It docs not extend to goods which are of the nature of plant or equipment used in the business.

<p>When Italy entered the war, all outstanding navicerts and export licences for Rumania were revoked.

<p>An Army officer or soldier or a woman in the military service of the Crown who wishes to become a parliamentary candidate is required first to obtain the permission of the Army Council through the normal channels.

No differentiation is made between officers and other ranks, and no application submitted in this way has been refused.

<p>In the case of men appointed to commissions from the ranks without being required to undergo further training in officer cadet training units, the upper age limits vary from 43 to 55 according to the branch of the Service No upper age limit has been prescribed for admission to officer cadet training units, but, other things being equal, preference is given to those under 30. In the case of those appointed to commissions from the Army Officers' Emergency Reserve, the upper age limit, unless the candidate has very special qualifications, is 55, and, except for technical corps where special qualifications are required, previous military service is required.

<p>I have been asked to reply to this Question. The standard of catering in shelters is less satisfactory than I should like it to be, partly owing to reductions in the supplies of meat, cheese and fruit available for shelter caterers, and partly to fluctuating numbers in the shelters making it necessary for caterers to restrict the amount of perishable foodstuffs for sale in order to avoid waste. It must, however, be remembered that regular shelterers bring from home the more nutritious part of their meal.

<p>May I remind my hon. Friend that the Animal Rationing Scheme was devised to ensure a fair distribution in the national interest of the limited supplies of feeding stuffs available? Sales of cereals before 1st February do not confer a right to issue of coupons as the scheme assumes that in cases such as those referred to by the hon. Member the farmer was able to obtain all his current requirements before that date under the arrangements then prevailing. In cases where sales before 1st February have left farmers without the necessary feeding resources the scheme provides that the Agricultural Executive Committee will, on appeal, arrange for the issue of the appropriate coupons where such action is justified. Coupons are being issued in such cases with the utmost expedition.</p>

<p>Before you call the first Amendment, Sir Dennis, may I put to you a point of Order? We are now carrying through an unusual procedure, but one the reason for which we fully understand. The Bill has been recommitted, and we are to consider the Amendments in the name of the Chancellor, and in the names of other hon. Members, not on the Report stage, but in Committee. The reason is that a number of very important questions were left in abeyance on the original Committee stage. I think it would be of value to the Committee if, before the Amendments are discussed <i>seriatim,</i> you would permit the Chancellor of the Exchequer to make a somewhat wide statement on the scope of the major changes he proposes in the Bill. Subject to what any other hon. Member may say, I feel certain that, if you can see your way to permit the right hon. Gentleman to do that, it will very much facilitate the understanding of the Committee and no doubt, in the end, shorten the proceedings on the Committee stage.</p>

<p>I appreciate what the right hon. Gentleman has said. A convenient method of enabling such a course to be taken is provided for in our procedure. The proper method to enable the right hon.

<p>I beg to move, "That the Chairman do report Progress, and ask leave to sit again."<br/>
I move this Motion in order that, in conformity with the wish expressed by the right hon. Member for East Edinburgh (Mr. Pethick-Lawrence) and other hon. Members, I may explain the principal changes in the Bill involved in the Amendments in my name on the Order Paper. There are, of course, a large number of Amendments on the Order Paper, some of them involving radical alterations, which show that we have made every effort to profit from the recent discussions in the Committee. Hon. Members will see that I have been able to adopt many of the suggestions that were made from all parts of the Committee. I should doubt if in connection with a Measure of this magnitude hon. Members have ever played such a considerable part in shaping and improving a Bill. There are some 150 Government Amendments on the Order Paper, the great bulk of them being designed to meet points that were made by the Committee in the course of the Debates. Some of these Amendments are of a minor character, some are more important, and some affect the scope of the Bill considerably.<br/>
I want, first, to refer to Clause 1, which has an important aspect in connection with the administration of the Measure. Hon. Members will remember that it deals, among other things, with the relationship between the Treasury and the Commission, which, of course, also involves the position and authority of Parliament. The Committee desired to secure, first, that there should be publication of any regulations or directions concerning these matters, secondly, that the directions should be general, and thirdly, that Parliament should have control over any such directions as might be given. Therefore, the Amendments which I shall move provide, first, that the directions under this Clause shall be made by way of regulation, secondly, that they shall be


of a general character, and, thirdly, that nothing In them shall be construed as authorising the Commission to exercise any or its functions in a manner inconsistent with the provisions of the Act, and &#x2014;by virtue of a new Clause to replace Clause 50 in the Bill&#x2014;that they shall be laid before Parliament so as to secure the necessary control which the Committee thought desirable.<br/>
The next matter to which 1 want to refer, which was the subject of considerable discussion in the Committee, is the position of claims under &#x00A3;5. I shall make new proposals dealing with the difficulties that may arise in connection with the provision that claims for payments under &#x00A3;5 shall not be admitted. I think there was general agreement that the justification for this limitation was that if there was a very large number of small claims, as one might perhaps expect and there was no limitation of this character, it would involve a general hold-up of the work of the Commission, and in any event a considerable dislocation in the assessment of claims. Accordingly, I considered the matter afresh in conjunction with my right hon. Friends, and I am now proposing, in the Amendments on the Order Paper which deal with this subject, certain Amendments designed to mitigate any hardships which may arise. I am suggesting to the Committee three or four alterations in that respect. Firstly, I am suggesting that a claimant may aggregate cost of works claims for repeated damage to the same property, whether a developed or an undeveloped hereditament. For instance, if the same house is damaged on three occasions to the extent of &#x00A3;2, &#x00A3;1 and &#x00A3;4 respectively, a total claim of &#x00A3;7 can be made.<br/>
I am also suggesting an Amendment by which a claimant will be enabled to aggregate cost of works claims in respect of more than one developed hereditament in the same housing authority's area. A landlord, for instance, may have a number of properties in one such area which have suffered minor damage; the expenditure on individual properties comes, in a number of cases, to less than &#x00A3;3 a house. In that case the landlord will be able to aggregate his expenditure. Take the case of a local authority which carries out first-aid repairs&#x2014;many of the houses, of

course, require only minor expenditure. Take an example which is quite frequent, say, that of 10s. per house. In that case the authority will be allowed to aggregate expenditure and present a total claim. I have had to confine the Amendment to particular housing areas, and that has had to be done. I do not think there will be any hardship. The arrangement is designed purely from the point of view of administration. I suggest that these Amendments will go a long way to meet the difficulty of the &#x00A3;5 limitation, especially when it is remembered that a very large proportion of the damage below &#x00A3;5 will be repaired by local authorities under their emergency powers; in which case, instead of the cost of repairs being charged to the individual, the local authorities will be reimbursed in bulk from the Exchequer. I am advised that the proportion of claims under &#x00A3;5 which are left uncovered by one or other of these arrangements will be very small indeed. There is another aspect of the matter which I will mention now. It may very well be that, after the war, when we are able to consider arrangements for the general replacement of temporary by permanent repairs, the Commission or the Government may be able to devise means by which they may be executed by some central agency, either the local authority or some other body, which will meet cases of small damage in a convenient and expeditious way. I hope the Committee will agree with me that this arrangement will avoid dislocation, and that the Amendment I have put on the Order Paper does, to a very large extent, meet the difficulties which my hon. Friends have raised in the earlier Debates on this Bill.<br/>
I would now like to say a word or two on another matter which was a subject of considerable discussion&#x2014;the question of value payments, particularly as compared with the assessment of the compensation to be made in respect of cost of works payments. My right hon. Friends, who were associated with me in connection with this Bill, and myself, did, of course, give careful consideration to this matter during the framing of this Bill. Quite recently we again examined the whole position, and I considered what was said on this subject in Committee. Criticism centred on the comparison between the amount of the value payment and the cost of works payment, and particularly on the fact that


value payments were to be made by reference to prices current in March, 1939. While the criticisms of the Clause put forward by the Government were such as 1 have indicated, the alterations proposed proved, in fact, impracticable and could not be sustained. The more one considers the matter the more one realises that the difficulty arises in endeavouring to say now what will be the position after the war. Many of my hon. Friends, in an endeavour to find a way out, have made suggestions by which there should be a certain percentage addition to the value payments. The fact remains that no one is in a position now to deal with the matter in that particular way. In other words, I suggest to the Committee that that matter must really be dealt with at the most appropriate time, and that is when the bulk of the value payments can be made.<br/>
I have, therefore, Tabled a number of important Amendments which provide that when the time comes for the payment of value payments in substantial volume the matter shall be considered by the War Damage Commission. The next Amendment provides that if they consider, in the light of their experience&#x2014;and, of course, no one will have better experience or greater knowledge than the Commission&#x2014;that the value payments are inadequate, they shall report to the Treasury. I have provided in another Amendment that the report shall be published. Every one will then be able to see the consideration that has been given by the War Damage Commission to the matter and their recommendation. It will not only be a matter of communicating with the Chancellor of the Exchequer. It will be for all plainly to see what has been done. There is also an Amendment providing for a further duty which, this time, will be on the Chancellor of the Exchequer. It will be his duty to consider the report and then I propose that the Treasury shall have power, in the light of the recommendations which may be made by the Commission, to increase the sums which would otherwise be payable under this Measure. I also propose to ensure that any order that the Treasury may make increasing the value payments under the provisions of this scheme, shall be laid before the House and shall be subject to an affirmative Resolution. In other words, the final

decision must rest with the House of Commons and the matter must explicitly come before the House before anything can be done.<br/>
I suggest to the Committee that by these provisions we ensure that this very important matter shall be considered at the right time. In the first instance, the whole matter will be considered by the body which must have the best knowledge of all the facts; secondly their report is to be made subject to consideration by the responsible Minister, and, finally, I commend this proposal to the Committee on the ground that the whole matter will ultimately be decided by the House itself. I say again, having given this question a great deal of care and attention and knowing the anxiety which has been expressed about it that the more I consider it, the more confident I am that we are not in a position to-day to determine this matter and I believe the new proposals will ensure the best and fairest way of arriving at a just conclusion.<br/>
I would call attention to another important matter which deals with a different category of beneficiaries. That is the arrangement for advances under Clause 9 (4). In the first place, the Committee will appreciate the fact that these advance payments to people who are able to satisfy the Commission of the justice of their case will, of necessity, be payments on account of final compensation. We have always to bear in mind that that final compensation may be required for the rebuilding or repair of property and we must never forget, but always keep in front of us, the interests of the persons themselves. Therefore we consider&#x2014;and I do not think there is any criticism of this&#x2014;that these advances should be restricted to cases of necessity and should be limited in amount. Otherwise, advances on account of final compensation might be made to such an extent that when the time came for the repair or reconstruction of the property, all that the person concerned was entitled to would be gone. Thus not only would the benefits of the Measure not come to him, but, from the national point of view, the whole object of the Measure to a large extent would be defeated. Therefore, as I say, these payments must be limited to cases of necessity and also limited in amount.<br/>
1 have, however, considered a suggestion which was made from all parts of the Committee that the original limit of &#x00A3;500 as the measure of advance was on the low side, especially in the case of a business. I shall, therefore, move an Amendment to raise the maximum amount of such advances to &#x00A3;800. A person who is in need both of a new home for his family and of new premises for his business will, if my Amendment receives approval, be able to secure advances up to the maximum of &#x00A3;800 under each of those heads. I think that easement of the position will, at the same time, preserve the national interest and be of considerable assistance to large numbers of people. An advance of this character will enable people in many cases, either to rent a new house or new business premises or in some cases to purchase. I hope the Committee will think that I have met them in that respect while, at the same time, preserving the general tenor of the Measure, namely, that compensation should, as far as possible, be used not only in the interests of the individuals but in the national interest.<br/>
I pass to another important Clause which was also subject to considerable discussion in Committee, namely, Clause 20, which deals with the contributions of mortgagees in certain cases. I think there were two main criticisms of the original Clause, first, that the methods proposed to determine the respective liabilities of mortgagor and mortgagee were not flexible enough to get a fair apportionment between the parties, and second that the Clause, as then drafted, would create great difficulties in that it left the mortgagee and mortgagor to find out for themselves the value of the mortgaged property&#x2014;the figure which would determine their respective liabilities for contribution, and therefore very important. It was also urged that the Clause should be widened by increasing the limit on both residential and agricultural contributory properties. In the light of these constructive criticisms we have accordingly reframed the Clause. Under the Amendments which appear on the Paper in my name, the area will be widened in which contribution by mortgagees will be made and the amount of some of those contributions will be increased. It is also proposed that the scope of cases in which the mortgagee

will contribute should be widened by increasing to &#x00A3;150 and &#x00A3;500 the figures of annual values for non-agricultural and agricultural properties respectively. These new figures, of course, compare with the original figures of &#x00A3;100 and &#x00A3;250; therefore I have again made a considerable extension in that matter.<br/>
Perhaps more important still is the new scale which I am now proposing so far as the contribution of mortgagees is concerned. These contributions will now begin where the interest of the mortgagee is more than 33&#x2153; per cent, instead of where the interest is more than 50 per cent., and it is proposed that between 33&#x2153; and 50 per cent, the mortgagee will contribute a sixth, that between 50 and 66&#x2154; per cent, he will contribute a third, between 66&#x2154; and 75 per cent, he will contribute a half and above 75 per cent., if he has that interest in the property, he will contribute two-thirds. That is a very considerable alteration on the original proposal. There will also be a new provision applicable to special conditions existing in Scotland to provide for contributions by mortgagees in the case of tenement properties comprising small dwellings of a rateable value not exceeding &#x00A3;35, which will be explained by the Lord Advocate when he deals with the Scottish Application Clause.<br/>
I have also, at the suggestion of many hon. Friends, who have been most helpful, remodelled the valuation provisions required for the purpose of ascertaining the mortgagee's contribution. The Clause in its original form involved the valuation of each property as at 31st March, 1939, in order to establish the relationship between that valuation and the amount of the mortgage. In the light of the discussions on the Clause it is now proposed to substitute the purchase price for the March, 1939, value except that in case of properties acquired before 1st January, 1932, the value is to be taken instead of the purchase price in cases where the value is less than four-fifths of the purchase price. This is necessary in order to deal with the fact, that in the case of many properties more than nine or ten years old it is only to be expected that there will be a substantial divergence between value and purchase price and to take the purchase price in such cases would not only be artificial but would be unfair to the mortgagor.<br/>
There is one further alteration that I should mention. In the course of the discussion it was suggested that there ought to be some simple method enabling the value of residential property to be ascertained without recourse to the courts, and, to meet that suggestion, it is now proposed that, in the event of a dispute, and at the request of the parties concerned, the Inland Revenue, who, of course, have no interest at stake in the matter, may determine the value for parties who are not able to agree, and in that event their decision shall be taken as final.</p>

<p>Yes. If they cannot agree, there is no recourse but to go to the Courts, but I should think most people would be reasonable as this independent valuation is available and it would be cheaper.<br/>
The last matter I want to refer to is one which also received a good deal of attention in Committee and is of considerable public importance&#x2014;that is, the private chattels scheme. The President of the Board of Trade and I have given much attention and consideration to the criticisms and suggestions made in the House and outside concerning this very vital matter to so many people. All the criticisms and suggestions which have been made up to the present, though various people had various ideas how it should be done, were directed to securing that such a scheme for the insurance of chattels should give the widest protection possible and that the charges should be such, whether compulsory or voluntary, as really to be within the financial capacity of the persons concerned. It was strongly urged on the Government that we should make every effort so that such a scheme should be on broad and generous lines, covering the largest amount of effects, and broadly comparable with the cover which has already been given in respect of personal injuries and which we are now about to give in respect of property under this Bill. In other words, the great desire of the House was to see whether we could not bring the scheme up to what we are in fact doing in relation to personal injuries, and what we are doing; as far as property is concerned in the first part of the Bill. Compulsion was not urged upon the

Government for compulsion's sake but because many of my hon. Friends, although others disagree with them, thought that the widest and cheapest scheme could be secured if compulsion was adopted. That is really what animated them and others who had their own suggestions to make.</p>

<p>I think the right hon. Gentleman ought not to leave out that a further consideration was that all who have property of that kind should make some contribution.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1941-02-25a.394.1" hansard_membership_id="7445" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/27643" speakername="Sir K. Wood" colnum="394" time="">
<p>And should make it with a view to getting the premium as low as possible. If that was not secured, there would be no object in levying any contribution of that kind.<br/>
There is already provision by way of free grants in respect of essential furniture and clothing to those whose incomes fall below &#x00A3;400 if married or &#x00A3;250 if single. That is the scheme which is now established, and I do not think anyone would suggest that we should go back upon such a provision, nor do I think it could be suggested that compulsion could be applied as a practical measure to the insurance of the remainder of the chattels of those people. That would be too difficult altogether. People within those income limits are already getting essential furniture and clothing free, and it would be practically impossible from an administrative point of view to contemplate imposing insurance upon that large section of the community as regards the remainder of their chattels.<br/>
With that consideration in mind it is estimated that the total value of the furniture owned by persons not falling within the free grants limit may be something between &#x00A3;600,000,000 and &#x00A3;700,000,000, but even that figure must be reduced as it is plain that compulsion should not be applied to such things as costly furniture and antiques. Therefore, when you exclude such, items and measure the scope of the field you come down to something of the order of &#x00A3;400,000,000 or &#x00A3;500,000,000 worth of furniture in respect of which any compulsory scheme could operate. When you have arrived at that conclusion, and take as premium a figure which has been suggested in this House but which would not be satisfactory to everybody, a


premium of &#x00A3;1 per cent, charged by way of compulsory levy, the revenue which I should receive as Chancellor of the Exchequer might be put at between &#x00A3;4,000,000 and &#x00A3;5,000,000 a year. But, of course, there would have to be an upward limit as regards compulsion, and on such an assumption the yield would be further reduced, and I am advised that, broadly speaking, the amount which I receive would by that time have come down to between &#x00A3;3,000,000 and &#x00A3;4,000,000.<br/>
I will not detain the Committee with estimates of what the cost of such a scheme would be, because we all have our own ideas about it, but that &#x00A3;3,000,000 or &#x00A3;4,000,000 must obviously be reduced again by the considerable charges there would be for collection and for the strict enforcement of premium payments. I will content myself by making this further observation, that it is obvious that so small a yield must fall below the liabilities of the scheme. If we were able to do anything at all in connection with such a proposal the rates of premium would have to be increased, and we know that in fact they could not be increased to what would be anything like a proper figure. Therefore, I am bound to come to the conclusion, and all my friends agree with me, that with such a small yield from the premiums the bulk of the money would have to come from the general taxpayers. That is quite obvious to anyone who gives the problem any examination.<br/>
With all those considerations in mind my right hon. Friend the President of the Board of Trade and I have come to the conclusion that it is in the general interest that a scheme should be devised which should be simple in character and follow the lines of the Personal Injuries scheme, that such a scheme should give free cover and protection up to a certain sum to all owners of chattels irrespective of income, and that beyond that amount it should be made possible for voluntary insurance to be effected up to a reasonable amount. This, of course, is a very important departure. We propose that every householder in the country should receive free compensation up to &#x00A3;200, together with an additional &#x00A3;100 for his wife and an additional &#x00A3;25 for every child under 16. and for persons who do not come within those categories&#x2014;like lodgers and

persons living in hotels&#x2014;there shall be free compensation up to &#x00A3;50. In addition to the free grants it is proposed that people should be able to insure at the following rates: Up to &#x00A3;2,000, &#x00A3;1 per cent.; from &#x00A3;2,000 to &#x00A3;3,000, 30s. per cent.; from &#x00A3;3,000 to &#x00A3;10,000&#x2014;I took the highest limit put on the Order Paper by hon. Members&#x2014;&#x00A3;2 per cent. The only restriction I would make would be the obvious one that the amount of cover should be limited in respect of such things as jewellery, antiques and specially valuable articles.</p>

<p>Yes, we shall make provision by which they can be included. I have given the outlines of the scheme to the Committee. The grants scheme will, of course, under the provisions of the Bill, be subject to Regulations to be made under Clause 60 and the whole thing therefore will in fact be laid before Parliament. I suggest, for reasons which I will give in a minute, that the scheme will bring much relief and assurance to the people of this country. It can be said that the contents of a house are of as much moment as is the house itself. In any event, the protection which the State is generally affording in many directions to our citizens will not be regarded as complete and adequate unless we make due and ample provision in this direction.<br/>
I will give two or three examples of what will follow as a result of this scheme. A husband and wife with two children will receive free protection for their furniture and clothing, up to &#x00A3;350. Further, the existence of the free grants means that the net burden of the voluntary insurance is much reduced. For instance, a married man will be able to cover his chattels up to &#x00A3;600 in effect at 10s. per cent, or &#x00A3;3; or, if he wanted to insure his furniture, valued at &#x00A3;900, he could do so at 13s. 4d. per cent, or &#x00A3;6. That is a tremendous consideration to a number of people who are in the category which is so often neglected by the State. Everybody can make his own judgment on the matter, but, from the figures that have been provided, it can be said that we shall be covering by the free grants the majority of the householders in the country. Of


the rest, all but a very small proportion will be able to claim lull cover for what, 1 think, in the circumstances of the time, we may well call the modest premium otf&#x00A3;1 per cent.<br/>
Further particulars of the scheme will appear in our draft Regulations. I suggest that the proposals I am outlining show that we have responded to the suggestions which were made in Committee on the original Bill. I have endeavoured to bring forward a scheme which I hope and believe will receive the support of the whole country. I am reminded that the essential furniture part of the original scheme, by which we gave free protection for that and for essential clothing, disappears. Persons in those categories will receive cover for their furniture, irrespective of whether the furniture is essential or not. We will now cover what I would describe as staple furniture. There was a good deal of criticism of how the definition of essential furniture was to be arrived at The very important major alterations in the Bill will, I hope, show the Committee that I have been prepared to give consideration to all points that were put forward. I hope that the new proposals will commend themselves to the Committee</p>

Gentleman the Chancellor to move all Amendments of that kind, but merely put the Amendments to the Committee and now and again the Committee may possibly assent to my putting the Amendments in blocks. I would warn hon. Members that, if that procedure is followed, they should watch their papers very carefully in order to interrupt me if they want to raise a question on any particular Amendment.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 3, line 46, at the end, to insert "engineer."<br/>
I must apologise for the Amendment being in manuscript form, but there was a slight misunderstanding between those who are interested. I think, however, that the Amendment will meet with the general acceptance of the Committee. It is simply to insert the word '' engineer '' at the end of line 46. I think it will be admitted that engineers must invariably be employed in constructional work, and hitherto, as the Clause stands, there is no mention whatsoever of the word "engineer." It has been suggested that one might qualify the word "engineer" by "structural" or "civil" or something of the sort, but we thought it might be a limiting quantity, so that the word "engineer" only has been placed before the Committee.</p>

In the previous Committee stage it was suggested that the proviso to Subsection (5) of the Clause was too widely drawn. We are now substituting a new

proviso which makes it clear that the normal principles of valuation will be departed from only when the property in question, by reason of not normally being subject to sale in the open market, cannot be dealt with under the normal principles.</p>

This Amendment meets another point raised by the hon. Member for North Camberwell (Mr. Ammon) and provides that there may be an appeal on the question of value under Clause 5 (1, <i>a</i>).

We are making an exceptionally favourable cost-of-works payment, because we believe it to be in the national interest that the works should be carried out, but now there will be no reason why a person should not wait 10 or 20 years&#x2014; I agree that he is not likely to do so&#x2014; before carrying out the repairs. Is it proposed to put anything into the Bill in place of this Sub-section; or could a person, hypothetically, come along 10 years later, and get the cost-of-works payment?</p>

<p>I agree with the hon. Member's point, but I think this is a matter which could be appropriately dealt with by the procedure which will govern the Commission's regulations. We do not propose to put anything into the Bill in substitution for this Sub-section: it is difficult to think of any substitute which would not go just as far as the Sub-section does; but I have the point in mind, and it will be kept in view when the Regulations are drawn up.</p>

<q>(5) Notwithstanding any provision in this Section the Commission is hereby empowered to ensure that in no case will the owner of the property receive no share of the value payment and it shall be within the discretion of the Commission to pay such proportion of the value payment to the owner as may seem to them fair and equitable having regard to all the circumstances.</q>
Millions of owner-occupiers are very much concerned about the effect of this Bill on their interests in the houses in which they live. These houses have been built by them, but the finance has been obtained elsewhere. There is great apprehension that they will receive no share of the value payment, and that the whole of

the payment will go to those who have, in the first instance, provided the finance for the erection of these houses. I submit that something should be done to remove that fear. This Bill is brought forward to deal with a very special evil, arising at a very special time, namely, damage by enemy action. It is right that special provision should be made against that contingency. I submit that the Committee ought to take the step proposed in this Amendment, and to give some safeguard to the owner-occupier in connection with the value payment. There is suggested in this Amendment a double power. The first part of the Amendment empowers the Commission to ensure that in no case will the owner of the property receive no share of the value payment. The second part of the Amendment gives a discretionary power to the Commission to decide what proportion of the value payment shall be made to the owner, that discretionary power to be exercised in the ordinary way, so as to ensure that what is done will be fair and equitable having regard to all the circumstances. I am very anxious that whoever speaks on behalf of the Chancellor of the Exchequer in replying to this Amendment will give an assurance that the discretionary power that is sought in the Amendment shall be made available to the Commission in dealing with this matter.</p>

<p>My hon. and learned Friend has, of course, in mind the owner-occupier, and 1 think everybody agrees that the owner-occupier buying his house by instalments or mortgage in the manner with which we are very familiar in the case of the building society is one of those cases which merits further consideration in regard to the application of this Bill. That is one of the reasons why the building society type of mortgagee has been made a contributory to the annual payments, which from the point of view of the mortgagee might have been regarded as something with which he was not concerned. I think that what has been done in favour of mortgagors against mortgagees in this type of case is relevant in considering this Amendment.<br/>
Before coming to the actual principle which we discussed in Committee, I would like to point out that an Amendment of this kind would really be unworkable. For one thing, the share would be very


small, and, to the mortgagor, would be quite useless. I cannot see on what fair and equitable principles the Commission could decide as to what proportion was to go to them. The important position surely, is that in the case that is being considered the mortgagor owes a certain sum to the mortgagee. If the full payment will extinguish that debt and leave something over, or to the extent to which it extinguishes the debt, it is directlly contributing to the risks of the mortgagor and enables him to get rid of liability or enter into negotiations with some building society for providing him with reconstruction, or alternative accommodation. I have great difficulty in seeing how this Amendment could be worked or how it would really advance the interests of the mortgagor if you were to give him the &#x00A3;100. He would still remain owing &#x00A3;100 to the mortgagee, if the house was gone. I agree that we have to consider the building-society case with care and sympathy, but I cannot think that the principle embodied in this Amendment is the proper one, nor do I think that it would be workable.</p>

This proviso has to deal with the points raised by the hon. Member for South Croydon (Sir H. Williams), who told us of the difficulties which were bound to arise under the Bill as it then stood in regard to advertisement hoardings and the like. We have had an opportunity since then of discussing the matter very fully at his suggestion, or by arrangement with him, with representatives of the advertising industry who explained to us some of the points they had in mind. The Amendment which I move is designed to exclude from contribution any cases where the contributory property is an advertising station and nothing else. For example, the hoarding on a vacant building site. That really does meet precisely the point that my hon. Friend made, but he added another suggestion however that the hoardings themselves should be made insurable under the business scheme since otherwise they would fall between two stools. We pro-


pose to deal with that by amending the definition of "land" in Clause 51, to exclude hoardings from Part I of the Bill, so that as a result of their being definitely excluded from Part I they will fall under Part II which will meet the second part of his desire.</p>

<p>I am very grateful to the Financial Secretary for what he has said and for the efforts that have been "made to meet what is obviously a very difficult problem, but I am sorry to have to say that apparently the problem is not quite met. The billposters, who had had long discussions with the Inland Revenue, came to see me yesterday and explained that about 70 per cent, of the stations are not on hoardings constructed for the purpose but on buildings which exist for other purposes. The result is that the building that has hoardings on it has an increased Schedule A valuation attached to it, but there is no physical addition to the value. Apparently in 70 per cent. of the cases these people would be paying 2s. in the &#x00A3; on that part of Schedule A valuation which arises out of the use of the structure for billposting, and in the event of demolition there could be no compensation at all because what would have gone, would be merely the surface. The physical structure belongs to the owner of the property.<br/>
While, as I have said, I am grateful to the Chancellor of the Exchequer for what has been done, the issue is not yet adequately met, and the effect may be adverse. The industry is very much depressed at the moment owing to shortage of paper. The landlord in the first place would be called upon to make payment, and he could get out of it only by giving notice of the termination of the agreement with the billposter, and I believe that the effect would be that a large number of these agreements would be terminated. Therefore, the Chancellor will collect a great deal less income, and on the grounds of revenue, and not merely to meet the regard of what may be called the selfish interest of this industry, I ask that this matter shall be further looked into, so that when the Bill goes to another place an Amendment may be made to spread it a little wider.<br/>
I realise that there would be certain administrative difficulties, because it means splitting the Schedule A valuation, but that should not be too difficult, because I am told that bill-posting sites are rated separately. Therefore, in most cases there is a known value, and further valuation arising from the use of a bill-posting station could, in fact, be dealt with. I believe the matter could be put right by the insertion in line 5, after "erection," of "or use." I understand that if an Amendment of this kind was moved in another place, it would not raise a question of Privilege, because it does not involve a charge, but even if it did, no doubt Privilege could be waived. Although the Chancellor's intentions are good, they leave 70 per cent. of the problem unsolved, so I am told, and therefore on account of the complex situation I ask that the matter should be looked at again.</p>

<p>I am afraid I cannot say on behalf of my right hon. Friend that we can go any further. We have gone a long way to meet this point, and although I appreciate my hon. Friend's anxiety with regard to the revenue, I am sure that he appreciates that my right hon. Friend's anxiety is even greater. We have gone as far as we reasonably can to exclude contributions where the properties in question are advertising stations and nothing else. If you went further you would get into difficulties in trying to divide up how much was or was not due to advertising and there would be further difficulties in regard to corner sites which' people might say could be potential advertising sites. I hope my hon. Friend will leave the matter where it is.</p>

<p>I put. this point forward very reasonably, and the answer does not meet my complaint. An attempt to solve a legitimate problem which leaves 70 per cent. of the problem untouched is no attempt at all. In rating advertisements their separate value is established. The facts are capable of ascertainment, and the administrative problem is quite easy. It seems to me that it is on purely legalistic grounds that this matter is being resisted, and I ask that it should be further reconsidered.</p>

This Amendment and the following Amendment and five Amendments on Clause 16 all deal with the same point raised in Committee, which was this: It was suggested that the sixpenny rate should be extended to waste land used for sporting purposes, commercial fisheries and so on. It was pointed out that if a bomb falls in the sea, the cost of putting the sea back in the condition in which it was before the bomb fell is negligible, and the same thing applies to the Cairngorms. The Amendments are a little complicated, but I hope they meet the points raised and cover the cases which were put forward. I think the Committee will agree that they are obviously fair. We have made provision that in connection with a sporting estate a dwelling-house or shooting lodge will pay the 2s. rate, but so far as land or water and other accessories, covered by these Amendments, are concerned, it seems reasonable that they should pay the sixpenny rate.</p>

This Amendment covers the point raised by my hon. and gallant Friend the Mem-

ber for Newbury (Brigadier-General Brown) with regard to the complications of annuities under the Tithe Act. It is a very technical point, but in the case of compulsory redemption of annuities under the Act of 1936 the interest portion of the annuity is allowable as deduction in arriving at the Schedule A assessment. On the other hand, the payer of an annuity under the Act of 1918 gets relief in another way&#x2014;by deduction of tax on the interest portion and not by an allowance of the interest in arriving at the Schedule A assessment. It is clear that these two different methods of relief should be dealt with in the same sort of way for these purposes. My hon. and gallant Friend pointed out that the second of these methods is too high, and so the present Amendment corrects that inequality by providing for an allowance of the interest portion. It is only a small and technical point, but it is worth making in the interests of justice.</p>

<p>I should be obliged if the Chancellor of the Exchequer would elucidate one point concerning arbitration or valuation. The right hon. Gentleman will appreciate that a fair number of disputes may arise between borrowers and building societies. Whereas two individuals, in equal circumstances, would probably see the advantage of avoiding any legal costs and avail themselves of the arbitration procedure, it might be that, although the majority of building societies would adopt a reasonable attitude in such matters, some societies might adopt an arbitrary attitude or rule concerning a certain category of cases. As the majority of borrowers from building societies are people of small means, who would not venture to assert their rights in the courts, the building societies would have the advantage of going to the courts, and the mortgagors would be at a disadvantage. Can the Chancellor indicate whether, in a matter of this sort, the building societies will be expected to take a reasonable view? I know that one cannot take away from them their rights within the law, but sometimes, in matters of taxation and so on, the Chancellor gets a general understanding that a benefit will be passed on to the consumers or users. Therefore, I ask


whether we may have a general assurance that the building socieies will treat these provisions in the spirit which the Committee intends.</p>

<p>The Committee will remember that in my statement I said that if the parties agreed, there was a certain procedure that could be adopted, but that if they did not agree, the ordinary rights of going to the courts would apply. I feel sure hon. Members will agree with me when I say that we could not deprive the subject of the right of going to the courts in such circumstances. In reply to the hon. Member for East Ham, South (Mr. Barnes), I have every reason to think that the building societies will operate these provisions in the spirit in which I am sure the Committee desires them to do so. I have had many conferences with the building societies concerning this Bill, and I can say that they have endeavoured, while having regard to their own proper interests, to consider my proposals from the point of view of the national interest. If a case arose in which I thought they were not carrying out the intention of the Measure, I would not hesitate to speak to them about it, but I have not the slightest reason to think that at any rate the great majority of the building societies, who have only the public interest to serve, will not have regard to the wishes of the Committee. If occasion arose, I would undoubtedly point that out to them, but I hardly think it will be necessary.</p>

<p>In relation to this Amendment and the Amendment in page 17, line 47, I have received a request which really amounts to asking that these two Amendments should be dealt with in a different form so as in effect to be new Amendments. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has given his general explanation, and I think the Committee understands and approves what is meant; but it would have been a little unfortunate, if this matter were going 'to be debated, that these new Amendments should not have been put on the Order Paper. I think it is necessary in present circumstances that I should explain the point exactly to the Committee so that they may be aware of the proposed Amendments. In page 17, line 20, there will be an Amendment simply to leave out Sub-section (4) and not to insert any words. When we reach the Amendment in page 17, line 47, there is on the Paper an Amendment to add at the end a long passage&#x2014;that will now be to add that passage with the insertion therein of the words which are not being moved in on this Amendment in line 20, but which it is now intended shall be brought in as part of the words to be moved in on the Amendment to line 47.</p>

I move this Amendment in order to extract a statement from the Chancellor. Scientific bodies are very jealous of their rights, and they feel that they cannot possibly accept all that is implied by the conditions referred to in this Clause in connection with the decisions of tribunals of whose constitution they have no knowledge. I have been asked by some of these societies to put the following points to the Chancellor. Does it mean that the tribunals will decide what shall be the site of a school, and that they can alter the State grants to a school? Will they have any authority in altering places, the curriculum and the appointment of staff? We tried, at an earlier stage, to obtain an exemption from contributions, but I understand that that is impossible. Another point I wish to put to the Chancellor is that if any of these bodies are dissatisfied with the conditions imposed upon them by the tribunals, is it possible for them to have retrospective payments?</p>

<p>We did not have an opportunity to look at this Amendment until this morning. We understood that it sought to eliminate from the charity Clause charities for the advancement of science whereas charities for the advancement of education, learning and research are to be retained. I am not very clear what my hon. Friend has in mind. I would say at once, however, that so far as I am concerned I would not ask the Committee to accept this Amendment. I think possibly my hon. Friend is more concerned to obtain an assurance than to suggest that it would be fair or right for the charities concerned to be treated first under the provisions of this Clause and then to be able to say we do not like this very


much so may we start all over again under the earlier provisions of the Bill. I cannot contemplate procedure of that kind, but I think my hon. Friend can be assured that these authorities will be treated with fairness and consideration. There will be consultations between the Commission and those concerned, and I do not think he need have any apprehension about the matter. In practice I do not anticipate that there will be difficulties such as my hon. Friend represents. I hope with that explanation he will not press the Amendment further.</p>

shall not be treated for the purposes of this Section as held for charitable purposes.</q>
This Amendment again meets a suggestion put by hon. Friends opposite and behind me, and it excludes from the pro-

visions of the Clause charity land held by rating authorities, and Government Departments for purposes for which public moneys may be applied, or by other persons for purposes the expense of which is defrayed out of rates or public moneys. Charity lands in these categories will accordingly pay full contribution and get the ordinary rights of compensation under Part I of the Bill. Examples of the three categories are respectively local authorities' relief administrations and schools; Unemployment Assistance; and approved schools managed by voluntary bodies, but financed half by local authorities and half by the State. Of course, the justification of this exceptional treatment is that the charities in this position are only charities by accident. They are in effect public social services, and their essential nature is proved by the fact that their expenditure is met out of rates and taxes. For that reason I felt able to meet my hon.

These words appeared on the Order Paper as a Government Amendment. It was, however, pointed out that they would take out of contribution a large block of offices in which the undertakers leased one set of rooms. Owing to shortness of time an alternative Amendment to insert "mainly or exclusively" in line 5 was moved in manuscript, but apparently the original Amendment was moved as well.</p>

There is a tremendous list of Amendments to this Clause which all really relate to the same point. Public utility undertakings are dealt with under a separate scheme and have little to do with this Bill. The reason for this provision as regards contributors is that public utility undertakings are normally rated not on Schedule A but on the basis of their profits. Since the decision was taken with regard to public utility undertakings it has been brought to our notice that there are some other forms of property which are also rated in that way and do not come suitably under the provisions for contribution in the earlier part of the Bill. The most notable cases are undertakings of mining and quarrying and there also was one of broadcast relay companies. They have to be brought in, and the gist of these Amendments is to bring them, into this Clause. There are special circumstances which may arise when we draw up a scheme about the form and the amount of contributions that mines and quarries make, and notably underground minerals may require special treatment. That will come forward later on. I hope that by all these Amendments we shall clear up the difficulty which we foresaw may arise. There is really nothing further of great importance in them.</p>

<p>I have tried to read all these Amendments, and as far as I can make out they improve the Clause very much, but may I repeat a request which I have already made in regard to public utility undertakings? Including the

many municipal enterprises, they represent a capital of about &#x00A3;3,000,000,000. They all know that there is to be another Bill dealing with them, but, in the meantime, they have to make financial provision for contributions in respect of a period some part of which has already passed. That is causing considerable difficulty because they do not know what their obligations will be. They want to know what reserves they will have to provide in anticipation of the Bill. I wonder whether the Chancellor of the Exchequer is yet in a position to give some indication, at least, of what the obligations will be. It is a matter which affects most municipalities in this country and a very large number of companies.</p>

<p>I had put down an Amendment to include toll bridges, but it was not called, and I should like to take this opportunity of asking whether they come within the category specified by the Financial Secretary to the Treasury.

<p>I wrote to my hon. Friend on this subject yesterday, but perhaps he did not get my letter in time. I do not think he is quite right in saying that all toll bridges do not pay rates and taxes. There are some of one sort and some of another. Also, I am not sure what are his fears on this subject. If his fear is that because they do not pay rates and taxes and, therefore, are not contributory properties under the definition of those which have to pay contribution, they will not get compensation if they are damaged, he need not have that fear. Compensation does not de-

pend upon whether or not you are a contributory person. You get compensation whether you are or not. It would be very nice of those concerned to want to be contributors, but I should think that most people who will get the benefits without contributing will prefer not to contribute. In any case, the compensation is there, whether they are technically contributory undertakings under the Bill or not, and I am prepared to say, on behalf of my right hon. Friend, that in the further legislation required in regard to these public utility undertakings, it may be found necessary to say something specific about tolls. We shall then have an opportunity of discussing the matter, but at the moment they do get the benefits of the Bill in the matter of compensation.</p>

I do not know whether the Chancellor of the Exchequer takes the view that an Amendment already accepted covers this point, but it would be very satisfactory if it could be made quite clear that there is an obligation on the requisitioning authority to inform the owner of damage done. It is easy to see that there may be cases where the owner has, in consequence of the war, removed to a considerable distance. He will have no means of knowing about the damage, and his position will be materially prejudiced if there is not an obligation on the requisitioning authority such as is indicated in the Amendment.</p>

<p>The same point was raised earlier by my hon. Friend the Member for Lincoln (Mr. Liddall) who was satisfied with the assurance then given, so I was rather perturbed when I saw that the question was being raised again. The short point is that, of course, it is everybody's interest that the damnified person should be notified as soon as possible if anything has happened to his property, and that is the administrative practice now. The Office of Works make every effort to get into touch with everybody concerned, and as recently as last November the War Office sent out special instructions to the same end. Generally speaking we all want to let people know

if their requisitioned property is damaged. No doubt the Committee and the hon. Gentleman will accept our assurances on that point. It is rather different, however, to put it as an obligation in the Bill. You might get the complication that this would be an obligation against the Crown.<br/>
There is the further point that in certain circumstances&#x2014;I do not say that it has yet occurred&#x2014; damage might be done to property which is under requisition when it would be in the public interest that nobody should know that the damage had been done. It would have to be repaired quickly and secretly, but if there were an obligation on someone to go running round to find out to whom he should notify the damage, it would not be long before it got out that there had been damage. I hope the Committee will rest content with the Government's assurance as to our intention, but we cannot accept an obligation to do it in all cases. We are at war, and it might sometimes be against the public interest, upon security grounds, to do it.</p>

This Amendment concerns an important matter. It deals with cases where interest in land, or in the proceeds of land, which has suffered war damage, passes, under a will made before the war


damage occurs. If the interest left to a person by the will is a freehold or a tenancy that goes on, and if the property is so badly damaged before the testator's death that a value payment is made in respect of it, the person to whom it is left will suffer the loss of taking a badly damaged property and the persons to whom the residue of the testator's property is left will suffer nothing. It is, therefore, right that the value payment should go to the former. If the interest left is a tenancy which the testator disclaims after the damage, the person to whom it is left would, apart from this Amendment, take nothing. The Amendment assumes that the testator would intend the beneficiary to take something and in effect substitutes the value payment for the destroyed interest. This will prevent the testator's intention being defeated by inadvertence. If the testator adverts to the matter and desires to revoke the gift in the altered circumstances, the Amendment leaves it open to him to do so by altering his will. No provision of this nature is needed for cost of works payments or for value payments, etc., for land which sustains war damage before a will in respect of it is made. In the former case, the person named in the will will take the property and any expense that he incurs in repair will be made good to him. In the latter, the testator has the opportunity of making express arrangements as to the disposal of the payment.<br/>
I hope the Committee will accept the Amendment as reasonable, in the circumstances in which we are faced.</p>

<q>( ) Where a hereditament sustains war damage at a time when an interest therein is the subject of a contract of sale or of a notice to treat served under an enactment authorising the compulsory acquisition thereof, any value payment in respect of the damage, or share of such a payment, or payment under Section eleven of this Act, payable to the vendor in respect of that interest, shall, unless the contract is rescinded or the notice ceases to have effect, be held by him upon trust for the purchaser:</q>
<q>Provided that any lien upon that interest to which the vendor is entitled by virtue of the contract shall extend to that payment or share.</q>

This Amendment deals with the case of property which sustains damage at a time when it is the subject of a contract of sale or a notice to treat, under compulsory acquisition procedure, and a value payment or a payment under Clause 11, in respect of a tenancy in a property of exceptional rate value, falls to be made. Under a contract of sale the property sold belongs in equity to the purchaser, and is at his risk, from the date of the contract. The vendor will be entitled to the purchase money, notwithstanding the destruction of the property, and his only substantial interest in it after the contract is made is that he is entitled to a lien on it to secure the payment of the purchase money. In these circumstances, justice requires that the purchaser should have the benefit of any value payment or payment under Clause 11, except that the vendor should have a lien on it until the purchase money is paid. Probably the general law would bring this about if the Amendment were not made, but it is desirable that the rights of the parties should be made clear. The legal position is in substance the same when a notice to treat for a compulsory acquisition is served as it is when a contract for sale is made, and it is therefore treated in the same way under the Amendment. The general law would conduce to that result, but it is desirable that it should be clearly stated in the Bill.</p>

This Amendment arose out of a point put by my Noble Friend the Member for Horsham (Earl Winterton). He was not quite sure whether standing timber owned by a landlord would be covered.

<p>I wish to raise one point on this Clause. My right hon. Friend has met the Committee to the extent that he has provided that the insurance companies will collect premiums and those premiums will be handed over by the insurance companies to the Board of Trade or to other Government Departments. He made a strong point, however, of the fact that he did not consider the machinery which the insurance companies have, in the ordinary mode of conducting their business, for assessing the value of damage sustained would be acceptable for the purpose of assessing the damage which might be sustained. It is regrettable that while my right hon. Friend was able to meet the Committee to the extent of premiums being collected by the insurance companies, he should state that the claims cannot be settled by the same machinery. If the insurance companies could also effect the settlement of the


claims, it would prevent my right hon. Friend from having occasion to build up a very large comprehensive organisation for the purpose of effecting those settlements. On the basis of economy, I would ask my right hon. Friend to consider &#x2014;</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 54, line 18, to leave out "direct."<br/>
The object of this is to see that damage which is done subsequent to the actual bomb-dropping shall be taken into consideration. This would include damage by weather, and so on. I mentioned this point at an earlier stage, and I was told by my right hon. Friend that he would look into it. If he says that such damage will be included, I shall be satisfied; but if not, I shall proceed with the Amendment.</p>

<p>I think it better to leave in the word "direct." I can assure my hon. Friend that it will allow, what is our intention, that compensation for damage which is not directly due to the bombing itself, but which unavoidably follows, will, in fact, be included. If one took out the word "direct," and particularly if one also inserted the proviso in my hon. Friend's Amendment which contemplates payment being made for indirect damage, I think we should get into an area which it is not our intention to enter. For example, assume that a bomb hit a train on which the normal

night watchman of a building some distance away was injured. It might be by ill-fortune that, through his not getting to his destination, there might be a severe fire, which, if he had been there, might have been arrested in the early stages, with little or no damage. Obviously, we cannot go into indirect consequences of this kind, but I can give my hon. Friend the assurance that "direct" does enable to be included the class of damage which I think he has in mind, namely, damage due to weather, or to water in putting out a fire, or to another cause which operates to cause damage and more or less follows as an inevitable consequence of the damage done by the bomb. Therefore, we had much better stick to the wording, because I think it may tend to clarify and strengthen the Bill, and the presence of the word "direct" indicates to those who read the Bill the class of damage it is intended to cover.</p>

<p>I think that the learned Attorney-General devastated the Amendment, but I doubt whether he has made a case for the word "direct" itself. The Commission will only have the words of the Act to go upon, and in any interpretation that the Chancellor of the Ex chequer may put upon this Clause which is in conflict with the plain meaning of the Clause, the Commission will consider the meaning of "direct," and if, say, a direct damage means direct damage and not the thing which the right hon. and learned Gentleman has said &#x2014;</p>

<p>With very great respect and all humility, I have some doubts in my own mind whether the effect of weather, which might last a long time, on premises necessarily and inevitably can be interpreted as the direct result of action by the enemy. At least there is a strong element of doubt about it, and I do not think it is the desire of anybody to leave this in any doubt. I do not think that my hon. Friend himself would say that this is exactly the right form of words with which to deal with it, but I hope that something will be done to make the intention clear beyond all doubt whatever. I do not think that it can be said that it is beyond doubt by accepting the right hon. and learned Gentleman's statement that it is desired to


include such indirect damage as he has described. I hope that it will be possible to look at it again so as to make quite sure.</p>

<p>I would like to reinforce the remarks of my hon. Friend. I think everybody realises that the great difficulty is that when you get a direct result of a bomb and the inability of the local authority or anybody else to make immediate repairs, and inevitably three, four, five or six days go by, if they happen to be days of great storm and bad weather, the direct results of the bomb would be very much greater than they would have been if there had been fine, still weather. The anxiety of all of us is that, as long as this word "direct" remains in the definition Clause, we feel that not only the Commission, but if the new Clause to be moved later is passed by the Committee, the interpretation of the Act will go to the courts, and the same difficulty will arise there. Without any disrespect to my right hon. and learned Friend, we know that the expression of his intention carries no weight, unfortunately, with courts of law. In these circumstance I hope he will reconsider this matter and make quite sure, by some proviso or something of that sort, that any additional damage which occurs as a result of bombing&#x2014;consequential damage, that is&#x2014;must be included in compensation for these claims.</p>

<p>I think the Committee accepts the intention of the Attorney-General and welcomes it, but I am wondering, when it comes to the assessment of the claim by the Commission, how they will decide whether it did include the damage referred to by the Attorney-General. First of all, they have before them the form B.O.W.I or whatever it will be called under the new Regulation. In that form will be specified the damage. What is the position at the present time? A house is bombed, and the roof is exposed to the elements. The owner or agent asks the local authority to put it right, but for some reason, either lack of labour or material, there is a delay. Then the rain gets in, and a few days later the agent or owner is notified. The rain has penetrated to the ceiling, but does not show itself for a month's time. Then, down comes the ceiling.

That is not included in the form if the surveyor has done his job almost immediately. When the Commission have the form in front of them they have to make up their minds whether the damage to the ceiling did occur as the direct action of the bomb. They may say that this was not damage occurring immediately after the bomb dropped, so that the claim may be whittled down. Those with practical experience of these matters know of hundreds of cases, where not only ceilings, but the structure itself has gradually decayed, and one could not say whether it was due to direct enemy action or not. I am not versed in the law as is the Attorney-General, but it is evident to me that there is some conflict of opinion as to whether leaving in the word "direct" does cover what the right hon. and learned Gentleman himself and we want it to cover.</p>

<p>I also am concerned about this word "direct," because I had an Amendment dealing with it on the first Committee stage. I want to ask my right hon. and learned Friend this. I have read it, and it says:
<q>damage occurring as a result of action taken by the enemy.</q>
That is plain English. The only thing that does occur to me is whether the result would be satisfactory if the words in brackets&#x2014; (whether accidental or not) "&#x2014;were left out.</p>

<p>I have devoted some time to considering this obviously important matter. When my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Ashford (Mr. Spens) talked about a house that was damaged in bad weather and said that in such a case the direct results of the damage by bomb were greater than in a case where the weather was fine, he chose the word "direct" to cover that very class of damage which I said would fall within the provision. The difficulty is that if one starts to make a catalogue of all the things, such as the weather, water to put out a fire, and so on, one excludes those other things that are not in the catalogue. It is vitally important that we should use words that will exclude the indirect results of war damage. When I say that, I mean indirect in the wider sense. That is the difficulty about simply leaving out the word "direct." Of course, there may be borderline cases


which some hon. Members may think ought to be included, and other hon. Members may think too remote to be included, but from such researches as I have been able to make, the word direct "seems to be as good a word as one could use. If there were any legal decision which went contrary to the intention of Parliament, the matter could always be dealt with. I want the Committee to realise that this is not an easy problem. I will look into the matter again, and if I can think of some proviso or form of words that will meet the apprehensions of hon. Members, without opening the door to the indirect damage which everybody wants to exclude, we can arrange for those words to be inserted in another place.</p>

<p>I want to ask what will be the position of the Commission <i>vis-a-vis</i> the Treasury. As the hon. and learned Member for Ashford (Mr. Spens) said, the courts are bound by the strict phraseology of an Act, and do not take any notice of the guileful promises of Ministers when they wish to get a Bill through. Is the Commission to be as it were, a court of law? Will its policy be decided in consultation with the Treasury, or will it have the right to administer these provisions without any prompting or advice from the Treasury? If the Treasury is to be ultimately responsible for the policy which the Commission adopts, we shall be able to get at the Commission through the House, but if the Commission is completely cut off from the Treasury, it will fall within the category of a court of law.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Benson) will remember that an Amendment was agreed to which provided that the directions should be of a general character, that they should be in the form of regulations, and that those regulations should come before Parliament, thus being made public. I want to make this observation to the Committee. This matter ought to be dealt with satisfactorily within the Bill. It would not be right for the Treasury to try to interpret the Bill, in its directions to the Commission, in a manner that was obviously out of line with what Parliament had enacted. I think we must examine the matter again in the light of the discussion and see whether we can deal with it in another

place. It is an important matter and I would much prefer that it should be dealt with in the Bill.</p>

<p>I hope the right hon. Gentleman will not think that the whole of the Committee is anxious to leave out this word "direct." I think it would almost ruin the Bill if that were done. In the first place, it would open the door to an immense amount of litigation, and, in the second place, it would add an enormous burden on the taxpayers of the country. Undoubtedly, if the word "direct" were left out, the extent of indirect damage as a result of bombing would amount to far more than the damage anticipated under this Bill. We remember the case of the Alabama claim. The original claim was for &#x00A3;7,000,000, but when indirect damage was taken into account it reached something like &#x00A3;70,000,000. If the right hon. Gentleman leaves out the word "direct," the whole purpose of this Bill will be stultified, and the cost would be so much to the taxpayer that people would not be very pleased with the Mover of this Amendment.</p>

<p>This proposal is far more important than the right hon. gentleman the Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Mr. Wedgwood) seems to realise. As a matter of fact, in a hundred, and probably a thousand, cases it is impossible to formulate a claim in 30 days, and one has to apply for an extension. I defy any Member who has seen extensive damage to ascertain precisely what that damage is. It is impossible to find out until the debris has been cleared away. What is the position now? One goes to a local authority and tells them that there is a hole in a wall, or in the roof, and asks them to protect the premises from wind and weather. The local authorities do their best, but they cannot do the impossible, with the result that one has to wait for weeks, perhaps months, before anything is done. The owner who attempts to repair the damage himself meets with control. If he protects his property then he is liable to prosecution if the cost exceeds &#x00A3;500. Surely it is possible, if an incendiary bomb falls on property and there is a conflagration, that wider damage may be caused by water in putting out the fire than the immediate effects of the bomb itself. This matter really requires reconsideration. None of


us wishes to see the taxpayer robbed, but we want common justice done. Anyone who has taken part in arbitration knows perfectly well that it does not matter what the Attorney-General or anyone else says_. in the House of Commons; it is what is in the Act. I foresee that when the Commissioners are faced with this problem, they will say "Never mind what the intentions were; it is what is in the Act." I urge upon the Government, between now an the Report stage, to find some kind of definition to cover damage which results as an after-effect of a high explosive bomb. Amiable explanations here will not protect the building or victim; good intentions will not compensate the owner for his inability to obtain consent for employment of material or labour to perform the necessary work to protect his building; ardent desire on our part to ensure justice does not compensate for injustice. It is a case of justice to the individual. I ask the Chancellor very seriously to consider the effect of the Clause as it now stands because it is a very important matter.</p>

The Sub-sections which it is now proposed to insert, although different, relate to the Clause, about which the Chancellor of the Exchequer said a good deal in his initial statement, dealing with the rights of mortgagors and mortgagees. This is one of the additional alterations, over and above those to which he referred, and I almost feel that I ought to apologise to those Members who wish that the Clause could be reprinted incorporating all the Amendments on the Paper, so that we might better appreciate how the matter stands. I confine myself to this alteration, but hon. Members should also give their minds to the alterations which have already been made

When this Bill was in Committee my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for East Renfrew (Major Lloyd) moved an Amendment which it was not possible to accept, but I then indicated the feeling shared by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and myself, that there was a special case for making some provision for the position which arises in certain parts of Scotland with regard to dwelling-houses, and particularly the poorer class of dwelling-houses, which are controlled under the Rent Restrictions Act. The provisions of that Act prevent owners recovering from the tenants increases in the owners' rates. As a result of that and other local causes, it is I am afraid only too notorious that a very considerable amount of property of that class is not only subject to a mortgage, or a bond we call it in Scotland, but is so depreciated in value that in many instances it may not be a case of the mortgage or bond representing say one half, two-thirds or three-quarters of the value, but that probably it considerably exceeds the value. The result is that owner and mortgagee or bond-holder have been for some time locked together inextricably in a situation from which they cannot escape because of the Rent Restrictions Act. Accordingly, it is a matter of very serious concern to ensure that no additional burdens should be imposed needlessly upon an owner, if the owner will, thereby, be prevented or hindered in keeping the property in repair and continuing to make it a contribution to the all-too-limited housing accommodation in the West of Scotland. From that point of view we thought it desirable that in relation to the class of property, included in the first of the two Sub-sections, in the phrase
<q>tenement comprising dwelling houses the rateable value of none of which exceeds thirty-five pounds.</q>
The provisions of Clause 20 should enable the owner to pass on to the mortgagee or bond-holder a considerable proportion of the amount of the contribution. In the case of much of that property the only person who has a real interest in it is the mortgagee or bond-holder. The owner has become little more than a conduit pipe for passing on the rent to the mortgagee. It would obviously be unfair to ignore that position. I accept the possible criticism that this proposal, or indeed any proposal that might be made


to meet this situation, is nothing more than an experimental compromise. Wherever the line is drawn there will be cases on the wrong side of the line. I am afraid that is a thing we shall have to put up with, but I hope my hon. and gallant Friend will regard this Amendment as an attempt to meet a grievance which I fully recognise. The numerous Amendments which have been made to Clause 20 may make it necessary that the exact phraseology of this Amendment should be looked at a little more closely before the Bill is finally passed, but I have outlined the solution we suggest. The second Sub-section deals with a different point. It is a matter of machinery. Cases are common enough in Scotland&#x2014; I am not sufficiently versed with English law to know whether they are common here or not&#x2014;where there are two bonds which do not rank <i>pari passu.</i> There is a provision in the main Clause itself, but it is necessary in order to complete the scheme to make provision for the bonds to rank <i>pari passu.</i></p>

We wanted more and we hoped to get more, but nevertheless we are thankful for what we have got. As the situation is studied by those concerned in Scotland, they will recognise that the Chancellor and the Lord Advocate have made a real endeavour to understand and meet the problem.

<p>I would like to say a word on behalf of a certain percentage of people who will be affected by this proposal. I think nearly all hon. Members will have had communications on this subject from people who have been paying to building societies for five or ten years and who are now in very

difficult circumstances as a result of the war. In many cases it is as much as they can do to meet the interest charges. On top of that, they have to meet the premiums. It may Happen that blast will remove the whole of the windows on one side of the house; the actual owner may not be living in it&#x2014;he may be evacuated &#x2014;and may not be in a position to carry out repairs. Where such cases arise, it seems to me that the parties should at least get some compensation. I appreciate the general desirability of cutting out frivolous claims, but what would otherwise seem a frivolous claim might, in these circumstances, be a very serious proposition, and the man may have to go further into debt to meet the cost of making good the damage. I should like to have some assurance on this human side of the question, for while the Committee is in general agreement with the Clause as a whole, it still seems possible that there will be cases of positive hardship, and that the whole intention of the Bill as far as these people are concerned will be frustrated.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That the Clause be read a Second time."<br/>
This new Clause brings together all the Regulations which may be made by the Treasury and which will therefore come before Parliament. Such Regulations may be made as to the notification of the occurrence of damage and as to the making of claims for payments. The hon. Member for Bassetlaw (Mr. Bellenger) raised the point that the first notification should be quite simple as compared with the second and obviously more detailed document in regard to claims. It is provided by paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) of Sub-section (1) of this Clause that there will first be a notification and afterwards the claim. Then Regulations may be made under Sub-section (2) specifying limits of time, and under Sub-section (3) rendering the right to receive the payment under this part of the Act conditional on the requirements of the Regulations having been observed, provided of course that there is a right of waiver in special cases. Under Subsection (4) there is power to make Regulations as to any matter in relation to war damage sustained before the coming into force of the Regulations, so as to cover cases in which claims have already been made or in which claims will be made hereafter, before the Regulations are

finally approved. I have here a whole catalogue of the different points made by hon. Members on the Regulations, and I think we have really met the probability of all of the things that they have in mind arising. Anyhow, Parliament keeps its control over the form of the Regulations.</p>

<p>The Clause provides that the report of the Commission shall be published after the Treasury have made an order in pursuance thereof or have decided to make no order. I think it very desirable that the report should be published before the Treasury make their order or determine not to make an order, so that the general public may make representations upon the report. It is always difficult to obtain a reversal or a modification of an order after it has been made. The right hon. Gentleman has been very good m meeting all the objections which have been raised, and I ask him to consider whether the report might not be published before the Treasury come to a decision.

<p>I beg to move, "That the Clause be read a Second time."<br/>
This Clause gives power to decrease the payment for damage or otherwise, to any person who has failed to take reasonable steps to prevent damage, and has, therefore, increased the extent of the damage to the property. That principle was suggested earlier, and will, I think, commend itself to the Committee. The Clause works in this way. It does not damage or prejudice in any way the claims of those persons who have not been negligent. The amount by which the damage is increased is deducted from the sum that would otherwise go to the negligent party, or if the amount of the aggravation of the damage by negligence exceeds the sum that he would receive, then it can be recovered from him as a civil debt due from him, and the amount will go to meet the just claims of the parties. I think it is a Clause which will meet with general acceptance. I might, I hope, without infringing the Rules of Order, suggest to those who were interested in the discussion just now, that the direct result of considering this Clause and its implications has some bearing perhaps on the construction of the words, giving them the wide construction it is desired.</p>

<p>I beg to move, as an Amendment to the proposed new Cause, in line 1, after the word "is," to insert "caused or."<br/>
On the general question of this Clause the Committee ought to feel a great debt of gratitude that such a Clause has been moved by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, because the Bill contains extremely few safeguards, and there is a likelihood of very large sums of the taxpayers' money being paid away unless some such safeguard as this is included in the Bill. I do not want to labour the wording of my manuscript Amendment nor to make the Clause unduly complicated, but it seems to me that if war damage to a hereditament is increased by failure, one has to realise that the war damage might equally well be caused by failure. For example, an incendiary bomb falls and does no damage at all if it is dealt with in the course of two or three minutes, or at all events certainly less than &#x00A3;5 worth of damage will be done, but if the bomb is allowed to get a good hold on a wooden floor or something of that kind, enormous damage may be done. I suggest that, if the words "caused or" are put in front of the word "increased," we shall have an additional safeguard, and it will make people still more careful. It is well known all over the country that a great deal of damage has been done because reasonable precautions have not been taken to prevent damage; therefore I suggest that the words "caused or"

should be put in front of the word "increased" in order to make owners of property who are mentioned quite clearly in the Clause even more careful than they are at the present time.</p>

<p>I have only seen this Amendment for about two minutes, but I would ask my hon. and gallant Friend not to press it, because I think it may open up a question which we discussed before, namely, whether a person should be ruled out of the Bill altogether because he is not a fire watcher. I agree that we must have proper and adequate penalties for people who do not have fire watchers according to law, and if those penalties are not big enough, they must be increased. But if you say, "If you have no fire watcher you may lose your right to damage under this Bill," you will make it extremely difficult for the courts to deal with cases which come before them. It would be an impossible task to put it upon the Commission to inquire into all the aspects antecedent to the damage. They can inquire after the damage because at that stage the local authority is on the scene. Therefore, there are these two objections&#x2014;one in principle, and one practical, to this Amendment. Another is that the Commission would have no evidence of what was happening in the building at the time a bomb descended, and while I appreciate my hon. and gallant Friend's anxiety that there should be appropriate and unpleasant consequences for those who do not fulfil their duty in this matter, I think the proper way is to strengthen, if required, the penalties which can be imposed if it is proved against them that they have not taken proper precautions.</p>

<p>I only want to say that the Attorney-General has to a great extent convinced me, and if the effect of what he has said, and of what I rather haltingly put before the Committee, is to make people realise that they have to protect the public purse and the property of the State, so much the better. Quite recently a Minister of the Crown said, of individuals who had taken insufficient care and were guilty of contributory negligence in regard to their property, that they were "guilty of passive arson." I agree with that view, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw my Amendment, feeling confident that the law as it exists to-day will be sufficient to frighten


property owners into taking proper precautions for the safeguarding of their property.</p>

<p>This Clause endeavours to meet a number of points which occurred during previous Debates, but I think it contains a rather serious danger. Is it the Commission who have to decide what steps a man ought reasonably to have been expected to take in order to protect his property? Supposing my home is damaged by a bomb and the roof destroyed, is it to be considered unreasonable if I do not obtain and put on the roof a tarpaulin or a steel or wooden cover? If I happen to be unable, because of lack of means, to find the money necessary to take these steps, shall I be penalised as a result? If a person is reasonably expected to take certain steps for the protection of his property, is he to be relieved if he is unable to obtain the necessary labour or materials? Who is to be the judge in these matters? What court of appeal is there to be? There is no doubt that some provision of this nature is required, but it must be subject to every possible safeguard, for otherwise those who are perhaps not as careful as they might be about these things may be subject to serious deductions from the sum which they would otherwise receive. I suggest to the Chancellor that these questions ought to be answered, and that the public ought to know where they stand. It may be right to deduct sums because of a failure to minimise the damage, but I suggest that all leniency should be extended to those offenders and that all the relevant circumstances, including the financial circumstances of the claimant, should be taken into account. If we could receive some assurance on these lines, it might help us in coming to a decision.</p>

<p>Enlarging the point that has been made by my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for South-East Leeds (Major Milner), I want to say that one can reasonably assume that owners of property will take whatever steps they can to protect their property as much as possible, for

the simple reason that they are the owners of the property. This applies more especially if they have a mortgage on the property. As the Chancellor knows, however, many of these properties have sustained slight damage and the tenants have evacuated them. There is no further income to be obtained from such properties, and the owner has to pay ground rent, mortgage interest and so forth. In such a case, probably he has no money to take even reasonable steps to protect his property. Another point which occurs to me&#x2014;and perhaps the Attorney-General can give an answer on this&#x2014;is more in the nature of a legal point. The provision not only throws the onus on the owner of the equity but also on any person interested in a proprietary manner in the property or in part of it&#x2014;it may be a ground landlord, another lessor, or a chain of lessors. What right in law have any of these superior owners or landlords to enter on the property and do the repairs? At the present time the physical owner of the property, the equity owner, is in complete possession, and I do not know that anybody above him has a right under the common law to enter on the property and do repairs without his permission. A further point arises from this. One assumes that one of these people who is the owner of a proprietary interest is aware that the property has been damaged. He may be living near the property, or he may be living along way from it. How is it to be proved that he was aware that the property had been damaged, and therefore, could have taken the necessary steps? These points may or may not be substantial ones, but they will arise, and it would be as well to clear them up at this stage and not allow them to cause confusion later on.</p>

<p>I am in complete agreement with the principle involved in this new Clause, but I am a little anxious about the drafting. It. occurs to me that there may be some difficulty because people do not always know exactly, in the conditions under which we are existing to-day, who is the responsible owner. The Attorney-General referred back to the discussion we had on the word "direct," but as a matter of fact the omission or exclusion of a word in some of these Clauses makes a great deal of difference. I ask the Government to consider the question of including in this new Clause


the word "wilful," to make it quite clear that the penalties involved are to be imposed only for what might be termed "wilful negligence."</p>

<p>There is another aspect of this question which I do not think has been considered. In many cases local authorities have bought damaged property purely for demolition purposes. We are being compelled to pay on that property, but the last thing in the world we wish to do is to waste time or further money in protecting it. The only ques-which arises in the case of this property is the dousing of any fires which may be started. The property is bought for demolition, and it cannot be expected that we shall expend further money in safeguarding or protecting it. I do not know what claims we shall eventually have, but I should like an assurance that after paying the premiums we shall, at least, have some contribution to the new property. It seems to me that unless there is some proviso in this new Clause, any claim we might have would be invalidated, because, quite properly, we should not be wasting time in protecting this class of property. I should like to have some assurance that we shall not be penalised in such cases.</p>

<p>I should like hon. Members to consider Sub-section (2) of this new Clause, which applies its provisions to cases in which a value payment is made. It seems impossible that a value payment could be increased by any neglect on the part of the owner of property, because the amount of the value payment is determined under Clause 4 as,
<q>the amount by which the value of the hereditament in the state in which it was immediately after the occurrence of the damage is less than its value in the state in which it was immediately before the occurrence of the damage.</q>
Therefore there is no time limit in this computation by which the damage can be aggravated by the owner's neglect.</p>

<p>My reply to the hon. Member for Finsbury (Mr. Woods) is that if the property was valueless and had been bought for demolition purposes, it was unlikely that any claim could be made for failure to keep the weather out &#x2014;no doubt proper steps would be taken to see that the property did not catch fire. So far as the question put by the

hon. Member for North Battersea (Mr. Douglas) is concerned, I think the answer is that the value immediately after the damage would reflect the possibility of consequential damage. I will look into that, but I think that is probably the answer. Of course, there might certainly be cases in which a valuer discovered that a claimant had caused the damage to increase to such an extent as to alter the basis of payment.</p>

<p>1 am not an expert on damage to property, but take the familiar case of a house with a skylight. The skylight could very well be covered by a tarpaulin. The local authority provides the tarpaulin, but the householder does not put it on, and, as the result, rain pours in. That goes on for week after week, and you might easily get a case in which, if the tarpaulin had been promptly put on, there would be a small amount of damage, but, through its being left open to the weather, it is almost irreparable.</p>

<p>It is not in all cases the duty of the local authority. I have done it myself. Local authorities have plenty of work to do in looking after the houses of people for whom it was not so easy as it was for me to get a tarpaulin and do the temporary repairs myself. Some people suggest that the Clause is a little too severe and that it ought to be "wilful" failure. I am not quite sure about that. This is a failure to take reasonable steps, but that question is not to be decided by the Commission. The Clause does not give the Commission a discretion to decide it finally, and it could go to the courts. If it was sough to be recovered as a debt, that may be provided for already. But I will undertake to look into the question. It may be that there is not a clear provision at present for taking a question of this kind to the courts in doubtful cases. I do not think the court, or indeed the Commission, are likely to set too severe a standard of what is reasonable, but I think it is a


salutory principle that people should realise that their compensation may be cut down if they do not take reasonable steps. There may be cases where the owner of a house, but for a provision of this kind, might think it to his interest to let the rain come in because he was going to get a cost-of-works payment.</p>

<p>This Clause is the risk that he will run, and that is why I think the principle is a sound one. It is not quite a case where the interests of the owner of property will necessarily force him to take reasonable care. It is like any other case where a risk is insured where it may be that, short of a provision of this kind, a man will say, "If I can get the money for extra damage, it does not much matter." Therefore, on the whole, I think it is better to leave it at "increased by failure." One must trust both the Commissioners and the courts, in this as in other matters, to apply a reason able standard in all circumstances. I hope I have now dealt with the various questions &#x2014;</p>

<p>I think there is a misconception there. A person interested may be a tenant for life: he is not the owner, but he is a person interested. He would normally be the person in occupation and therefore the person on whom the duty would fall. As regards those who are not on the spot&#x2014; a mortgagee or a landlord who is living away&#x2014;I think it is difficult to imagine circumstances in which they will be concerned with this Clause at all, because no duty is placed on them to deal with the premises. That must be the duty of the occupier. Normally they would not be on the spot at all.</p>

<p>Supposing that he is on the spot, then he goes round and

takes charge and is the person who is dealing with the matter, and it may well be found that he has failed to take reasonable steps.

<p>With all respect to the Attorney-General, his reply is not, I feel, satisfactory. Obviously when he speaks of the various interests involved he is looking only at the interests of the individual on the spot, and he appears to cast some duty upon the occupier. Unless the occupier is either the owner or the mortgagee or has some other similar interest, he is under no obligation to do anything at all. I think the right hon. and learned Gentleman agrees with that.</p>

<p>There may be a misunderstanding, I fear. The question will be whether the person making a claim has failed to take reasonable steps which might otherwise have been taken to limit the damage. That person may be the owner or may be the occupier&#x2014;if he is a weekly tenant probably he has no interest at all&#x2014;or may be, though I think it is unlikely, a mortgagee in possession. The courts will have to be satisfied about the relationship of the person making the claim to the property and that he failed to take reasonable steps.</p>

<p>The Committee are obliged to the right hon. and learned Gentleman who, I feel, has somewhat clarified the situation, but this is a most important matter. The Clause is, in effect, a penal one. It also, I think, operates retrospectively and may therefore cover many cases which have already taken place. Having regard to the way in which we have, in the main, agreed upon everything which has come before the Committee hitherto, I would suggest that the right hon. and learned Gentleman should look into this again, because I am sure he desires to be fair and reasonable in the matter. I do not think it should go forth that claimants are to be penalised for every small piece of neglect which may have occurred, for one reason or another. In only the most extreme cases should the provisions of the Clause be brought into force. I hope that the


Attorney-General will look into the matter again from that point of view, because, as it is at present, the Clause might have very serious consequences, and if put into operation might cost a great deal more than would be gained by it.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1941-02-25a.469.0" hansard_membership_id="1130" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/12211" speakername="Mr. Bellenger" colnum="469" time="">
<p>I support the remarks just made by my hon. and gallant Friend. I cannot even now, after listening to the Attorney-General, understand why the Clause has been put forward. His explanation seemed to show that there would not be a great possibility of cases being brought before the court to decide whether claimants had been negligent or not. As for his example of the claimant who, in order to get on a cost of works basis instead of a valuation basis, allowed deterioration to occur, I cannot see that point at all. I thought the Attorney-General said that a claimant might leave his skylight open, for the rain would pour in so that more damage would be done, and that then the claimant might get a cost of works payment. If he is to get a valuation payment it will obviously be less than the cost-of-works payment, and therefore I cannot see that the illustration was substantial and offered any reason for including the Clause.<br/>
It all depends upon the interpretation given by the courts to the word "reasonable." I am not conversant with court practice in such a matter, but the Committee ought to have a proper explanation from the Government of why the Clause is being put in at all. In my previous remarks I think I said, and I hope I proved, that every owner who has hopes of getting benefit out of his property at some time, during or after the war, will take whatever steps he can to preserve that interest. I cannot see, therefore, that he is likely to penalise himself by what the Attorney-General called negligence. At any rate, I have not heard from the Attorney-General an illustration of what that negligence might be. He talked about his own house being supplied by the local authority with a tarpaulin to put over his skylight. I do not know whether that actually happened to him, but if so, he was taking steps to protect his own interest, probably his furniture as well as the property, for his own personal convenience. He put a tarpaulin or a piece of linoleum over the skylight for his own convenience, and that is what most occupiers would do.<br/>
The Government should look at this Clause again and make sure that, by putting it in, they are not merely hoping to catch a body of people who will not take steps to protect their own property, but that they may not be penalising many honest folk who, for reasons that any ordinary man can understand and over which they have no control, have allowed some slight, or increasing, deterioration to take place. I do not know what the interpretation of the courts may be, but such deterioration would be no real fault of the person concerned, or that they could remedy. I have already explained that many owners have not the means to take steps to stop deterioration of this kind. I hope that the proposed new Clause will not lay open the way to lots of court actions or lots of arguments before the Commission, in which case the value payment, or a considerable part of it, may be dissipated in costs. I hope also that this is not the intention of the Government, and that they will therefore take steps to look at the matter again</p>

<p>1 have seen this sort of thing actually in practice already, and I would ask the Minister to follow what happens. When a house is damaged by enemy action, the first thing an owner finds is that he cannot get anybody in the building trade to come to his aid and to put the house into such a condition that it will not deteriorate. I want the Government to understand this, because this is a very serious matter, especially to the man who owns the house in which he lives. Where a person owns a large number of cottages he has always got a contract with the builder, and the builder is in contact with him all the time and will repair his property, but I know of a little district outside Manchester where persons living in their own cottages have been completely unable to find people to repair their property and prevent its being damaged by snow and rain and wind. Can the right hon. Gentleman say that if such a person puts that argument before the Board, he will be regarded as coming within this Clause? In such a case the owner of the house simply goes to the builder, and the builder replies, "I cannot spare a slater or a plasterer or a joiner," and so the house deteriorates, but the owner will not be able to produce a single document to prove that he has done his best to prevent the house deteriorating.


I ask the right hon. Gentleman to consider that point.</p>

<p>I will take into consideration what has been said, but I must say that I do not think there has been expressed here this afternoon the views held by a very large number of people in this country, if I am to judge from communications sent to me. My hon. Friend said that all owners were taking precautions. I think he had better make some inquiries in the City concerning that. He would have a very different story told him, as many of us know. Already we have had experience of a certain amount of damage that has been caused through people failing to take precautions which they ought to take, not only in their own interests, but in the interests of other people. A lot of people have written to me in most indignant terms and pressed me very strongly indeed. I want my hon. Friend to realise that this deals only with cases of negligence. In the case that he has cited it would not be held that a person was negligent. I will, however, see whether any further improvement can be made. That has been my attitude in regard to this Bill all the time. We will study the points that have been mentioned and, if necessary, make further suggestions.</p>

I would like to go further than the Chancellor could go and argue against those who may be described as my own class&#x2014;the property owners. I am sorry to say there is some evidence to show that certain owners of property, great or small, are only too anxious to see their property destroyed in order to get compensation.

<p>I beg to move, "That the Clause be read a Second time."<br/>
This Clause enables the temporary use or occupation of land owing to the war to be disregarded for purposes of contribution. By Clause 16, Sub-section (3) agricultural land pays a contribution at the 6d. rate. The question has been raised of agricultural land being temporarily used for non-agricultural purposes owing to the war; for example, a barn being used for refugees. Despite the diversion of the land from its normal use it would still be liable to the ordinary agricultural rate of 6d., and this new Clause makes that point plain.</p>

<p>I assume that this Clause applies to cases where land is requisitioned by authority, and not to cases where the owner, for his own profit and benefit, diverts it to some other purpose? I do not know whether the wording makes that fact clear, but I think a distinction ought to be drawn.</p>

<p>I am not sure about that, but I will look into it. If an owner of land did divert his property in that way I do not think that he should be able to use his right under the scheme. Of course, it does not make a person any more beneficent to the nation if he, compulsorily, uses his property in a certain way, but on the other hand if it is being used as the

<p>I am obliged for that explanation, because the municipal authorities are very dissatisfied with regard to financial grants in respect of air-raid shelters. As the hon. and gallant Gentleman knows, up to 19th October only a proportion of the expenditure was paid to the active municipal authorities who erected the air-raid shelters, and the laggards who had not troubled to erect shelters in the early days but who erected them since 19th October last year are receiving 100 per cent, from the Treasury. As I understand it, where the Treasury have contributed, whether it be in part or in whole, they would presumably contribute in the future in whole to the cost of reinstatement or re-erection of the air-raid shelters. I would like it to be made clear, if it is the case, that the whole cost of any reinstatement or re-erection will be borne by the State under the ordinary provisions with regard to air-raid shelters and not in any way in connection with this Bill.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That the Clause be read a Second time."<br/>
This Clause covers cases in which the sporting or shooting rights are assessed separately under the Act of 1874 because they are in hands other than those of the occupier of the soil. The Clause provides that the contribution in respect of those rights shall be paid by the contributor in respect of the soil, which I think is ob-

viously right as the Committee will see in considering the two following parallel cases. In the case of a property of which the annual value is &#x00A3;200, including the sporting rights, the contribution is levied on that figure and covers the sporting rights as well. If the sporting rights are separate and are worth &#x00A3;20, &#x00A3;180 will be left on the occupier of the soil. As the compensation in respect of damage will go to the owner of the soil, it seems right that he should make the contribution in respect of the two interests when they are separate as well as when they are in the same hands. A proviso is added to cover cases in which sporting rights are in the hands of a third party when the land is comprised in more than one contributory property.</p>

The Committee are probably aware that under certain Statutes there are provisions by which cases which come to court under those Statutes are heard by certain nominated judges. That is a very convenient procedure, because the judges become familiar with the terms of the Statute. This Clause enables the Lord

Chancellor to nominate for the hearing of cases under this Act such judges of the High Court as appear to him expedient. We do not move this Clause in anticipation of a flood of litigation: we hope that it will be possible to work this Measure without undue resort by parties to the courts; but this is a useful power for the Lord Chancellor to have.</p>

<p>About five weeks ago I received from the Governor-General of Australia a letter covering a letter from Bishop Tucker, and including a report


drawn up by the Society of Friends and others, who had visited refugee camps in Australia, concerning the passage of the steamship "Dunera" loaded with 2,400 refugees from this country to Australia. By the same mail I received a consider able number of other letters, including cuttings from newspapers. I mention that because I think two things are to be re corded at once: in the first place, that a certain amount of publicity has been given to this report already in Australia, and secondly, that the reaction in Australia was extremely creditable to that country, to the Press and to the public here. They felt very strongly what occurred on the journey to be a slur upon this country&#x2014;</p>

<p>It was also felt that the Government in this country ought to do something to put the matter right at the earliest moment. I took the correspondence to the Secretary of State for the Dominions, and he advised me to take it to the Home Office. Thence it went to the War Office and, immediately, the Secretary of State for War decided to appoint a Court of Inquiry into the whole affair, the court to be appointed as soon as the people who were charged with the responsibility for what happened, got to this country. I need not go fully into the case, which is very unpleasant. Sufficient is it to say that the refugees on board the "Dunera" were mostly Jews belonging to Class C, that is to say, friendly Jews. There were 2,400 in a ship which was suitable for carrying only half that number; they were robbed by the soldiers in charge and battened down, being allowed up on deck only on certain occasions. In fact conditions were both unjust and inhuman on board that ship, especially so, as it was reported to me, that in the other ship which went to Australia conditions were unpleasant but quite in accordance with what one would expect from the British Army and British traditions.<br/>
This Court of Inquiry has not yet been set up and I want to urge on His Majesty's

Government the need for three things. In the first place, I think there must be a certain degree of publicity; at least, the findings of the court must be published. Only that will satisfy public opinion in Australia and in this country. It will do good because it is important that we should show the world that when anything of this sort has been done by people in British service, direct action is taken by this House and by the Government in order to prevent it happening again, to punish the offenders and to compensate the victims. I believe publicity is possible in a democratic country and it is certainly desirable. Do not let this be a hole-and-corner affair, so that anybody can charge us with the desire of trying to conceal what is unpleasant in our conduct. We must show the world that we are not afraid of people knowing what has happened and what steps the Government have actually taken. Therefore, publicity is extremely important. 1 would also urge that there should be on the court not merely officials of the Government but some independent person of judicial mind, whose report will carry weight. Thirdly, and perhaps most important of all, I think there should be evidence given not only from the defendants' point of view, but from the point of view of the victims themselves. I do not think it is enough simply to take sworn statements. Steps should be taken to return to this country at once a certain number of refugees who have suffered so that they can be cross-examined on their sworn statements&#x2014;although I know this will delay the findings of the Court of Inquiry&#x2014;and so that they may have the satisfaction of feeling that their side of the case has been stated as well as it could be in the circumstances. Whether, in addition to this, there should be representation of the victims by lawyers, I do not know, but I am certain that mere sworn statements should not be considered sufficient and that, even at the cost of delay, some of these people should be brought back to give evidence. As to the terms of reference, it is very important that the Court of Inquiry should deal not merely with the rights and wrongs of the case and whether punishment of any sort is required, but also make recommendations for the compensation of the people who have been robbed. They cannot be compensated for the inhumanity, but they can be compensated for the injustice, and


the watches, wedding rings and money that have been taken from them should, as far as possible, be restored to them. I think this must come within the purview of the Court of Inquiry.<br/>
There is one small action that ought to be taken before the Court of Inquiry is held. Some steps ought to be taken to get some money to these refugees who are now penniless in Australia. To have no money even to buy razor blades, cigarettes, newspapers or postage stamps is a terrible position for them. Their money has been taken from them. I think the Government might arrange for them to have some small sum each week pending the decision of the Court of Inquiry. This would certainly make life easier for them, and I believe it would have a very good effect in Australia if something of this sort were done. People in Australia constantly visit these camps now. They are looking after their duty to the refugees in Australia much better than we have done here. They have constantly in their minds their duty to these friendly aliens. If some small cash allowance could be made to these people immediately as an instalment on any claims they may have, it would have a very good effect.<br/>
But there is more involved now. Since the case of the "Dunera" going to Australia, there has been the casex2014;not equally shocking, but shocking&#x2014;of the "Ettrick" going to Canada. I have not seen sworn statements regarding the "Ettrick," but the accounts I have heard really call for an inquiry as well. I do not know what steps the Government are taking to get any evidence about the "Ettrick." The officers are here and the Government know their side of the case. The one statement containing details which I have had about the "Ettrick" was signed and was in the form of a diary. It was very unpleasant reading, but when I thought of sending it to the War Office, I was immediately told that it could not be used. There is a not unnatural nervousness on the part of these people. I ask that when the case of the "Dunera" is being inquired into, something should be said and done about the "Ettrick" at the same time, and that any steps taken in the case of the "Dunera" should also be taken in the case of the "Ettrick."<br/>
I do not want the House to imagine for one moment that either the case of the

"Dunera" or the "Ettrick" are typical of what goes on on board our ships. You always have a few brutes in every Service. Fortunately, we can deal with them in this country, not as in Germany. The British soldier and officer, particularly in the Pioneer Corps, are behaving almost with affection towards these unfortunate refugees. Commandants in camps here are being extremely British. But we do get these bad cases, and if we stamp on them we stop them elsewhere. I am afraid that there may be even now in ships upon the seas, conveying Italian prisoners, for instance, to South Africa or India, the same sort of thing happening. Steps ought to be taken right away to show the Government's determined disapproval of this sort of thing, and to make it quite clear to any military in charge of prisoners or refugees, wherever they may be, that any inhumanity, robbery or "souvenir-ing," as it is called, is criminal and will be sternly punished. It is because all of us in this House uphold, as best we can, the honour of this country, that these questions have to be brought up. It is because we bring them up here that these cases are rare. I beg the Government to take advantage of the fact that we are still a free democracy where these things can be brought up, and to make quite certain, by expressing publicly their detestation and horror, that such things do not occur again.</p>

<p>My right hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Mr. Wedgwood) has spoken on this rather disagreeable matter with great moderation and great feeling. I rather wish that it had not been necessary to have a Debate, even a short one, upon this subject, because I would not like the idea to get about that there was any division between the views of my right hon. Friend and the views of the Government, if these allegations were proved to be true. My right hon. Friend said that he wished the Government would state its detestation of these occurrences. It is impossible to say anything specific while this matter is still <i>sub judice,</i> and it would be unfair to do so. I am sure that my right hon. Friend will find that the Government, if these allegations should be proved, would detest them quite as much as he. My right hon. Friend devoted the earlier part of his


remarks to an appeal for the fullest possible publicity to be given to any inquiry there might be on the case of the "Dunera." I wish I could persuade him that that is not necessarily the right attitude to follow in a case of this kind. My right hon. Friend said perfectly truly that this was a democratic country and that in a democracy the fullest possible publicity was required. It is perfectly true that this is a democratic country, but, unfortunately, it is not a democratic world, and if the allegations are proved to be well-founded, I can foresee certain definite disadvantages in washing our dirty linen in public in a world which contains enemies as well as friends.<br/>
My right hon. Friend also said he was quite certain the case of the "Dunera" was not typical or characteristic of what has been happening. To publish every detail of any inquiry that could be made, would be construed in enemy countries and in enemy propaganda, as an admission of guilt, not applying to a particular case, but generally to the British character and the British way of waging a war. I think the right hon. Gentleman would agree that that is extremely undesirable. When he first brought up the case, the Secretary of State said that certain preliminary investigations were in hand and when they were completed he would know whether or not there was a <i>prima facie</i> case for inquiry and he promised if a <i>prima facie</i> case were established that inquiry there should be. I want to comment to the very minimum on the case at the present moment, but I can tell the House that these preliminary investigations have been completed; that there is a case for inquiry and, furthermore, it is clear that some, if not all of these internees on that ship, have suffered loss. Those two things have been established by the preliminary inquiry so far as it has gone.<br/>
I am going to say a word about the Court of Inquiry. If we establish a Court of Inquiry it will be held in secret and it may be months before it completes its inquiry. In fact, it may prove impossible to complete it until the end of the war. Essential witnesses may have to be gathered from every corner of the globe. They are not only in Australia. Some are in India, some in Africa and some at the moment are sailing the tropical seas. To wait until all these wit-

nesses are gathered before the Court of Inquiry might take months or longer. It might be impossible while the war is going on, but I am informed by the Judge Advocate-General that it may be possible&#x2014; he cannot give me an assurance&#x2014;to institute court-martial proceedings without the establishment of this Court of Inquiry. If that should prove to be possible, I suggest that it is a more realistic fulfilment of the pledge of the Secretary of State than to hold an inquiry which might carry on for months.<br/>
With regard to compensation, if a Court of Inquiry is held it will carry on for a very long time, and if we fulfil our original intention of waiting until the Court has completed its proceedings before considering the question of compensation, that would have the effect of putting these unfortunate people into a very difficult and even impossible position. They might have to wait until the end of the war before any compensation was paid. Accordingly, my right hon. Friend has decided that that would be an impossible course to follow and he is going to see what steps he can take to provide a much more immediate reparation for these people in Australia without waiting for the result of any Court or any disciplinary action that may be taken here. I cannot say at this moment exactly what steps we can take, but I think I can say that we will tee that the compensation is made as expeditiously and as justly as is possible. There will be no waiting for the collection of evidence before this is done. It may prove to be a little costly to the Ex chequer, but we have thought, and I feel quite rightly, that in a case of this kind it is better to clear our good name, even if it is perhaps a little expensive, than to wait and have this business dragging on for monhs with quite unjustifiable reflections upon our good name and character in the meanwhile. I hope I have said enough&#x2014;</p>

<p>I hope the hon. Gentleman will deal with the part of the right hon. Gentleman's speech which was concerned with the future. I would suggest that he should give an assurance that the most strict instructions will be given to officers and men in charge of all prisoner-ships that it is a military offence which will be severely punished for them to "swop"&#x2014;to use a


schoolboy term&#x2014;any articles with prisoners or to buy any articles from prisoners or sell to them.</p>

<p>If it has not already been made perfectly clear to officers, guards and crews on those ships, I think I can say that it will definitely be made clear, and that everything will be done to see that the instruction is not ignored and that there is no repetition of unpleasant incidents of the kind referred to. I hope the House will feel that by the steps taken to provide immediate compensation for those who have sufferedx2014;when I say "immediate" I do not mean at this moment but in a very short time&#x2014;and the steps taken to see that where disciplinary action is merited it is meted out, the War Office have dealt with this matter as hon. Members would wish it to be dealt with, and in a way which will clear the good name of this country from any imputations that may have been put upon it. With regard to the "Ettrick," which was mentioned by my right hon. Friend, as that was not to be the subject of this Debate, I cannot say very much about it without more notice, but I can say that the same principles which have actuated us in this case will move us in that one, and that we shall act as quickly as we can.</p>

<p>I think the whole House will feel relieved and thankful for the spirit in which the Financial Secretary has dealt with this most delicate, difficult and painful subject. I am very glad also that he was able to give the assurance he did in reply to the Noble Lord. I am sure that all who are troubled about what has happened owe a debt to my right hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Mr. Wedgwood) for the way in which he has raised this very difficult matter and the confidence he expressed in the general spirit of justice in the authorities of the British Army, a spirit which I feel certain will be shown in the proceedings which are to take place. As one of

those Members who have received a number of letters from internees and friends of internees, I should like to say how widespread will be the thankfulness among those poor people at the statement that reparation is to be made. I am sure that will be deeply appreciated, and that they will appreciate even more than any monetary compensation the spirit in which the matter has been dealt with by the Government this afternoon. On behalf of many who cannot speak here I should like to thank the Financial Secretary and the Government for their attitude.</p>

<p>In reference to that part of the speech of my hon. Friend in which he spoke of the question of the "Ettrick," I was glad to learn that he is thinking of dealing with it on the same principle. I have had the opportunity of reading a number of statements which have been sent in by refugees who have come back into this country. Something like 300 of these refugees are available here to give evidence, and many of them are prepared to say exactly what happened. I have sent these statements to the War Office, and I know that they are being considered at the present time. I hope that, by court of inquiry or possibly by court-martial, suitable action will be taken.<br/>
To one thing which has arisen in this connection I would call attention, and that is that some of the lower grade officials concerned have been saying to internees who have come back: "You had better keep your mouth shut or you may get into trouble; you may get interned again." I hope that the Government will take an early opportunity of saying that there is not the slightest foundation for any statement of that kind, and that if any of the refugees feel that they would like to give evidence or are asked to do so, they are perfectly free to do so in this free country.</p>
