<p>asked the Minister of Labour whether he is aware of the difficulty being experienced owing to the shortage of bricklayers labourers for working in conjunction with bricklayers and that no provision is made for them in the Schedule of Reserved Occupations; and what steps are being taken to remedy this position in view of the fact that building trade workers are being released from military service for urgent work?</p>

<p>An arrangement has been in force for some time under which building trades workers, including bricklayers labourers, employed on work of great importance, including the first-aid repair of houses damaged by air raids, have been granted deferment of their calling up for military service. Certain other proposals in this connection are at present being considered.</p>

<p>asked the Minister of Labour whether his circular of last July, recommending an immediate reduction of the hours of labour of adult males to 55 or 56 hours per week as soon as the necessary labour force had been acquired, is being fully observed?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1941-02-20a.261.10" hansard_membership_id="1252" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/12340" speakername="Mr. Bevin" colnum="261" time="">
<p>The circular to which the hon. Member refers did not recommend an immediate reduction, but contemplated that hours would be reduced progressively

as the necessary labour became available. Progress is being made along these lines, and the position is under continuous review by my Department.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1941-02-20a.262.0" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. Adams" colnum="262" time="">
<p>asked the Minister of Labour whether his attention has been drawn to a court case in which a magistrate dismissed a charge, brought against a firm, of working boys during longer hours than is permitted by law; whether other such cases have been brought to his notice; and whether he is taking steps to ensure, in the interests of sustained production, that the law relating to the hours of work of juveniles shall be fully enforced?</p>

<p>The answer to the first part of the Question is in the affirmative. I am not aware of other similar cases. I am advised by the Factory Department that, generally speaking, the hours of juveniles are now being effectively controlled through the Factory Acts and the Emergency Order procedure for regulating war-time hours.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1941-02-20a.262.2" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. Adams" colnum="262" time="">

<p>asked the Minister of Labour what is the total increase in wages and war-time allowances granted to railway workers since the beginning of the war; whether such increases are comparable to those granted in other industries; and whether the Government have now given further consideration to the question of fixing a standard wage which can be paid in all industries concerned with the national war effort?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1941-02-20a.262.6" hansard_membership_id="1252" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/12340" speakername="Mr. Bevin" colnum="262" time="">
<p>Apart from certain increases in the wage rates of lower-paid workers which, though operative from the end of October, 1939, were awarded in respect of claims made before the outbreak of war, the wage increases granted to railway workers since the outbreak of war amount to 7s. per week, in the case of conciliation grades, 8s. in the case of shopmen and &#x00A3;18 per annum in the case of salaried staff. There have been corresponding increases for women and


juveniles. In addition the lower-paid workers received, shortly after the outbreak of war, increases varying from 6d. to 5s. per week as the result of an increase in the weekly minimum rates of men and women in the conciliation grades. The average increase in rates of wages varies widely in different industries. In all the industries combined, excluding agriculture, it is estimated that the average is about 14 to 15 per cent. As regards the last part of the Question, I have nothing to add to the statement made in the course of my speech in the House on 21st January.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1941-02-20a.263.0" hansard_membership_id="3239" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/28549" speakername="Sir W. Davison" colnum="263" time="">
<p>Do not the Government consider it desirable that increases of wages, which are mainly due to the increase in the cost of living, should be generally comparable in all industries, and that it is undesirable that smaller industries which are not as highly organised as the railways and other big industries should have the same advantages as those which are highly organised?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1941-02-20a.263.1" hansard_membership_id="1252" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/12340" speakername="Mr. Bevin" colnum="263" time="">
<p>The Government are averse to a political settlement of wages. We believe that if it were introduced, it would have the same effect as it did in the end of the last war, when it led to rapid and disastrous inflation. The second point made by my hon. Friend is surely unjustified, because powerful unions like those of the railwaymen and engineers have refrained from using their power, and have referred their cases to arbitration. Surely it is not suggested that arbitration courts would be influenced in their decision as to whether a trade was or was not well organised. They have to decide cases on the facts, and without interference</p>

<p>In connection with the revision of the Schedule of Reserved Occupations,

<p>Yes, Sir, I will, and I will take the opportunity of saying to my hon.

<p>Two separate Orders concerning lire-prevention duties have been made.

The Compulsory Enrolment Order

will be put into operation where under Regulation 27B a local authority is directed to make fire-prevention arrangements in its area, elsewhere than at business premises, and the number of volunteers for that purpose is insufficient.</p>

<q>Following questions and answers from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Home Office the executive council were satisfied that the member's internment had not arisen out of his trade union activities, but was solely connected with his activities on behalf of a political party of which it was alleged he was a member.

<p>The rate of grant to local education authorities on their expenditure on the provision of meals, including buildings and equipment, was substantially increased last July&#x2014;the increase being in no case less than 20 per cent.&#x2014;and now ranges from 50 to 92 per cent. with an average rate of 70 per cent.

The provision of meals for school children is a normal peace-time service, part of the capital and running cost of which has always been met from the rates on the ground that it forms part of the education provision of the area.

<p>asked the Home Secretary whether his attention has been drawn to the circumstances in regard to the retirement of an inspector in the York police force at the request of the Watch Committee, the reason being that a charge of theft was preferred against him and admitted, but no prosecution has taken place, and the man retains his pension; and will he cause an inquiry to be made into the case, and report his findings to the House?</p>

<p>I have made inquiries into this case and am informed that the inspector was dealt with by the Watch Committee, as disciplinary authority for the force, and was required to resign, as an alternative to dismissal. The result of this decision was that he retained his right to a pension on retirement. The administration of discipline in a city or borough police force is vested by law in the Watch Committee, as police authority, and the decision in a disciplinary case rests with them. The decision to deal with this case as the Committee did was no doubt due to their desire to deal mercifully with an officer who had a record of 32 years' hitherto unblemished service, during which he had been four times commended for gallantry and had received the Royal Humane Society's medal. While I appreciate this feeling, it is, in my view, a principle of public importance that police officers guilty of criminal offences should be brought to trial before a court which, in making its adjudication, will, of course, take account of all the relevant considerations, including those which can be urged in favour of a merciful view.</p>

<p>The Minister without Portfolio is the War Cabinet Minister in general charge of the study of all reconstruction problems. Within the framework of that general study, the Minister of Works and Buildings has a special responsibility for seeing that all practicable preparations are made for the physical reconstruction of town and country after the war. The preparatory work over which my right hon. Friends have assumed direction affects the work of many existing Departments, and an appropriate organisation has been established to ensure that they receive full assistance from these Departments in their study of reconstruction problems.

<p>The only vegetable crop which war agricultural executive committees have been asked to order farmers and smallholders to grow is potatoes, and the greatly extended acreage to be obtained by these means is a vital part of the Government's food production policy. Substantially increased acreages of other vegetable crops, such as onions and carrots, are also to be secured from farmers and others as part of the same


policy, but it has not so far been considered desirable to issue orders to grow these crops. The contribution to the nation's food supply of vegetable crops grown in allotments and private gardens, although appreciable and of vital importance, is by no means sufficient for our needs, and certainly not of such a volume as to exclude the production on commercial holdings.</p>

<p>asked the Home Secretary whether, in view of the

special war-time need experienced in many districts of opportunities for recreation and amusement on Sundays, not only for members of the Fighting Forces but also for industrial workers, consideration has been given to the question of empowering local authorities in such districts to allow the Sunday opening of cinemas and theatres?</p>

<p>Yes, Sir. As a result of war conditions, special considerations arise, affecting not only members of the Fighting Services but also industrial workers, of whom many have little or no chance in present circumstances of going to places of amusement during the week, and many are living away from their homes and their friends and, therefore, are in special need of places to go to during their Sunday leisure. By Defence Regulation 42B, local authorities have already been empowered to adopt a simplified procedure for authorising the Sunday opening of cinemas in areas where large numbers of troops are concentrated; and it is proposed to amend the Regulation so as to give similar powers to local authorities in districts where the conditions in which industrial work is carried on create a similar need. Moreover, the war-time reasons for facilitating Sunday cinematograph entertainments apply equally to theatrical entertainments: and it seems right to give to local authorities in districts where these war-time reasons obtain the same discretion with regard to theatres and music halls as with regard to cinemas. Accordingly, the view of the Government is that a Defence Regulation should be made enabling licensing authorities, on the representation of the local authority in places where the presence of troops or changed industrial conditions create a special need, to authorise the opening of theatres and music halls. The condition will apply which already applies to cinemas, that all employ&#x00E9;s must be given one day's rest in seven, but it is not proposed to apply to theatres or music halls the condition that a proportion of the profits must be devoted to a charitable purpose. The Defence Regulation will contain a provision so dating its operation that the House may, if that be its desire, have an opportunity of debating the Regulation before it takes effect.</p>

The postal addresses of these three camps have been given publicity in the Press. There is, however, one small group of about 60 persons interned at Troyes, about whom I have made inquiries and am awaiting further information. Many of the British subjects who were interned have now been released. in general, they fall into the following categories: Children up to 16 years of age, mothers of children up to 16 years of age, women over 60 years of age, and ailing elderly men. There are now no restrictions as to where those who are released may live, with the exception of certain coastal areas. Consequently the majority of those persons released have returned to their former homes. I am expecting to receive in the very near future the names of those Who are at Besan&#x00E7;on and Drancy, and of those who have been released from those two camps. The names of the internees at St. Denis, who number some 1,700, are known, and their relatives in this country and elsewhere in His Majesty's Dominions, whose whereabouts are known, have been informed by the Foreign Office. Arrangements have now been made to provide the internees in France with small sums of money to purchase

necessaries, and the United States authorities have been authorised to incur expenditure on clothing and medical supplies.</p>

<p>On the First and Second Sitting Days we shall take the concluding-stages of the War Damage Bill. It will be necessary in any event to re-commit certain parts of the War Damage Bill in order to carry out some of the undertakings given by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer during the Committee stage. From conversations which have taken place, we understand that it will be to the convenience of hon. Members if the outstanding points on the Bill are discussed entirely on re-committal rather than some being taken in Committee and others on the Report stage. In order to meet the general convenience of the House, a Motion has been put down to re-commit the Bill as a whole. We shall, therefore, begin this stage on the First Sitting Day and bring it to a conclusion on the second day at a convenient hour which will allow sufficient time for a formal Report stage and the Third Reading.<br/>
On the Third Sitting Day we shall consider the House of Commons Disqualification (Temporary Provisions) Bill.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1941-02-20a.299.1" hansard_membership_id="4455" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/14943" speakername="Mr. Speaker" colnum="299" time="">
<p>Since I made my Statement to the House on 6th February about the procedure to be adopted in connection with the issue of writs in the room of Members presumed to have been killed on active service, I have, as I informed the House, received suggestions which have required and received careful consideration. I have had to delay my final statement in order to see to what extent it is possible to adapt my original proposals to these suggestions.<br/>
It has been suggested to me that it is desirable that the House should have a more direct responsibility for determining when a vacancy through presumption of death has arisen, and also that any scheme of procedure should be sufficiently comprehensive to include other cases of presumed death through enemy action as well as the case of Members presumed to have been killed on active service. I think these are valuable suggestions, and I have taken them into account in the procedure which I now suggest to the House.<br/>
For the purpose of determining the existence of vacancies through presumption of death, I propose to secure the assistance of a panel of advisers, consisting of Members representative of the various sections of opinion in the House. When the presumed death of a Member through any form of enemy action has been notified to me, I will, at my discretion, consult two members of this panel, and, if it is found necessary, inquire into the evidence on which the presumption of death is based. If satisfied, I will announce the presumed death of the Member to the House, according to my usual practice. I propose that a period of a week should then be allowed to elapse, during which it would be open to any Member of the House to address a request to me for further information. After the expiration of a week, it would be permissible to move a writ in the room of the Member presumed to be dead.<br/>
I have invited the following Members to serve on the proposed panel: The right hon. and gallant Gentleman the Member for Rye (Colonel Sir George Courthope); the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Antrim (Sir Hugh O'Neill); the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Platting (Mr. Clynes); the right hon. Gentleman the

Member for Keighley (Mr. Lees-Smith); and the right hon. Gentleman the Member for South-West Bethnal Green (Sir Percy Harris).</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."<br/>
I am not the parent of this Measure, although I am proud of it. The parent is my right hon. Friend the Minister of Health. I came to the House in 1922 with a vision before me of the great and shameful waste caused by flooding in the neighbourhood of my home. In my childhood I saw flood banks washed away, cattle drowned, and food destroyed. I saw this happen six times a year, and I saw repairs made at the public expense six times a year. Thousands of acres of first-class agricultural land raised nothing and were used only by seagulls and mosquitoes. No one proprietor of land could be blamed for this, and no one proprietor had the power to remedy it. There were 70 proprietors over a stretch of 12 miles. If one proprietor was able and willing to raise floodgates, his efforts could be rendered useless by some other proprietor further up the water. So, with a fatalism that almost brought agriculturists to despair, we had to acquiesce in this wastage of our national wealth. Then came 1930 and we got a land drainage Measure through this House covering a period of five years which, later on, was extended by two years. That Act, in so far as its cumbrous machinery has allowed it to

work, has succeeded well. Work has been completed on two schemes and in the case of a third, namely, the River Kelvin scheme, work is still in progress. Under that Act it took from six to nine months after a scheme had been decided upon to get operations started. First, we had to settle claims for compensation. We had to settle also claims in respect of betterment. We had to adjust disputes and if we could not adjust them, we had to go to arbitration. Finally, the scheme so adjusted or arbitrated, had to be laid for a month on the Table of this House and on the Table in another place.<br/>
Under the Measure which we ask the House to approve to-day, this long elaborate and delaying process has been eliminated. In the Bill we provide, first for consultation with the Agricultural Executive Committees. Then we propose to prepare the schemes. Many schemes are already prepared and ready for immediate operation when this Measure has been placed on the Statute Book. After a scheme has been prepared we propose to notify all owners and occupiers affected and give them a reasonable chance to make objections. Then we go ahead with the work. We allow them a further month to make claims for compensation for damage, and after two years &#x2014;long after the work has been completed &#x2014;if there should be any further claims for compensation, upon grounds that could not reasonably be foreseen in the initial stages, those claims will still have to be considered. We further provide that the Land Court, which is generally accepted in agricultural circles in Scotland as a fair, reasonable and expeditious tribunal, is to determine those cases. Where we cannot achieve a settlement by negotiation and agreement, disputes will be referred to the Land Court. We provide that all betterment achieved at the public expense shall be a charge on the proprietor. That charge may be made in a lump sum, or by an annual rate levied on the proprietor or proprietors, through the local authorities. Expenses over and above betterment are to be met by the State.<br/>
The reason for urgency here is obvious. Food production must be increased. We must have more expeditious procedure and the schemes which we have in mind to operate immediately are schemes by which


we calculate that the land affected will be in full production for the harvest of 1942. Our schemes will be limited only by the amount of labour that is available. In this connection I may say that I believe a considerable number of men who have hitherto been described as surplus to requirements in the coal industry, because of their age, would make admirable workmen on these schemes. They are accustomed to these and similar operations, and they are accustomed to working amidst damp. We have in mind immediate recourse to the Ministry of Labour to call to the aid of the Department of Agriculture for Scotland as many of these men as can be secured.<br/>
We propose to start at once six or seven schemes representing the renovation of some 12,000 acres in Scotland. The gross cost is estimated to be in the neighbourhood of &#x00A3;100,000, and after betterment has been recovered the net cost to the State we estimate will be &#x00A3;50,000. As a result of this work 12,000 acres of land now useless are expected to produce about 51,000 tons of food&#x2014;no mean achievement in these days. The schemes which we propose include the River Nith scheme, affecting a district where during the floods of 1931 eight acres of splendid agricultural land were completely washed away; where villages had been flooded and where water occasionally covers the land to a depth of four or five feet. There we propose to begin operations at once. Other schemes which we propose to undertake after consultation with the county agricultural committees&#x2014;and some of these consultations have already been held&#x2014;are as follow: The Lochar Water, in Dumfriesshire; the Mouse Water, in Lanarkshire; The Almond, in Mid and West Lothian; the upper section of the River Annan; the Goodie Water; the Lyne Water, in Peeblesshire; the River Eden, in Fife; two tributories of the Tay, the Isla and the Dean; and sundry small schemes.<br/>
Those are the aims and objects which the Measure is designed to achieve. It has been received favourably by persons who are qualified to speak for agriculture in Scotland. It meets an urgent necessity for food production and is, I submit, an economic Measure which will yield to the State beneficial results in many directions. Therefore, I commend it to the House.</p>

<p>I have been asked on behalf of some of my hon. Friends and colleagues on these benches to give a cordial welcome to this Bill, and I believe that in doing so I can speak, in the main, for hon. Members in all parts of the House. We recognise handsomely the part which was played in the preparation of this Measure by the former Secretary of State for Scotland, now Minister of Health. We must congratulate the new Secretary of State for Scotland both on his accession to office and on the very congenial task which was assigned to him to-day in moving the Second Reading of this Bill. When my hon. Friend spoke of his grandfatherly interest, it made me think that I was a grandfather as well, because I remember in early days reading many of his articles in the Press on this very subject. On this subject he has taken a life interest, both in public life and in administration throughout his career. I congratulate him on his accession to office, and on bringing forward the Second Reading of this Measure, which is so congenial to us all. He spoke of the effects of flooding in his own area, and anyone who lives in the West of Scotland and has seen the great damage resulting from the flooding of the Kelvin cannot but agree with the urgency of this proposal. Indeed, I have seen the results in many parts of the country to which he has referred. He made reference to the River Nith and the River Annan; in both these cases, I have seen serious damage, because it was my lot to live on the banks of the River Annan for six years in connection with my first ministry in Scotland.<br/>
So far as this Measure has been outlined, and is now in our hands, it commends itself to us; and the principle of betterment is again recognised. In a way, the Bill is a modest Measure, covering something like &#x00A3;100,000 and an acreage of 12,000. It is addressed to those parts of the country indicated, through the machinery provided by the agricultural executive committee; where any cases of difference may arise, the subject will be dealt with by the Land Court, which the Minister rightly said commands the general support of agriculturists and the people of Scotland. It provides that the most needy areas, and what is more important the most likely areas to yield production quickly, are to be taken up in the first instance.<br/>
I shall only mention one other matter, because I do not wish to go into details. What appeals to us is the note of urgency which the Minister has sounded, and which is embodied in the Bill. The cumbrous procedure of the Act of 1930, where operations were delayed not only by the procedure, but also because of the financial stringency of the time, which in some regards led to a hold-up of both the Land Drainage Act for England and the Land Drainage Act for Scotland, is swept away. Schemes for compensation and the like, instead of being allowed to hold up the Bill, are so arranged that at a certain stage, with due safeguards, the Secretary of State can step in and proceed with the work, although some of these claims are still outstanding, and will be settled later in the way provided. With these few words, I end as I began by giving a very cordial welcome to this Bill, and by congratulating the Secretary of State for Scotland, whom we are pleased to see in the office he now occupies. I have no doubt that he will bring forward other projects for the benefit of agriculture and food supplies in Scotland, and we wish him all success.</p>

<p>It would seem almost ungracious to the Secretary of State for Scotland if this small Bill were allowed to pass without a word of congratulation from this side of the House, and if the Government were not congratulated on having taken a step, however small, towards the restoration of what one might call the lost lands of Scotland. In the foreground of the agricultural picture, as I see it to-day, there are many thousands of acres of existing arable and grassland which are incapable of achieving maximum production because of the fact that they are insufficiently drained. In the background we have the colossal problem of restoring thousands of acres of waste land. These acres are partly immobilised, and in many cases wholly immobilised, to the extent that they are a pure waste and contributing nothing whatever to the national effort. There is a stretch of land in my own constituency, not very far from where I live, which could be and should be rich and fertile land, growing heavy crops. In that area there are probably between four and five thousand acres of land which could be and should be among

the most fertile land of Scotland. If this land had been drained before the war took place, I estimate that to-day we would have something like &#x00A3;60,000 worth of foodstuffs being produced from it. These derelict acres are a disgrace to the State, and, looking back over the wasted years, I, for one, marvel at the apathy of past Governments in their failure to face up to this problem. To-day we are paying the penalty for past neglect.<br/>
No one can say that, even under this Bill, where the total estimated expenditure is 100,000 and the estimated acreage involved is only 12,000, a real effort is being made towards the restoration of our lost lands. Take the county of Lanark. There are some 230,000 to 250,000 acres under crops and grass; probably one-quarter of that acreage requires drainage &#x2014;five times the total amount covered by this Bill. By and large, the term '' waste land "applies more to England than to Scotland, but even so, North of the Border, very large areas of agricultural land are incapable of maximum production because of inefficient drainage, and in spite of all the fertilisers in the world. The land is sour and therefore inefficiently drained.<br/>
When I first glanced over this Bill I got rather a thrill. It warmed my heart, because the Secretary of State is given very great powers. He was always a strong man, but he is made exceedingly strong by this Measure. I thought very probably I should find a snag a little lower down, and I found it. I welcome the powers given to the Secretary of State, because I believe that nothing should stand in the way of maximum production of food from the land, whether in peace or in war, and, if we are to get through this war successfully, it seems rather extraordinary that we should still be able to detect the clutching hand of the Treasury. The Secretary of State, in the Memorandum, is made a very strong man, with great powers, but a little lower down he is, to my mind, totally disarmed, nearly bound hand and foot, by the limitations imposed upon him. I do not believe that you can do anything really substantial with such a figure as &#x00A3;100,000 for the whole of Scotland, nor do I believe that &#x00A3;10 per acre, beyond which no scheme can be promoted, is anything like adequate. I cannot see anyone draining efficiently to-day on &#x00A3;10


an acre, and I speak with some experience. I have recently carried out an extensive drainage scheme on my own property, and I should like to give the House the figures. For one acre, drains 10 yards apart, labour, &#x00A3;9 0s. 1d.; 165 four-inch tiles at 225s. per 1,000, &#x00A3;1 18s. 9,d.; 1,225 three-inch tiles at 135s. per 1,000, &#x00A3;8 5s. 4d.; total, &#x00A3;19 4s. 2d. I should like to ask the Secretary of State whether he can do something to expedite the payment of claims. They are very slow in coming, and people who spend money expect to be paid in a reasonable time.<br/>
There is one little problem, which I do not think is always understood, that I should like to bring to the right hon. Gentleman's notice. If an owner is going to drain, at the high cost with which he is faced, he very often stops short when he thinks his costs must have a bearing upon rental. That is why many schemes fall fiat to-day. He does not want to spend &#x00A3;20 an acre, although he gets &#x00A3;10 back from the Government, because he feels that he may have to put the rent up. Then there is the great question of labour. There are practically no skilled drainers available at all to-day, and the Bill, to my mind, is quite useless unless the Government organise regional labour. I think the Scottish farmer has been quick to recognise the valuable assistance given him by the Government, and I think Scotland relatively is well drained and, for that matter, very well farmed. But 1 think now is the time for the Secretary of State to make a survey. He has his agricultural committees doing extraordinarily good work and performing a very great national service. If we had a survey of our waterlogged areas, we should be in a very strong position when we come to consider, in the light of postwar agricultural policy, what we are going to do with our wet land. I hope the Secretary of State will use his powers vigorously, and I hope there may still be time to reconsider the limitations imposed upon him.</p>

<p>I rise partly to congratulate the right hon. Gentleman on his accession to office. We realise the great energy which the late Secretary of State displayed during his brief term of office and his partial or whole responsibility for the Bill. But I should like to say how much some of us in Scotland

appreciate something else that has been done, and that is the appointment, for the first time, I believe, of a second Under-Secretary of State. I think this has been due for a long time. It has been clear for many years that, if the very large Departmental responsibilities are to be properly exercised, there is need for further assistance from the Ministerial angle in Scotland itself. On personal grounds may I say how glad I am to see this very powerful combination of the right hon. Gentleman, with his very great past experience, and the Under-Secretary and the previous Under-Secretary, with their very special knowledge of agriculture, of social services, and of education? Some of us hope that this will mean a fresh impetus to Scottish administration, which is badly needed. We have badly needed someone almost wholly concerned with education for many years. Equally there is so much reorganisation necessary which has been neglected for 20 years&#x2014;I say it advisedly&#x2014;in the Highlands and Lowlands that I hope the right hon. Gentleman will at last be able to give his whole time to Scottish affairs, even if he has to go on being Regional Commissioner as well.<br/>
I think the hon. Member who spoke last is under some misapprehension. I gathered that his drainage was due to flooded areas, of which I have some in my constituency, and I hoped that some money and assistance might be forthcoming in that area. The Secretary of State said there were some miners who might possibly be employed in this work. For many years I have had in my constituency a number of miners, aged 55 and over, who are about the saddest sight in Scotland. There was talk of pensions, but nothing has ever happened. They belonged to mines which have ceased to work in the last 20 years. The younger members of the community have been translated to the areas where mining is moving a little further South, in Ayrshire, but the rest remain behind in these desolate areas. I believe that those men were among the few thousand for whom the Minister of Labour could not find work. It may be that for the first time some of them can be given work in a job which is not very different from some of their previous employment, especially as most miners have one foot in the mine and one on the land.</p>

<p>I do not think anything could better justify our Coalition than the introduction of this splendid Bill. There is nothing more important than the revivifying of our Scottish countryside, and the production of food is almost equally important. I hope the Bill will do something along those lines. As a child I knew quite well a certain area in Peeblesshire which was admirable wheat land but is now derelict bog. I understand that one of the schemes proposed will benefit that particular area. I hope to see that district brought back to cultivation, growing wheat again and increasing the population of that district which is so badly wanted. I do not think this Bill can be considered as more than a hopeful and satisfactory beginning. I ask for a survey of the whole of Scotland, so that landowners maybe advised what is the best use to which their property can be put, whether for forestry, agriculture, pasture or arable, so that Scotland may be brought back to that splendid, vigorous, country life which has been its great strength. We realise that in no country in the world do the peasants to such an extent go to universities and take a prominent part in the affairs of the nation, particularly, perhaps, in the ministry of the Church of Scotland. This Bill, by reviving the Scottish countryside, is therefore one of the most satisfactory that has been introduced for a long time. I hope that it is but a small beginning and that we shall find every acre of Scotland carefully surveyed, so that it may be put to the best use of which it is capable.</p>

<p>This is a Bill which gives power to the Secretary of State to carry out certain public works with money that is directly provided by the Exchequer and with labour that is directly employed by the Department of Agriculture. No objection has been raised to the granting of this power to the Secretary of State, and the only point for discussion is the means and the expedition with which the work can be carried out. I think that my hon. Friend the Member for West Perth (Mr. Snadden) has not quite understood the nature of the public works that are proposed under the Bill. It is entirely confined to arterial drainage. My hon. Friend was clearly thinking of field drainage over a wide area.</p>

<p>The Bill refers to agricultural land capable of improvement, and I thought that if the work could not be done by an owner under the existing Government scheme, the Government would have power to do it for him under this Bill.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1941-02-20a.328.1" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. Wedderburn" colnum="328" time="">
<p>I would remind my hon. Friend that a 50 per cent. grant is available for field drainage, but the works contemplated under this Bill are the lowering of river beds and the treatment of catchment areas in such a way as to enable land which is now uncultivable by flooding or by the water in the land to be brought under cultivation. That is the sole purpose of the Measure. I am glad to hear the remarks of those hon. Members who have described this as a hopeful and satisfactory beginning and who have asked us to do a great deal more. I would only remind them of the importance of the time factor. In order to carry out schemes of this kind, as the hon. Member for Bilston (Mr. Hannah) suggested, surveys are necessary. Surveys have been taken for the purpose of 10 fairly large schemes which it is proposed to complete, we hope, this year, when the Bill is passed. The estimated cost is &#x00A3;100,000, and that is the basis of the figure contained in the explanatory Memorandum. The House will recognise that in order to carry out the work on a wider scale it is necessary to have further surveys and to get good engineering opinion about the prospects.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for West Perth described the difficulty of obtaining a large supply of labour. That is obviously another limiting factor at the present moment. Other limiting factors are the amount of machinery which can be spared from our general war effort and the necessary preliminary surveys. The prime purpose of the Bill is to increase our food supply next year and the year after. That is why we have given the figures which appear to limit the scope of the Bill. They are, however, based on what has already been planned, and which, we have good reason to think, it will be practicable to carry out in the spring and summer of 1941. That is the sole reason for the limitations that have been criticised by hon. Members. If it be found possible to extend the scope of the principle that underlies the Bill, no one will be better pleased than my right hon. Friend. I would like to thank all hon. Members who have


spoken for the very helpful and kind response which they have given to the Bill, which we hope will strengthen our resources in war and, on a long view, increase our prosperity in peace.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That this Bill be now read a Second time."<br/>
This is one of the few occasions on which the Foreign Office has been responsible for a Bill in Parliament. The object of the Bill is to confer certain immunities and privileges upon members of foreign Governments and envoys accredited to Allied Powers. We have in London at the present time a miniature Europe. We wish, consequently, to adjust the law of our country in order to meet the international character of our capital. I feel confident that the House will wish to honour these Allied Governments by giving to them the independent and dignified status to which their position and Sovereign powers entitle them. We shall be all the more inclined to take this step by reason of

the courage and policies of these administrations, which are in every respect worthy of their traditions. The House has already passed the Allied Forces Act, which confers on the Governments concerned power over their own nationals in respect of those forces which are so gallantly massed on our shores. We have already had many occasions to admire the heroic exploits which the Allied Forces have performed in defence of our own shores. We have also reason to be grateful for the material contribution which they are making to our common war effort. I refer in particular to the great assistance we have derived from the co-operation of the Colonial Empires of the Netherlands, of Belgium and of Free France. We are fighting not only for the freedom of individual conscience but for the free rights of peoples and the free functioning of government. Our cause is greatly strengthened by the example of these gallant Allied Governments, who, though forced to live in exile, are continuing to discharge their legitimate functions thus rendering London the focus of the resistance of a free Europe.<br/>
By conferring the privileges suggested in this Bill, I trust we shall make this country a real home of freedom for these determined representatives of national resistance. It is important that they should not live here as strangers in our midst, but should be assured of the status and privileges of their situation. Such privileges were accorded to the Government of Belgium during the last war by the French Government; while in this war, before the fall of France, privileges similar to those suggested here were afforded by France to the Poles. The representatives of a foreign Power accredited to the Court of St. James enjoy certain privileges in this country. These are, notably, freedom from local jurisdiction, the special protection of residence, and certain fiscal advantages. The legal position of the sovereigns or heads of States is covered by international law and recognised in our own courts, but the individual members of Allied Governments and their official staffs are not so covered.<br/>
If hon. Members will turn to Clause 1 of the Bill, they will see that it proposes to confer a position corresponding to that


of members of the Diplomatic Corps upon the members and senior officials of the Allied Governments of Poland, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and the provisional Czecho-Slovak Government. The privileges and immunities will also be conferred on the leaders and senior officials of the Free French movement established in this country. No doubt there will be general agreement that the Ministers of Allied Government and leaders of national movements should enjoy a status not less favourable than the diplomatic representatives accredited to the Court of St. James. As regards the official staffs of these Governments the House will no doubt, wish to know upon whom it is proposed to confer immunities and privileges. It has been decided that the names of the individuals falling within our definition shall be included in a list to be published in the "London Gazette." His Majesty's Government and the Allied Governments will agree upon the names that are to appear in this list.<br/>
Turning to Clause 2, the House will see that this treats of the position of diplomats accredited to Allied Governments at present in our country. Allied Governments at present here have in most cases diplomats of other Powers accredited to them. It is suggested that protection corresponding to that afforded to diplomatic envoys accredited to the Court of St. James should be granted to those representatives. With these explanations, and taking into account the sentiments of my opening remarks, I trust that the House will give a Second Reading to this Bill and will rejoice in doing so. My right hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General will be very glad to answer any points which may arise.</p>

<p>I have not studied this Bill, and I should like an explanation on this one point. It will be within the memory of the Solicitor-General that long ago the Chinese Empire, which was represented here, took advantage of their immunities to imprison Sun Yat Sen, and he was very nearly deported and executed. We cannot stop that happening under ordinary circumstances, but we ought to be very careful in connection, particularly, with the Polish Government here. We have

had a lot of people who are not Polish citizens and who are not members of the Polish Army imprisoned. We do not want that to occur again. We do not want to turn the grant of immunities into a right of having a private prison here in London. I have no doubt that that point has been looked into and will be borne in mind, but it would be detrimental to our principles in this country if through this Bill we provided opportunities for police action which are not strictly in accordance with our own practices.</p>

<p>I am fully in sympathy with the object of this Bill. It seems to me only proper and right that our Allies who are in this country&#x2014;temporarily and we hope not for long, before they are restored to their own countries&#x2014;should be surrounded with every atmosphere of dignity that we can possibly give them, and diplomatic immunity is certainly one of them. I think we are at times rather too much inclined to say that we are fighting this war alone. Naturally, that is not a remark that goes down well with the splendid Allies who are rendering us very great services under most difficult circumstances, and this is one of the occasions which enable us to emphasise the point that we are not alone, that we have some very good friends, and are going to give them the recognition to which they are entitled in this country.<br/>
There is one point upon which I want to be clear. My right hon. Friend mentioned the names of various countries that come under the Bill. I want to be clear about the position of another Ally, Abyssinia. A statement was recently made that the Emperor Haile Selassie has returned to his dominions. The Bill speaks of "Governments established in the United Kingdom." I do not know whether that means that the Governments must be situated here. That is not the case in regard to the Abyssinian Government, who, I take it, are now in their own country. I want to be clear whether under this Bill or under the existing law full recognition can be given, to our gallant Ally at any time it may be demanded and thought appropriate, to that Ally who after some very troublous years and painful history looks like coming into its own again. It is possible that in the future, as events develop, there may be set up some kind of provisional Government in


Albania such as does not exist at the present time. I should like to ask whether in the event of that taking place it will be possible for them to have recognition. Those are the points on which I should like to have assurances from the Solicitor-General, and I would ask him to explain the position.</p>

<p>Before the right hon. and learned Gentleman replies, I would like to put a further point. Some years ago I had occasion to raise a Debate on this subject, and it gave rise to some very interesting discussion and information. I raised it on the question of civil liabilities incurred by a person entitled to diplomatic privileges, after he had committed an act of negligence in driving a motor-car.<br/>
While everybody will agree with the main purpose of the Bill, we still leave in an atmosphere of doubt and uncertainty what are diplomatic immunities, privileges and customs. While this may or may not be the appropriate time to go into that matter, some consideration ought to be given to it, because it gives rise to a very great deal of feeling if persons entitled to diplomatic immunity rely upon that immunity to escape their ordinary civil obligations. This has been done in the past. Therefore, I hope that the Foreign Office will make an attempt, as soon as the appropriate occasion offers, to give us a definite statement as to what are the customs in diplomatic immunity.</p>

<p>We certainly cannot complain of the reception which the Bill has had. Obviously it is designed as a matter of courtesy to the people whom we desire to shelter and because we recognise the very real help we are getting from them. It shows how fortunate we feel ourselves in having them as our Allies during this war. As the hon. Member opposite stated, it is wrong to think that we are fighting the war alone. The House has been, as ever, critical, and rightly so, of the proposal that is put before it, and I propose briefly to reply to the observations that have been made in the course of the Debate.<br/>
We have been reminded by the right hon. Gentleman opposite of the history of the Chinese Legation over here. He will perhaps know that since that incident took place corresponding incidents have

taken place in various foreign countries. The law relating to diplomatic immunity has been considerably clarified by those events. I should say now, without hesitation, that, by international law, not merely the municipal law but the law which is recognised as prevailing throughout all civilised countries, immunity which is now extended to a diplomat does not entitle that diplomat to retain or imprison at his will any person whatever, whether a national of the country to which he is accredited or a national of his own country. I think that is now plainly established and stated as having been established by all the world-recognised books on international law. I therefore feel no hesitation in giving to the right hon. Gentleman the assurance for which he asked.<br/>
I was asked about Abyssinia's position. A statement was made by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs not long ago regarding the exact position which we have adopted in regard to Abyssinia. We all recognise the splendid work which the Abyssinian patriots are now doing. The Abyssinian Government are established in Abyssinia, of course, and not over here. I hope that they will very shortly be established at Addis Ababa. Consequently the whole question of the Abyssinian Government does not some within the scope of the Bill. At the same time, it is open to our Government, following well-known principles of ordinary international law, to recognise any Government and to accord to that Government full status, both <i>de facto</i> and <i>de jure,</i> but that does not come within the scope of the Bill, which is designed merely to deal with the Governments which are established in this country.<br/>
With regard to civil liability, nothing has impressed me more than the fact that this question so seldom arises. It is a commonplace that people are very apt to regard debts of honour, that is to say, debts which are not payable in law, as the type of debt which they always make a point of paying first. When I have investigated the estates of bankrupts, as I sometimes have to do, I have found that they have almost always dissipated their assets to some extent, in the first place, in paying those debts of honour which are not legally binding. It is undoubtedly a fact, so far as civil debts which are owed by diplomats here or the


civil liabilities under which they come are concerned, that they have been almost always discharged without difficulty. If difficulty ever arises, it can always be taken up by the Foreign Office with the head of the Commission over here, and the difficulty is almost always got rid of.<br/>
Of course, diplomatic status and diplomatic immunity, which, it must be remembered, is the immunity of the envoy himself&#x2014;the retinue merely have a derivative immunity&#x2014;are absolute, so long as the person concerned is on the list. In the Bill, we have adopted the very convenient course of proposing that the list shall be published in the three "Gazettes." That means that everybody will be certain and clear as to who is and who is not entitled to the immunity. After these observations, I hope that the House will now give us our Second Reading. If any further points arise, they can be considered in the Committee stage.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."<br/>
This is a small Measure, which deals with the financial review that was expected to take place between the Government and the local authorities, as to expenditure on Civil Defence. Section 10 of the Air-Raid Precautions Act, 1937, provides that the Secretary of State, whose functions have since been transferred in this respect to the Minister of Home Security should,<br/>
<q>before the expiration of a period of three years from the passing of this Act"&#x2014;</q>
which was on 22nd December, 1937&#x2014;<br/>
<q>in consultation with such associations of local authorities as appear to him to be concerned and with any local authority with whom consultation appears to him to be desirable, cause an investigation to be made into the working of the financial provisions of this Act

with particular reference to the expense failing to be born by local rates.</q>
A report of the result of the investigation has, under the Section, to be laid before Parliament. It was genuinely intended by my predecessor, now the Lord President of the Council, that that financial review should take place, and, for all I knew, I should have been leading the local authorities in those financial negotiations. But when the time arrived the "Blitz" occurred, with the result that it would have been inconvenient both to the local authorities and to the State that that full financial review should take place. I met the local authorities and discussed with them a number of points which they wished to raise apart from the big financial review, and certain of those discussions are still proceeding. The local authorities agreed with me that it would be impracticable to comply with the terms of Section 10 and that as soon as possible we should go on with that financial review, but that in the meantime I should ask Parliament to be good enough to postpone the operation of that Section. Consequently, this Bill provides that the financial investigation, which will involve the collection of a good deal of detail, should be further postponed. We expect to complete that investigation within the next 12 months, and indeed, it is hoped to proceed with it as opportunity occurs. We would like to get it completed well before that period if it is possible but it must depend upon the physical conditions under which we are all working. The Bill is agreed to by the local authorities, and I am sure that it will commend itself to the general feeling of the House.</p>

<p>No one wishes to detain my right hon. Friend from securing the Second Reading of this small Measure, but I wish to make one general comment. I am a little concerned at the shortness of the view taken by those responsible for deciding on the period for which the Bill shall be in operation. For example, we had the War Damage Bill, which gives cover only until the end of August; we had the Prolongation of Parliament Bill, which gives a small extension; and now we have this Bill, which gives an extension for only one year, an extension long enough to enable my right hon. Friend to say that he expects to get the financial investigations completed. Nobody can foretell the diffi-


culties which will fall upon us during the next 12 months, and I hope that in applying their minds to the term for which these Bills shall be extended, my right hon.Friend and any other Ministers who will be concerned will take into consideration the fact that perhaps a longer period would save the House of Commons much trouble during the next 12 months or two years. I do not think it would be going too far to suggest a period of two years. However, if my right hon. Friend is satisfied with one year, I know that the House will be content.</p>
