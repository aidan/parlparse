<p>I understand that there is no general shortage of junior navigating officers in the British Mercantile Marino at the present time, but that there is still a shortage of engineer officers. The system under which engineers are examined by the Board of Trade for certificates of competency has recently been the subject of a comprehensive inquiry by a Departmental Committee. That committee, whose report was published on 3rd January and is now being very carefully considered, has recommended a number of changes in the system, but they stated that the present overall standard of the examination is appropriate and should be maintained.</p>

<p>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.

<p>During the last three months two licences have been issued for the export of war material to Japan. No applications for similar licences are at present under consideration. As has been previously explained in this House, His Majesty's Government consider that it is contrary to the public interest to publish particulars of licences issued for the export of arms and ammunition to particular destinations. I may add, however, that the value of exports of arms, ammunition and naval and military stores to Japan during the three months ended 31st January, 1938, was &#x00A3;36,314.</p>

<p>The position is this: I asked for representations from organisations that thought they might be affected, and I received information from a large number of them.

<p>The answer to the first part of the question is in the negative. With regard to the remainder of the question, two United Kingdom patents have been granted during the past 15 years to the Kabushiki Kaisha Nihon Seiko-Sho Company. These patents are still in force, but no information is available as to whether they are being worked in this country, nor does the Register of Patents contain any entry recording any dealings therein by means of licences or otherwise.

<p>I am informed that Mr. Buchan applied to the Herring Industry Board on 30th March, 1936, for a loan for re-conditioning his boat under a scheme published on 5th March, 1936, which provided that no loan would be


granted in excess of &#x00A3;375, but that no promise of a loan was made to Mr. Buchan. On 1st May, 1936, the board's surveyor, after an inspection in accordance with the scheme, reported that the cost of re-conditioning would be at least &#x00A3;728, and on 4th May Mr. Buchan was informed that a loan could not be granted as the cost was so much in excess of the maximum of &#x00A3;375. The estimate of &#x00A3;251 referred to in the question was, I understand, obtained by Mr. Buchan in February, 1936, before he applied for a loan.

<p>It is not anticipated that there will be on the whole any loss of income Tax at the standard rate, or of Death Duties, as a result of the unification of royalties. As regards Sur-tax, my hon, and gallant Friend is aware that the produce of the tax is not earmarked in relation to particular sources of income, and moreover the effect in this respect of unification must depend upon the nature of the investment made by the compen-

<p>asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether his attention has been drawn to the serious objections in the national interest to the levying of Death Duties in a lump sum on the death of a taxpayer, especially in the case of agricultural estates; and whether he will appoint a representative committee to consider and report as to the loss, if any, likely to be occasioned to the revenue in the event of taxpayers being allowed to take out insurances in the name of the Chancellor of the Exchequer for the estimated amount of Estate Duty payable on their estate on death, such insurances not to be included in such estate except in so far as any such insurance might be in excess of the sum required to meet Death Duties; or, in the alternative, as to any loss to the Exchequer by taxpayers being permitted to make annual payments to the Chancellor of the Exchequer during lifetime to be accumulated with interest in respect of duties payable on death, such accumulations to the extent of the duty not to be included in the deceased's estate?</p>

<p>The estimation of the cost to the Exchequer of any proposal for relief from taxation is essentially a budgetary matter that must rest with the Chancellor of the Exchequer of the day, who has the resources of the Revenue Departments at his command for the purpose. The particular form of relief to which the question refers, namely relief from Estate Duty in respect of life assurance moneys&#x2014;a relief which I may observe would be general in character


and would necessarily cover a much wider field than the particular case of agricultural land&#x2014;is in fact a form of relief that has been frequently discussed in Finance Bill debates of recent years, in the course of which estimates of cost have been furnished. My predecessors in office have consistently rejected proposals of this kind as being unsound in principle and too costly to the Exchequer.</p>

<p>Is my right hon. Friend aware that the estimates given by the Treasury in Finance Bill debates have been very varying amounts? Does he not think that, having regard to the great importance of this matter, it would be desirable to have an independent committee of inquiry in order to take evidence as to the various schemes that are suggested and which those who suggest them consider would not involve the Treasury in a loss, especially as the Income Tax rebate would not apply to them?</p>

<p>My hon.

<p>Arising out of the answer, and in view of the statement made by the Prime Minister yesterday that he would receive a deputation from ex-service men, is it not desirable that the Chancellor should receive a deputation from old age pensioners, in view of the very serious difficulties confronting them at the present time?</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That the Clause be read a Second time."<br/>
This proposed new Clause is put forward in connection with the Registration Act passed last summer. The object of that Act was to allow owners of this kind of property to start the preliminary steps of registration, but, as I said at the time, there was no objective stated. Now there is a definite objective under the Bill which we are discussing, and that is that registration is the first step towards valuation, valuation leading eventually to compensation and the property passing. The experience we have had so far is that, from the point of view of valuation, there might be, within a strict interpretation of the Registration Act, a great deal of information which would have to be registered but which would really be unnecessary in order to be able to form a proper valuation. The sort of instance I have in mind is one in which an estate has been cut up into a great number of parcels of land, all of them with the same sort of deeds. It seems hardly necessary that every single document should be registered, because that would entail a great deal of work and expense, if it is clear that the absence of some of those details will not really affect the position from a valuation point of view. In those cases it might be quite enough, when the valuer came to do his work, to take general evidence, and if such cases should arise a person will be deemed to have complied with the provisions of the previous Act by not giving all the information which is there required. If he takes advantage of that he will be indemnified against possible complaint because he has not supplied everything, and therefore has fallen into error. It is a Clause to the advantage of everyone concerned.</p>

<p>I rise only to ask the Minister whether he is satisfied that


in accordance with the new Clause the Commission will have the whole of the information that is necessary. From the reading of Sub-section (1) it seems possible that a good deal of material information may be missing, and that information, I understand, will be information which will be material to assessing the value of the particular interest by the regional valuation committee. Presumably the Commission will want to have before them the whole of the materials that would be before these regional valuation committees. I am not clear that Sub-section (1) will give that access, through the registration, to the whole of that material. The Sub-section says:
<q>complete information thereof would include information of no material importance for valuation purposes as to rights annexed to coal or a mine that affect adversely numerous small parcels of land, or would include any other information of no material importance for valuation purposes, he shall be deemed to have complied with the requirements of that Act as to the information to be given with respect to that matter if he gives with respect thereto such information as the Commission indicate to be in their opinion of material importance for valuation purposes, notwithstanding that the information does not extend to all the circumstances of the holding relevant to that matter.</q>
If some of these ancillary rights are to be acquired and the Commission are to be able to estimate what the value of those ancillary rights is, they will obviously want to know, whether small or large parcels of land are affected, what their incidence is. I should have thought that, prima facie, they would have wanted the fullest possible information as to the whole of the effect of these rights before they could come to a decision as to whether they would acquire them. We are anxious that there should not be any limitation which would make it impossible for the Commission to have at their disposal the fullest material in order that they can arrive at a judgment as to whether they can exercise their rights. Will the Minister give us an assurance that between now and the next stage he will look into the matter from the point of view of the Commission?</p>

<p>I want to refer to something quite different, and that is to slovenly ways in legislation. There is passed a Statute, the Registration Act. It is then found that there may be circumstances in which it is inconvenient to apply that Act rigidly and completely. The proper thing to do there, as a matter of clean and tidy legislation, is to amend the Act. But the draftsman does not want to do that; he wants to put in another Act a provision that if you do not obey the other Act you shall be deemed to have obeyed the other Act. I am one of those who have to face this sort of thing day by day in the Courts. At least I ask from the Minister a promise that he will not do it again.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That the Clause be read a Second time."<br/>
On the face of it this new Clause is concerned with the question of the liberty of owners of mines or royalties to make new sinkings in the period which elapses between the passing of this Bill and the taking over of the royalties by the Commission. It purports to lay down certain provisions which shall apply in the event of an owner not being able to get permission to sink a pit which he would otherwise have done during that intervening period. We are not wedded to the


precise terms of the Clause, if there are more convenient words in which to frame it, but we are very anxious to raise the question of what the Commission is going to do by way of planning the coal resources of the country. Obviously if the Commission is going to utilise its ownership of the royalties in order to try to bring some orderliness into the production of coal, it is essential that at the earliest possible moment it should get the most complete control over the question of the opening of new mines and pits; otherwise it may be that for the purpose of getting better compensation, for the purpose of an owner putting himself into the position of being able to obtain a compulsory lease from the Commission as the owner of the royalty of a mine, in various districts steps might be taken, even before or immediately after the passage of this Bill, to open up new mines which would alter the relationship between coal production in the various districts and between the various districts.<br/>
I am aware of the various provisions with regard to quotas and so on which have their influence on the position, but they do not in any way prevent owners from opening mines now. It would be entirely wrong, when you are contemplating a new system of the ownership of minerals, a new system for the granting of leases, if in the intervening period, after full notice has been given that that system is to come into operation, individual owners, from the point of view of improving their own position for the future, should be able to take action and spend large sums of money which would be contrary to the plans which the Commission itself would have when it came into the full ownership of the minerals. Once the Commission gets control of the royalties it will be for the Commission to say whether in any particular instance a new mine or pit is to be sunk. I imagine that that is one of the methods the Commission will use for planning the coal production of the country. That is one of the main objectives of this so-called unification of royalties, or nationalisation as we call it.<br/>
Unless there is some such provision as this in the Bill it seems to me that we shall be laying the Commission open to very grave embarrassment, and we shall be tending to defeat the very object which we all presumably have in mind in the

unification of royalties. We are anxious to find out from the Minister what his views are both as regards this specific question of planning and also as regards the wider question of how the Commission are going to use their powers to try to bring order into the production of coal. It might be that a proposal would be made to stop such a thing as the development of the Kent coalfield while there was plenty of capacity for production in other parts of the country, or it might be that a completely new coalfield could be developed before the Commission came into power. Such a coalfield could be started and then it would be necessary to go right through with it. Once a mine is started you cannot stop it economically; once the capital is put up in an area where it is said that up to the present coal has not been fully proved, people may say that for the purpose of compensation they prefer to put down a pit. They are perfectly entitled to do it, and they may think that by that method they would get a much larger share of the &#x00A3;66,000,000.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1938-02-08a.888.1" colnum="888" time="">
<p>The Clause is a common-sense proposal, and after the exposition of my hon. and learned Friend it would be sheer waste of time for me to speak at any length upon it. We know how often there have been attempts to develop a coalfield as a result of which someone has to be compensated.</p>

<p>I hope the Minister will not accept this new Clause, and for two reasons. The hon. and learned Gentleman who moved the Second Reading ended by saying that if anyone sank a pit now he would be doing it merely to get some of the &#x00A3;66,000,000. I can assure him that no one will sink a pit, with all the costs involved, in order to prove a claim greater than is justified to a share of that &#x00A3;66,000,000. This is really an extreme Socialistic Clause. It may be that the hon. and learned Gentleman wishes to have this power in the Bill. It may come some day and this may be a step towards it, but as matters stand I cannot see how you can say that anyone is not to sink a new pit who has a lease of the coal now and that merely because you pass a Bill providing that the royalties are to be unified you are to be able to say that you will stop the whole industry progressing.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Berwick-on-Tweed (Sir H. Seely) has failed to appreciate what we have in mind here. Apart from this new Clause it would be possible for a colliery company, in conjunction with certain owners, at once to start boring operations, and when they had discovered any coal in an area they could cut the sod and start sinking a shaft. I rose to get an explanation from my hon. and learned Friend why Wales is not mentioned in this proposed new Clause, and whether it would not be possible to delete the words relating to England and Scotland and leave things as they are in that regard.</p>

<p>Before I answer the hon. and learned Gentleman and give a detailed explanation upon the point which he raised, may I just say that I cannot advise the Committee to accept this Clause? In one phrase the hon. and learned Gentleman said that it was desirable that the Commission should get control at the earliest possible date of all these matters regarding the property of which it will be the owner. The earliest possible date is that at which the property will actually vest in the Commission, in 1942. I understood the hon. and learned Gentleman's point to be that somebody might now, for the purpose of getting more compensation, put down a plant, prove the existence of coal and sink a pit. I do not think I am misrepresenting him. All I can say is that the Clause deals only with what happens after the passing of the Act. The property is to be valued on the valuation date, which is 1st January, 1939. From such knowledge of the industry as I have, it seems to me quite impracticable to start the process of getting leases, boring and proving coal and then sinking a shaft. It could not affect the valuation at 1st January, 1939.<br/>
Perhaps that was not really the point to which he wanted to direct our attention. His point is that, by and large, the Commission will be owner of this coal, and that it is therefore desirable that the Commission should have in its mind a sort of general planning for the future. He asked me to say whether I could tell him how the Commission would use its powers in the future in this matter, but I am afraid that until the Commission exists

no one can get an answer to that question. The Commission will, of course, be bound by what we have already passed in the Bill, that they shall, under Clause 2, deal with their property,
<q>in such manner consistently with the provisions of this Act as they think best for promoting the interests, efficiency, and better organisation of the coal-mining industry.</q>
The Commission is bound, under Clause 2&#x2014;it is so long since we were on that Clause that some of us may have forgotten it&#x2014;to pay attention to any general directions given by the Minister in the national interest. I cannot answer, therefore, as to what may or may not be the intentions of the Commission.<br/>
The reason why a proposal of this kind, obviously, cannot be accepted, is that the Committee have accepted the arrangement of the Bill, which is that between the passage of the Bill and the final vesting date, the present owners of the property remain in the enjoyment thereof, and that it would therefore be contrary to what we have already passed if we inserted something of this kind now. The broad principle remains that after the valuation date, as long as they do not do anything to deteriorate the property under Clause 9, which I am sure hon. Members will remember, there is nothing in the Bill to prevent them from improving the property. I should think that improvements were desirable. The principle is that until the property actually passes to the Commission, the Commission has no <i>locus standi</i> in the matter.<br/>
It is fanciful to imagine that in the short period before the vesting date&#x2014;it is short compared to the length of time that this property is to be in the hands of the new owners&#x2014;we are in the least likely to see the development of entirely new coalfields about which nobody knows anything now. The hon. and learned Gentleman referred to the opening up of the Kent coalfield, but that has a history of many years, and it has not yet gone very far. To imagine that some sort of startling development of that kind is likely to occur before 1942, to the detriment of the Commission later on, is a little wide of the mark. A suggestion of that kind is out of line with the policy which the Committee have already adopted in the Clauses which we have passed. While I much sympathise with the hon. and learned Gentleman's point


of view&#x2014;it is expressed in a Clause in the Bill which we discussed last Friday that control should pass this year, and is not in this Bill&#x2014;it is not possible for me to accept the Clause, and I hope that the Committee will resist it.</p>

<p>The purpose of the new Clause which has been proposed is to find out what sort of powers the Commission will have under the Bill and under the explanation which the Secretary for Mines has given. I understand that, under the Bill, existing leases will be taken over by the Commission on the vesting date in about four years' time, and that they have no power to vary those leases. There will, therefore, be one limitation already in force upon the Commission in regard to existing leases. If an arrangement has been made with any landlord by which a colliery owner can sink pits and establish new collieries, that power will remain in the hands of the colliery owner under the lease, and it will not be within the power of the Commission to refuse to agree to a development of that kind. To do so would be a violation of the existing lease.<br/>
I want to know whether I have the approval of the Secretary for Mines thus far. If it is apparent that under existing leases a colliery owner has already entered into an arrangement by which he can sink new collieries as and when it suits him so to do, that power will still be in the hands of the coalowner after the vesting date. Are we clear about that? May we have the hon. and gallant Gentleman's reply?</p>

<p>I thought that was so, but in order that we may all be clear about what we are doing, that admission was necessary. If that be so, and the Commission are bound by the character of existing leases, there is nothing in the Bill at the moment to prevent colliery companies from varying in the meantime leases that do not contain that power at present. Have I the hon. and gallant Gentleman's approval to that point? In this interim period, if a colliery owner, anticipating the powers to be conferred

upon, the Commission, does not possess leases which give him that right, there is nothing in the Bill to prevent him from varying those leases so that when the Commission inherits those leases in four years' time, it will inherit leases with all those conditions attached. Have I the approval of the hon. and gallant Gentleman to that statement? If that be the case, I would like to know from the hon. and gallant Gentleman what powers the Commission would have to control the development of existing coalfields. The effective control will be in the hands of the colliery owners, because it will be a part of the leases which the Commissioners will have taken over that the colliery owners are able to sink new collieries if and when they like, extending over the coal of which they have the lease.<br/>
We are referred to a previous part of the Bill, and are told it is one of the main advantages of unification of royalties that the Commission will have the direction and orderly development of coalfields, but it is apparent that the Bill strips the Commission of the power to do so. Does the hon. and gallant Gentleman agree with what I say? If he does, I would like him to tell the Committee what will be the power vested in the Commission to control the development of the coalfields, because such control will depend upon the leases.</p>

<p>I bow to your Ruling, Sir Dennis, but I was taking up a matter referred to by the hon. Member for Berwick-on-Tweed (Sir H. Seely), who referred to what he described as the extensive powers for which we were asking. I admit that they are extensive, but I submit that they are necessary. In the four-and-a-half years between now and the vesting date, these powers would give the Commission at least the right to authorise or deny the opening up of new collieries. In so far as the proposed new Clause would do that, it would vary that part of the Bill where, in the interim period, the Commission can vary existing leases. After that date has been reached, the part of the Bill which prevents the Commission from interfering with existing


leases would, I admit, resume its power, but in the meantime very important influences may be brought to bear upon the coal industry. That is why I think that the powers we are asking are too limited and ought to be more extensive. Our schemes for the coal industry are more ambitious than those of the hon. and gallant Gentleman, and we ask for this power for four-and-a-half years.<br/>
We were told on the Second Reading of the Bill that one of the principal claims made for the unification of mining royalties was that the ownership of those royalties in one pair of hands and one centre of authority would, by virtue of the ownership itself, enable the owner, the State, to impose orderly development upon an industry which is universally admitted to have developed in an anarchic and anti-social way. Now we are told by the Secretary for Mines that there is nothing in the Bill which will not enable the existing owners of coal to strip the unification of mining royalties from any of its significance in that regard. I assume that, if that is so, it is very questionable indeed whether the House of Commons ought to waste its time in unifying mining royalties. The financial aspects of the matter have not commended themselves to us, and now the organisation itself is rendered nugatory because of the powers vested in the leaseholders.<br/>
It is sheer nonsense for the hon. and gallant Gentleman to say that in the meantime, in the years which intervene between now and the vesting date, nothing important can happen. Only the extraordinary tradition in this country which lays it down that no Minister shall take up any office except it be one in regard to which he has an entire ignorance would have allowed him to make a statement of that sort. I do not blame the hon. and gallant Gentleman, but it is the misfortune of this Committee that it has to put up with that fact. You can go a very long way towards sinking a pit in three or four years; you can sink quite a formidable pit in that time, and it might easily pay an existing owner, if he could not get his landlord to vary his lease, to sink a shaft. I understand the desire of the hon. Member for Berwick-on-Tweed that he should not interfere with his liberty in this matter, but it is the contention of the Chancellor of the Exchequer that one of the virtues of this Bill is that it interferes with the

liberty of private economic adventurers like the hon. Baronet. We were informed that it is just because of hon. Members like himself exercising the rights that they have that the industry has been brought into its present anarchic state, so that the hon. Gentleman is rebuked by his own Government. It therefore hardly lies in his mouth and in the mouths of other owners like himself to claim that this is an unwarranted interference with their liberties, because it is just that interference that the Chancellor of the Exchequer said was necessary, and it is just that interference that the hon. and gallant Gentleman has told us that these provisions do not empower.<br/>
It is true that after the vesting date it will be impossible for new coalfields to be developed without the permission of the Commission, although, as my hon. and learned Friend has pointed out, a great deal can be done between now and then to commence the exploitation of a new coalfield, but the main trouble is that we have no power to control the extension of the periphery of existing coalfields. One of the most stupid things that has happened in the last two years has been the enormous development of new coalfields, even in the Midlands, at the expense of some of the older coalfields in this country. In that way assets have been wasted, and mines are derelict in South Wales, in Durham, in Scotland, and indeed all over the country, very largely as a consequence of the fact that instead of there being intelligent development, new enterprises, of which the hon. Baronet is happy to own one, formidable commercial successes, exploiting rich seams of coal, have been allowed to develop, and the counterpart of the thriving properties that hon. Members like the hon. Baronet possess is the disused shafts and mines of South Wales and Durham. That is a wholesale wastage of national assets.<br/>
I hope I have shown the Committee that by resisting this new Clause and by refusing, although I cannot argue that, to limit the liberty of the coalowners in other parts of the Bill, the hon. and gallant Gentleman in facts strips the Commission of any effective control over future colliery development and shows that this Bill, as we always said it was, is a facade behind which is nothing but emptiness.</p>

<p>I did not expect the Secretary for Mines to accept this Clause. The reason why I was anxious that it should be moved was in order to demonstrate the fact that the Government would not accept it, because it shows the complete hollowness of their professions that this Bill is designed to do anything as regards the orderly planning of the coal industry of this country. Let me remind the hon. and gallant Gentleman of two Clauses, of which I am sure he is quite aware&#x2014;first of all, Clause 12, under which a person carrying on the business of coal mining immediately before the vesting date who is then beneficially entitled to the fee simple in coal gets thereby an absolute right to a lease of that coal, a right which he would not get unless he satisfied both those things. It is surely worth while somebody opening a pit, starting a coal mine, in order to get that right under Clause 12, which he cannot otherwise get.<br/>
In a new area, or in a fringe area, if an owner starts to develop a seam and carry on the business of coal mining, he gets, under this Bill, the very valuable right of a perpetual lease, which he cannot otherwise get; and it is the commonest thing possible in Acts of this kind, where you are dealing with property and compensation, to stabilise the circumstances at the date when the Act is passed. It is very common indeed, anyway to stabilise the circumstances as at the date when the compensation is to be payable or when the valuation for compensation is to be made. The extraordinary thing about this Bill is that you are assessing compensation upon the &#x00A3;66,000,000, upon the basis of an Act already passed three years ago. You are then going to take the property for which you are paying the price only four years hence, and in the intermediate period, apart from wastage of the property, you are allowing it to be altered just at the will of the people from whom you are taking it.<br/>
I think there has never been a Bill before which has permitted that where a property is to be taken. The most usual form, of course, is to give the right of entry immediately, whenever it is wanted, and thereafter to allow compensation and so on to be fixed. That is not happening in this case, and what we are asking in this Clause is to stabilise the conditions up to the vesting date, just

as Clause 15 of the Bill stabilises the conditions after the vesting date, because after the vesting date it is not lawful for anyone other than the Commission or a person authorised by them to search or bore for coal. So that that is stabilised after the vesting date, and if it is necessary to stabilise it after the vesting date, there can, in our opinion, be no conceivable argument in favour of allowing people to do that in the period that elapses between the passing of the Act and the vesting date. Indeed, not only can there be no argument, but any person or Government concerned with the orderly planning of an industry must inevitably take steps to prevent it. The hon. and gallant Gentleman cannot say that this does not affect anything and is not necessary. The hon. Member for Berwick-on-Tweed (Sir H. Seely) has let the cat out of the bag sufficiently well to demonstrate that that is not the truth. He realises quite well that he, among others, is going to try and get away with it in the next four years, and that is why he is so indignant at being stopped.</p>

<p>All that I said was that I did not think anyone would go to the expense of sinking a pit during this very short period merely to get a part of the &#x00A3;66,000,000, which the hon. and learned Gentleman said was the reason for moving this Clause.</p>

<p>I said that that was one of the reasons, and I pointed out how under Clause 12 that reason, among others, may operate. It may operate very strongly, and it may also operate on the question of valuation. The valuation of an unproved mineral is a very different thing indeed from the valuation of a proved mineral. I was talking the other day to a person who manages very large sections of property, and I asked him, just out of curiosity, what he had done as regards the Coal Bill. He replied that as far as he could ascertain he had put in a claim for all the property they owned in England, in the hope that there was coal under it. I told him that I did not imagine he would get much out of it, and he said he did not suppose he would, but that he would have a shot at it. If


his position had been that he had proved his claim in one of these areas, his position as regards compensation would be entirely different. It is obvious that in those circumstances it would pay a person to&#x2014;</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman knows very well that in the first instance we put a much earlier date into this Clause, but we were told that it was out of order, and therefore we altered it to bring it into order. We should like to have stopped all this immediately notice was given at the last General Election that the Government were going to unify mining royalties. That is when it ought to have stopped. When the hon. Baronet below the Gangway here says that this is a drastic Socialist step that must be resisted at all costs, I would point out that one does not resist steps which do not affect one. That seems to be fairly conclusive, and, therefore, we have the position that this is a step that is going to affect the royalty owners and the coalowners. How is it going to affect them? It is not going to affect them to their disadvantage, or else they would not oppose it; it is going to affect them, if they are allowed to do this, to their advantage. Anything that affects them in those four years to their advantage will be to the loss of the Commission, because the compensation will be based upon the receipts of three past years and the Commission should be entitled to any improvement after the date the compensation is fixed.<br/>
The coalowners and royalty owners want to keep the advantage to themselves, although the compensation is based on the advantage that they had three years ago. They want to have it both ways. We see in this a very strong additional reason, which has been completely proved out of the mouth of the hon. Baronet, why a Clause of this sort should be put in to protect the Coal Commission. We shall certainly, as a result of the action of the Government, be entitled to say, as we shall say, in the country that all the Government's professions about the planning and the reorganisation of the

coal industry based upon the ownership and the unification of royalties is just eye-wash. We always thought that it was eye-wash, and now that is proved.</p>

<p>I have been rather less fortunate than the hon. Baronet opposite in being able to comprehend the meaning of the new Clause. As I read the Clause it is absolutely meaningless.

<p>I am much obliged to the hon. and learned Member. Let us follow the means proposed to be employed to achieve this object. The new Clause intends to place a restriction upon the lessee of the coal, but in point of fact what it does is to place a restriction upon the owner. Every area which is at all likely to be developed in the next 15 or 20 years is already, and has been for probably a good many years, in lease to a colliery undertaking. The development of coal in the past has never been done to any extent by the owner of the coal but by the lessees, the colliery undertakings. Although it is intended to put a restriction upon the lessee, in point of fact the restriction is put upon the owner who, as I have said, in nearly every case has already parted with any right to prevent his minerals being developed by granting a lease to these new areas. It is perfectly clear that the intention of the Clause is really only to restrict the owners and not the lessees of the coal, because the compensation awarded is to be interest upon the lump sum which is awarded to the mineral owners under other Clauses of the Bill. This Clause will be unable to prevent any new mines being sunk except in the one in a thousandth case of the mineral owner who at present enjoys a freehold in the possession of his coal. The new Clause will achieve no object whatever in securing better planning of the coalfield in the future.</p>

<p>But the mineral owner still remains the mineral owner, although he may have leased his coal. There is the mineral owner who has not leased the right to the development of his coal, and the hon. Member admits that the Clause limits him where he exists. He says that such a mineral owner does not exist to any extent, but where he does exist the Clause limits him. In respect of other limitations the Clause has a meaning. Therefore, it is not a Clause that means nothing. It means that where there is a mineral owner who has not leased his

right to development, he will be limited if we pass the Clause. In that respect the Clause has a meaning. Although in fact the other mineral owners have leased their right to develop to certain colliery undertakings, they still remain in law the mineral owners until the vesting date, when the Commission becomes the mineral owner. Therefore, they will have to get permission from the Commission under this Clause before developments can take place on their land.<br/>
In some parts of the Bill there is a protection of the existing leasehold rights, but here you have a modification of them. Therefore, those landlords who have not parted with their rights to develop will be limited if the Clause passes. In the second case, as regards the others who have parted with their rights, on lease, they will still be the mineral owners, and the limitation passes on to the colliery companies. If that be so, then if our Clause is passed there will be a limitation of the right of development on the part of any new colliery undertaking. It is just such a limitation that the Government indicated they intended to carry through, and those powers are absolutely essential if we are going to direct the development of the coalfield. The Government are not allowed to mine coal or to exploit coal in any sense of the word. They have not the power of direct direction to the coal-owner but will only have powers governing the exploitation of the coal vested in them as owners of the mineral rights.<br/>
We are now told by the hon. Member that in his judgment the vast majority of the leases in this country already carry powers of development. Therefore, with respect to those the Commission will have no power of direction. The hon. Member went on to say that the Clause does not mean anything. We shall remember his speech, and I hope that it will be remembered in Leeds, because he has said in effect that so far as the unification of mining royalties is concerned, in the future as in the past, in regard to the sinking of collieries and the development of the coalfield, the coalowners will be able to do what they like. When we seek to give the Commission for 4&#x00BD; years the powers which they ought to have, the hon. Member says that for those 4&#x00BD; years we will have no interference with private economic adventures in the


coalfield. If the Committee does not make provision such as we suggest in the Clause, they are largely wasting their time in regard to the Bill.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That the Clause be read a Second time."<br/>
Voluntary amalgamation is the principle in this Bill, and the Commission may take action if sufficient progress is not being made with the amalgamation. It is very little consolation to those who are affected by voluntary amalgamations and are thrown out of employment to know that it is being done voluntarily instead of by compulsory action. The Clause which I move has been fairly extensively debated on a previous occasion. There is a very vital principle at stake. In these days of amalgamation and rationalisation, we are rapidly coming to the time when we must face up to the problem of what is really the best, cheapest and most efficient way in the national interest to produce a given commodity. I can quite understand that even under voluntary amalgamations, it may be cheaper by a few pence per ton for the colliery company, as a result of amalgamation, to produce coal from a certain mine or mines by a few pence per ton. That is not the real cost as far as the nation is concerned. When we consider the number and extent of the health services for which local authorities are now responsible, the local authorities should, before there is a voluntary amalgamation, have the right to submit a case to the Commission, and that the weight of their evidence as to the ultimate effect upon a particular district should be taken into effect before the Commission agreed to a voluntary amalgamation. The same may be said in relation to the Commissioner for the Special Areas with respect to transport, roads, schools and housing, etc.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1938-02-08a.914.3" colnum="914" time="">
<p>The Clause provides that if an amalgamation is consented to, the wage standards and the conditions of labour of the men in the district should not be


prejudicially affected. That is very important as far as the men are concerned. There have been one or two operations which have taken place in the county of Northumberland not in regard to amalgamations, but reorganisations. Instead of the coal being brought by the railway company, the colliery company, being in possession of the necessary land, have put down their own lines and brought the coal from "A" colliery to "B" colliery. There has been surplus labour at "A" colliery because the washing, cleaning and screening has been done at "B" pit. The men at "B" pit, with probably very small additions, are able to deal with the coal brought there from "A" pit. It is true to say that the coal is being produced more cheaply than it was before, but the wage standards of the people at "A" pit have been considerably affected because of the numbers thrown out of employment as a result of the alteration that has been made. That sort of thing applies where you have amalgamations in respect of which pits are taken over and probably some of them are closed down. Some of the men may be absorbed at the pit that has taken over their old pit.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1938-02-08a.915.0" colnum="915" time="">
<p>It is not good enough to say that the wages of a man have increased unless you take the whole of the factors into consideration. We have a means test in operation in this country. See how the wage standards are being affected as far as the means test is concerned. Take the case of two men dismissed because a pit has been taken over by an amalgamation. One of them is able to obtain work under the new company, but the other is rendered idle. They are living at home. The man who is working is earning fair wages, but his brother, if he has exhausted his standard benefit, has to make application to the Unemployment Assistance Board, and in consequence the wages of the working brother are taken into consideration. If the brother's wages are sufficiently high, the man's application to the Unemployment Assistance Board is disallowed. The effect undoubtedly is that the income of that home is reduced as a result of the voluntary amalgamation. The wage standard here is reduced by 50 per cent. I would like to give the following illustrations, as I notice that I am still in order. A man

working in our district for many years exhausted his standard benefit. His son came home and obtained work in the district, earning decent wages at the bricklayer's rates. His father was put out of benefit altogether, and the son had to keep the whole family. That is what I mean as having regard to wage standards.</p>

<p>I suppose that I can go on as long as there are doubts about it. Later in the Clause it says:
<q>provision will be made for the transference or absorption of workers who may be displaced as a result of the amalgamation.</q>
That is a very important part of the Clause. There have been innumerable instances where men have obtained work, but their wives and families had to be left behind while they went into lodgings. The Clause provides that the Commission, when considering voluntary amalgamations, shall see that proper provision is made in this connection. I hope that I have made the point very clear. We are arriving at a time when it is not good enough for industry, by some rationalisation or re-organisation, to bring in a machine which will throw out a certain number of men and then tell the State that it must keep them. By the introduction of this Clause, I believe that we should take the first step towards safeguarding the men affected by either compulsory or voluntary amalgamation.</p>

<p>It strikes me that in moving this new Clause Members opposite may have omitted what seems to be rather an important feature. The hon. Member for Morpeth (Mr. R. J. Taylor) said that it was high time that the industry was informed that by improving its productive methods, machinery and so on, it could not throw men out of employment and say to the State, "You must look after these men." The point that strikes me is that the main duty of industry is to the vast mass of consumers in this country who are working men and women, so that its products are made available to them at the lowest possible cost, consequent upon a decent return to capital and to labour. If you are going to say to an


industry that a pit, although it is uneconomic and an expensive pit to run and has, at the pithead, a carefully built-up local organisation of roads, sewers and the like, and a population which cannot take any other form of employment, must not be closed down but, under an amalgamation scheme, must be kept going, the first result in modern industry to-day would be to raise the price of coal over the whole area.<br/>
That would have two effects. It would put money into the pockets of the more efficient pits and take more out of the pockets of the people who purchase coal. I am in favour of controlling the price of coal so that it does no more than give a reasonable return to all employed in the industry and no excessive profits on investments, but I would stress the danger of this rather loose talk about keeping uneconomic units in existence for the sake of circumstances which have now become redundant. As far as the industry itself is concerned, its duty to the consumer is to produce at the lowest possible cost. When you have established what is an uneconomic pit or concern, by no means an easy proposition, are you going to the coalowners in Durham and tell them that they must increase the price of their coal in order to look after various communities in the south-west of Durham where the pits are completely worked out and full of water? Are you going to say to the existing mines that they must look after these men? Where are you going to draw the line as to what is economic and uneconomic? It is very difficult.<br/>
It is a much better proposition for the consumers of this country that the State should take charge of these communities and look after them. If the State takes charge, then the Surtax payer and the Income Tax payer will have to bear a large proportion of the cost, and it will not mean a steady reduction in the standard of living to the poorest classes of the community owing to what I consider to be an uneconomic price level, which would have to be maintained in order to keep in existence uneconomic pits.</p>

<p>I am rather sorry to hear the hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Peat) opposing this new Clause. He does so purely on financial grounds, whilst we

are supporting it on humane grounds. I know he has a knowledge of the southwest part of the County of Durham and I think that knowledge should be sufficient to tell him that the time has come when something should be done to prevent areas like those in South-West Durham being created in the future. The hon. Member says that it is a matter for the State to take over when employers have left a district in the derelict condition of some of the areas in South-West Durham. I think it is the duty of the State to take over the coal mines and prevent such districts being created. I regard the new Clause as raising the most important question that can be raised on the Bill. The questions of royalties, amalgamations and selling prices are not so important as the subject raised in the new Clause. It brings us face to face with things of which we have experience. We have seen collieries stopped and districts left derelict, and it is because of what we have seen through voluntary amalgamations that we jump at this opportunity to urge upon the House that when voluntary amalgamations take place the people who are displaced should receive some consideration.<br/>
What arguments can be used against such a proposition? We suggest that before amalgamation is allowed to take place the local authority shall be entitled to make some representations. The local authority has spent very much on roads, schools, water and sewerage, and there can be no possible argument against their having the right to make some representations before amalgamation closes down a colliery. We also suggest that the Commissioner for the Special Areas should have the right to make representations. When we have discussed questions affecting the Commissioner for the Special Area, we have been told that one of his duties was to beautify the district. Those who have owned the collieries have left ghastly pitheads and dismantled collieries; they have left the place in ruins, and we appointed the Special Commissioner and gave him as one of his chief duties to beautify the districts, to remove these pitheads and make the place more attractive.<br/>
In the new Clause we suggest that the Commissioner should make representation. After his experience of the last few years we think he could make many useful representations before a voluntary amalgamation closed any pit. Another


important provision in the new Clause is that if voluntary amalgamation is going to close a colliery some provision should be made for the transference of the people. In the county of Durham committees who have examined some of our villages have suggested that the whole of the colliery village should be demolished&#x2014;villages where people have lived during the whole of their lives! A committee appointed by the Commissioner suggested that in South-West Durham three of these villages should be completely demolished.</p>

<p>It was more than an illustration. Perhaps I have not made myself clear, but when I have done so I think you will agree that I am in order. I was dealing with what is in the new Clause about transference, and I was saying that I could not agree with transference as carried out by the Ministry of Labour. The suggestion in the new Clause is that when voluntary amalgamation takes place it should be one of the duties to see that the men in the villages are transferred. I regard the question of transference in the new Clause as a very important proposal, and I suggest that the time has come when voluntary amalgamations should not take place or people be able to stop any colliery when they please.</p>

<p>I must remind the hon.

<p>I do not intend to carry it so far. I say that when a voluntary amalgamation takes place they should not have the power to close any pit they please simply because they think the pit is uneconomic. I know small pits which under amalgamation have been closed straightaway, and yet those small pits have served the village in which they were situated. I want them to be kept going as long as possible. The hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Peat) talked about uneconomic pits. Some of us believe that the better pits should help to keep the poorer pits going. It is no argument to say that because there is an amalgamation you should close the poor pits.</p>

<p>I think the hon.

To my mind, that would not be the result, but it would ensure that if certain pits had to be closed down, provision would be made for the transference or the absorption of the workers displaced as a result of the amalgamation. The hon. Member for Darlington stated a rather hard view when he said that the only matter that ought to be considered was whether an amalgamation would produce coal at the cheapest possible rate, without consideration being given to the social effects. No doubt that was the view 100 years ago, 50 years ago, or even more recently, but it is becoming less and less the view in the industrial world at the present time.</p>

<p>I do not wish to misrepresent the hon. Member in any way, but if he reads his speech to-morrow, I think he will see that he said that the only consideration was the production of coal at the cheapest possible rate. That is a sentiment which I challenge, for I do not believe it is the view which Parliament takes with regard to any industry in which it has any form of control. At the present time, we desire that the financial side, as well as the human side, of any amalgamation shall receive equal consideration, although I should have thought that the human side was a good deal more important than the financial side. In passing legislation of this nature, we ought to make every safeguard, as this Clause endeavours to do, to maintain the social conditions at any rate at their present standard. I have in mind two things for which the Commission, under this Clause, would have regard in the case of an amalgamation. The Commission would very likely say, "What arrangement have you made for the miners who will be displaced as a result of what you are doing?" I know of cases in other industries where, when there have been amalgamations, a definite scale has been laid down and people have received so many weeks', months' or even years' wages in accordance with the number of years' service which they have given.<br/>
The other instance is drawn out of the past. It is known that all over the Black Country of South Staffordshire there are many very ugly pit mounds, which are now to a great extent being levelled out for housing purposes. I suggest that in future the Commission ought to bear that matter in mind, and say to those who are promoting an amalgamation that before it can be allowed to take place, they must make some arrangement to see that those ugly pit mounds are not left behind, as they have been in the past. Even if an amalgamation appears to be sound and good from the point of view of the shareholders, I think it ought not to be permitted if it will involve any degradation in the standard of life in the neighbourhood. It is because this proposed Clause offers some prospect of safeguarding the position on those lines that I heartily support it.</p>

<p>This is a very important Clause, and in the discussion of it we are given good illustrations of the varying forms of capitalist outlook on any sort of industrial organisation at the present time. There are two ways of looking at the matter. One is that which the hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Peat) may perhaps disclaim when I attribute it to him, although I think it was the essence of his speech; it is the sort of outlook which causes people to say, "Let us look at the money side of it; let us see whether more money can be made for the shareholders and whether coal can be supplied, generally speaking more cheaply; and if so, do not let us worry about anything else. If, in the course of running our capitalist system in that way we throw off workpeople and leave them sitting in villages where there is no work to do, let the State carry the burden of maintaining them in that luxury which is the lot of the unemployed."<br/>
That, of course, is a step forward in capitalist development, because in the old days the capitalist said, "Do not let the State maintain those workpeople, do not worry about them; let us go on seeking profit and nothing else, and for Heaven's sake, do not let the State interfere." Now, at any rate, they have got to the point of saying, "Whenever anything is profitable, by all means let us have it; when we talk about uneconomic pits and uneconomic prices, do not let us think of happiness, or even of houses and water supply, but of the market price of coal and the difficulties of the owners of the pits; and let the State take some part&#x2014;it can have the wrong end of the stick and take over the burden and wastage."<br/>
The other way of looking at the matter&#x2014;apart from the commonsense thing, which we do not expect the Government to do, of making the industry, which is vital to the community, belong to the community and be properly administered by it for the advantage of the whole community&#x2014;is that which is embodied in this new Clause. If we must continue to have this industry in private hands, let us, at any rate, see that when it seeks to amalgamate coalmining undertakings for its own profit, some opportunity shall be given for making it consider to some extent the true wealth of the country. Let us, at any rate, see that amalgamation

does not simply mean getting a profit or selling coal cheaply, but shall also mean that the industry shall consider the whole balance of convenience. Let it be remembered that a village is in itself wealth, that in it are skilled coalminers who are in themselves wealth, and that if their lives are made a misery, they will cease to be an asset and become a liability. That would be a sensible and humane thing to do.<br/>
It may, perhaps, occur to hon. Members opposite, if they will look at things broadly and not narrowly, that that is the best way of conserving the wealth of the country for which they profess to have some regard, because they believe that for a few years longer they can keep nearly all of it in their own pockets, instead of having it properly distributed in the true interests of the community. I venture to suggest that hon. Members opposite who propose to vote against this Clause should read it and consider what they will vote against. If they vote against it, they will be saying, "It shall be lawful, right, proper, expedient and beneficial for coalmining undertakings to amalgamate by voluntary agreement whatever they like, and if anybody says anything about existing social facilities and works, it shall be sentimental nonsense, to which no regard shall be had by any such undertakings; and if anybody says anything about transport, roads, schools, houses, places of entertainment, light, water supply and other facilities and works, it shall be up-to-date nonsense of the sort that shall not be tolerated; and people shall go on amalgamating their coal-mining undertakings with the express sanction of this Committee, which indicates to them that it is a jolly fine idea to lay whole areas of the country waste by, for their own profit, amalgamating a number of coal-mining undertakings with express disregard of all those considerations." In the same way, should they be considering for their own greater profit and their future baronetcies and peerages the amalgamation of a number of coal-mining undertakings, they will have the sanction of the right hon. Gentleman and his able and efficient Secretary for Mines and all the serried ranks of hon. Members sitting opposite, to the number of 18 or 20, and all their fellow hon. Members in the Smoking Room, if they expressly disregard wage standards, conditions of


labour, and the transference and absorption of workers, and they will be putting up one more little monument to selfish anarchy, and putting a few more nails in the coffin of capitalism.</p>

<p>I should not have intervened in this Debate had it not been for the speech of the hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Peat). It is refreshing in one sense to hear the doctrine of the old Manchester School being advocated by so sound a Protectionist as the hon. Member. His concern in this matter is about the price of coal to the poor. Is it not really astonishing that that consideration should be put forward by a Member of the party which, during the last five or six years, has so greatly increased the price of every commodity used by the poor, and has said that that is the reason for the various tariffs and orders which they have introduced?</p>

<p>The Chair indicated that this Debate would have to be confined within narrow limits, and if I could follow the line indicated by the hon. Gentleman I should have pleasure in doing it, but it would somewhat extend the length of the Debate if I were to attempt to discuss where the increased price of coal has been going during the past few months, especially the large increases which have been asked by the coalowners of the public utility undertakings. The hon. Member said it was far better to let the poor have cheap coal and let the Super-tax payer keep the disinherited coal miner in the mining village. That is not a travesty of his argument, but they are almost his exact words. That is where we differ from him, because it means that private enterprise is to determine the allocation and extent of the burden that the public have to carry. We say that in these days the public should be entitled to have some voice in both the allocation and the extent of the burden of poverty that they are expected to carry.<br/>
I regard this new Clause as very valuable because it asserts in definite and direct terms what the Commissioner must take into consideration. Consider what

is happening in part of my constituency which covers the borough of Jarrow. The hon. Member for Guildford (Sir J. Jarvis) is well aware of the position of affairs there. A particular industry decides that it will amalgamate into a smaller number of units the productive enterprises that they have, and the amalgamation throws a district entirely derelict, presenting the State, the county council and borough council concerned an appalling social problem and leaving them to deal with it. This Amendment asserts that before that kind of thing is perpetrated in the coal industry there shall be constituted some public tribunal which shall decide whether in the interests of the State as a whole economic regeneration is being effected. They may before amalgamation takes place suggest such provisions for solving or assisting to solve the economic difficulties that are created as shall be just to all the parties concerned. I was surprised that a Member representing one of the boroughs in County Durham should take the view that was put forward by the hon. Member for Darlington. I do not think he did himself justice. I believe he remembered he was an accountant and forgot he was a Member of Parliament when he made his speech. The clear dividing line between the attitude of the two sides of the House on this matter was shown in the broad, human view taken by my hon. Friend the Member for Morpeth (Mr. R. J. Taylor), and the narrow view, more reminiscent of the view of the party that sits in attenuated numbers below the Gangway 100 years ago, of the hon. Member for Darlington.</p>

<p>I do not share the alarm that some Members have on the subject of amalgamations. I have seen many voluntary amalgamations in my area, and while it is true that some of them have had ill-effects, others have had the opposite effects. I have seen colliery after colliery absorbed by a large concern in my area. It is true that within a few years of an amalgamation pits have been closed. On the other hand, I have seen a colliery taken over that was looked upon as a small concern which had a hard struggle to keep going. I have seen such a colliery taken over by a big concern and developed into a big colliery. The absorbing company had the capital with which to sink to lower seams and to equip the colliery in a better fashion


than it had been equipped before. Instead of a struggling colliery, we now have a big colliery under that concern. You can, therefore, have both ill and good effects from voluntary amalgamations.<br/>
I support the new Clause because of the instruction that is proposed to be given to the Commission. The Commission ought to have regard to the interests of the local authorities before an amalgamation takes place and before pits and even whole collieries are closed down. The local authority should have the power to make representations to the Commission. There is also the point of view of the man who is displaced and thrown out of employment. In my area where collieries have been closed down young men who were living in the neighbourhood have had to go miles to get work in other collieries. That affects their wage standards because they have bus fares to pay and additional expenses compared with those who are living in the neighbourhood of the collieries. There is, however, no work for the men who have worked 10 or 20 years for the colliery which is closed down. These are the individuals to whom we refer as the hard core of our unemployment problem in the mining areas. There is no opportunity for them to get work even if they are prepared to travel considerable distances.<br/>
I hope we shall get some encouragement from the Secretary for Mines, because where voluntary amalgamations have been undertaken the colliery concerns have shown little or no concern about the men who were thrown out of employment as a result. What I have said raises the point mentioned by the hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Peat) about the closing of inefficient collieries. It might be assumed that when a big concern took over a small struggling colliery the first thing that would happen would be the closing of that inefficient pit; yet by a little readjustment and by the expenditure of a little more money the pit has been made efficient. Unless, therefore, one knows the whole circumstances one can hardly tell when a pit is inefficient or uneconomic. It stands to reason, now that all the shallow seams are being worked out, that, in order to carry on, collieries have to sink to lower levels and put down deeper shafts in

order to get the coal, but the bigger concern is the concern that can carry out such work. From that point of view there is something to be said in favour of amalgamations even on voluntary lines. I supported the principle of compulsory amalgamation, but we have had a considerable amount of voluntary amalgamation in my area, and if rumours are true we have not reached the limit yet. I believe that before this Bill becomes an Act we shall have an even bigger voluntary amalgamation in several of the coalfields of this area.<br/>
If there are to be voluntary amalgamations in future I hope the Commission will lay it down that more consideration is to be given to the displaced men than has been given before. There would have been less feeling among the miners had colliery concerns given more consideration in the past to the men displaced. It is not enough to say, as the hon. Member for Darlington said, that after a colliery concern can no longer employ the men it is the duty of the State to look after them. That would have been all right if the State had been getting the benefit from the working of the coalmine, but as the colliery owners had been getting the benefit of the labour they employed, it is not right that they should be able simply to say to the men, "We do not require your services any longer. You can live as you like; you can either go to the parish or live on your savings or struggle along as you like; but, as far as we are concerned, we have finished with you." If there had been less of that sort of thing on the part of colliery owners in the past there would have been less feeling against amalgamation, even on voluntary lines. I hope the Commission will lay it down that not only are public bodies to be protected, but that the miners are to have more protection than they have had in the past.</p>

<p>We have not yet heard from the Secretary for Mines, and I am very hopeful indeed, being of an optimistic nature, as are many of my colleagues here, that the Government are about to grant what is asked for in this Clause, and I shall be grievously disappointed if such is not the case. Indeed, I can imagine that a special remit has been sent from the Cabinet with reference to this Clause, for one


need not be greatly concerned in public affairs to recognise that the question of derelict areas and derelict men is one of the most important which is being dealt with at the present time. This question is involved closely and intimately with the preservation of industry where it is located and where it can be developed upon more humane lines. Derelict areas and derelict men have cost the State, both nationally and municipally, many millions of pounds sterling, and an enormous amount of suffering.</p>

<p>Then I would say that we disagree with the argument of the colliery owners that in the nature of things amalgamations will be beneficial. They are not necessarily beneficial. One has heard again and again of industries being amalgamated and attempts being afterwards made, in some cases successfully, to revert to decentralisation because the larger units have not been so successful as had been contemplated. The hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Peat) took the purely economic view that any industry must be made to pay, and that is understandable, but to-day the State is stepping in and taking an interest in industry, and in this Parliament and in the last Parliament we have seen very great benefactions given to industry.</p>

<p>I am sorry, Captain Bourne, to digress in this way, and it seems to me that if I cannot enlarge and extend my arguments to prove what I am endeavouring to demonstrate, it will be difficult to add anything to what has already been said. No part of the country may suffer more from amalgamations, either voluntary or compulsorily, than Durham, and having suffered in the past what we are asking is that in the event of amalgamations being suggested by the colliery owners the local authorities and the Commissioner for the Special Areas should be consulted&#x2014;though I rather hesitate to mention the Commissioner, in

case I am out of order, although his name does appear in the new Clause&#x2014;as to what the effect socially of such an amalgamation will be. The closing of a colliery, or a few collieries, may create a derelict area, and the Commissioner, who has been called into being by this Parliament with a view to remedying a state of affairs already created, ought clearly to be consulted in such circumstances.<br/>
We contend that the day has passed when wage questions and standards of employment can be entirely ignored by the community. I had the pleasure of mentioning in the House recently certain amalgamations in which compensation was granted to displaced engineers, and I do not see why similar protection should not be accorded, in the event of amalgamations taking effect, to those who have been employed in any pits which it is proposed to close&#x2014;as long as the Government decline to deal with the question of redundant labour as affecting colliery undertakings, as long as boys go into our coal pits&#x2014;</p>

<p>Very well, Captain Bourne; it seems about impossible to please you so far as this Clause is concerned. I want to assert, finally, that the local authorities ought to have consideration in this matter. They are to be called upon to undertake very heavy expenditure as a result of amalgamations. The Commissioner is entitled to be considered, and the wage-earners ought to have full and complete consideration, and if proper provision is not made by law that they should be protected automatically we say that under this Clause such protection can properly for the first time in our history be accorded to those who suffer from the amalgamation. We ask that this new Clause should, therefore, have the support of the Committee not only upon economic grounds, but upon the grounds of broad humanity.</p>

<p>It ill becomes the House of Commons to seek amusement out of a case of this kind. When amalgamations take place there is not only the economic factor, the purely financial issue, to be considered, but the case of the people who are affected by the combination and may be thrown out of work, and all we ask is that when amalgamations do take place some regard ought to be given to their interests. If an amalgamation will bring almost desolation to a vast number of people, steps ought to be taken to prevent that happening. I have always recognised that under our present system it is difficult to stop amalgamations, but when we see what has happened it is our duty to bring this matter to the notice of the House. If we cannot prevent amalgamations we say that some regard should be given to the transference of the people affected. If an amalgamation is to take place and 200 or 300 people will be thrown out of work, regard ought to be had to whether they can be transferred to some other part of the country before any collieries are closed under the amalgamation. That is all we ask.<br/>
Perhaps the time is not opportune, perhaps hon. Members opposite say we have no need to deal with that question yet, but they cannot go on creating derelict areas by degrees without calling upon their heads some show of feeling from the electors. That is bound to happen, and the electors, so far from assisting us to do what we are attempting to do in a constitutional manner, may end by asserting themselves in a more determined fashion. I ask hon. Members opposite not to add to the trouble by making fun of us. I want them to treat this matter seriously and reply to our arguments. If they say that it cannot be done let them prove to us that it cannot be done.</p>

<p>Last night we heard a number of speeches, particularly from the benches opposite, criticising the power of monopolies in deciding prices,

especially for certain industrial consumers. Much the same idea arises here, because it may be in the hands of a board of directors to decide whether a community shall live or die, for that is what it virtually comes to. The hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Peat) used the term "uneconomic pit." It is possible for efficient concerns to strangle completely certain small concerns, or to bring them to such a state of mind that in order to exist they will agree, somehow, to amalgamate with the larger concern. During the last 9 or 10 years we have had any number of examples of that in most of the coalfields, probably a greater number in South Wales than anywhere.<br/>
At the moment a by-election is being fought in Pontypridd. The whole of that community depended upon five or six pits. The Great Western Colliery Company held, I think it is true to say, a greater measure of good will, particularly in the international market than any other concern in South Wales, but that concern was partially&#x2014;some part of it&#x2014;was practically driven into liquidation, and although the nominal capital was &#x00A3;300,000 it was finally purchased for about &#x00A3;35,000. The whole of Pontypridd became a derelict area. Practically 40 per cent. of the people normally engaged in the mining industry are totally idle. Close by we have the Treforest Trading Estate. I do not want to extend the Debate and when we were discussing this before we were dealing with the powers to amalgamate compulsorily certain undertakings, while here we are dealing with amalgamations depending upon the volition of the concerns, but I wish to point out that more than &#x00A3;1,000,000 has already been spent at Treforest in order to find work for a few thousand persons at the outside. The State has incurred that enormous liability in order to find work for that very small proportion of persons rendered idle through amalgamations and liquidation.<br/>
Before we create any other distressed area, and the closing down of a pit is, in fact, the creation of a distressed area, surely the community in the area should have the opportunity of presenting then-case to the Commission, in order to place before the Commission the enormous amount of social capital which will be affected by the closing down of the pit


or undertaking. In quite a large number of constituencies there has been experience of what I may call the distressed areas problem. Wherever a pit is closed down it means taking away the complete income of a number of households. In other words, the eggs are all in one basket. There is just one breadwinner. The daughters are seldom engaged in service. The total income of the house is affected and they are made destitute. Often they have to depend upon the community, which is already in a bad state financially. Glamorgan and Monmouthshire are two counties where the ravages of amalgamation have taken place to a larger extent than perhaps in any other part of the country outside Durham. The local authorities are mulcted in very heavy Poor Law charges. It is for that purpose that we are pressing the Clause.<br/>
There is another feature. It is possible for directors to close a concern in which the miners may enjoy relatively good conditions. In most mines piece-work obtains, particularly for the hewing of coal. Price lists have to be made for the purpose and, where the price list yields a fairly reasonable wage, a pit is closed in order to lower the wage level of the whole of the undertaking. There are very many examples of that in South Wales and elsewhere. Surely every effort should be made to see, particularly in potentially distressed areas, that the community is not robbed of a legitimate purchasing capacity, after price lists have been properly negotiated, because at the whim of a directorship they may close a pit, lower the wage level of the whole area and deprive certain businesses of a market for their goods because of the ever contracting purchasing capacity of the area. All those things ought to be taken into consideration, and they will some day have to be taken into consideration if the House is to face up to the great problem of the Special Areas which exist and which may be created if employers of labour are given free play at any time to do precisely what they like with those whom they employ. It is for the purpose of partially prohibiting that and dealing with what might be the effects arising from amalgamation that we are pressing the Clause.</p>

<p>When the question of compulsory amalgamation was considered on Thursday last it was made clear that

the reduction of mining undertakings would inevitably lead to the closing down of some pits. The President of the Board of Trade agreed that a case had been made out on behalf of local authorities who were primarily concerned in the closing down of pits which affected their social services and general amenities, and similarly on behalf of those who were likely to be displaced. He agreed that provision should be made to enable local authorities and other interests to make representations to a Select Committee of this House. We persisted in our Amendment and were defeated, but we still press the importance of making prevision in the case of voluntary amalgamation because, although some procedure may be applied arising out of some provision which will emerge on Report capable of dealing with the consequences of compulsory amalgamation, there is no provision which enables the Minister, or the Commission, or Parliament to deal with the consequences of voluntary amalgamation. If, as the result of voluntary amalgamations, over which this House has no control, local authorities and mine workers suffer, what is to be done? The question deserves to be stressed, because it is very doubtful whether there will be much development in the way of compulsory amalgamations at all in view of the procedure that the right hon. Gentleman is going to apply, and of the fact that the arrangements preceding compulsory amalgamation are hedged round with all kinds of restrictions and limitations. Voluntary amalgamation will certainly be stimulated by the Commission if there is no prospect of compulsion being applied.<br/>
If pits are closed down what is Parliament going to do? The procedure referred to on Thursday does not apply to voluntary amalgamations. If the hon. and gallant Gentleman is not prepared to accept our Clause, has he any alternative to offer? Can he give an assurance on behalf of the Commission that before any voluntary amalgamations occur they will inquire into the possible consequences? If he believes that in the case of compulsion it is a matter for Parliament and a Select Committee, is he prepared to give an assurance that the Board of Trade will not permit voluntary amalgamations to take place until there has been an inquiry? That is a very modest proposal. What struck me as very remarkable in


my experience at the Mines Department in 1924 and in 1930&#x2013;31 was that colliery owners could close down their pits as and when they pleased irrespective of the consequences to the local authority, to the community at large and to the miner. What happened in consequence of that freedom to close down? Local authorities sent their representatives on deputations to the Mines Department, as I have no doubt they do even now, and the Miners' Federation and other interests concerned sent their deputations, as no doubt they do at present. I am sure the hon. and gallant Gentleman is fully seized of the difficulty that presents itself. If colliery companies can close down whenever they please, and adversely affect the whole life of the community, that is not merely a matter for the community concerned or for the mine workers. It is a matter for the whole industrial life of the nation.<br/>
If you denude an area of its only industry, what is to be done? This question bears very heavily on the problem that confronts the distressed areas. I doubt whether there would be a single distressed area in the country of any importance if it were not for the closing down of colliery undertakings. It is because colliery areas, which are the real distressed areas, have been denuded of their industrial life that we have the distressed areas, which cause Parliament so much concern. This is an appeal based on human grounds. We have to concern ourselves, not so much with the industrial as with the social and human values. We cannot afford to allow local communities to suffer in consequence of the liberty which is permitted to the mining or any other class of undertaking to amalgamate and thus to close down some of their concerns.<br/>
I make an appeal to the hon. and gallant Gentleman. Voluntary amalgamations are not protected by the provisions of the Bill, to which his right hon. Friend referred last Thursday. There is no safeguard. Mining undertakings may amalgamate, may reduce the number of pits employed, may throw out of employment large bodies of men and disturb the life of the community. All those things may happen&#x2014;indeed, in our view, they are bound to happen. What is the answer of the hon. and gallant Gentleman? As no other safeguard is

provided, and as there appears to be no suitable alternative, I hope, in the circumstances, that the hon. and gallant Gentleman will accept the proposed new Clause.</p>

<p>Perhaps I may say at the outset that the Committee should be ready to make a decision on this matter, which has already been discussed on a previous occasion. The principle of the proposed new Clause seems to be that if two or more undertakings wish to come together on a voluntary basis, it shall be contrary to the law for them to do so unless the Commission, which is not a party to the amalgamation, is satisfied that certain considerations have been borne in mind for the amalgamation to be effected. As the hon. Gentleman has said, there is a very intense human problem. Everybody recognises that to be the case, because of specific instances. There may be a case where the shutting down of a colliery undertaking, a shipyard or a mill, causes considerable local dislocation and consequent social difficulties to the community involved, and everybody recognises that there must be many cases in consequence of that sort of policy being put into effect. I must ask the Committee to bear in mind, however, that the coming together of two or more undertakings, whether voluntarily or compulsorily, does not of itself involve those consequences. It does not mean, for instance, in the coal industry, that a pit will be closed. Maybe, the amalgamation is effected in order to prevent a pit being closed.<br/>
Alternatively, it may very well be that although the amalgamation takes place to-day or to-morrow, no pit is closed down for five, 10 or 35 years. It is not so easy to deal with the intense human problem which the hon. Gentleman mentions, and which we have in mind just as much as he has, even though we do not say so all the time. It is not so easy to deal with it if one bears that sort of aspect in mind. The hon. Gentleman said, quite rightly, that it is surely of very little consequence to a man who has been thrown out of work as the result of a voluntary amalgamation for him to know that it was done voluntarily. There, again, we must not lose sight of the fact that amalgamation, whether voluntary or compulsory, even though it be followed by the closing of a pit, is not the sole cause of unemployment, which


may very well arise from improved internal organisation of one pit, by the adoption of more up-to-date machinery, by the concentration of production or more intensive working in the pit itself. Unemployment caused in that way has nothing in the world to do with amalgamation, and may bring about just those social difficulties which the hon. Gentleman described.<br/>
To accept the new Clause would be to deal Only with a very small fringe of a very large problem; indeed, I am not sure that it does not raise those very questions which have been so much in the mind of the Government and which have now been remitted to the Commission on the Location of Industry&#x2014;which no doubt will have to bear in mind a good many of these considerations. That is why I say that this new Clause touches only a very small fringe of a very large problem with which, no doubt, in course of time, Parliament will be concerned. The question here is whether the consequence of amalgamation is the closing of a pit, and, as I have indicated to the Committee, that by no means necessarily results. Hon. Gentlemen are saying in this proposed new Clause that the mere fact of amalgamation means the closing of pits, and that the Commission should have to be satisfied about so and so, because if there is an amalgamation and a pit is closed as a result, there may be a very adverse effect upon the local community. As I have said, the adverse effect may come to the community as the result of a pit being closed down to save bankruptcy or the exhaustion of seams. The hon. Member for Spennymoor (Mr. Batey) was probably right in his point of view in explaining that the proposed new Clause was not providing against something which he wished to have happen, and that he did not want to see the closing down of collieries. Of course, no one does, but it is inevitable that it should happen.<br/>
We come back to the position with which the hon. Gentleman ended. He said, suppose that, after the passage of the Bill, there are voluntary amalgamations: should nothing be done through the Commission to consider the larger social and employment problems? My answer to that is one which he anticipated, and it is that although we are giving to a statutory body compulsory powers, Parliament attaches to those powers a specific limitation, and that to

try to translate that same idea into the field of voluntary amalgamation would be to do something for coal which would not be confined to coal and would be part of a very much larger problem. Any kind of undertaking may wish to amalgate with any other, and the consequence of doing so in the wider field may be just as serious as in this narrower field of coal. If that be a principle which Parliament wants to adopt, Parliament must consider it upon a far wider ground than in the form of a new Clause to the Coal Bill because it is not specifically a coal problem. Parliament may say in the future that unless somebody considers the effect upon transference or employment, no amalgamation shall take place; but I cannot agree to introduce this vast new principle into a Bill dealing with coal when the principle has not been thoroughly thought out.</p>

<p>If you give to the Commission, as you would in the terms of the Clause&#x2014;I am not quarrelling with the drafting, but this is inherent in what is proposed&#x2014;power to say that it shall be unlawful for undertakings to amalgamate unless the Commission is satisfied on such and such grounds, you are in effect, whether you intend it or not, putting a power of veto into the hands of the Commission.

<p>The President of the Board of Trade agreed to put power into the hands of Parliament in the case of compulsory amalgamation to say that before the Commission agreed to compulsory amalgamation certain conditions laid down by Parliament must be complied with.

<p>In my view there is a world of difference between cases where compulsion is exercised and where amalgamation has happened in the normal course of things. Parliament gives powers to the Commission to exercise certain duties. I see a very great difference between the two. The point I was making is that if it is inherent in the proposed new Clause that nobody shall voluntarily amalgamate unless the Commission is satisfied with this and that, you put upon the Commission the power of the veto.


Then, however good the reasons are for giving them that power, you give the Commission power of veto over the voluntary organisation of the industry. This would be going against the decision of this House that the Commission shall not be responsible for the financial running of the industry. That seems to me a lucid reason why the proposed new Clause should not be adopted. It would make the Commission far more responsible for the financial and day to day running of the industry than Parliament decided it should be. Beyond that, to insert a Clause of this kind applying to voluntary amalgamation of collieries&#x2014;while the case on general human grounds is strong in respect of the difficulties of local communities&#x2014;would have a very much wider application. I suggest to the Committee that the Clause should not be inserted in the Bill.</p>

<p>May I put it to the hon. and gallant Gentleman that his argument amounts to this: Whereas the Commission are authorised to take action under the Bill in case of compulsory amalgamation, they are not empowered to take action in regard to voluntary amalgamation? Therefore, the case is not on all fours. Let me put this point to the hon. and gallant Gentleman. If the Commission, in the course of their investigations, find that there are very great difficulties in the way of compulsory amalgamation of mining undertakings, but that it is practical to stimulate voluntary amalgamations, as indeed they were empowered to do under the Act of 1930, and that voluntary amalgamations would help, would the hon. and gallant Gentleman not agree that the obligation which is thrust upon the Commission applies as much in the case of voluntary amalgamations as in the case of compulsory amalgamations? If that is so, why not accept, if not the proposed new Clause, a proposal which amounts to this, that just as last Thursday the Committee decided, on the advice of the right hon. Gentleman the President of the Board of Trade, that in the case of compulsory amalgamation Parliament should have the final word, so in the case of voluntary amalgamations Parliament should have, if not the final word, something to say before the amalgamation was carried through?</p>

<p>I believe there are many Members of the Committee who regret that the hon. and gallant Gentleman, although he spoke of his sympathy for the human distress involved in some cases of amalgamation, did not see his way to offer some alternative to this new Clause which he is unable to accept. He objected to the proposal in the Clause that it was applying to the case of voluntary amalgamations in the mines a principle which is not applied elsewhere, but surely we are engaged in what amounts to a reorganisation of the mining industry, an industry which is in a position of peculiar privilege in certain respects and is governed by Acts of Parliament in a way that no other industry is, and the mineowners are given under this Bill a position of special privilege and monopoly. It is therefore reasonable, surely, to say that an industry which is so set apart by its nature and by the position given to it by Parliament should have special provisions to deal with these cases of voluntary amalgamation.<br/>
I do not consider that we can avoid voluntary amalgamation or that we should try to do it, but in carrying through amalgamations that may be necessary and desirable, it is, I believe, the desire of a very large number of Members of this Committee and of a very great number of citizens in the country that the human rights of the workers and the effects of amalgamation upon the well-being of the community should be borne in mind. It is surely not too much to ask of the Government that, in passing this great Measure, they should definitely lay it down that it is the duty of the Commission to have regard to those interests. I wish therefore to appeal to the Minister, who has given no response hitherto to the appeals that have been made to him for some alternative, that he should indicate at least the possibility that at a later stage of the Bill some words will be inserted, if not a new Clause, which will safeguard the position of the worker and of the local communities whose life is bound up so largely with the existence of the mines, from the terrible effects that may come upon them if the sole criterion in amalgamation is financial success from the point of view of money returned


to the mining undertaking. I believe that that is the desire of many Members of this Committee.</p>

<p>I think the Minister might have given us some reasons why he cannot put something in the Bill to deal with this problem. It is not, as he said, introducing a new principle of amalgamation in other industries, that you have got to have in mind this question about local authorities, but in Part II of this Bill the functions of the Coal Mines Reorganisation Commission are taken over by the new Commission, and that is to facilitate voluntary amalgamations, which are submitted to that organisation. Therefore, it does not seem to me that it is quite putting a new principle into other amalgamations that may come about in other industries, that you are building up something new. You have said you are going to do something to meet the case of a similar Amendment dealing with compulsory amalgamations, and I feel that something should be done which would not create some new principle in regard to these voluntary amalgamations, because this is an industry that has an arrangement for so-called voluntary amalgamations which are submitted to a Commission.</p>

<p>The Secretary for Mines has obviously not attempted to answer the case submitted in favour of this new Clause. He tried to justify his attitude by telling the Committee that if this were done for coal, it would be expected that the same should be done for other industries in this country. He knows very well that in some respects no industry in the country can be compared with coal mining. Once a colliery is closed down, the chances are overwhelmingly against that colliery being reopened. I am told that a factory, however, may be kept closed, unused, for three, six, nine, or twelve months or longer, and that still that factory could be re-started almost at 24 hours' notice, but the hon. and gallant Gentleman knows very well that the average colliery that is closed down for three months is, generally speaking, doomed for all time, that is, as we are able to appreciate time in the coal-mining industry, so that there is no analogy there at all.<br/>
A previous speaker made a very apt point indeed, and may I add to his appeal

that possibly before the Committee disposes of this question some measure of protection may be provided, not merely, as has been said, for the miners who may be engaged in a particular colliery or group of collieries, but for the whole of the communities that are, in so many of our coal-mining areas, particularly in South Wales, absolutely dependent upon the continued working of a colliery or group of collieries. If I were disposed to localise this problem, I think South Wales represents some of the most terrible tragedies that have been associated with the industrial life of this country, particularly in regard to coal mines. There we have a number of communities entirely dependent upon coal mining, and the closing down of a mine is, not infrequently, on the ground that such a colliery may be uneconomic. One hon. Member urged the Committee to oppose this new Clause on the ground that it might be setting a premium upon the continued existence of uneconomic collieries.<br/>
Possibly more nonsense has been talked in this House around that phrase of the uneconomic pit or colliery than on any other phase of the coal-mining industry. There are many on these benches, and I can see one hon. Member elsewhere, who have spent some years in coal mines. We know that there are periods in the history of a coal mine when, as the result of the temporary absence of profit such a mine may be regarded as being uneconomic. The deciding factor is the question of whether or not profits are being made, but some of us have had experiences of collieries being uneconomic, not because the coal seams are inferior, not because the labourers in them are not making the same response as in other collieries, but owing to wicked mismanagement and blundering in the working and opening-up of such collieries. I could speak from experience&#x2014;</p>

<p>I do not intend to elaborate my experience. I simply made use of that phrase in case anyone in the Committee would care to challenge the statement that I had just made. As the result of the way in which collieries have been mismanaged, we are seeing the starkest tragedy overwhelming communities


that have no hope of any other kind of work than coal-mining. The Secretary for Mines knows very well that we need not take up the time of the Committee in elaborating these tragic matters. He knows very well that certain amalgamations have very little that could be argued to their advantage but a great deal that could be said to their disadvantage and condemnation. All that we are asking is that before any of these voluntary amalgamations be permitted in the future, the social and human consequences shall be appraised and weighed in the balance, in order that the Commission can be satisfied that the disadvantages do not far exceed any advantages that can be claimed on their behalf.<br/>
The Secretary for Mines, at least by implication, admitted to-night that there may be strong human grounds for this Clause being embodied in the Bill. If that be so, the least that can be done in order that these human grounds may be considered is to accept the Amendment. There are Merthyr Tydfils, Rhondda Valleys, and Dowlais in different parts of this country, and the sufferings of the people, their disappointments, their bitter experiences and their poverty are the consequences of amalgamations which have been inspired by doubtful profit-making and by ignoring human considerations. In view of the fact that there appears to be some small measure of recognition on the part of the Government that there may be some justification for the new Clause, we hope that the Clause will not be completely ignored but that it will be weighed carefully by the Government. If that be done, I am certain that the decision will be that something on the lines suggested in the Clause should be embodied in the Bill.</p>

<p>I want to put one practical consideration to the Secretary for Mines, and I hope he will consider it worth while to reply again. In my division there will be in days to come some voluntary amalgamations, and there will need to be also some compulsory amalgamations. What this Clause asks for is that there should be the same treatment for those who are displaced or in any way embarrassed by amalgamations, whether voluntary or compulsory. I should like the Minister to con-

sider the position in my division of one village where an undertaking is closed down because of compulsory amalgamation. The President of the Board of Trade told us last Thursday that he is prepared to give consideration to the consequences of an amalgamation of that character. The miners in that village and the local authority will be given the opportunity of consultation which we are asking for in this Clause. In another village in my division there will be a voluntary amalgamation. I want the Minister to realise what my position will be in visiting those two villages. I shall have to explain that in the case of the village where compulsory amalgamation has taken place Parliament has decided to give consideration to those who are adversely affected, but in respect to the other village where a voluntary amalgamation has taken place I shall have to say that Parliament has decided that it shall not receive the same consideration.<br/>
The Secretary for Mines said that there is a difference between the two cases. He said that since compulsory amalgamation is imposed by this House as the result of an Act of Parliament, Parliament is responsible for the consequences and is compelled to give some undertaking; but since voluntary amalgamations take place without that consideration, we are not entitled to give the same undertaking. He is skating on very thin ice in this matter and the miners in my division do not appreciate these nice distinctions. I could understand his argument that if an undertaking such as we ask was given in regard to voluntary amalgamations, similar undertakings might be asked for in respect of voluntary amalgamations in other industries. I see the force of his argument, but it is weakened when we bear in mind what happened last Thursday when, after great pressure had been brought to bear from every party, the President of the Board of Trade promised to give consideration to the question before the Report stage. Is the Minister not prepared to give a similar undertaking as regards voluntary amalgamations as was given by the President of the Board of Trade regarding compulsory amalgamations?<br/>
I hope he will not tell us that there would be difficulty with other industries, which might make a claim in days to come. We are dealing now with a specific industry and with a question which


was dealt with in a certain way last Thursday as regards compulsory amalgamations, and I cannot understand the Secretary for Mines trying to make the distinction. As a result of the Bill, when it becomes an Act, there will be voluntary amalgamations in different parts of the country, during the two years in which those voluntary arrangements can be made before compulsory amalgamations can operate. I would ask the Minister to give us the same undertaking for voluntary amalgamations which has been given for compulsory amalgamations.</p>

<p>After the statement by the Secretary for Mines I wonder whether he understands the Clause. He said that this matter is only the small fringe of a very large problem. It may be the small fringe of a large problem to him but it is not a small fringe to the local authorities and the localities that will be affected. My mind goes back to villages and townships in my division where a quarter of a million pounds have been spent in the building of houses, not by a colliery company but by the locality. Some of those districts are already fairly highly rated. If under voluntary amalgamations they are not to be allowed to put their case, where is the trouble going to end? I have been in my constituency and have met some of the miners who are following this Bill very keenly. I attended my own council the other day, where they had been discussing Part I of the Bill from six o'clock until nearly 10 at night. They said to me: "George, There is nothing in that Bill for us," and they asked me to watch the amalgamations under Part II. Not only did the men put this view to me, but the managing director of a colliery wrote to me and said that they did not want compulsory amalgamations, and that if they had voluntary amalgamations then the township that would be affected should have an opportunity of putting its case before the amalgamation takes place. That is all that we ask for in this Clause.<br/>
With respect to that part of the Clause which asks that wage standards and the conditions and standards of the persons employed in such undertakings will not be prejudicially affected, I could give cases which came to my notice before I was elected to this House, where there were voluntary amalgamations and pits

where strong trade union branches existed were closed because the men had stood out for a good price list. Other pits belonging to the same voluntary amalgamation which were not as strong from the trade union standpoint and had not stood up for a good price list were not closed. No one outside the mining community understands what price lists men, but we in the industry know that it is necessary to be vigilant, because there has been filching in regard to prices. Some of our men have had experiences Wednesday after Wednesday when the deputy has come round and wanted to cut down this price and the other price, but generally the trade union activities have been able to maintain the prices. We are asking that the standards of wages shall not be affected.<br/>
I am sorry that the hon. Member for North Leeds (Mr. Peake) is not present, because I want to refer to a pit that had been voluntarily amalgamated by his business concern. The pit was in a little village that was fairly prosperous, but the pit was closed down and has been closed for five years, with the exception of keeping the pumps going. That has been done because there was a good price list made at that pit and the company could get coal cheaper from a pit five or six miles away. The local authority had put up a considerable number of houses there, and now the place is practically derelict. This is a great problem to the people in my own township, where I live, and the people there are watching it very closely. They have a strong trade union branch there and have maintained price lists since 1926, which cannot be said of many pits.<br/>
My last point is in regard to the transference or absorption of workers who are displaced. In voluntary amalgamations in the past they have not cared a pinch of salt about the men displaced. Where there has been a strong trade union branch and they have maintained price lists and a pit has been shut down, they have not taken the men on at other pits. The men have been turned away, and the next day the company have started other men from districts perhaps six miles away. We look upon this matter with the greatest amount of caution. We ask that in voluntary amalgamations the men who have served the company before the amalgamation should have


the first chance of work with the same company elsewhere.<br/>
I am amazed that the Government are not prepared to accept the new Clause. If the Clause had come from the Government Benches the Government would not only have given it consideration but probably the Secretary for Mines would have said: "We think this is a very nice, reasonable Clause, and on behalf of the President of the Board of Trade and myself I may say that we are prepared to accept it." We do not want sympathy to be shovelled out to us and then to be told when the test comes that the Government cannot accept our Amendment. We ask for a favourable consideration of the Clause, because the matter in question is causing great concern to the mine-workers who have given the best part of their lives to the industry.</p>

<p>; I agree with the hon. Member for the English Universities (Mr. Harvey) that the Minister's reply was unsatisfactory. There can be no doubt about that, because the Minister has put himself in precisely the same position as the colliery company which in relation to amalgamation considers only the narrow point of view of its own interests. Colliery companies have confined themselves to that one consideration in the case of previous amalgamations and the Minister is now taking up exactly the same attitude. Surely it is the duty of the British Parliament to take into consideration all the social questions involved in a matter of this kind and the Minister ought to have regard to the wider issues with which we are concerned. The Minister to-night has given a point-blank refusal to our request and his argument is something like this: There is mechanisation in the mines and that displaces men; we know also that amalgamations will take place. Thus, there are two blacks, says the Minister, in effect, and we want to make a white out of them. But he did not advance one reason why we should not give consideration to the interests of the nation and to the wider social questions involved when he was opposing the proposed new Clause.<br/>
May I give a case from my own district? The colliery in which I began work is a small colliery now employing

600 men, but there are two villages dependent on it. Sooner or later, Monmouthshire collieries will be amalgamated and it may be that that colliery will be closed and those two villages left derelict. That will impose a charge on the nation although the colliery company may get away with a slight advantage for the time being. We see in Merthyr Tydfil at the present time a result of amalgamations and removal of works. It is a standing example. How many millions of pounds of State money have been poured out in that case? It seems to me that the Minister is not prepared to take any step in reference to the matter dealt with in our proposals. He says that it would be dangerous to do so. But there is a well-known precedent for doing something of the kind proposed in the new Clause. In the Third Schedule to the Railways Act of 1921 there is a provision that every existing officer, as from the date of amalgamation or absorption, is to become an officer or servant of the amalgamated company. There is a provision by which in the case of voluntary amalgamations, the amalgamated company has to make provision for every servant displaced by the amalgamation.<br/>
We do not go as far as that, but we ask that some authority should give consideration to all the factors involved, and the Minister's reply is "No." That is a completely unreasonable attitude. It is not in the interests of the nation and Parliament will do a wrong thing if it allows colliery companies to consider only the question of whether or not they will be able to save a 1d. or 2d. or 3d. a ton by closing down certain collieries, when we know that the closing of those collieries will render villages derelict, and deprive people of their livelihood. On Thursday last, when we were discussing compulsory amalgamations, the suggestion was put forward by the President of the Board of Trade that there should be a Parliamentary Committee for the consideration of points that would arise in connection with those amalgamations. My hon. Friend the Member for Seaham (Mr. Shinwell) has now made that proposal to the Minister in regard to voluntary amalgamations. So far, the Minister has turned down that proposal. Is the Minister's attitude not an anti-social one as far as these amalgamations and their consequences are concerned? Is he considering only the welfare of individual


companies? Has he no respect for those communities which may be left derelict by amalgamations?<br/>
All we ask is that full consideration should be given to these matters, and I think we ought to have a more satisfactory reply than has been given to us up to the present. It is no good saying that this proposal does not go far enough. It is at any rate a step in the right direction and the Minister has not advanced any argument to show why that step should not be taken in the interests of the workers and the communities concerned. Local authorities ought to have some status in this matter. For years we have been considering problems of the kind that arise from amalgamations. We call them by all kinds of names. We refer to Special Areas, and distressed areas, and all the rest of them. These problems arise from bad organisation in industry, and if these amalgamations are persisted in without any consideration being given to the interests of the people concerned and the larger questions involved, we shall continue to do damage such as we have already seen in so many mining areas. I ask the Minister to reply to the suggestion made by my hon. Friend the Member for Seaham. This is a tremendously important matter and ought not to be treated lightly by him. He ought to give us a definite reply one way or the other. If he is not prepared to meet our demand, the obligation rests upon him to give more substantial reasons for his attitude than he has given so far.</p>

<p>When my hon. Friend the Member for Consett (Mr. David Adams) described himself as an optimist a smile went round the Committee. I suppose if I call myself a simple unsophisticated country-lover hon. Members will find occasion for amusement. But my lot was cast for many years in green pastures and beside the still waters, and it was not until I came to this great city of London that I realised that such a valuation could be placed upon human life as that which is exemplified in this Bill. The various owners concerned have all been considered except one. The owner of the minerals is to be safeguarded and compensated and the owner of the mine is also to be awarded compensation, but the man who owns the labour which is put into the working of the mine is

ignored and given no consideration under this Bill. The local authorities are also to be left derelict. I have said that I come from a country district. I should explain that it is the derelict area of South-West Durham. If I were to enlarge on the condition of that area I should doubtless be pulled up by the Chair, and I will only refer to the number of mines which have been closed in that area during the last few years&#x2014;not all by amalgamation but some by amalgamation.<br/>
Between 1917 and 1937 the number of mines has been reduced from 91 to 79. The rateable value has fallen and yet the social services have to be kept going by local authorities, and if amalgamations are to continue and if local authorities are to be saddled with further burdens of this kind, they will soon be worse than bankrupt. Not only are the local authorities and the miners affected. The workers generally in those districts are also affected. Much has been said, and I endorse every word of it, about the miners' welfare. We have also to remember that when the miners are out of work tradesmen and people in shops cannot pay their assistants and are compelled to discharge some of those assistants. Not only the miners but shopkeepers and tradesmen are concerned in this matter. In the district to which I refer the number of men engaged in the mines alone, has been reduced from 33,300 to 22,400. We ask that something should be done. The Secretary for Mines said that our proposal only touched the fringe of the problem. Has he forgotten the historic case in which if the hem of the garment were touched, inspiration followed. I suggest that if the Government would only touch the fringe, as we ask them to do in this case, inspiration might come to them and enable them to deal with the problem as a whole.</p>

<p>I cannot think that the very forceful speeches which have been made from this side of the Committee are not going to produce a further reply from the Government. I have seldom listened to a speech which was such a negation of both fact and logic as that which we heard on behalf of the Government. The hon. and gallant Gentleman appeared to think that if Parliament established any sort of control over voluntary amalgama-


tions, it would be a revolutionary principle. My hon. Friend the Member for Pontypool (Mr. Jenkins) has made an interesting reference to the Railways Act, 1921. The existing railway companies cannot engage in voluntary amalgamation without legislative permission and authority and if they came to Parliament for that authority, Parliament would attach to it a provision for compensation against displacement or worsened conditions of employment. My hon. Friends have not yet made their claim in this matter as high as that, but they are making a claim which is in line with the provisions of the Railways Act, 1921.<br/>
The Government's attitude on that point is the negation of fact. The negation of logic is more perplexing. The Minister seems to assume that every compulsory amalgamation agreed to by the Commission will be, or is likely to be, against the public interest, and that, therefore, there must be some appeal against it to a Select Committee of both Houses. He seemed at the same time to assume that voluntary amalgamation over which the Commission has no control, will be in no case against the public interest and that there is no need for any sort of public control over them. Does any hon. Member assume that no voluntary amalgamation can ever have any undesirable characteristics into which public inquiry ought to be made and in regard to which there ought to be public control? I am rapidly coming to the conclusion that the Government's desire is that the mining industry should evade every form of public inquiry and control by hastening on with their voluntary amalgamations so that they will escape the provision promised last Thursday.<br/>
Then the Minister in another so-called argument against the Clause said there were other causes of unemployment than amalgamations, and that these were unavoidable causes. Is it any justification for not dealing with an avoidable cause to say that you cannot at the same time deal with an unavoidable cause? Surely the reasoning should be in the opposite direction. If there is a cause of unemployment over which Parliament can exercise some control, however small, it ought to exercise that control. I add my voice in this Debate in the hope that the Minister even now will see the logic of the arguments

put forward from this side, and will provide some assurance that will satisfy my hon. Friends.</p>

<p>A great many arguments have been put forward, and, if the Minister persistently declines to answer them, we must draw our own conclusion that no effective answer to them can be made. In these circumstances it would be a pity to allow the Debate to end without reviewing briefly the true reasons why the Government are unwilling to accept the Clause. The fundamental point at issue is whether, where amalgamations take place in industry&#x2014;whether compulsory or voluntary it matters not&#x2014;the same provisions of just compensation should apply to the labour that is displaced as to the capital which is injuriously affected. I have noticed, in all these half-hearted Socialistic Measures which Conservative Governments reluctantly put forward, that whenever there is any proposal to expropriate or injuriously affect a money interest there are invariably the most elaborate provisions for compensation for the capital affected or displaced. It is only of late years, under the strongest and most sustained pressure, that the Government have ever recognised that labour displaced is entitled to the slightest consideration.<br/>
The Minister believes that in opposing this new principle he is opposing a revolutionary principle, but in point of fact he is doing the exact opposite, because the strongest argument against the principle of compensating capital is the argument that, when labour is displaced, compensation is invariably refused. I wonder what a coal miner will think when he sees the arguments used to condemn him if he feels reluctant to compensate a capital interest that has been displaced. How much ink has been spilt in criticism of those who in the past have advocated that policy. It is no part of the policy of this party to-day; we wish to compensate equally the labour and the capital interests; but in the past, when the word "confiscation" has been mentioned, the newspapers have been full of criticisms, the hoardings have been placarded with the words "Confiscation is Robbery." What will a coal miner think, as he comes out of a mine which has been compulsorily or voluntarily amalgamated and closed down, if he sees


this criticism against the confiscation of capital? What argument of natural justice can be adduced to show that labour displaced is not entitled to compensation equally with capital displaced? There is no answer to this Clause in common justice, and the reason why the Minister is not able to accept it at present is that it will drive him up against the inevitable conclusion that natural justice in industry at the present time can only be accorded by a thorough-going system of Socialism and State control of industry. We are moving steadily towards that end, and the Minister will be forced to acknowledge it before many years have past.</p>

<p>The Minister has given a point-blank refusal to this Clause. No doubt he will put on the Whips and the Clause will be defeated, and this will be the last occasion on which we shall be able to raise this matter effectively during the passage of the Bill. I want to add one suggestion. When there was a revolt on the other side, twice during the past week, two things happened. On the occasion of the first revolt, with regard to compulsory amalgamation, the Government caved in. They surrendered to a number of people who represent but a tiny fraction of the number represented by those who have spoken from this side to-night. We shall not forget to tell the country that they surrendered to a vested interest but are deaf to the appeals of large masses of the people. The other revolt was on the part of people not quite so important&#x2014;the small industrial consumers, whose voices we heard last night. The Minister did not surrender to them, but he did the next best thing. We were told that he and the President of the Board of Trade met the Central Mining Association, and that, while the Government could not surrender any more, they had had very specific assurances from the Mining Association that such-and-such things should be done. They were read out here yesterday.<br/>
I want to suggest to the Secretary for Mines that, if we are defeated on this Clause, he should once more go and see the coalowners, the people who will be responsible for voluntary amalgamations, who may, indeed, be already busy considering them, not perhaps in London,

but in the mining areas. I would like to see all discussions on the amalgamations of collieries held in the mining villages, so that people could be taken round and shown what the consequences would be if they go on with it. Will the Secretary for Mines approach the coal-owners and ask them to give him another pledge that they will not proceed with any scheme of voluntary amalgamation until they have consulted the Commission and satisfied the Commission that in the voluntary amalgamation there will be the same protective provisions, meagre as they are, that there will be in the case of compulsory amalgamations? I do not think that that is asking too much. The Minister has been to the coalowners to satisfy those on his side who are supporters of money, wealth and privilege. Will he now go to the coalowners and ask them for a pledge not to carry through any voluntary amalgamation unless the same protection is given as is accorded in the case of compulsory amalgamation? Unless he is willing to do that, we shall again remind the country that he went to see the coalowners at the request of the financiers, but will not go to see them at the request of the people.</p>

<p>I would ask the hon. and gallant Gentleman to give an answer on the suggestion which has just been put forward, and which seems to me to be eminently a reasonable suggestion. He went to the coalowners to get them to do things, which he said yesterday could not be put into the Bill, for the benefit of certain interests. Is he willing to go to the coalowners, in the interests of the miners and the local authorities, to get from them, if he can, some undertaking that in future amalgamation schemes there will at least be consultation with those who will be affected? The matter is one of very vital importance. This is the last occasion that we shall have of putting into the Bill a single mention of any sort, kind or description of the mining community or the local authorities as being interested in the mining problem of this country. So far the Bill is absolutely blank as regards any such interests. As far as the Bill goes, they might not exist. We have tried uniformly to get protection for these people inserted, somewhat on the lines of the very elaborate protection that is provided for


other interests. If that cannot be done, will the Minister tell us whether he will at least approach the coalowners and see if they will give some form of guarantee?</p>

<p>On and after the vesting date the following provisions shall apply to all leases of coal or mines in force at that date notwithstanding any provisions in any such lease to the contrary:
<ol>
<li>(1) No minimum or dead rent shall be payable, but the right of the lessee under any such lease to recoupment of any overpayment in respect of past short workings shall not be affected;</li>
<li>(2) If the lessee gives notice in writing to the Commission of his desire to renew a lease not less than six months before the date of determination prescribed therein, the consent of the Commission to such renewal on reasonable terms and conditions shall not be unreasonably withheld, and any question whether such consent is being unreasonably withheld, or whether the proposed terms and conditions or any of them are reasonable and what other terms and conditions are reasonable, shall, if the lessee so require, be referred to arbitration, and the lessee shall be entitled to a renewal of his lease on such terms and conditions as may be found by the arbitrator to be reasonable.&#x2014;[<i>Mr. Peake</i>.]</li></ol></p>

<p>This proposed new Clause and the next one on the Paper, also in the name of the hon. Member for North Leeds (Mr. Peake)&#x2014;(<i>Certain provision of new leases</i>)&#x2014;seem to deal with the same point, the one in the case of existing leases, the other in the case of new leases. I suggest that they should be dealt with in one discussion, and that the second proposed new Clause should be called only for the purpose of being put to the Committee for their decision.</p>

I fully appreciate the suggestion that these two new Clauses should be discussed together. As you have said, Sir Dennis, they raise precisely the same point, but the first deals with existing leases and the second with future leases to be granted by the Commission. I hope that hon.


Members in all quarters of the Committee will be able to understand the meaning of these new Clauses better than I was able to understand the meaning of the last new Clause which we discussed. The first new Clause, the Second Reading of which I now move, is divided into two parts. Sub-section (2) is intended to indicate that there should be a bias in future on the part of the Commission in granting renewals of existing leases, in favour of the party who has been the leaseholder previously. In many parts of the coalfields considerable sums have been sunk in developing mines where there are large quantities of coal still to be worked, but where the lease may only have a few years to run. The colliery owner hitherto has been fully safeguarded by the fact that he could go to the Railway and Canal Commission under the Mines (Working Facilities and Support) Act for an order for the extension of the lease. But that Act as far as it affects coal, is swept away by Clause 18 of the Bill and the security which the colliery owner has hitherto enjoyed, in being able to get a renewal of his lease, may be prejudiced. This Sub-section goes no further than to suggest that there should be a certain bias on the part of the Commission in favour of granting renewals to existing leaseholders rather than new leases to persons who have not been interested in the coalfield previously.<br/>
I do not, however, attach tremendous importance to that part of the new Clause because in many cases it is still possible to extend the duration of leases before the valuation date. The important part of the Clause is Sub-section (1). Hon. Members who understand mining matters are well aware of the evils of the minimum rent system. For many years past I have urged the unification of coalmining royalties, not on any theoretical ground of public advantage, but on the purely practical ground that the working and development of collieries would be made much simpler and could be greatly improved if the colliery proprietor were free to work the parts of the coalfield which could most economically be worked, irrespective of the ownership of the surface and the dead rent payable to each individual surface owner. There is nothing in the Bill to indicate that this very important question of minimum rents will be dealt with by the Commission. In fact, from Clause 21, which lays down what

rents may be reduced and at what time they may be reduced, it appears that this question of minimum rents is going to be put on one side and lost sight of altogether. I find nothing in the Bill to indicate that it is the intention of the Commission to deal with this question from the point of view of the working of the coal mines.<br/>
It is a matter of great practical importance. It affects the amount of travelling which men have to do underground. It affects the lay-out of the pits, the ventilation, and, to some extent, the question of safety. If colliery proprietors knew to-day that in future they could develop their coalfields upon the best practical lines, irrespective of this question of minimum rents which has hampered the industry in the past, the public advantage would be greatly served. I have put down this new Clause in the form of a proposal for the abolition of minimum rents, but it would serve my purpose equally will if minimum rents were merged at each individual undertaking into a single minimum rent for that undertaking. It seems to make very little difference whether you abolish minimum rents, or whether they are so merged at each undertaking as to give freedom to the colliery concerned to work the coal to the best advantage.</p>

<p>What does the hon. Member mean by merging? Does he mean merging them in the royalties?</p>

<p>No. A colliery at present has, on the average, five or six different mineral lessors. To each of those a separate minimum rent has to be paid whether any part of his coal is worked or not. What I am suggesting is that you should merge these several minimum rents into a single minimum rent payable over the whole area of that particular colliery. That would give freedom to work the coal in whatever part of the area it could be most economically developed. This question has assumed additional importance since machine mining came in. In the old days, faces were extended over very wide areas, and it was no inconvenience to get quantities of coal under different surface areas; but with mechanised mining, and the resulting concentration of work underground, this question of minimum rents has become rather an acute one. In fact, it represents the sole


immediate practical advantage of any magnitude to be gained from Part I of the Bill.<br/>
I am fully aware that it is impossible for a private Member to draft any Amendment that will get through the very fine sieve of Departmental and technical criticism, and all that I am asking of the Minister on this Clause is that he shall give some declaration of policy as regards what the Commission is going to do about this matter. We have to plan the development of our mines many years ahead. We are considering to-day what seams are going to be worked in 15 or 20 years' time, and the development of a pit, once settled, is, as hon. Members opposite know, settled very often for all time. Important decisions are being taken every day at collieries as to the future planning of the coal mines. If we could have a declaration that it is the intention of the Commission to merge these minimum rates and treat them in such a way that we shall not be penalised, and if we could henceforth develop our mines on the assumption that these minimum rents will be merged, that would be a great practical immediate help to the coal industry, and I very much hope that the Minister will be able to give us some statement on the lines I have indicated.</p>

<p>It is very difficult to say in advance what may or may not be the policy of the Commission when it comes into being; and I cannot possibly give any firm answer to a question of that kind. I understand that we are discussing my hon. Friend's two proposed new-Clauses together, and that he wishes for some indication that in future there will be a bias towards granting renewals to previous leaseholders instead of to other people. The Clauses deal with three quite different points; while my hon. Friend has attached most importance to the question of minimum rents, they raise other issues. On the question whether in the future there should be a bias in favour of the existing lessee in renewing a lease, I should imagine that the Commission would act, as I said before, as the best possible landlord, and would doubtless have regard to what might be the customary practice in these matters. But, while my hon. Friend suggests that there should be a bias in that direction because

the mining facilities legislation will be swept away by the Bill, it is important to remember how the mining facilities legislation acted. As I understand it, what the Railway and Canal Commission had to consider, if there was a dispute on this question, was whether it was in the national interest that such-and-such a lease should be renewed. The criterion was the national interest.<br/>
The reason why that has disappeared is that, while the mining facilities legislation was introduced as a step which was thought desirable at that time, when Parliament and the country did not wish to advance as far as we are advancing now, there is now to be a statutory Commission, which is to have regard to the general interests and efficiency of the industry, and also to any general directions which the Minister may give in the national interest. Therefore, it is obviously anomalous to have recourse to the Railway and Canal Commission on a matter of public interest which clearly comes within the functions of the stautory Commission. My hon. Friend points out the great advantage that would follow in his view, firstly, if minimum rents were abolished altogether, or, secondly, if they were all merged. But, on the other hand, he suggests that the right of recoupment should be continued&#x2014;a very valuable right, it seems to me&#x2014;without any obligation on the part of the lessee to carry out the terms of the contract into which he has entered. In fact, I think that the benefit of this retention of the recoupment without any obligation as regards minimum rent would mean an immediate remission of something like &#x00A3;400,000 out of the estimated revenue which the Commission would have reason to anticipate as the result of the abolition of royalties.</p>

<p>My hon. and gallant Friend will, of course, remember that, in valuing the royalties at &#x00A3;66,000,000, the fact that there was this liability to repay to the lessees these overpayments of minimum rent was taken into account.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1938-02-08a.908.1" hansard_membership_id="2977" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/13794" speakername="Captain Crookshank" colnum="908" time="">
<p>Nevertheless, it would still be a very great financial advantage to the lessees generally if this provision were made, and that raises the question whether, if there were any remissions of one kind or another, this is a form of remission which would be most valuable, not to the lessees alone, but to the industry generally. I think we must


bear in mind the effect of Clause 21, which we have already passed, and which indicates the kind of considerations which should be borne in mind in any planned relief by the Commission. In general terms, if one colliery is paying more than another, or one district is paying more than another, ways are laid down in Clause 21 by which it may be desirable to reduce its payments. The Commission would consider, in the case of colliery A, B or C, what its all-in obligation amounts to&#x2014;whether it is rent, or minimum rent, or royalty payments, or wayleaves&#x2014;and how the obligation of A compares as a whole with the obligation of B, rather than, as in this case, singling out the minimum rent proposal as the one that should have priority. In the same way, when a proposal was made that royalties should be the first consideration, that proposal was rejected by the Committee. I think the Commission would bear in mind the general burden, say per ton, which any particular lessee found himself having to pay.<br/>
If we were now to abolish all minimum rents as such straight away, it seems to me that it would be contrary to the implication of Sub-section (2) of Clause 21, and it would also be contrary to the first part of that Clause, which expressly says that any planned reduction should be made when there is a revenue surplus foreseeable, that is to say, when it becomes clear in figures that there is a surplus to distribute and that the Commission can afford it. That seems to me to be the answer, as far as I can give it, to the general question that my hon. Friend asked. I know it does not carry one very far, because I am not the Commission, and we cannot know by what motive they will be actuated. But if they act as a good landlord, trying in the interests of the industry to reduce burdens where they are excessive, I think they will probably take all these factors into account.<br/>
As to whether they should consider merging all the minimum rents of one undertaking at any given moment, I should have thought that that question would arise rather in regard to the powers of the Commission to consolidate leases, and that they would be able to do the merging there. But, at the end of that, presumably, there would still have to be some form of minimum rent. I do not believe it would be possible ever to get

away from that, because otherwise there would be no kind of obligation on the lessee at all. Such an obligation was envisaged in the fairly recent legislation with regard to petroleum, where a minimum obligation was laid down. I think we must always have at the back of the lease some form&#x2014;I do not say exactly what&#x2014;of obligation, and that obligation has been brought down by the practice of many years to what is called minimum rent. My hon. Friend did not deal with the other parts of his proposed new Clause; I do not know whether he wants me to do so in advance.</p>

<p>I must ask my hon. and gallant Friend to forgive me. I forgot to say a few words on the question of the arbitration Clause in the new leases. That is a matter to which the industry attaches very considerable importance. All leases hitherto have contained an arbitration clause, and that has worked to the advantage of both parties. In the vast majority of disputes between a colliery lessee and the mineral landlord, the question has been settled without going to law or involving the processes of the courts. We should like to see in any new leases granted by the Commission provisions included with this object.</p>

<p>There are two questions here which might be referred to arbitration. The first is where a lease is being withheld. There is another later on, about refusal to grant a lease. The first question is whether there should be arbitration because renewal has been withheld, and the second is a very much smaller matter, relating to disputes with regard to the provisions of a lease. As the hon. Gentleman said, it is the general practice to have some sort of clause of that kind in a lease. We must assume that, as the Commission would wish to act as a good landlord&#x2014;indeed as the best possible landlord&#x2014;it would not be likely to throw aside a practice which all good landlords have made customary. I do not think anyone could lay down in an Act of Parliament what a lease should or should not contain. As to whether there should be arbitration because a lease has been withheld, that is quite another matter. If it is reasonable for a lease to be continued, no doubt the Commission will continue it, but if you are going to expect the Commission to act as


a good landlord they must be the ultimate arbitrators as to whether they shall grant a lease, because, if not, the Commission's functions in that direction must be almost nugatory. Whether that is the answer the hon. Member expected or not, I do not know; but that is the answer that must be given. If there are any further points which arise I will try to deal with them as they come up.</p>

<p>Am I right in understanding that when the Commission take over the leases, they do not take over any liability for dead rents, or for allowing those dead rents to be worked off, although they have received &#x00A3;400,000 on account of those dead rents?</p>

<p>I congratulate the Government on a slight access of backbone. In the past, even an advertisement issued by the Mining Association has been enough to cause them to collapse. Perhaps the explanation is that this is a more rapacious demand than even the Mining Association should dare to put forward. The hon. Member for North Leeds (Mr. Peake) has Oliver Twist beaten to a frazzle. The more the mineowners get, the more they demand. I am only surprised that they do not say that no rent should be payable in respect of mining leases. Will the hon. Member remember that the Commission are paying on the basis of certain dead rents? How would he appreciate it if he were asked to purchase 12 houses on each of which a minimum rent of &#x00A3;50 a year had been placed, and then he had the condition thrown upon him that he must not charge the minimum rate in future, thereby destroying the value of the properties? That is what hon. Members are trying to do in this case. The truth is that dead rents have been a problem in the past, and they are a problem, no doubt, that the Commission will have to consider; but to deprive the Commission of that for which Parliament is compelling them to pay would be fantastic. The hon. Member for North Leeds mentioned a number of things, but one thing he forgot to mention was the property of

the mineowners, who would obviously benefit very largely if the burden of dead rents were removed from their shoulders. They would get the benefit, first, of the payment for dead rents, and, then, of the abolition of dead rents as well.</p>

<p>I do not follow the right hon. Gentleman's reply to my very simple suggestion, which, as far as I could see, was that the Commission would take over the liability either to refund dead rents or allow them to be worked off against the new leases. The Commission have received a benefit, representing the liability to dead rents, and they are under an obligation to pass on the benefit so received.</p>

<p>It would be the least un-businesslike thing that the hon. Member and his friends have done under the Bill. If there is an existing lease, under which the coalowner is entitled to claim back the dead rent or minimum rent he has paid in the past against his future working, that arrangement will continue.</p>

<p>If it is not carried on, it will come to an end, just as it does to-day. The ordinary mineral owners will bring it to an end whenever it terminates. The same will happen with the Commission. On the question of arbitration, it is surely quite obvious that if one is setting up an authority, such as the Commission, to reorganise the coal industry, it will be no good substituting an arbitrator for that Commission, because if you do you ore making the arbitrator the person who is going to plan the industry, and not the Commission. I intervened to protect the Minister against further onslaughts by telling him that we will support him.</p>

<p>If there were no dead rents there would be no check on obstructive tactics on the part of the Mining Association. If a mineowner, dealing with the Government in respect of new-leases, had no dead rent to pay on other leases, he would be able to go on strike. The object of dead rents is to ensure maximum production. It is the safeguard of the public. The dead rents are the exact parallel to the taxation or rating of land value. They are rents which are to be paid, year in and year out, whether the


land or the minerals are used or not. In so far as they fall on the mineowner to-day, they ensure the maximum production of coal. We want to ensure maximum production.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That the Clause be read a Second time."<br/>
I welcome the opportunity of moving the Second Reading of this Clause and of making a few observations upon it. Frankly, I stand here as a very disappointed man. I put a question to the Secretary for Mines this afternoon, and it is worth repeating in order that we may keep his reply in retrospect. The question was not put down by me as an

individual but on behalf of those who comprise different political parties, a large municipality and a number of rural district councils and other public institutions. The question was:
<q>To ask the Secretary for Mines, if he is aware of the public concern recently expressed in the North Staffordshire area over the effect of subsidence; and if he will reconsider the Government's policy on the question and take some steps to ease the burden on people caused by the effect of subsidence.</q>
The reply of the Secretary for Mines was:
<q>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative. With regard to the second part, I am afraid that there is no statement that I can usefully make at present.</q>
That reminded me of our last week's experience, of a debate on the Coal Bill, of what I have read in the Press and of what I have heard going on behind the scenes since the Coal Bill was introduced. There can be concessions for coal barons, well-organised vested interests, and financiers, but no concessions from this Government to poor people who have sunk their life savings in property in mining areas of the kind of which I am speaking. But despite that pessimistic view of the situation which I am bound to take, I am still optimistic enough to believe that we may yet receive a statement from the President of the Board of Trade which will give some hope to the people for whom I am speaking. As a result of


what the Committee has already approved, provided another place endorses what has been agreed to, amalgamations will now be encouraged when the Bill becomes an Act. That will mean that in areas of the kind of which I am speaking there will be more concentration upon mining than ever before in the history of this country. Old workings will be left.<br/>
I have a picture in mind of an area a few miles from the division which I represent where voluntary amalgamations have already had a very deadly effect upon the area. According to the geological experts there are thousands of tons of coal still in that area, old workings are being flooded and subsidence is still taking place. As a result of these amalgamations the effect of subsidence will be intensified in districts of this character, and, therefore, it is more important than ever that municipalities should have the right of access to the plans of those old workings, and to plans when it is proposed to sink other pits. It is for these reasons that I am moving this Clause. In addition, I have had a recent conversation with very competent surveyors, who pointed out to me the importance of this Clause and the need for something of this character being done. These surveyors, public-spirited men with no political bias at all, are doing great work in these areas under great difficulties, and if this Committee is to be fair to them it is most essential that a Clause of this description should be inserted in the Bill in order that they may have access to old and new workings in carrying out their duties to the local municipality.<br/>
In these areas, particularly in the area I represent, the difficulties of the municipalities in regard to housing are beyond description. No one can realise them unless he is living in an area of this kind. It is the policy of the Government to encourage individuals to sink their life savings in the purchase of their own houses, and when they have done so they are subject to the subsidences and have to spend hundreds of pounds in carrying out repairs. This ought not to be a responsibility on the individuals who have purchased their houses. Local education authorities have also to meet a very serious situation as a result of mining subsidence. Indeed, as a result of the need for increasing the

educational facilities for the children in the area for which I am speaking, it is proposed to build a number of new schools and extend one or two of the old schools, but they are proposing as a result of subsidence to build these new schools miles-and miles away from where the children live. Such a situation is not fair to the municipality, to the children or to the people resident in the area. The Government ought to do something to ease the difficulties of these people. I have been looking at the Royal Commission's Report on mining subsidence, and this is what they say in regard to the Don area:
<q>The results of underground coal workings are special in character, exceptional in their incidence and serious in their extent.</q>
That might have been the position at that time, but now that situation is not exceptional and the seriousness can be found in many other areas. What the Royal Commission says with regard to the Don Valley is equally true, without any exaggeration at all, of the North Staffordshire area. In their final report the Royal Commission say:
<q>In this context we suggest that in connection with preparation and also with the subsequent development of town planning and housing schemes local authorities should be entitled to accurate information as to the present workings and the future development of minerals.</q>
That is all we are asking in the new Clause. Mr. Evan Williams who, of course, is not friendly to hon. Members on this side of the House, spoke as follows on behalf of the coalowners:
<q>I think it is quite fair that any prospective builder should be entitled to obtain accurate information as to what is going on underneath and as to what is likely to go on underneath the land on which he is going to build.</q>
And Mr. Williams went on to say that he would put the local authority in the same position in that respect. That is all we are asking. In dealing with poor people, or comparatively poor people, the Royal Commission say:
<q>The other party, however, had to buy because a house in the area was for him a necessity, and the area was limited.</q>
In their recommendations on page 54 they say:
<q>We are satisfied from the evidence we have heard that in certain circumstances facilities should be given for the inspection of the underground plans of colliery companies.</q>


That is all we are asking. We want the recommendation of the Royal Commission put into effect. Fourteen years after that report we are asking, not for anything revolutionary, not for Socialist proposals to be put into operation, but that the Government should carry out the recommendation of the Royal Commission. When we have discussed this matter before I have heard hon. Members opposite say&#x2014;I can hear them saying so now&#x2014;</p>

<p>The absence of hon. Members opposite is but typical. When we are considering anything which is going to affect vested interests, or landed proprietors or the coal barons, the House is full of hon. Members, but when we are considering anything which affects poor people, the unemployed or the miners, these benches are full but the benches opposite are just as we see them now. I have heard it asked, why build in these places, why run the risk of subsidence? The reply is that these people have to live in these areas, they obtain their livelihood there. Shopkeepers obtain their livelihood there and the municipality is bound to carry on. In the area for which I am speaking the whole city is built on a coalfield and subject to subsidence and, therefore, it is only reasonable that this Clause should be inserted in the Bill to enable a municipality to take steps to deal with this matter in the future. Despite the fact that I opened on a pessimistic note I hope the President of the Board of Trade will make on the question of subsidence a statement which will give some hope to these people. When I visit the South of England and see the parasitic centres and the way the people live, and I realise that they obtain their incomes from areas like the one for which I am speaking, I say, it is not fair or right or reasonable that this situation should exist, and I hope this Clause will do something to bring about an improvement.</p>

<p>I have very little to add to the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke (Mr. E. Smith), except to say that both my hon. Friend and myself, in proposing this new Clause, have the support of the local authority of Stoke-on-Trent, which contains the two

constituencies of Stoke and Hanley. All that the new Clause asks for is that the local authority shall be given power to obtain information which is absolutely essential when it has to deal with subsidence. There are other local authorities besides that of Stoke-on-Trent which suffer from subsidence, but the Stoke-on-Trent authority claims that there is no other city in the Kingdom which has such tremendous difficulties in finding suitable sites for new public buildings and re-housing. Stoke-on-Trent has spent thousands of pounds in getting reports from mining experts.<br/>
Under the new Clause, local authorities would have power to inspect and take copies of, or extracts from, all plans required to be kept under any Statutory enactment of the workings of any mines. Moreover, the local authority would be empowered to inspect the workings of mines at all reasonable times and without payment, and to take such measurements as they might consider necessary. Surely, that is not asking too much. It does not necessarily follow that information acquired in that way would be used for any other purpose than that stated in the new Clause, that is to say, to enable the local authority to come to a decision as to whether any proposed building on a certain site would be affected by subsidence. It is increasingly difficult in Stoke-on-Trent, with the very few sites which are left, for the local authority to come to any decision unless it has access to the workings for the purpose of taking extracts from the plans or making measurements. In a previous Debate on the Bill, I brought to the notice of the Committee the fact that present commitments, or commitments in the very near future, for creating rafts for the prevention of subsidence and the sinking of houses or for under-pinning schools amount to &#x00A3;140,000. I appeal to the right hon. Gentleman the President of the Board of Trade to give this new Clause his earnest and full consideration, and, in order to assist local authorities who have such difficulty in finding suitable sites, to agree to the new Clause being added to the Bill.</p>

<p>I wish briefly to support the new Clause. I have been asked to do so by the South Shields Property Owners' Federation. It is not often that they


favour me with their instructions, or even with their requests, but they know I am a person who desires to represent the whole of the constituency, and not merely those enlightened individuals who cast their votes for me, because while there is life there is hope, even for members of a property owners' association. Owing to the growth of town-planning, it is usual, when property changes hand, for a very close search to be made in the offices of the local authority with regard to all the disabilities that may attach to the development of any piece of land. In an area such as South Shields, which, like Stoke-on-Trent, has been built on a number of coalmines, some of them very old ones, it is essential that there should be in the offices of the local authority available for that authority and for the inspection of those who contemplate buying land in the district&#x2014;</p>

<p>I realise that that is the position as far as the new Clause is concerned, and that the information which

is legally obtainable by the authority is limited to that sort of information; but I suggest that it will be of very considerable value to the general public as indicating the lines of these workings and that it will avoid a good many of the difficulties which have been mentioned by my hon. Friend. It must be borne in mind that even under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act, the local authorities grant very many mortgages to people who apply to them for assistance in the acquisition of their houses. Surely, a local authority will be entitled in those cases to ascertain whether they are lending their money in connection with a house that may be liable to subsidence.</p>

<p>I do not desire to get involved in an argument with you, Sir Dennis, on points of that kind. May I put it in this way? This would be the recognition of the right of the local authority, limited according to the words of the new Clause to those parcels of land in which they have a direct interest, to information that is of the greatest value to them. It is the assertion of a principle that ought to have been recognised many years ago. It was recommended 13 or 14 years ago by the Royal Commission, and I can only hope that the Minister will not ride off on that fact. Though Mr. Evan. Williams cannot think so much about it now as he used to do because he is more occupied with issuing advertisements, he would probably be prepared to say to-day what he said in 1924. We could only hope that with so strong a supporter as Mr. Evan Williams we shall have the blessing of the Minister.</p>

<p>I was going to say that I have considerable sympathy with the object of the new Clause. I will add to the time-honoured formula that I would like to help the hon. Gentleman who moved it to get in substance what he seeks, although I did not think the new Clause is the best or the right way of doing it. The new Clause is confined to local authorities and I do not see why it should be so confined. The influential body which has given the hon. Member for South Shields (Mr. Ede) a temporary and, I


hope, transient support, is as much entitled as the local authorities to the information. The right hon. and gallant Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Colonel Wedgwood) has an Amendment to one of the Schedules which would try to give this sort of advantage to all who are interested, rather than to the local authorities alone. That, I think, is only right. The hon. Gentleman referred to the report of the Royal Commission and the statement made there by Mr. Evan Williams. I do not know whether he knows the subsequent history of that recommendation of the Royal Commission. When it came to be considered it was found that it was in conflict with a principle which had been adopted in most mining legislation, namely, the secrecy of information of this kind. It was felt, and felt rightly, that, although it might be right that a person who had a direct interest on the surface, that is, the property owner or the local authority, should get information, he should not broadcast the information which always by law had been protected with secrecy.<br/>
The result was that 10 years ago a guarantee was given by the mineowners that, although they would not publish this information, any one who had a reasonable interest&#x2014;and that included the local authority&#x2014;should have access to all the information that was necessary as regards both the past and the present workings of the mine. The guarantee went further and gave something which, I venture to say, is really of greater value to the local authorities or the property owners, but it is something which could hardly be secured by statute. They promised not only to give information about past and present workings, but to give, as far as they could, information as to the probable trend of future workings. In my submission the inquirer will probably be more interested in the way developments are going to take place and in being given some idea under what area of the surface coal is going to be extracted than he is in the actual plans of the old mine workings. That guarantee was given 10 years ago. I have made inquiries, and, as far as I can make out, there has never been any complaint made to the Mines' Department that the guarantee has not been implemented or that any person who reasonably required this information had not been given it. As far as the workings

of individual collieries are concerned, therefore, the present position under this guarantee, implemented as it has been, probably gives to local authorities and to others more than is asked for in this new Clause because it gives information as to future workings as well as information about past workings.<br/>
Let me pass to the new situation created by this Commission and to the part that the Commission could play in giving information of this kind. I doubt whether, the Commission itself would really be able to add anything to the information which can now be obtained from the individual collieries as regards areas which are already fully developed. Where an area is being fully worked the colliery itself is much more able to give the information as to the probable trend of its working than the Commission.</p>

<p>I am afraid I am not making myself clear. I have explained that under the existing practice, which I have not heard challenged, people who have reasonable grounds for getting this information have access to individual collieries, and I am suggesting that, in addition to that, it may well be that the Commission will be able to give additional help to people who are interested. I do not think they could give much help in the developed areas. There the individual collieries could supply all the information that was necessary and give the best opinion as to future workings. Where, I think, the Commission can be of help is when it comes to a question of developing new areas. There the Commission, with the whole plans in its mind, will be able to give to the local authority or the property owner useful information as to the direction in which developments will take place. The Commission cannot be set up until this Bill becomes an Act, and I can give no pledge on behalf of a non-existing


body, but I can promise that as soon as the Commission is set up I will bring to its notice this Debate, the points that have been raised, and the suggestions that I have made in reply to them. Although I can give no undertaking, I have no doubt that the Commission, answerable to the public, will clearly have to give every consideration to the local authorities and the property owners under whose property there may be workings, and will, in fact, be ready to do so.</p>

<p>Does not Clause 45 present some difficulty, because under that Clause any person who discloses information obtained by him in the exercise of the powers conferred under Clauses 13 and 41 is liable to punishment?

<p>That is right, and that is why I am suggesting that the present system of going to the individual colliery undertakings for plans of existing workings should remain. Where I am suggesting that the Commission could help is by giving their opinion as to the trend of future developments, by simply saying, "We are proposing to give leases for the development of such and such a bit of coal, and therefore the working is likely to extend in such and such a direction." That is the kind of opinion, which is now given by the individual mineowner about his own bit of leasehold, which I am suggesting should be given by the Commission about the developments in any new area. I will certainly consider whether it would not be possible in the development of an entirely new area to include in the general direction the instruction that as far as possible the local authorities or other property owners concerned should be given some indication of the likely trend of the developments. In that way I think it will be possible to secure that the interested parties do have the fullest possible information as to past and present workings and, what I think is from their point of view even more important, be given in good faith the best possible opinion as to the likelihood of future working and be able by that means to avoid difficulties.</p>

<p>Future developments are not what we are suffering from. People may possibly get good advice from the Commission about the future, but we are troubled about the present. On that we have had a valuable statement but, unfortunately, it is but a statement and does not altogether coincide with the facts. Stoke-on-Trent is one of the places which have suffered most of all from subsidence, and the town clerk of Stoke-on-Trent asked us to put forward this new Clause because under the standing arrangement which, we are told, has been observed so constantly for ten years, Stoke-on-Trent fails to get the information they require. If that understanding had always been observed I do not think there would have been so much need for us to take action, but when a local authority itself is unable to get the plans it wants and to see where it can safely put its schools or its main drains or its roads, what chance is there of a small property owner getting the information from the colliery company? A small man has no chance whatever of finding out whether it is a particular pit which has caused the damage to his house. He would be laughed at if he applied to know.</p>

<p>Yes, but the right hon. Gentleman in his reply dealt both with property owners and with local authorities, and I thought that I might point out that a local authority is naturally in a better position than a small man to get the information, and that if the authority cannot get it the small man stands no chance at all. That agreement, which was to obviate all the necessity of legislation such as this, is not an agreement which is of much use, and the reason is that it is not binding on all colliery companies. They have the right to decide whether the demand is based upon "a reasonable ground." What seems reasonable to the local authority or the man whose property has suffered may not seem a reasonable ground to a colliery company, who might say, "The damage has been done by some other gentleman and not by me."


The position of the colliery owners in refusing this information in future will be infinitely stronger. Once this Bill is passed they will say, "I refer you to Clause 45. Under that Clause it is a punishable offence to disclose the secret plans of the workings of this mine." The position of the colliery company will be stronger and the position of the local authority weaker, so that the need for this Clause is greater after the right hon. Gentleman's speech than it was before. He is relying upon a bargain which may or may not have been carried out but which is less likely to be carried out in the future.</p>

<p>I seem to have said something which was misunderstood. What I suggested was that the mine-owners might say that the passage of this Bill terminated the conditions under which they gave a promise 10 years ago and that the promise does not hold any longer. As they are to be approached on all these other matters could they not be approached to say whether that promise holds good?</p>

<p>Could they not renew that promise in the shape of a legal Clause in this Bill? This is no more than a promise between an evanescent body of people and a Minister who changes. We have the authority of a Lord Chancellor for saying that a Bill such as this is the occasion on which such a change should be made. He said in reference to a matter like this:
<q>If it is desired to alter the mining law in this drastic manner the proper place for such an innovation to take place is in a mining Bill.</q>
Here is the mining Bill. Why are these plans to be kept so wonderfully secret? Why cannot they be inspected even by the authorised servants of a local authority? The refusal to submit these plans must give rise to a certain amount of suspicion. No other plans are kept secret like this, except the plans of Government battleships which it is desired to keep secret from the foreigner. The plans of every factory we put up are submitted to the local authority, as are the plans of every building, of every street. And they are public property, to be seen by everybody. Yet these plans of underground workings, which cannot be seen by the light of day are particularly, and especially, kept secret in an Act of Parliament pressed upon the Government by the owners of these properties. Is it that the workings that took place during the War were not exactly shown to the Government or to the local authority? Is it that they have sometimes trespassed underground upon other people's property? What is the reason for this special secrecy in connection with these plans of underground workings on which the safety of all property on top depends? The operative words of the Clause are:
<q>A local authority shall have power to inspect all plans, made under any statutory enactment, of the workings of any mines where in the opinion of the local authority the workings of such mines would be likely to affect the surface of any land upon which the local authority contemplates erecting any buildings.</q>
It seems to me that that is the very least that you could give a local authority. In Stoke-on-Trent they have lost, I should think, &#x00A3;100,000 in damage to public buildings or works. What we are asking is that when they put up public buildings


in future they should know the risk that they face. It seems to me madness to refuse them the right to know whether in putting up a school or running a sewer they can avoid the risk of complete destruction. What applies to Stoke applies even more to my own borough, where we own all the land, and the land we do not own we are in process of buying. We sell it to builders and all we want is an entire plan showing where the workings are. I cannot for the life of me see who is to suffer through these plans being in the hands of the local authorities, if the owners of the mines have worked them honestly and have not trespassed on other people's property or made the divisions between different mines thinner than they ought to be.<br/>
We have been turned down in every effort that we have made to improve the position of people who are suffering a grave injustice. That injustice was recognised by the Royal Commission, which was appointed only about a dozen years ago after an enormous agitation brought about by the injustice suffered by these same people. It reported and gave great satisfaction to those who got it appointed and who had grounds of complaint which were proved to be reasonable. The Government has done nothing since it reported, and it is refusing every single Amendment to this Bill designed to ameliorate the position of these people. They are small property owners, and they can be neglected. They are only the poorer local authorities&#x2014;heavily rated local authorities&#x2014;and they can be neglected. We appeal for people who are suffering from what is recognised as an injustice and the entire population of North Staffordshire&#x2014;Labour, Liberal and Conservative, the entire local Press, and the entire town councils of Stoke and Newcastle ask for this small instalment of justice.</p>

<p>When the right hon. Gentleman rose to reply to my hon. Friend's excellent speech, with its very modest request, I thought he was going to show a little generosity. He has shown none up to now to this side in anything in the Bill. He started off very well by not only saying that he was going to accept the principle of the new Clause, but that he thought that it did not go far enough and he would like to go even further. Before very long, however, he became as

timid as he has been all the time the Bill has been under discussion, and up to now we have no promise whatever of anything to meet the position stated by my hon. Friend. He asks that local authorities should have an opportunity of seeing the plans, should know the location of the seams, and be aware of what there is in the immediate district. There is nothing that can satisfy us except some words in the Bill. No promise by a Minister is sufficient to meet a position of this kind. It is not sufficiently laid down in law that knowledge that has been obtained during the last few years must be communicated to local authorities. In some cases when establishing housing sites they have been able to obtain the information by consulting the district valuer, but that is not the position generally with regard to information regarding the danger of subsidence. Everyone in an area that is likely to suffer from the effects of subsidence should be able to know whether or not they are building in a suitable place, and whether that danger exists.<br/>
I remember when there were collieries which had no plans, and there was no knowledge whatever of the circumstances. When I was a boy the water flooded into one pit and all the tubs and rails had to be left because no one knew the position in the colliery and what danger they were approaching. The only man left in the pit, where I was a workman and a checkweighman, who knew anything whatever about it was retained in the employment in order to give what little information he had to guide the company so that they should not work up to the danger point where water might break in. In my locality I have seen rows of houses which have been split in two because there was not the knowledge that there ought to have been, even in the colliery company, as to the risk to property in danger of subsidence.<br/>
I might give my own case. I live in a mining area which is very well mined, and within half a mile of one side of my house, into which I have just gone, is a colliery. The other day I was riding up to Leeds in an omnibus and I spoke to one of the miners who is working there. I said: "Where are you working now?" and he told me that it was only 200 or 300 yards beyond my house. There is immediate danger of subsidence there, but it is not in the common knowledge


of the people, and it ought to be possible for a person like myself, having been a member of a local authority for 20 years before I came here, to obtain information and to know what the dangers are. It is terrible when people who have spent all their savings on a cottage see it destroyed in a night. Since I became a Member for Parliament I have visited mining districts where I have seen the doors broken away from the walls, and bedroom floors falling down. Rows of houses have been destroyed by reason of subsidence, and compensation ought to be paid to the people by those who are responsible for it.</p>

<p>I agree, Captain Bourne, but I was drawn to that point because I believe it, and I felt that it ought to be said. All we are asking is the opportunity to develop our knowledge as to the position of our own country and our own localities where people are threatened with dangers which are not clear to the eye and are not within immediate knowledge.<br/>
At the beginning of his speech, the right hon. Gentleman sympathised with the new Clause. He went further than sympathy, and said that he agreed with the principle of it, and felt that it ought to go further. He said he would try to see that the Commission were informed of the matter, after they were appointed and the Bill had become an Act, so that they might see whether it was possible to take some steps in this direction. The right hon. Gentleman is not going very far if he inserts definite words in the Bill, which he must do or we must vote against this matter, because it is so serious in every mining area. We appeal to him to put in words that the necessary information shall be given to the local authority and to people who live in areas similar to those which have been mentioned in the Debate, in order that we may avoid dangers or be aware of them, should they at any time come upon us.</p>

<p>I hope that the Minister will consider this matter and take it a step further than the indications already given. He has promised to give the new Clause

sympathetic consideration and he told the Committee that the views of the Mining Association had been taken as to the ultimate effect of it upon the future working of the collieries. I have served upon local authorities for quite a number of years and we have been extremely anxious to carry this matter a stage further than a mere promise regarding the opinion of the Mining Association. The President of the Board of Trade said that he would consider giving instructions to the new Commission, when set up, regarding the objects of the new Clause. We have had a very large experience in our area, and we are anxious that this proposal should be carried into legislative effect by appropriate words being inserted in the Bill.<br/>
Any amount of sympathy is given all along the line to local authorities and everybody concerned, but nothing appears to be given which has any practical effect. I have not been asked to support this Clause on behalf of the Property Owners' Association. It sounds rather intriguing that my hon. Friend who sits at the back should be speaking on behalf of the property owners.</p>

<p>I support the Clause on behalf of what, I believe, is the second largest rural district council in England and Wales. I have the direction of the Chair that I should be entitled to discuss the Clause from the standpoint of a local authority, whereas I should not be entitled to do so from the standpoint of a property owners' association. The local authority which asked me to support this Clause is larger in population and area than some of the county authorities in this country, and it is important that one should indicate the lines on which they have asked me to speak. For 14 miles right in the centre of my division, the effect of subsidence is affecting the operations of local authorities all along the Rother Valley.<br/>
My hon. Friend, in a very interesting speech introducing this Clause, called attention to what the Commission had to say with regard to Doncaster. I want to call the attention of the Committee to the actual facts relating to the Valley of the Rother. We now know that the Valley of the Rother has, within the last 15


years, sunk approximately a foot per year, a measure of the subsisdence that has been taking place all along the valley. To-day houses owned by the local authority, gas mains and water mains, as well as sewage farms, are all submerged in times of heavy rainfall to a maximum of five, six or seven feet of water. Some of the council houses in the Rother Valley are so badly affected that new access has had to be made into the property and the tenants reside in the bedrooms. When an appeal was made to the proper Departments for the matter to be considered, those Departments could do nothing.<br/>
Many views have been expressed with regard to preventing this subsidence, and it is not an answer for the President of the Board of Trade or his Department to indicate what should be done in regard to the future planning of the mining industry in these areas. It is not a question of these areas alone. Wherever coal is won in this country, subsidence is bound to take place. There is only one way of preventing it that I know of, and that is not to take the coal out. If you take the coal out, the surface will go down. I am asked to support this Clause on behalf of the Rotherham Rural District Council, whose property down the valley is affected for some miles. It is a serious matter to them, because their sewerage farms, their water mains, their gas mains, and their houses are all being affected. I hope the Minister will not try&#x2014;I do not think he is trying&#x2014;to impress the Committee that he is so anxious to put this matter right, because I believe that if he is anxious to put it right, he will not rely merely on promises from the Mining Association or on any directions to the Commission when it is set up. I think the only right and logical way to deal with the matter is to put the appropriate Clause in the Bill.</p>

<p>I always feel a little nervous at addressing a crowded House, and therefore I am very glad that you, Sir, have called upon me at a relatively early hour, because although the Chamber is now filling up and the right hon.

<p>It is like our complaints of a concession by the Government. As it is always a question whether it is a concession or not, so this is a question of whether there was a joke or not. I want to consider seriously what the right hon. Gentleman has done, because he has done two very important things. The first is that he has entirely conceded the principle for which the mover of the Clause is contending. He has conceded absolutely that it is right and proper that the private interest of the colliery owner ought to give way in the public interest to the desire of local authorities really to know the facts, which are often very expensive to ascertain and without which rights cannot be enforced or safeguarded without the trouble of litigation. Indeed, the right hon. Gentleman said he would like to go further, or help us to go further, in various respects, so that we do not need to argue the case for the Clause, which is conceded.<br/>
Then comes this very much more important consideration. The right hon. Gentleman says, "Don't trouble to put it in an Act of Parliament. Our masters have told us that we can have the information from time to time without a Clause in the Bill." That is a very important principle and wants investigation, Lawyers and laymen in this country have been brought up to believe that the source of rights is the Common Law and the Statute Law, and textbooks have been written on the assumption, generally very bad ones, that those are the sources of our rights, but in future, if what the right hon. Gentleman says is correct, the textbooks will have to say, "This is the Common Law, and it does not give you a right to information; this is the Statute, and it does not give you a right to information, but on the authority of the President of the Board of Trade, speaking in the House of Commons on such and such a date, the coalowners of the country will in fact concede you the information to which the law does not entitle you." We are asked to accept as apparently better than a statutory right, which can be construed and enforced by a court, the promise of the colliery owners.<br/>
Now colliery owners are some of them good and some of them bad. We have one or two very good ones in this House, and we look up to them with reverence as a sort of exhibit; and there are others, not necessarily in this House, who are very bad. The history of the relations between both the industry and the public and the employer and the employed, in the colliery industry of this country is one of the most outrageous scandals in the last 200 years, and it is to an unorganised, uncertain, and shifting body of that kind that we are asked to look for our rights, which could be put in a Clause in five minutes. When we come to any particular case and some local authority wants some particular information and says to the board of the colliery, "May we have this information?" supposing the colliery replies&#x2014;and we are told that this is the sort of thing that has happened, although we are told that other colliery owners have loyally abided by these somewhat ill-defined undertakings&#x2014;" We do not think the undertaking covers this," you cannot go to the law court and say, "Will you decide whether I have a right to this," because the thing resides in a sort of gentlemen's agreement, and we know what gentlemen's agreements are. I do not know even whether this undertaking is to be found set down in writing anywhere. Would the right hon. Gentleman put it in a Schedule to the Bill? That would give it, of course, all by itself, no legal validity whatever, but at any rate a little more definiteness to people seeking, not for their rights, but for the privileges which we ought to accept, instead of our rights, as suggested by the right hon. Gentleman.<br/>
This is a very important and a very dangerous principle. Why should it not be carried a little further? Why should it not be applied to the Income Tax? Do not enact that people must pay Income Tax, but explain to the House, when it comes to the Income Tax, that the Income Taxpayers' Association has given an undertaking that they will pay, and if there is any dispute about how much is due, you will ask the taxpayer what he thinks is fairly due from him, and you will accept that from him. There are moments, when I have to pay my Income Tax, when, from a purely selfish point of view, I could quite commend that

sort of thing. We are being asked tonight to accept, instead of a statutory right, an unworded undertaking by a Mining Association or some other body connected with the colliery industry which will have to be implemented by the honour or good faith of undefined colliery owners, some of whom very likely do not even exist, if they do not yet own the mines, but will own them next year. I appeal to the right hon. Gentleman to say that the best place in which to give people rights of great importance in this way is not an undertaking of the colliery owners, who really control the Government, but something tangible set down in the Statute.</p>

<p>Let it be remembered that we are not asking for information which need be disadvantageous to the coalowners. We are asking for information which, if it is not given, will be a disadvantage to the local authority. The right hon. Gentleman has made another promise. He has given an assurance that when that Commission is set up&#x2014;and meantime he cannot speak for the Commission, because there is no Commission&#x2014;he will approach the Commission and ask for an assurance that this matter will be considered. He has given a further assurance that the coalowners, as they have done in the past 10 years, so he said, will continue to furnish the requisite information to the local authorities.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1938-02-08a.980.2" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. Stanley" colnum="980" time="">

<p>The right hon. Gentleman points out that they will give such information as is at their disposal with regard to future developments. May I direct the right hon. Gentleman's attention to this important factor in the situation? He has given assurances on behalf of the Commission that is to be set up, arising out of the Bill, and he has given certain assurances on behalf of the coalowners, but none whatever on behalf of the Board of Trade. If on some future occasion the right hon. Gentleman is questioned in this House with regard to the assurances that he has given tonight, he may reply: "I have done my best. I have approached the Commis-


sion and I have an assurance from the coalowners; but the Commission find themselves unable to carry out the assurance they have given, for some reason or another, and the coalowners similarly are unable to fulfil the assurance they gave to me." He will be able to excuse himself on those grounds. Surely, that is a most unsatisfactory position for hon. Members. If there is a legitimate grievance&#x2014;the right hon. Gentleman does not dispute the existence of a legitimate grievance; in fact, he expressed sympathy for the local authorities, the property owners and others affected by subsidences&#x2014;surely we ought to have from the President of the Board of Trade a definite assurance in black and white that he will make himself responsible for the obligation into which he has entered to-night.<br/>
When the hon. Member for Rothwell (Mr. Lunn) was speaking he referred, in passing, to the question of compensation, and you very properly directed his attention to the fact that we are not discussing compensation in this Clause. Surely, that emphasises the modest character of the proposal. We are not asking for compensation in respect of subsidence, although a case could be made out for compensation. All that we are asking is that local authorities adversely affected by subsidences and will continue to be so affected by subsidences in future, should have the right to be informed, so that they may be able to proceed with social development in a normal fashion. As regards the question of information, may I remind the right hon. Gentleman that the Mines Department for many years has been preparing a catalogue of abandoned mines. Abandoned mines are referred to in this Clause. Is it not possible for the local authorities to approach the Mines Department and obtain information in respect of the workings of abandoned mines, on the understanding that they will not disclose anything that is confidential or anything which might be disadvantageous to the coalowners? If the right hon. Gentleman will give a definite assurance on that head, not on behalf of the coalowners or the Commission but on behalf of the Mines Department, which is the responsible Department, it would be a concession worth having. It is a concession that the right hon. Gentleman is in a position to give. I hope that he will meet what I

regard as a modest request and one that is practicable.<br/>
With regard to the question of future development, the Commission to be set up is to be entrusted with the reorganisation of the mining industry. Arising from that, there is to be amalgamations of mining undertakings. Despite what has been said about the closing down of pits, it will not be disputed that here and there, inevitably, some pits will be closed. Apart altogether from the powers of the Commission under the Bill, in the normal process of events in the mining industry there will be some closing of pits. Wherever there is closing of pits and steps are taken to protect the workings, because there will be waterlogging in some coalfields particularly in South Wales, where the flooding is so acute that it threatens adjoining mines which are working, surely there will be an obligation on the Commission, which has nothing to do with promises, assurances or guarantees, but something which should appear in the Bill, making it dear beyond peradventure that the local authorities in some way should be safeguarded. That is all that we ask.<br/>
I would remind the right hon. Gentleman that he has given several promises. He gave a promise last Thursday. What will arise from that promise we shall see on the Report stage. This afternoon on the question of voluntary amalgamations he gave a promise, but one cannot legislate by promises alone. We cannot have legislation by addendum. I do not know whether it is possible, following the line of argument taken by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for North Hammersmith (Mr. Pritt) to introduce into the Schedule the series of promises, assurances and guarantees which the right hon. Gentleman has given. Let me put it more modestly. Is it possible at some stage in our proceedings to have furnished to every hon. Member a list of the promises, guarantees and assurances which have been presented in the guise of concessions, so that we may know where we stand?<br/>
Apart altogether from these matters, which may have no strict relevance to the Clause under review, I would repeat that we are making a most modest proposal and one which the right hon. Gentleman could properly concede. He could give on his own behalf, not on behalf of some second or third party but on behalf of


himself, the Government, and the Mines Department in particular, an assurance that if local authorities do apply for information which it is desirable that they should have it will not be withheld.</p>

<p>The President of the Board of Trade was so sympathetic in his reply that I thought at first he was going to accept the new Clause as it stands. But he went on to say that powers already existed, and that he would advise the Commission to take a note of the speeches made on this occasion and see what could be done about them. If there is that sympathy and understanding on the benches opposite, why cannot the Government accept this new Clause and satisfy us for once on a matter of this kind? After all the local authorities are not all Labour bodies. Every council has to look after the situation in its own district, and we want Parliament to recognise what the duties of these local bodies are. All we ask is that they should have sufficient power to examine any site which they think is dangerous, before taking it over for housing or other purposes. In mining areas we find instance after instance of the danger and damage which is caused at the present time. I was not aware that local bodies had any power of this kind at all, and I was surprised to hear what the right hon. Gentleman said in that connection.<br/>
In the district from which I come, there are houses falling down because of mining works underneath. There is one housing site which commands a splendid view. When the council took it over I said that they had got one of the best sites in the country, but it turned out that the houses were built over a fault. Strata cutting across the coal seam at this point caused a fault and as a result of the conditions underground the houses on one side of the fault are slipping away and have become almost uninhabitable. Why should not local authorities have the power to go into mines at their own expense, and inspect the underground conditions, so as to be able to avoid building upon sites where there is a likelihood of such a danger arising? In our district the gasworks has been losing thousands of cubic feet as a result of mining subsidences, dislocating the communications between the gasworks and surrounding towns. These conditions are not con-

fined to any one place like Stoke-on-Trent. They occur in every mining village, and a Bill like this gives Parliament the opportunity of showing in a practical form how steps can be taken to prevent these occurrences.<br/>
I make an appeal to the President of the Board of Trade. He has had a very difficult time. He has had to give way to the superior battalions of the coalowners. Probably he did not want to do so, but he was anxious to get this Bill through and he bowed to the onslaught. I am not blaming him in that respect. I know that Parliamentary procedure from time to time has to give way to a certain volume of opinion, and in view of the fact that the coalowners had behind them so many Members on the other side of the House, I cannot blame the right hon. Gentleman for giving in to them. But here we are putting forward a comparatively small but sound and practical proposal. The President admits that there is something in it. He has almost indicated that he would go even further than we propose. All we ask him to do is to accept this new Clause, and if the Government find that there are other means of dealing with the matter let them put in those other means. We have not heard any attempt to-night from the other side to dispute our arguments and I hope that the right hon. Gentleman, recognising what Parliament stands for and recognising also the fact that an unanswerable case has been made out for this new Clause, will agree to give us what we ask.</p>

<p>I understand that the difficulty of the right hon. Gentleman is with regard to future workings and things of that kind, and that he would be prepared to accept this new Clause if there were attached to it some assurance to private property associations and others, and if he also had some kind of assurance that the possibility of future developments would not be revealed by local authorities to private firms for some ulterior purpose. I cannot understand what ground there is for the right hon. Gentleman's objections to the Clause. When the Commission takes over the minerals of the country, surely they will have in their purview copies of all plans of the collieries that are being worked, and if a new shaft is to be sunk, the area that is to be taken will be known in


advance. All those things are known to colliery proprietors before they commence the development. They will have to decide whether they will work the surface measures first or the deeper measures first and it is really the surface measures that are largely responsible for subsidence&#x2014;what are called "house coal measures" cutting relatively thin and often draining surface water.<br/>
It should not be difficult for a colliery company to deposit plans at the request of a local authority in order that the local authority may know whether it is proposed to work the thin surface seams first, or the deeper measures first. Such information as that supplied to a local authority would obviously be for the purpose of protecting public buildings or any other structural works which were in prospect. Surely a local authority is entitled to that information. I have brought this matter before the House on several occasions. We talked at one time about the question of compensation and I referred to the position in one valley in my constituency. I visited those collieries and found that the backs of the houses had completely fallen out and I pointed out the hardships which were entailed on the owner in these cases. The whole of his life savings had been spent in producing a house which was lost almost overnight, and he had no remedy whatever I have pointed out also that the local authority is spending hundreds, possibly thousands of pounds in digging trenches to safeguard its water mains, sewers and so on.<br/>
Like my hon. Friend the Member for Leigh (Mr. Tinker), I had no knowledge, and I doubt whether the local authorities have any knowledge, of the undertaking or assurance given by the Mineowners' Associations 10 years ago. I know that they have been anxious for years to obtain this information, and I am certain that most of them were ignorant of the fact that it could have been obtained on request. But, even if they had known of it, no specific obligation is placed upon the coalowners to deposit plans for examination by the local authority or by owners of property who are anxious to construct buildings in given areas. I am certain that, unless a Clause of this kind is agreed to, we shall find that the coal-owners will have a privilege that is not possessed by any other property owners. The local authorities can upon request

obtain plans from all other property owners with regard to new construction or anything of the kind, but the mineowners are put in a singular and select position. Why that should be the case it is very difficult to understand. That privilege, which they apparently have, should no longer obtain if it is prejudicial to the public interest and to the interest of property owners in areas in which seams of coal are being worked.<br/>
I cannot understand why the President of the Board of Trade is not prepared to meet us in this very reasonable request. It is not made as benefiting us as individuals, or the party that we represent. It is common knowledge that most authorities include members representing the political predilections of hon. Members opposite, and those local authorities are making the same demand that is being made by others which have Labour majorities. The President of the Board of Trade, however, is not prepared to concede this demand to local authorities who have a just case for protection and for an assurance that, when they spend their ratepayers' money, they will get the maximum value for it. I hope that, after this long Debate, the President will concede the Clause.</p>

<p>I fail to understand why we should not place upon the Statute Book an obligation on colliery owners to provide this information for local authorities. I was born and bred in the City of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, scarcely any part of which is free from colliery workings, but I cannot assert, as some others have done, that as a local authority we have suffered much from subsidence. That is due to the fact that we have taken the precaution of obtaining information before undertaking any of our large buildings, and because, by rafting in accordance with modern methods, we have been able to construct over colliery workings some of our college buildings and other municipal works in such a way that they have suffered no detriment. It is true, however, that where as a local authority we were not able to take such precautions, as for instance, in the construction of our main drains, roads and other public works, we have suffered very considerable financial outlay, which would have been avoided had the information that we ask should be statutorily provided been dis-


closed. While the municipality is protected, if that information for which we are asking had been in the town hall there is little doubt that the private builders would have been made acquainted with the colliery workings in areas which had been built upon in and about the city of Newcastle and which have suffered very considerably from subsidence. The division I represent has constantly suffered very substantially from colliery subsidence.<br/>
This information ought not to be withheld on any consideration whatever. Under this Bill, the colliery owners, apparently, are to be placed in a preferential position. Disclosure of this information would not injure them, financially or otherwise, but it would benefit the whole community considerably, and many thousands of pounds would be saved by private individuals to whom this information would be made available. We ask, therefore, that it should be a statutory obligation to enable the representatives of local authorities, without fee or charge, to make themselves acquainted with colliery workings, and, if it be possible, to know the direction of subsequent colliery workings, so that the community at large should not continue to suffer this great hardship, which constitutes such a burden in our colliery districts, often on members of the working community who have invested their all in house property.</p>

<p>Will the right hon. Gentleman answer the questions put by my hon. Friend, especially in regard to abandoned workings? Surely he must appreciate, as a result of this Debate, that the 10-year holding in mining is a rather different thing from what we are concerned about. We are surely entitled to ask when a Bill is passing through the House on this subject that we should not be put off with an undertaking given outside. We are here to legislate, and if a thing is right it is right to put it in the Bill.</p>

<p>The assurances I gave did not apply to the 10 years' period. They applied to plans in the possession of the local authorities. I explained before that I was not prepared to legislate, because I was not prepared for the general disclosure of these plans, which is contrary to the policy which has always been adopted in the past. I was giving no guarantee, but only the renewal of a guarantee, which has been in existence now for 10 years and which, I pointed out, goes even further than what is asked for in the Clause and gives a valuable additional guarantee. I will look into this point with regard to the abandonment of mines with the Secretary for Mines before the Report stage.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman says that he is not prepared to depart from what has happened in the past with regard to secrecy. What was the object of secrecy? It was, apparently, that where you have a lot of different joint owners there might be trouble if plans were disclosed. As you are going to have the Commissioner and only one royalty owner, any object of secrecy must have disappeared. You will have a single royalty owner who will know exactly what all the workings are in every part, and there can be nothing to conceal which, after all, is the object of secrecy. You are not concealing something from the complainant. It does not matter to the man who is leasing the next mine as to what the workings are in


your mine. You have a single landlord for the whole land who controls the working between the two, and the whole object of secrecy has disappeared. It really is no answer&#x2014;I put this with great respect to the right hon. Gentleman&#x2014;to say that, because things have been, they shall remain.<br/>
We are changing all sorts of things in this Bill. Why not change the opportunities of local authorities for getting information? What conceivable reason can there now be for keeping the plans of an abandoned mine secret for 10 years? What conceivable reason can there be in common sense or anything else? I am sure that neither the right hon. Gentleman nor the Secretary for Mines can think of one. If they can, will they let us know what it is? They cannot think of one, either of them, at this moment. I will sit down immediately if either of them can get up and give the Committee a single reason in their opinion, and they are the persons thoroughly conversant with the whole matter. Think as they may&#x2014;and one can see how thoughtful they both are in the matter&#x2014;nothing comes forth. One may fairly assume, therefore, that, on the face of it, <i>prima facie</i> there is nothing to</p>

<p>prevent the alteration of the system, and I ask the right hon. Gentleman in all seriousness, bearing in mind this great change which is being made as regards ownership, to consider, before the Report stage, whether he cannot put in something of this kind, unless he can give some better reason. We certainly do not see anything at the present time.</p>

<p>If I understand the Bill, it is mainly to promote the public interest in connection with mining development. Is it not also equally in the public interest that the local authorities should have the opportunity of knowing, before they embark upon public works, the conditions of the mine in the district in which they are operating? What have the Government to say to the local authorities on this matter? Do they think that local authorities ought to "have this information so as to enable them to avoid injury and unnecessary expense? Is not the declared object of the Bill to defend the public interest?</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That the Clause be read a Second time."<br/>
This Clause is designed to avoid what otherwise would be a considerable hardship and disability. I wish that the provisions of the Bill covered the whole consequences of the Bill, and not part of them. I shudder to contemplate what the effect of widespread amalgamation will be in terms of unemployment without protective provisions such as were put in the Railways Act, 1921. Since all the appeals made to the Government for that purpose from this side of the Committee have elicited no response, but have produced from the Minister the comment that the proposals to protect the miner against the consequences of the Bill were fantastic, I will limit myself to the terms of the new Clause. Parliament has

always insisted on adequate compensation for dismissal or other unfavourable circumstances arising out of amalgamations which Parliament has approved. Those provisions have usually been based on the local government legislation of either 1888 or 1933, as was the case of the Railways Act, 1921, and of the London Passenger Transport Board. It has been assumed by legislation that all employ&#x00E9;s of the amalgamated undertakings become the employ&#x00E9;s of the amalgamated undertaking itself, and the acquisition by the amalgamation of rights and property has also meant the acquisition of liabilities, and in acquiring those liabilities it acquired the employ&#x00E9;s of the amalgamated undertakings. It was bound in consequence either to compensate them for loss of office if it failed to continue to employ them, or, if it continued to employ them at a lower rate of remuneration, to compensate them for the difference between the two standards.<br/>
The State now proposes, through the medium of the Commission, to acquire mining royalties and property, and if the new Clause I submit is not accepted, that acquisition will have serious consequences for the people covered by it. The existing relationship between the royalty owner and the mineowner requires the engagement by the royalty owner of a body of men known as mineral agents, mineral surveyors and mineral engineers. They are technical men with special qualifications for doing a special job. They are a small number, amounting, so far as I can make out, to between 250 and 300. Their job is to make surface and underground surveys, to prepare plans for royalty owners, to inspect workings, to measure up sections and share the area of coal worked, to calculate and agree with the colliery companies the amount of royalties to be paid to the royalty owners, to agree with the colliery company the amounts to be deducted for dirt and inferior coal, to keep plans, to make valuations, to collect royalties and to disburse them to whoever may be entitled to them. The expectation and the fear are that this Bill will eliminate the need for the continued employment of this small body of people.<br/>
Inevitably there will be a number of dismissals, and that will mean the placing permanentliy out of industry of a proportionately large body of men, with no hope that they will ever again find a job in the professional occupation within which alone they can hope to earn a reasonable standard of life. In that sense they will join the unskilled labour market. More than that, few, if any, of these men, because of the small size of the firms, are members of statutory superannuation funds. On the contrary they have been employed by firms which have been accustomed to make <i>ex gratia</i> pension allowances to them, and those also will go. I ask the Committee to observe that the number of men concerned is small. The aggregate amount of compensation required under the terms of the Clause is infinitesimal compared with the global sum which will be paid to the royalty owners themselves; and I ask the Committee to agree that only the barest justice will be done by requiring the royalty owners, who are themselves to be generously compensated, to compensate in their turn these people whose services they will no longer require.<br/>
I would only add that the global compensation figure is based upon the gross revenue of the royalty owners, and that is a basis which must include the expenditure undertaken by the royalty owners in the employment of the men referred to. Therefore, in my view the global sum includes a figure which could properly be attached for compensating these people. The right hon. Gentleman shakes his head, and I suffer his negation for the moment. I submit, finally, that we should not take a step under Part I of this Bill which will place out of employment a very considerable number of men with professional and technical qualifications who will have no hope again of ever being able to employ those qualifications in a way which will enable them to earn an ordinary reasonable standard of life. The House should not do that without requiring the royalty owners, whose employ&#x00E9;s these people were, to compensate them for the disturbance and the loss of office.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1938-02-08a.995.1" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. Stanleys" colnum="995" time="">
<p>The Clause refers to a small class of people who number, I should imagine, from inquiries I have

made, something like 100, or perhaps rather more than that, who serve either in a wholly or semi-technical capacity mineral agents now employed by the mineral owners. The hon. Member has confined his Clause to such people as are employed by firms wholly or mainly dealing with such property, and they are, therefore, quite a limited class of people, whose skill, I agree, is of a rather limited technical character and who might find it difficult to get employment in a different kind of work. Let us consider what will be the reactions of the passage of the Bill upon the employment of those people. For four and a-half years there will be no difference at all, because it is not suggested that until the actual vesting of the property in the Commission takes place there is any reason to anticipate any loss of employment among them. Therefore, to begin with, they have four and a-half years' notice. After that the Commission will have to do with respect to their properties exactly the same thing as the royalty owners now do with the same properties when in their hands. Exactly the same kind of work will have to be done by someone for the Commission as is now being done by these people and those who employ them for the individual royalty owners.<br/>
Therefore, not only is there 4&#x00BD; years' notice, but there is at the end of it every prospect of continuing employment in exactly the same kind of work. I think, though, it is right that these people in their capacity, just as the employers in their capacity, should have the first chance of the jobs that are going under the Commission, and that priority should be given in employment to those who may be losing their employment because of the Act. I think the Government should give an assurance that it will represent to the Commission the desirability of offering priority of appointment, whether as a staff, which covers the case raised by this Clause, or as agents, which covers the case of my hon. Friend, to competent persons or firms who have had experience in a technical or semi-technical capacity and who for not less than 10 years prior to the passing of the Act have been wholly or mainly engaged in that class of work. They will also suggest to the Commission that in the interests both of themselves and of the classes of persons concerned, it will be desirable for them to invite a committee representing the professional


interests of such persons or firms to cooperate with them in a consulative capacity in regard to the offering of these appointments. I think that offers a very fair chance of the continuance of the employment of these people under the new employers.<br/>
I must correct a statement that the hon. Member made. He said that the global figure which forms the subject of the agreement between the Government and the royalty owners for the purchase of coal was arrived at before the deduction of these expenses. That is not the case. The net average annual figure, upon which the global sum is finally determined, was arrived at after the deduction of a sum representing the expenses of management of the property. In any case, therefore, I could not accept that this compensation should be deducted from that global sum agreed with the royalty owners.</p>

<p>Whatever course the previous Debate may have taken does not alter the fact that my new Clause deals with a point not covered by the new Clause to which reference is being made. If hon. Members will look at Clause 2 they will see that the Commission are given the duty of granting coalmining leases. I am moving this new Clause solely because I want to preserve a measure of liberty to the people of this country. [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh! "] I know that hon. Members opposite believe in the Socialist principle and do not believe in liberty, but that is no reason why I should not do my best for what I happen to believe in. This new Clause was put forward as an Amendment to Clause 2, but my draftsmanship was not sufficiently succesful, and I was told that it was not appropriate at that point, and


my attention was directed to another Clause. I tried there and failed, and I was told that the appropriate place to introduce the point was in a new Clause. I therefore felt a little sad that the hon. and learned Gentleman should try to trip me up after the Chairman had previously tripped me up twice.<br/>
A large number of people are owners of coal. They are so numerous that if any citizen thinks he would like to own a coal mine the chances are that he will find some coalowner willing to do business with him and grant him a lease. [HON. MEMBERS: "At a price! "] If he is reasonable he will be able to obtain a lease on terms which, if his judgment is right, will enable him to conduct the coal mine properly. The only coal mine in which any coal miner wants to work is one that is conducted properly, and no coal miner wants to work in a coal mine which is conducted at a loss. If we are to monopolise the ownership of coal, only one authority will be in a position to grant a lease, and that is the Commission. If only one authority has the right to grant a lease, and an unqualified right to refuse to grant a lease to any particular person, it is clear that the rights of the citizen to become the owner of a coal mine or to start a new coal mine are destroyed.<br/>
Therefore, I think hon. Members will see that in my Clause there is involved the fundamental principle of the liberty of the British subject to enter into any occupation that he desires to enter. [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear!"] I know that hon. Members opposite are anxious to destroy the liberty of the people, and I am glad they are interrupting me because it gives me the opportunity of enforcing the point that they are the enemies of liberty. The terms of the Clause are very reasonable. It imposes upon the Commission the duty of granting leases, but they are free to refuse the granting of a lease, though I want to attach to that that they shall not refuse to grant a lease unreasonably, in other words, because they do not like you or because they wish to direct the whole future development of the industry, which I do not think is desirable. I think that in the long run the fact that a large number of people are free to make decisions leads to better results than one person acting as a dictator and having the

sole power to make decisions. Therefore, I do not want the Commission to be in a position to refuse to grant a lease to anybody who comes along without giving any reason at all. In other words, if they refuse to grant a lease, they must have good reasons for so doing. Furthermore, if they grant a lease, they must not include in it unreasonable terms.<br/>
I am pleading a cause to this Committee. If I had been pleading this cause in any House of Commons elected up to 10 years ago, I should not have had a single opponent. It is an interesting commentary on the change of public opinion that it is even necessary for me to propose this Clause. It is a significant commentary on the political thought of this country that a Government can introduce a Bill which presumes that an autocratic body can deprive the citizen of his rights, and the fact that a Member should seek to preserve those rights is regarded as a matter for jeering by a party that professes to call itself the champion of democracy. It is an interesting comment on our political philosophy. I am one of those who with others are trying to preserve a measure of freedom in this country. It is not easy. We see freedom being completely eliminated over half of what we call the civilised world since 20 years ago, the right of free expression of views destroyed, the right of free entry into an industry destroyed, and the right of the citizen to enter into any occupation that he thinks fit to enter destroyed. I do not want any statutory barrier placed in his way to enter any occupation, because I believe it is vital. The freedom of the people, free economic development, the preservation of free institutions, the preservation of that very democracy which we all think we stand for. [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear!"] I do not mind the jeers of those who look forward to the time when they will all be little Lenins and little Stalins, but I am concerned with the idea that we should not in our Acts of Parliament, even by appearance, do things which destroy the right of people to choose their own occupations. It is in that sense and in the hope that I shall receive some support that I move the Second Reading of this Clause.</p>

<p>I differ from the Mover of this Clause only on one point,


when he says that public opinion has so changed that it now accepts the kind of dictatorship that is indicated in the Bill. I am convinced that public opinion does not accept it. There is a very widespread feeling of resentment against the dictatorial powers that are claimed in the Bill. I hope the Minister will consider this Clause. It is unreasonable that the authority in whom is to be vested the right to grant leases should have an absolute and unfettered right to decide whether or not a lease should be granted, and be entitled to impose whatever kind of conditions they wish to impose in granting a lease. There ought to be some kind of appeal against an abuse of the authority to be reposed in the new Commission. If the terms of this Clause are not regarded as satisfactory, I suggest to the Government that there ought to be some kind of appeal against abuse in the granting of leases, otherwise we may find that not only a new person endeavouring to come into the industry may be deprived of the lease which he seeks, but an existing colliery undertaking seeking a lease of adjoining coal may resent or feel aggrieved at the decision in regard to their application. There ought to be some appeal in cases of that.</p>

<p>The Mover of the Clause admitted that he was not here when we were discussing an earlier Clause which dealt inherently with the same matter. The earlier Clause was a proposition that if the renewal of a lease was unreasonably withheld, there should be the right of arbitration. This Clause says that if a new lease is unreasonably refused there should be reference to the Railway and Canal Commission. The principle which we negatived earlier is the same principle that is brought forward here.</p>

<p>It is not the same principle. The first question was whether a person already in the industry is entitled to a renewal of his lease. That is a question as to whether he is entitled to continue. The underlying principle of my Clause is whether a person who is not in the industry is entitled to enter the industry. That is a fundamentally different principle.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1938-02-08a.1001.3" hansard_membership_id="2977" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/13794" speakername="Captain Crookshank" colnum="1001" time="">
<p>It does not fundamentally alter the answer I am going to give, and for this reason. What this Bill

seeks to do and what we have passed in earlier Clauses, so long ago that the facts are already forgotten, is to place the coal of the country under a statutory body which will, according to Clause 2 (1), so manage the business
<q>consistently with the provisions of this Act as they think best for promoting the interests, efficiency and better organisation of the coalmining industry.</q>
At the same time under Clause 2 (2) they do that subject to the general direction of the Board of Trade in
<q>matters appearing to the Board to affect the national interest.</q>
Therefore, this body, which will be charged with very great powers and important functions, will surely be the body above all, from the vast knowledge of the industry which they will accumulate, best fitted to decide what is in the interests of the industry, subject to what is the national interest. The suggestion of this Clause is that if they refuse to grant a lease there is to be recourse to the Railway and Canal Commission. The reason why the Railway and Canal Commission is inserted here is because of the fact that up to to-day the Railway and Canal Commission have functioned when leases are refused under the Acts of 1923 and 1926. Under those Acts an appeal can be taken to them, but the only criterion by which the Railway and Canal Commission can judge is the national interest. While I am sure we all appreciate the sincerity of the views of my hon. Friend and ms desire that the maximum of freedom should be maintained in this country&#x2014;which I certainly share with him&#x2014;he must agree that it would be clearly anomalous for Parliament to set up a body to administer a property in the general interests of the industry and the national interest, and at the same time give jurisdiction to somebody else to override any decision that they make, on the ground that it is in the national interest to do so. That is contrary to the whole conception of the plan which we have been discussing up to now&#x2014;that the Coal Commission are to consider these matters and act in the way they think best in the interests of the industry as a whole and the national interest. It would be inconsistent with that plan to provide that in individual cases there should be some review which could only be based on the national interest. I am sorry to disappoint my


hon. Friend but I do not think it is reasonable to put these powers into a body such as the Railway and Canal Commission, overriding the Coal Commission which <i>ex hypothesi</i> would be in a position to know better what is in the interests of the coal industry and the national interest.</p>

<p>The new Clause which the Committee discussed a short time ago, dealing with compensation, differs from my proposal in one or two particulars. It referred only to compensation for employ&#x00E9;s. Mine deals with both masters and men&#x2014;all those employed on technical services in connection with the industry. The other and more important point of difference is this. I am asking that compensation should be paid to these gentlemen out of the revenues of the Coal Commission. The previous new Clause proposed that such payment should be deducted from the global figure, overlooking the fact that already a deduction had been made from the global figure to cover all professional service rendered to the industry at the present time. The First Schedule provides already for the payment by the Coal Commission of salaries and pensions to those professional experts and specialists and, of course, their employ&#x00E9;s and other servants of the Commission. It provides nothing for those who are now employed in these capacities but who lose their job and their livelihood by failing to enter the service of the Commission. I contend that they are just as much entitled as the others to expect compensation from the Commission.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1938-02-08a.1004.4" colnum="1004" time="">
<p>There are two special reasons why in my view these people should be compensated. One is that the great majority of them are specialists in the sense that, if they lose their special job, they cannot turn to other remunerative employment; they are not trained for any other line of work. It is true that the Clause as drafted includes people such as firms of solicitors who do this work and who no doubt have been trained to do other work as well, but the mineral agent and mining surveyor is a specialist who, if he loses his employment in that capacity, will lose his livelihood.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1938-02-08a.1004.5" colnum="1004" time="">
<p>The other reason is that, when the net revenue from mineral royalties was arrived at, a deduction of 4.54 per cent.


was made from the gross revenue in respect of these professional services. That amounts to approximately &#x00A3;221,000 a year, which is the agreed estimate of the cost of these professional services to the industry as it is to-day when it is being taken over by the Government. That was capitalised, and the global value was consequently reduced by &#x00A3;3,315,000. That sum the Government have saved from the purchase price they are proposing to pay. Surely that is a special reason why they should undertake and pass on to the Commission an obligation in respect of the technical and professional services which the industry at present employs.</p>

<p>When the matter was first raised, it was suggested that this would be a dangerous precedent. It is not a precedent at all. I would remind the Committee that in quite a number of recent statutory amalgamations provision of this kind has been made&#x2014;for instance, in the case of the Metropolitan Water Board, the Port of London Authority, the amalgamated lines under the Railways Act, 1921, and the London Passenger Transport Board; while the Local Government Act, 1933, provided for a somewhat similar obligation, and there was a like provision in the case of the compulsory amalgamation of the British beet sugar companies. I maintain that these are all precedents in support of my contention that compensation should be paid in this case. The present case is stronger than any of those, because in them the Government were not taking credit for the cost of professional services, while in this case a full capitalised sum, representing the full cost of these professional services, has been deducted from the global sum.</p>

<p>My right hon. Friend the President of the Board of Trade indicated in his answer on a previous Clause the reasons why he would refuse to accept my Clause, as he refused to accept the other. The first reason was that, as it is suggested, these professional experts will have four years of great activity in which to feather their nests, and the fact that they would have that opportunity would free the Coal Commission, with the Government behind it, from any obligation to compensate them when they lose their livelihood for the future. The second reason was that many of them&#x2014;perhaps the majority&#x2014;would be employed by the Coal Commission. That is no doubt true, but it is all the more reason why the minority, who

will not be employed, should be compensated. One reason, which I heard for the first time this evening from my right hon. Friend, was that the Government will recommend the Commission to give priority of employment to those who have been employed on this work in the past and have lost their jobs. I must express my surprise at that being put forward. Who else can the Coal Commission employ? They are the technical experts in the coal industry, and the Commission must employ some of them. The recommendation of priority is really worth very little, and I am surprised that my right hon. Friend should have put it forward as an argument. I will sum up by repeating that all the precedents of recent legislation are in support of my proposal, that there is a special reason in that the Government have taken formal credit, by taking account, in fixing the global figure, of the cost of professional services, and that the number who will be thrown out of work will be very few. For all those reasons, I hope my right hon. Friend will change his mind and agree to give compensation to all who suffer under this Bill.</p>

<p>No doubt; but I am informing the hon. Member that the admirable principle he expatiated on a little time ago is not in fact to-day, and never has been, a principle in the system under which we operate. These professional men have accumulated, by their experience and knowledge, a goodwill value in their business, which will be swept away when this new Commission takes over. These professional men, the parents of many of whom have paid premiums for them to acquire this specialist knowledge, and who have had a special education to equip them for the job which they have taken over, have been very unfortunate in that they have not been able to have a strong body behind them like the


Mining Association to force upon the Government their claims in respect of compensation.</p>

<p>I have been reminded by hon. Members very much to my right that, in view of the fact that they are now trying to extend this Measure to protecting the middle classes, I should give some support to the Clause, but even while giving support to the Clause in favour of compensation to professional people in connection with the mines, it is very significant that every section in connection with the mining industry has now been catered for except the miners. It is very strange that a Tory Member should have been called and given an opportunity to present this case, and that the Clause to provide compensation for miners has not been called. The professional people and technicians ought to receive consideration apart altogether from the fact that the Communist party is concerned with protecting these people. They deserve consideration, but something should also be done to ensure compensation for the miner.<br/>
The hon. Member who spoke very feelingly and effectively about the professional people said they would lose their livelihood if they were not taken on by the Commission. If they lose their livelihood, something should be done for them. There is not an hon. Member anywhere who, if he knew that a professional man was likely to lose his livelihood would not agree with me that he had a claim. No one could put up an argument against the case made by the right hon. and gallant Gentleman opposite, but everything that he said in connection with the livelihood of the professional man applies a hundredfold to the miner. I only want to say that as far as this question is concerned, the best possible consideration should be given to the professional men and technicians who give service to the industry. I ask not only for justice for these people but for all kinds of liberty, because, sooner or later, we on this side are going to see to it that they get the liberty of going down the pit or of going into some other industry to work for their living.</p>

<p>The discussion on the previous Clause covered some of the

points raised in the present proposal. On that Clause we discussed the compensation which might be payable to the employ&#x00E9;s of these mineral agents whose own compensation we are now considering. On that Clause I made the statement as to what I am prepared to do with regard to the future employment of the agents themselves and their employ&#x00E9;s. The Committee decided not to compensate the employ&#x00E9;s. We are now considering the question of the compensation to the mineral agents themselves. Let me deal first with the question of precedent. I have searched the records and I cannot find any precedent for compensation in circumstances such as these, where people are largely on a fee basis payment. There are precedents for compensation for people who are under contract for services, people who had some contract under which they were employed which secured their employment. The great majority of these people, as far as I know, are remunerated by way of fees, are under no contract and there is no certainty of a continuance of the fees they are receiving. I agree that the case of those who are wholly or mainly engaged in this employment is of a special character. There are a considerable number of people, solicitors, estate agents, and in other professions who have earned a little money from fees by doing a little of this work, and a very small number, between 20 and 30, who are wholly or mainly engaged in this work and who, therefore, might have no alternative employment.<br/>
What is the effect of the Bill upon these people? First of all it creates during the next four and a half years a period for them of very intensive activity. The right hon. and gallant Member talks about "feathering their nest," and asks what has that to do with it. I say that if you are going to determine what effect the Bill may have on their earning capacity you must take into consideration the advantages which the Bill is going to give to the earning capacity of these people, and it is fair to consider that during the next four and a half years there will be ample remunerative employment for them on a scale they have never known before.</p>

<p>On a fee basis?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1938-02-08a.1008.1" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. Stanley" colnum="1008" time="">
<p>Yes. During the whole of the valuation period the appeals will necessitate the employment by the claim-


ants of people of this calibre who will be rewarded by fees. It will be the Commission who will bear the whole of the costs of the proceedings, and therefore it will be the Commission who will pay during the four and a half years the enhanced fees which these people will receive. I say that in considering the effect of the Bill upon the livelihood of these people you cannot possibly exclude the very great advantages which the next four and a half years are expected to bring. At the end of this period, during which they will be able not only to continue their profession but look forward to more remunerative times than ever before, what is to happen? The coal and the necessity for management of the property will not disappear, but will merely be transferred from the hands of a large number of individual royalty owners, who do not themselves do the technical work of management of the property, to a Commission of five people, who equally will be unable to do the technical work of managing the property, and will require, just as the royalty owners do, the services of a number of people. I do say, with regard to this group of people, that the prospects of their employment under the Commission are very great indeed.<br/>
The statement which I made on the previous Clause extends to and covers this one. The right hon. and gallant Gentleman said that that is not worth anything. What was the reason that he gave for saying that it is not worth anything? He said that it is not worth giving a pledge that these people will receive priority of employment because they are the people whom, in any case, the Commission will have to employ. Surely, if that be the case, it weakens to a very considerable extent the case for including in this Bill a provision for compensation for the loss of employment, which, as the right hon. and gallant Gentleman himself told the Committee, is extremely improbable, since the particular skill, knowledge and experience which these people possess make it inevitable that they should be the people who will be employed by the Coal Commission in the future. The right hon. and gallant Gentleman made the point that there is a special obligation upon the Government in this case because of the deduction which has been made from the global figure for professional services. But that deduction was made because it was to be the Commission which, in future,

would have to bear the cost of managing these properties. They will have to spend the money which was deducted from the global sum in the management of their properties, just as it has been spent by the royalty owners in the management of their property. There is no doubt that a very considerable proportion of that sum will, in fact, go into exactly the same pockets as those into which the payments of the royalty owners are now going.<br/>
I think the Committee will see that, in fact, the interests of these people are very fully safeguarded. First of all, they will have nearly five years' employment. In addition to that, during those five years a large amount of extra work will go to them, the fees of which will be borne by the Commission. After that, there is a practical certainty of their employment by the Commission, because they are the only people who have the skill and experience to carry on the work which they are now doing.</p>

<p>I wish that the President of the Board of Trade, in making his speech, had taken into account the Schedule, which is governed by the new Clause moved by my right hon. and gallant Friend. If the President will look at the Schedule, he will see that the compensation is intended only for those who are not taken on by the Commission. That wipes out two-thirds of his speech. The Minister then implied that the Amendment deals only with the employers. If he had read the Schedule, he would have seen the qualifying words at the bottom of page 705, which bring in the employ&#x00E9;s. This new Clause has an advantage over the one which was moved by hon. Members opposite, but which was not persisted in, in that it covers the whole of those dispossessed and only those who are not taken into the employment by the Commission.<br/>
The President said that the deduction from the global figure was made because the Commission would have to bear charges at present borne by the mineral owners, but to the extent to which the Commission do not find it necessary to take on the whole of the staff, they will not have the whole expense, and therefore the capitalised sum of their savings is precisely the sum available for compensation to these dispossessed persons. It is deplorable, after the Clause has been


on the Order Paper for many weeks, that the Mines Department, amid all then-preoccupations, have not taken the trouble to read the Schedule, which really explains the position to a much greater extent than the President's reply, which was devoted to the Clause alone, without any reference to the Schedule.</p>

<p>I should like to bring to the attention of my right hon. Friend two points which, I think, from the terms of his speech, he may have overlooked. Although there are 20 or 30 firms engaged in this work, and those firms will do very well in the next four or five years, there are employed by them a considerable number of mineral surveyors who are remunerated by way of salary. These employ&#x00E9;s will not get their salaries increased, at any rate, to any substantial extent, during the next four years. When the Commission has taken over, the amount of measuring up and surveying at the collieries will be greatly reduced because, whereas at present, every half year each separate estate has to be measured up to see exactly what quantity of coal has been extracted, in future, when the leases in each colliery are merged into a single lease, the royalty will simply be calculated on the gross output of the mine as a whole. Probably both sides will agree to accept the pithead weights of coal raised as the index of what the royalty is to be, and all the labour of dividing and measuring up each separate pit will in a few years come to an end. My right hon. Friend has underestimated the amount of displacement of labour which there will be when the Commission has taken control. I hope he will give my remarks further consideration before we part with the Clause.</p>

<p>Several of us have worked with these surveyors all our lives and know the kind of work they do. Many of them are already colliery agents who transfer from one colliery to another and examine the amount of royalties due. Some of the people who have come to me about it are licking their lips over this business because they know they are going to have an opportunity such as they have never had in their lives before. These surveyors will be fully employed,

as the Minister said. They will be working overtime. I am sure the hon. Member for North Leeds (Mr. Peake), who knows the coal trade from his point of view, will allow us to know it from our point of view. I know some very large colliery owners who refuse to give up the idea of being surveyors for other companies. I know one who was one of the largest engineers in the industry who worked for the Earl of Carlisle, and other large royalty owners. Many of these jobs are handed down in the hereditary sense, and I know a surveyor whose grandfather did work for people like that. I see no reason why we should sit here at this time of the night and worry about people who are to have an opportunity they have never had before. The Minister should give a chance to the young fellows who belong to our class, who went to the elementary school, and who have got their engineer's certificate and can survey in the true practical sense.<br/>
I can appreciate the hon. Member siding with these people because some of them are well paid for their jobs, and owners of royalties have been robbed of thousands of pounds by the way they have not done their work. The colliery owners welcome that, because if an owner has any pillars or any water or any difficulty and can get a half-dead surveyor like that, he can jump things. I am not joking; I am only putting it in my rough way, with practical knowledge of hundreds of pillars of coal which have been jumped just in order to get the best bit out of the industrial pantry. One of the reasons why we are supporting this thing is in order that the nation may get the best out of the industry. Many of the men are of the type who would be better if they had less to do and did it better. I am surprised that an hon. Friend of mine here should come along to weep over these men, with the opportunities they are going to have in the next four and a-half years. Apart from what the Minister has said I am convinced that there will be a desire for coal development, to find coal where it is not being worked now, and these men will be employed. I only wish the people who will be thrown out of work by these amalgamations had the same opportunity of having an advancement in their employment as the men over whom we are asked to mourn.</p>
