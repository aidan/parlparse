<p>We have recently announced a &#x00A3;1 million programme on wave energy. The other renewable forms are being assessed and, where appropriate, research and development programmes are being drawn up.<br/>
In 1975&#x2013;76 my Department spent about &#x00A3;&#x00BD; million on research into these sources. The estimated spend on non-nuclear non-marine research and development is about &#x00A3;4 million in 1976&#x2013;77 rising to some &#x00A3;7 million in 1979&#x2013;80.

<p>Is it not a fact that by the year 2000, despite North Sea oil, we shall not be self-sufficient in energy? Is it not therefore necessary to have long-term projects and studies not only of the sources of energy mentioned but of tidal power, particularly in terms of the Severn barrage scheme, which was first considered in 1921?</p>

<p>My hon. Friend is correct. Various projections have been made about the energy resources that we shall have in the year 2000. I assure my hon. Friend that, in addition to the plan that he mentioned, all kinds of geothermal and solar energy are being duly considered.</p>

<p>I am sure that the House would agree with the hon. Gentleman if we could spend more on these resources. However, I think he knows that the studies that are taking place on this matter are "at large" studies. Once the results are clear, without our embarking on gigantic, colossal sums of capital expenditure, it will be for the Government and this House to agree on the kind of expenditure that the hon. Gentleman visualises.</p>

<p>Is my hon. Friend aware that that answer is not strictly true, al-

though I am sure it is not the Department's fault? Is he aware that one of my constituents, who has a sick husband and children at home, recently asked the North-Eastern Electricity Board to install a pre-payment meter and was told that she would have to wait a minimum of two years before it would be prepared to do so? Will he now see that the boards carry out the spirit of the policy laid down by the Secretary of State and recently readvocated by my hon. Friend in his report to his right hon. Friend?</p>

<p>I shall certainly draw the attention of the board concerned to the case mentioned by my hon. Friend. The information that the boards have given to me and my colleagues on the committee is that they will install such meters on request in appropriate cases. My report on this matter is clear&#x2014;that wherever a consumer requests a pre-payment meter, unless there are dangers it should be supplied.</p>

<p>Is the hon. Gentleman aware that we should be very grateful if he would consider sympathetically the installation of pre-payment meters, particularly if action on that front would enable the Government to disregard the recommendations of the review body in respect of the powers of disconnection held by the electricity and gas boards? Is he aware that there is a hard core minority of feckless people for whom debt is a way of life, and that the vast, silent majority of those who pay on time would bitterly resent their tariff having to be increased to cross-subsidise that small clement?</p>

<p>My view is that there has been a great deal of exaggeration in the figures put forward by both sets of boards as to the effect of ceasing the practice of disconnection. However, as my right hon. Friend said in his statement, my report is going to him and the boards are at liberty to put their views on the report to the Government before the Government contemplate action.</p>

<p>Is my hon. Friend aware that the installation of pre-payment meters is an essential element in any new policy of ending disconnections? Should not the Secretary of State first meet the electricity and gas boards to press them to end the practice of disconnecting anyone


who cannot pay and, secondly, initiate legislation to deprive the boards of the power to disconnect?</p>

<p>I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Ashley) for all the work he did on the review body. My right hon. Friend is meeting both kinds of boards in the very near future and has said that we shall hear the boards' views before any legislative action is taken.</p>

<p>Is my hon. Friend aware that even when a pre-payment meter has been installed the consumer's problems are not at an end? If a request is made for a meter to be emptied at other than the regular time, either because it is full or because the consumer is going on holiday and does not wish to leave a considerable sum of money in the meter, a charge of &#x00A3;2 is made by many boards for this service. Will my hon. Friend look into this matter?</p>

<p>That is a disappointing reply. Will the Minister of State consider adopting a new line of approach? Will he try to persuade his right hon. Friend, and his other right hon.

<p>I am not reopening the question of the decision taken in 1974. The AGR has now come onstream and the early operating experience of it is, I am advised, very satisfactory.<br/>
As to whether, when, and to what extent there is an energy gap is disputed between the industries. The British Gas Corporation does not take the same view about margins of energy gap as some of the other industries do. Nobody doubts&#x2014;and this is the basis of present policy&#x2014;that coal, nuclear power and conservation, in appropriate proportions, will be central to the meeting of our long-term needs. The fact that there can be a conflict between two fuel industries about this basic question indicates the need for a harmonisation of forecasts before we reach a decision to invest many thousands of millions of pounds.</p>

<p>So far this year one new gas and seven new oil discoveries have been announced, one new oil field has come onstream, and by the end of the year a further four are expected onstream. I am satisfied that 1976 will be another successful year for the development of our North Sea resources.</p>

<p>Does the Minister of State accept that the political activities of his Government have held back for up to two years decisions on the question of whether or not to develop viable fields?

<p>I do not think that is true. The Chairman of Conoco told us recently that the North Sea was the most attractive investment area in the world. The rate of development and of discovery is remarkable. If the hon. Gentleman will look at the Brown Book that we have just published he will see that the figures are consistent with the development that was expected.<br/>
With regard to the smaller fields&#x2014;and this relates to the question asked by the hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Gray) about the tax policy, which may be a little unfair on the smaller fields&#x2014;we have taken power under the Petroleum and Submarine Pipe-lines Act to refund royalties where we feel that it is in the national interest that a field should be developed. We have received precisely one application, and I regret to say that that application has not succeeded. As I have said, I shall look at the criteria to see whether we could be wrong. We may be wrong. But we are not doing anything to inhibit development. On the contrary.</p>

<p>I thought it right, and I thought the House agreed, that after the experience of the last round of licences we should consult about the terms and conditions which would get the best bargain for us without endangering the success of the round. As to the r&#x00F4;le of BNOC in exploration, it is of such critical importance that the British people should have some extra knowledge of this exploration. The cost of exploration is nothing like as high as the cost of development, and at a modest guess BNOC should normally be&#x2014;</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman says that it is taxpayers' money, but the benefits accruing from exploration are formidable, and why we should seek to support foreign countries against our own investment I do not understand. How quickly we do this depends upon the pace at which we can settle the median lines with the French and Irish, but I think it better to do it in tranches rather than by means of the enormous round that was held in 1972 followed by a long gap, which tends to create problems with industrial development to meet the demands for equipment.</p>

<p>Will my right hon. Friend give an assurance that the participation agreements under the next round will make BNOC a full and active partner with at least a 51 per cent. stake in all oilfields with a majority say in decision-making, including the placing of orders to help employment prospects?

<p>It is intended that BNOC, when negotiating for licences, should satisfy us that the national interest is safeguarded. Whereas before we have had

the problem of trying to change the thoroughly bad licensing arrangement reached by the previous Government, this time we are starting afresh. Therefore, our opportunities are greater and the BNOC r&#x00F4;le will be the development of the policy for which I have now assumed responsibility. We have in the case of Gulf/Conoco achieved a real participation through the NCB(Ex) investment. There is also the Gas Corporation involvement. In the case of Burmah, BNOC has taken over the major responsibility. Shell and Exxon are now ready to enter into talks with BNOC, and this makes meaningful the policy on which we are determined.</p>

<p>Is the House correct in assuming that both the number of blocks offered and the stricter time limit covering the relinquishment of blocks have been designed to facilitate a level of expansion and development which will bring orders and relief to the hard-pressed offshore industries?

<p>It is not for me to speak for the Almighty, but the Prime Minister allocated those responsibilties to the Minister of State. We are trying to get


the best possible bargain for the people of this country, compatible with the need to utilise the technology and massive investment required to develop the resources.

In the new round of licensing we have the chance to maximise the benefit for the people.</p>

<p>I do not wish to be sharp with the hon. Gentleman, but if I had taken the Opposition's advice during the passage of the Bill the country would be no better off in any respect, and a great deal weaker in its capacity to defend its national interest all over the world. The nation States and Governments are seeking to achieve a commanding position for their own people in the benefits deriving from oil, but we must also proceed to participation by way of understanding with the oil companies, and by legislation. The legislation that we have adopted has been absolutely right. If the hon. Gentleman thinks that Shell and Exxon are meek in their approach to the Government&#x2014;and I see that he hopes that they are not&#x2014;I will leave on the record that in the event of conceivable difference of opinion the hon.

<p>My hon. Friend knows the answer. Not only has our policy been made clear; the consultative document is out, to give the trade union movement, the oil companies and industries concerned an opportunity to comment. My hon. Friend knows that in order to develop the North Sea substantial investment and technology are required, and that we intend that the British interest in that is represented by 51 per cent. participation.

<p>Yes, indeed. My hon.

<p>Everybody recognises&#x2014;I certainly do&#x2014;that when massive sums of money are required for investment a proper return should be expected from that investment. But I also think that with the uncertainties associated with world energy supplies, notably the sudden quintupling of the price of oil in 1973, to try to build an energy policy on the basis of reproducing in the public sector an imitation of a market economy, as was done before 1973, was a disastrous error, because it omitted wider considerations of the need for long-term planning. If we are to engage in the development of resources, we must also be sure that those resources are utilised. That is why a coal investment programme must be accompanied by a coal-bum programme and why we must relate all these things in a rational way. There are long lead times and great uncertainty. This does not lend itself to the reappearance of Adam Smith as the guider of the nation's energy policy.</p>

Friend believe that it would be a good idea to recommend to the gas and electricity boards that they should freeze their prices for 12 months?

<p>The problem of rising prices is central to the problems facing the country as a whole. I do not dispute that price freezes all round would be welcomed, but questions about the Price Code would have to be addressed to my right hon. Friend the Paymaster General. We have tried, in so far as it falls within the remit of my Department, which is


quite narrow in this respect, to examine various aspects, including the suspension of disconnections for old people, the review that my hon. friend the Under-Secretary undertook, and creative participation in discussions on how to deal with the hardship suffered by those who are undoubtedly badly affected by increased prices. As every hon. Member knows, those people include, in particular, the weekly wage earner, who may suddenly be confronted with short-time working and unemployment. The normal electricity bill is of a scale and magnitude that is exceptionally difficult for him to cope with. That is why prepayment meters and the other proposals made by my hon. Friend merit very careful consideration. It is a difficult question. We are not helped by being reminded by Conservative Members of the mess we inherited from them.</p>

<p>I beg to ask leave to move the Adjournment of the House, under Standing Order No. 9, for the purpose of discussing a specific and important matter that should have urgent consideration, namely,
<q>the effect of the Government's limitation on local authority expenditure programmes as set out in the speech of the Secretary of State for the Environment yesterday, the effect upon the problems in the immigrant reception areas and the consequent effect upon Government immigration policies".</q>
In addition to a limited number of London boroughs, the main areas of immigrant settlement in this country are in the inner crowded areas of industrial towns and cities in the West and East Midlands, Yorkshire and Lancashire. The Home Secretary's speech of 24th May set out Government policy on immigration and made clear that about 60,000 immigrants will be admitted to Britain during the next 12 months and that about this number of immigrants will be admitted in each of the following two years. It is clear that nearly every one of those immigrants will settle permanently in these already established and crowded immigrant reception areas. In the same speech, the Home Secretary also declared that no more resources would be made available to local authorities bearing these responsibilities.<br/>
As one example of the problem of these areas affected by the Government's statement, it should be borne in mind that Birmingham is now receiving more than 1,200 new immigrant schoolchildren every year. This is evidence of only part of the extra immigrant demand upon the resources of the city for education, housing and social services. Good race relations in these immigrant reception areas&#x2014;</p>

<p>The anxieties I have mentioned are shared by responsible elements in all the families living in these crowded immigrant reception areas. A debate is urgently needed because, following the Secretary of State's speech yesterday, the Government should at once begin a process of urgent consultation with local authorities in the major immigrant reception areas to identify the range of stress in housing, education and basic essential services. The local people in each area, including, of course, all immigrant communities, should be consulted with regard to these problems and the resources required for successfully coping with them.<br/>
It is clear that today the Government face a stark choice. They must either properly determine and make available sufficient resources to match the growth in the immigrant reception areas&#x2014;</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I must ask you whether it is not a gross abuse of the procedures of the House to pursue a blinkered, blind prejudice to try to make the racial situation in this country even more difficult than hon.

<p>The hon. Member gave me notice that he wished to raise this matter. I shall now give my ruling.<br/>
The hon. Member seeks leave to move the Adjournment of the House for the

purpose of discussing a specific and important matter that should have urgent consideration, namely,
<q>The effect of the Government's limitation on local authority expenditure programmes in the immigrant reception areas and the consequent effect upon Government immigration policies.</q>
As the House knows, under Standing Order No. 9 I am instructed to take into account the several factors set out in the Standing Order but to give no reasons for my decision. I have given careful consideration to the representations that the hon.

<p>I beg to ask leave to move the Adjournment of the House, under Standing Order No. 9, for the purpose of discussing a specific and important matter that should have urgent consideration, namely,
<q>the matters reported in the <i>Observer</i> yesterday, specifically the speech made by Mr. Kingsley Read, the leader of the National Front, and the growing problem of racialism today.</q>
You will probably be aware, Mr. Speaker, that in the speech of Mr. Kingsley Read, reported in the <i>Observer</i>, he is alleged to have said:
<q>I have been told that I cannot refer to coloured immigrants so you will forgive me if I refer to niggers, wogs and coons.</q>
He is also said to have referred to the recent murder of an Asian youth as
<q>One down, one million to go.</q>
Recent events in Blackburn, close to my constituency, involving the flooring of a councillor in a fracas and the National Front demonstrations during last week's visit of an Asian peace emmisary, have created a fear among Asians in my constituency. Only a few days ago the windows at the Gujarat Hindu Centre in Preston were broken. All this points to an attempt on the part of racialist forces to challenge the rule of law.<br/>
Prosecution of those who deliberately seek to ferment racial disorder, as in my view do the words of Mr. Kingsley Read,


must be undertaken as a matter of urgency. The important question posed by these events is whether we wait until the position so deteriorates in various areas of potential explosion or whether we act now to prevent the explosion.<br/>
I do not wish to be alarmist or to exaggerate the situation, but the lessons of the 1930s in Germany should have taught us that we cannot afford merely to hope that the problem will disappear. With the possibility of a worsening unemployment situation and the lowering of living standards, scapegoats will be pursued by organisations such as the National Front. The sooner the Government address themselves to this position, the sooner we shall be able to tackle the problem in Britain. It is on that basis that I seek to move the Adjournment of the House so that the matter may be debated.</p>

I believe that the issuing of a directive by the Secretary of State for Education and Science directing the Conservative councillors at Tameside, who won the election on a policy, to reverse their policy despite their victory will mean, if the directive is fought in the courts, as is likely, that parents will not know to which schools their children are going, and there will be indecision in all the schools until September. I urge that this urgent and immediate matter should be debated in the House because of the condition of education in Tameside this September.</p>

<p>This debate arises from the growing anxiety on the Conservative Benches and in other parts of the House about security policy in Northern Ireland. The Government should be under no illusion as to its depth and feeling. Despite the deaths of 1,546 people in the past seven years, no hope is yet offered of any new and decisive measures. Although the number of arrests of terrorists has been increasing, the Government appear to us to be marking time and drifting towards even greater violence if they cannot restore the authority of the law in Northern Ireland. We cannot afford the present world-weary and negative attitude in official circles. New thinking, it seems, is not being encouraged. Its absence is another reason for this debate, as it leads to a sense of despair among the people on the mainland as well.<br/>
That is not to say that the House lacks sympathy for the Secretary of state in his very difficulty task, which it has shown in the past to his predecessors. We on this side of the House agree with him on a great many matters, but an Opposition have a duty to put forward constructive alternatives, and the Government in this

emergency should give them proper thought and consideration. The Opposition lack the technical information in an emergency such as this to put forward specific plans on security. I think it would be agreed that we ought, as Members of this House, to advance those in outline which we consider to be responsible.<br/>
During the past few months we have increasingly criticised the lack of coordination of the security forces. It seems to us that no one is clearly in charge. The Secretary of State must make it quite clear that he is the civil power in Northern Ireland. The security forces in Northern Ireland are his ultimate responsibility. It would not be fair, when Ministers are questioned in the House about security operations, to say "It is not my problem but that of the Army or the police." The Secretary of State has the ultimate responsibility. He is the civil power.<br/>
The Government's policy towards guerrilla warfare which we face seems to involve a half-hearted containing operation. We think that the Government should go over to the offensive and declare war against terrorism. In the past few months, their comments have shown little sense of urgency. The Government still support the extraordinary fiction of a provisional ceasefire and yet claim that this does not hamper or affect the r&#x00F4;le of the security forces. The two are just not compatible. Everyone knows that the Army regards itself as being on a low profile at present. We feel that the present security position is deteriorating as a result of a lack of firm political leadership. The Army, the UDR and the police, who have borne the burden of the past seven years, deserve no less, and we are not criticising them.<br/>
A week ago, on 7th June, the Secretary of State was directly challenged in this House on the delay in reaching conclusions through the Ministerial Committee on Law and Order which he appointed six months ago in January. He replied that this body was concerned with the long term and that there was no magic solution or panacea. The House knows that already. That answer also gave rise to the present debate. Everyone knows that in the short term, from day to day and from hour to hour, the greatest anxiety of the people of


Northern Ireland is for life and limb. One person on average is killed every day. One hundred and fifty-five people have been killed this year alone, of whom 31 were members of the security forces.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman kindly asked political parties, including our own, to contribute our ideas on security to that committee. We have not sent a written memorandum, but we have made a number of suggestions to him over a period of several months and I set out several points in a letter to the Secretary of State dated 21st May. When I met the Secretary of State with my hon. Friend the Member for Epping Forest (Mr. Biggs-Davison) on 19th May, I drew attention to the need for greater flexibility in reacting to terrorist raids on the border. I said that an anti-terrorist force&#x2014;I have since called it a border force&#x2014;should be formed under the GOC from Regular soldiers integrated with selected men from the UDR and the RUC to provide local information.<br/>
I should like to expand a little on that idea. This would be a highly mobile force, specially trained, because it is necessary for the Army to be more adaptable in its ability to hit back at skilled marksmen. We are dealing, in the border zone especially, with hardened guerrillas, not the wretched hooligans who machinegun people at bus stops, and they will never be beaten unless the specialist nature of the operation is understood fully.<br/>
There would be no purpose in creating such a force unless there was a border zone where all movement was much more strictly controlled. Identity cards and movement passes should be in force in that zone, and a narrow strip on either side of the border should be the subject of joint control by British and Irish security forces, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bexleyheath (Mr. Townsend) has often suggested.<br/>
I know that this is an intricate subject, and the difficulties of doing this jointly are constantly argued. But that is not the way to win a war. Every reasonable plan must be examined carefully. I have informally made known my views in various quarters, because a cross-border security zone offers at least some hope of stopping the influx and exit of gunmen.<br/>
The way of the advocate on these frustrating problems is indeed a stony one. Today's <i>Daily Telegraph</i> agrees that such a plan would be excellent if it could be established. It says:
<q>The total defeat of the IRA might well be brought in sight".</q>
But in the same paragraph it says that the proposal was foredoomed. It says:
<q>The data should not be changed".</q>
The data are changing all the time. This is one of the proposals that should be considered, because close border co-operation is one of the secrets to the solution of this problem.<br/>
None the less, nothing should be done to discourage the Government from setting up an anti-terrorist border force on the Northern Ireland side and entering into further discussions with the Republic. I hope, therefore, that the Government will take some positive action on this. It is high time they did, and not only on the border.<br/>
Months ago many of my hon. Friends, including the hon. Member for Beckenham (Mr. Goodhart) and the hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. McNair-Wilson) suggested that the contribution of the UDR could be increased by full-time units working closely with the Army. These part-time soldiers risk their lives daily and show great devotion. Could the Secretary of State tell us what he is doing&#x2014;not in the future, but now&#x2014;about that proposition? This was put to him last autumn, if not before, and it has been very much in our minds during conversations with him.<br/>
The Secretary of State told us on a number of occasions on his plans for the primacy of the police. No doubt they have received a check from the wanton murders of policemen and women which have shocked the United Kingdom in recent weeks. The terrorists, unfortunately, still possess the operational strength to make many more such attacks if action is not taken. What, therefore, is the right hon. Gentleman doing, not in the long term but now, to see that, now they are in the front line, the police can protect themselves? Recently, we were told by a Minister of State during Questions that they had the arms that they needed if they asked for them. This is not exactly inspiring.<br/>
We hoped, at the suggestion of the Secretary of State, to talk to the Chief Constable about this. We were not suggesting a paramilitary force. We were suggesting that while the violence lasted the RUC should be armed with modern rifles and should receive anti-terrorist training like the Metropolitan Police.<br/>
The RUC has a splendid record which is often mentioned in this House. We hope that leaders of the Catholic community will urge people of their faith to join up and to support the police. As I have said more than once, unofficial action outside the police force would serve only to create further danger and would handicap the security forces in their main anti-terrorist operations.<br/>
All the security forces are in need of stronger legal powers to catch the godfathers of terrorism, some of whom walk about the streets scot-free. When the Government are questioned about this, as they have often been recently, they say that they do not wish to tinker with the criminal law as it applies to the whole United Kingdom. After seven years of destruction and terror, however, the special conditions in Northern Ireland have to be recognised by stiffer penalties for the deliberate organisation of murder.<br/>
As a party, we have proposed a new offence of terrorism, following the Gardiner Report. This would apply to the whole of the United Kingdom, as my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Wimbledon (Sir M. Havers) suggested in the debate on 25th March. What action is the right hon. Gentleman taking on this, and when is he taking it?<br/>
There will not be even a temporary peace in Northern Ireland until the Government declare war on these sordid and cowardly murderers. How can they do this while they are conducting clandestine meetings with their leaders? How can they possibly achieve the confidence among the population of Northern Ireland which is urgently required?<br/>
Last Monday, the Secretary of State said in reply to me:
<q>I am engaged, quite correctly, in testing the views in the community of Northern Ireland. In the penumbra of Northern Ireland, where large numbers of people are Republicans, it is valuable for me to do so, but I am not in business to negotiate with murderers on either side."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report</i>, 7th June 1976; Vol. 912, c. 929.]</q>

We can accept what the right hon. Gentleman said in the last part of that answer, but what exactly is he trying to convey to the House? Will he explain whether the talks have saved innocent lives?<br/>
The men we are discussing treat murder as a way of life. They are not going to give up violence while British officials are prepared to chat to them over drinks. There may be no negotiations, but inevitably there are rumours of a deal. Talking to representatives of the gunmen undermines the position of hon. Members from Northern Ireland in this House and of other elected representatives.<br/>
We are well aware of the pressure put on the right hon. Gentleman to stop these talks by Ministers in Dublin. We believe that such talks create a sense of despair and defeatism. They weaken the authority of the Government and encourage more terrorism. If the right hon. Gentleman continues them, with warnings from all sides, he must bear a terrible responsibility for the future.<br/>
We want clear answers from the Secretary of State to our suggestions this afternoon. Nothing which might help to restore confidence should be lightly dismissed by curt official answers. We agree with many things that the Government do in relation to Northern Ireland, but we must speak our minds and say quite bluntly that in the present security situation nothing which might restore confidence should be passed over. Too much is at stake. By the end of the year there will be more experienced terrorists out of prison and on the streets. We shall watch with some apprehension what the Government decide to do, because if they do not act the Army will have to remain for many more years and there will be no constitutional progress in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>What I should like to do this afternoon, in response to this debate, is to share my thinking with the House on the current security situation and what can be done about it. The theme of Government planning is the rule of law. I would like to describe what working towards the rule of law means for the security forces. I should also like to say something about the work of the Ministerial Committee on Law and


Order, which I have mentioned before to the House, and to talk about co-operation with the Republic.<br/>
I shall be talking about this very shortly when we debate the renewal Order for the emergency provisions. At the same time it is likely that we shall be debating the renewal of the Northern Ireland Act 1974. As this gives me two opportunities to talk about security, I shall be able to concentrate on political matters in the later debate. We must not forget, of course, that the security and political considerations cannot be divorced&#x2014;their relationship is not as simple as is sometimes thought. It is not my view that those who are involved in violence would stop it if there were a political solution.<br/>
As I explained in the White Paper of July 1974 and again in my letter to the Chairman of the Constitutional Convention of 14th January this year, which was published as a White Paper, our aim is to see a devolved Government in Northern Ireland acceptable to both communities there. As I said in my letter to the chairman in January this year,
<q>Experience in recent years has made it plain that no system of government within Northern Ireland will be stable or effective unless both parts of the community acquiesce in that system, and are willing to work to support it.</q>
It is in these terms that we have to view the security situation.<br/>
There is no doubt that we do not get full support for the security arrangements from a sizeable portion of those who are living in Northern Ireland. This is not something which can be achieved overnight, as we must remember that we are not operating in England, Scotland or Wales, or even in Great Britain as a whole.<br/>
The problem in Ulster is not the classical colonial problem that has faced this country in recent years. The security problem there is both urban and rural. It is a situation in which small groups of criminals wax and wane with the degree of support and assistance they get from the communities from which they come. When a community feels threatened, frightened and at risk, it will succour its violent men, giving them a standing they would not otherwise have. But we cannot ignore all the strength of

folklore and history combined in Ireland which is ever present and which we on this side of the water find difficult to comprehend.<br/>
What we are dealing with in fact is not a single problem at all but a skein of interconnected problems, compounded out of fear: the basic division of the community, malicious misinterpretation, remembrance of past injustices, intimidation, the criminal legacy of seven years of violence, the poisoning of community relations, vandalism, and the alienation of youth. It is especially the problem of youth and youth involvement which will concern us in Northern Ireland for many years to come.<br/>
Furthermore, we are dealing with a changing situation. The overall pattern has changed. There is less of a planned campaign, less civil rights violence with mass confrontation on the streets. Much of the violence is still orchestrated and directed, but we see more examples of unco-ordinated operations and individual criminal activity. This is something that the security forces have to take into account.<br/>
Some of the violence is the same kind as we have seen for the last seven years&#x2014;the killing of those who make mixed marriages, the murder of those who live on sectarian interfaces and who are the accessible victims of retaliatory murder, the blowing up of pubs whose customers are usually members of one community or the other and, of course, para-military killing of para-military.<br/>
The House will recall that 1976 began with a wave of sectarian violence in County Armagh. Five Catholics were killed, and this was followed by the murder of 10 industrial workers, taken out of their bus and shot down when returning from work. It was a result of action by the Government and mainly the security forces that the sectarian violence in the area was significantly reduced. But, as hon. Members have rightly emphasised, violence has since continued at a high level in other areas and under other guises.<br/>
The Provisional IRA has engaged in a campaign of cold-blooded murder against members of the security forces, particularly against the RUC and the UDR. So far this year, 15 members of the RUC, five members of the Army and


seven members of the UDR have been killed. Why is this? They are shooting members of the security forces and particularly policemen because of the growing success of the RUC in securing convictions before the courts. We have also had, in recent months, attacks on members of the Northern Ireland Prison Service.<br/>
One-hundred and twenty-nine civilians have died in terrorist violence this year. This includes not only members of paramilitary organisations but ordinary civilian members of the population. Those who provide the community with essential services, especially those whose work recognises no sectarian boundaries, are among the most frequent targets for cowardly attack. Those who wish to get on with their work in peace or to provide, in the face of mounting economic difficulties, employment to others see their premises bombed or gutted by fire.<br/>
The pattern of retaliatory killings was repeated over the weekend of 5th&#x2013;6th June when sectarian attacks took place resulting in 11 people being killed and a substantial number injured in a series of shootings and bombings without warning on civilian targets, mainly in Belfast. Intensive activity by the security forces in all affected areas was taken to limit the outbreaks of violence and led to a number of arrests. Without this decisive action, the casualties could have been much higher. It is perhaps no coincidence that last weekend there were more mortar and other attacks on the Army in Belfast, fortunately ineffective.<br/>
Those are the facts of the violence. Now I turn to the response by the security forces. Against this background, I shall give the House the simple facts of the security forces' achievement. The figures would have to be multiplied by 30 to give a comparable figure for this side of the water.<br/>
This year, up to the end of May, 497 people have been charged with serious terrorist-type offences, including 47 for murder, 38 for attempted murder, 142 for firearms offences and 93 for explosives offences. And up to the end of May 402 people were convicted of serious offences, 31 of them for murder. Some 1,300 persons convicted and serving prison sentences in Northern Ireland are serving more than four years; this represents

two-thirds of the prison population. One hundred and sixty-one persons are serving life sentences. So far this year, 26,265 lb. of explosives has been recovered or neutralised, compared with 22,724 lb. for the whole of 1975.<br/>
This is the nature of the violence in Northern Ireland. It is a variety of types, it has a variety of causes. There is no simple solution to this type of violence. There is no ingenious mechanism or sudden new initiative that will make the problem disappear overnight. If there had been a simple solution, successive Governments and their security advisers would have found it.<br/>
As there is no simple answer, we must be prepared for a long haul. During this period there is one fundamental key to advance, and that is through the rule of law. In the long run, the rule of law means enforcing the recognised law of the land in the recognised courts. To work towards the rule of law is the only way to proceed which offers the prospect of a long-term solution to the security situation.<br/>
We have already taken steps in this direction. No interim custody orders have been made since February 1975. When internment was introduced in 1971, with 1,400 people detained, apparently it was said glibly that it would all be over in three weeks. However, the violence escalated to far greater proportions. That was the effect of a proposal by the Parliament of Northern Ireland which was not within the rule of law as it is understood in these islands. That swift initiative, which made everyone feel so grand, did not succeed. I have found other examples in Northern Ireland where something is done which is pleasing and sounds good in the House of Commons but ignores what Ireland is all about. There is no swift answer or swift initiative.<br/>
I am glad to say that the last detainee was released in December 1975 and that special category status has been abolished for all crimes committed after 1st March 1976. As much as I supported that idea from the Opposition Benches at the time, I now believe that the introduction of special category status to give political status to men and women of this kind was a great mistake.<br/>
I mentioned earlier the myths that lend support to para-military activities in


Northern Ireland. But all those to whom I speak in the minority community tell me that the biggest step in reducing this support in the past year has been the ending of detention. At the same time, the ending of special category status has been recognised as a significant contribution in restoring the rule of law.<br/>
Let me deal now with the r&#x00F4;le of the Army in the context of the rule of law. The Army is not on a low profile. It is working hard for the greater part of every day, sometimes 18 hours per day per soldier. When there is increasing activity for two or three days, there is often what amounts to over-stretch. The Army is not showing a low profile.<br/>
The Army continues to do a vital job in Ulster under the leadership of the General Officer Commanding Sir David House. It will remain in Northern Ireland as long as it is required. Province-wide, it still has a vital r&#x00F4;le in providing an essential framework of security within which the police can operate, and it must be on hand to cope with situations which are beyond the capacity of the police to control. Its presence is also necessary in those areas where the police cannot operate alone. It is not the case that the police have not operated in these areas only for the past seven years. There are many areas where the police have not operated for the whole of the 50 years of existence of the Province. This is not a new situation. Given the existing level and pattern of violence, the continued presence of Regular forces in substantial numbers in support of the police is clearly essential at the present time and in the foreseeable future in Northern Ireland.<br/>
The Army is at present employed in the Province in the same strength as throughout 1975. It has been alleged both by individuals and in the Press that 1,375 have left the Province this year. That is wrong and is simply not true. There has been no reduction in the number of soldiers in the Province. The Spearhead Reserve, as the House was informed at the time, returned in May to its normal r&#x00F4;le of emergency reserve after four months in Northern Ireland. Soldiers constituting that reserve can be recalled if required. Meanwhile, the level of forces in and around the South Armagh area has remained unchanged from the level of January this year. The SAS

remains deployed there. A high level of activity will continue to be maintained in all areas where the threat of violence and intimidation is acute.<br/>
This means that the GOC, who is overall Director of Operations, is responsible for the detailed deployment of all his forces, including the UDR, and for the overall co-ordination of security force operations. Of course I have overall responsibility, but this is a point upon which I feel extremely strongly. It is not the job of politicians to interfere in the deployment of forces in the Province. My security advisers have the necessary knowledge for this task and they must be allowed to do what is required.<br/>
There will be normal troop changes as units go to and from the Province as part of the ordinary roulement arrangements. Some people misrepresent these changes. Every time a platoon of soldiers moves from one area to another, or gets on an aeroplane to return to Germany, we hear allegations of "pull-out of troops" or "sinister military moves". This would be laughable anywhere but in Northern Ireland, where the rumours are believed in inverse proportion to their foundation in fact.</p>

<p>Two points arise out of what the Secretary of State has said. First, at what point was the Army's profile raised? Until recently the Army was certainly under the impression that it was on a low profile. Secondly, is the right hon. Gentleman aware that, whatever else is the position, he is responsible for getting results from the security forces?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-06-14a.48.1" hansard_membership_id="381" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/19979" speakername="Mr. Rees" colnum="48" time="">
<p>I am prepared to accept the responsibility for what happens, whether that is good or bad. I say, however, that the deployment of the soldiers and their use must be a matter for the GOC and his officers. There have been complaints in the past of interference by politicians. They have never arisen from my actions, because I do not approve of that.<br/>
The hon. Member for Abingdon (Mr. Neave) asks about the Army's low profile. Last year there was a ceasefire. I did not describe it as a ceasefire. Those were the words used by the Provisional IRA. The hon. Member will see from the number of people arrested at that time that there was no low profile. However,


I stopped the twice-weekly search of every house in Derry and in certain other areas, but, if the security forces want to go to a house to question someone because they have evidence or because they are reaching a point of taking a matter to the courts, they do not have to ask my permission. I did not order a low profile.<br/>
Many people in Northern Ireland regard a high profile as putting the Army right round the green areas, going in and "fixing them" and seeing that the whole thing is cleared up by the weekend. The hon. Member for Abingdon does not say that, but that is the sort of action that some people believe will take us back to the times before 1968&#x2013;69 when there was no violence to speak of. I do not interfere with the profile of the security forces. They respond to the level of violence which obtains in the Province.<br/>
It is sometimes argued that greater effectiveness could be achieved if all the security forces operated under the direct command of a supremo security director. Full co-ordination of operations is, as I have said, already assured by the responsibility of the GOC as Director of Operations. The level of co-operation between the Army and police is of a very high order. The fact is that the r&#x00F4;les of the police and the Army are complementary, but they are different. In my view, that was the mistake which was made in the early days of the campaign. One cannot turn a police force into an army and one cannot turn an army into a police force. Their functions are complementary but they are different.<br/>
When we got towards the end of detention, I began asking myself why the Army was sent there in the first instance. Why did the people think that the Army went there in 1969? It was to separate the communities.</p>

<p>Exactly, The hon. Member for Antrim, South uses a phrase that extends the argument I am putting. That was not the situation two, three or four years later. It is not the situation seven years later. Nobody clearly thought out in the first instance why the Army went there. I believe that an investigation

could and should take months, because I did not want a quick, simple answer. I wonder who, in 1972, had the nice quick answer of putting men in a barracks and having aircraft engine noise in order to get information from them. I wonder what depth of thought was given to that. I warrant it was a swift thing done overnight to get an initiative, but I believe that initiatives of that kind do not face up to the facts of the problem in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>My right hon. Friend will recollect that when he and I were sitting on this side of the House in 1969 some of us had the gravest doubts, and there was nobody who imagined, that the Army would be there for seven years. Few of us thought that it would be there for more than six months.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-06-14a.50.1" hansard_membership_id="381" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/19979" speakername="Mr. Rees" colnum="50" time="">
<p>Whatever people thought, I say to my hon. Friend that it illustrates why I thought that a long, hard look at this and at the long-term trends of violence was necessary.<br/>
Now I turn to the police and the crucial problem of securing the greater effectiveness of the police in enforcing the law of the land. This is what the rule of law ultimately depends upon. This is the long-term problem that has been the main concern of the ministerial committee that was set up at the beginning of the year. This committee has been working for four to five months. I make no apologies for that. Indeed, the committee would not be much use if it had produced a quick report in a couple of months. Irish history is full of examples of quick responses and superficial proposals that have set off policy in disastrously wrong directions. My ministerial colleagues and I have been determined to avoid this kind of mistake and to take a long, hard look at what is involved in achieving the rule of law in the long term.<br/>
However, the work of the committee and the studies that have been carried out by our advisers have already begun to inform practical thinking and change action on the ground. The Chief Constable of the RUC has already set in hand a significant reorganisation both in RUC headquarters and in the field. The immediate purpose of this reorganisation is to enable all the available


resources of the force to be focused towards the paramount objective of the detection of criminals, particularly terrorists, and the obtaining of evidence which can be used in the courts to bring those responsible to justice.<br/>
Three aspects of this policy are now being implemented. The first feature of the new organisation is the creation of three regional crime squads which are already being formed. They will be closely co-ordinated with the Army. These regional crime squads are based on relative Great Britain experience. They will use the latest and best-equipped vehicles and communications equipment. They will add technical strength and muscle to the human resources&#x2014;the men and women&#x2014;of the RUC. They will cover the whole Province, corresponding to the North, South and Belfast areas, equating broadly with the existing Army brigade organisation.<br/>
Secondly, special emphasis will be laid on units, both centrally at headquarters and in support of each of the three regional crime squads, to collate resources and intelligence to gain convictions. With regard to that second aspect, with my knowledge of the evidence given me when I personally signed away 400 people, I regard that as one of the most important developments that the Chief Constable is taking.<br/>
Thirdly, there is the extension and more purposive use of specialised units dealing with forensic and similar technical work. I recollect, in the course of violence coming from one particular side of the community, that I was informed that a single weapon could shoot 20 people and that forensic evidence is what was required to tease out the sort of information on which a conviction could be founded. Forensic changes and similar technical work is part of this third point that the Chief Constable is doing at this very moment. The reorganisation of policing, led by the Chief Constable, is being vigorously pursued, and its end product will be evidence that can be used in the courts. This means getting information of a high quality that will stand up in court.<br/>
With regard to changes in the law, I wish to make only one observation today. That is, that there is no point in making

changes in the law unless the police can obtain evidence to substantiate charges under the law. Changes in the law may look good, but if they are unenforceable they are not worth a row of beans. I must make it clear once more that no kind of para-military r&#x00F4;le is envisaged for the police in this reorganisation. There can be no question of putting the clock back. We look to the future.<br/>
In the years following 1969, the RUC received a good deal of criticism. The RUC today is a different force. Approximately two-thirds of its members have joined in the past five years. I want to pay tribute today to the courage and professional competence of the men and women of the RUC. They are not a paramilitary force&#x2014;they are a civilian police force in the finest tradition. Neither the Police Federation nor any other organisation wants the RUC to become a paramilitary force. I want to make the police more efficient. That means giving them more support on the ground, like the police forces in the rest of the country, particularly the Metropolitan Police. That is the line in which they are moving.<br/>
RUC morale is today, in spite of the risks of the work, as high as it has ever been. The force is increasingly being recognised for what it is and must be&#x2014;a truly impartial force. Yet we all know that its acceptance is not yet complete. There are areas in Northern Ireland today where a full police service cannot be provided. Nevertheless, it is only by the increasing acceptance and effectiveness of the RUC that the rule of law can become a reality.<br/>
I very much agreed with the right hon. Member for Down. South (Mr. Powell) when he pointed out in this House on 7th June that any action, however well-intentioned and however understandable, by private persons or groups of persons, could contribute nothing to security and could only endanger it. As he said, it is only the security forces of the Crown which in the long run can prove to all concerned that there will be no practical result from vigilante groups or other misplaced private security initiatives.<br/>
I should also like to commend the views of my hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt), who said in a recent radio programme&#x2014;during last weekend, at the height of those very difficult two days&#x2014;that the numbers of


troops were less important than the question of people's attitudes. It is by recognising these true facts of the situation and in supporting the security forces that hope for the future resides. I take this opportunity to pay personal tribute to the contribution made towards achieving these aims by the retiring Chief Constable, Sir Jamie Flanagan. Sir Jamie was justly proud of the progress made by the RUC in recent years. He laid the foundations on which I am confident that his successor, Mr. Newman, will continue to develop the impartial and professional force that the Province already has and deserves to have.</p>

<p>Before the right hon. Gentleman leaves the RUC&#x2014;we agree with all he said about its not being a para-military force or acting as soldiers&#x2014;will he answer my question about giving armed protection to the RUC when it is in the front line?</p>

<p>With regard to arms, the Chief Constable is putting to the Police Authority&#x2014;the Government supplies the money&#x2014;the need for better weapons in the border areas and weapons of a different style to facilitate quick removal from a vehicle. These are being provided and we are also considering&#x2014;again, it is in preparation for ordering&#x2014; a weapon which can meet conditions in the border area better than the weapons used at present. This is a border situation where I am advised that these are required.<br/>
I have already mentioned the ministerial committee and the way in which its work is already informing action on the ground. The committee has almost completed its work, and I hope to say more about its conclusions shortly in the debate to which I referred earlier. I shall say more about the ministerial committee's conclusions in future. I had in mind at one stage the publication of a White Paper about the committee's work, but I have decided against that since I am anxious not to reveal operational and other details which could be advantageous to those who wish to destroy peace. The more I look at the early reports of the committee, the more it seems to me that there is in them what would be only to the advantage of paramilitary forces and is best not published.<br/>
However, what I can say now is that the committee has been concerned to analyse the nature of the foreseeable threat to law and order, to specify the measures and forces that will be required now, in the medium term and in the long term, in order to deal with the threat and to achieve the rule of law, and to show how successful action will depend upon interdependence and co-operation between the police, the Army and locally recruited forces. The report is long-term.<br/>
What I have said so far about the Army and the police therefore represents the initial stages in the application of the ministerial committee's ideas, which of their nature must be long-term. As far as locally recruited forces are concerned, I can say that we have decided, on the strong advice of my advisers, against the introduction of a Regular battalion of the Ulster Defence Regiment, but certain aspects of that issue are best left to the report of the committee in a few weeks' time.<br/>
The UDR, like the police, is not yet fully accepted everywhere in Northern Ireland. For example, it is not accepted by many people in the Social Democratic and Labour Party. That is a fact of life. It is not what I want it to be, and not necessarily what my hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, West wants it to be, but it is the situation. But I should like to pay tribute to the bravery and self-sacrifice of its members and to make clear that it has a vital and developing r&#x00F4;le now and in the future.<br/>
The UDR will remain a regiment of the British Army. It was set up in 1969 to support the Regular forces in Northern Ireland in protecting the border and the State against armed attack and sabotage, and it plays a valuable part in that latter r&#x00F4;le. It is its continuing r&#x00F4;le. It offers scope for men and women who have a good knowledge of their local areas to make a positive contribution, based on that knowledge, to the achievement of the rule of law. It will continue to provide an essential service to the people of Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman used the expression "acceptability" about the RUC and the UDR. Is he saying that the local community is not prepared to accept


the fact of these two bodies, or that history is against the acceptance of them?</p>

<p>Certainly, the mythology, folklore and sometimes the facts of history are against it. That is a major part of the situation. I am informed by those who are operating in the streets that they are getting far more help from people in the green areas, but we have not yet achieved acceptability in that people will openly come to them in the sense of the term "acceptability".<br/>
The interdependence and co-operation of the security forces on which I have laid stress is the key to the future. It is misleading&#x2014;I mention this because it would not happen here, but it happens in Northern Ireland&#x2014;to abstract and misdescribe particular elements of the developing programme, to coin such slogans as "Army withdrawal", "employment of soldiers by police" or "Ulsterisation of security". The value of the Government's approach lies in the combination and interdependence of the various elements of the security forces.<br/>
However, interdependence does not mean integration. It would be wrong&#x2014;I must keep saying this because the point is not understood in Northern Ireland&#x2014;to establish the police as a paramilitary force, for the police to conduct military style operations or for the police and the Army to merge in whole or in part.<br/>
I turn now to the proposal which has been made for a joint Regular Army-UDR-RUC force with special training and responsibility for combined anti-terrorist operations in border areas. On the advice of my security advisers, I do not share this view. Full co-operation and coordination of operations is fully assured by the existing arrangements. I under stand that the Government of the Republic have made a response to what the hon. Member for Abingdon has said&#x2014;I have a copy of it here if he would like to see it&#x2014;from which it seems that, from what they have heard of the suggestion so far, they do not think much of it either.</p>

<p>Is it not the case that when my right hon. Friend visited the Republic and had discussions with the Dublin Government

they fully supported the stand which has been taken by the British Government? Is it not also true that over the past 48 hours the Irish Government have denied the interpretation which has been put on a meeting they had recently with the hon. Member for Abingdon (Mr. Neave), stating that his version was completely in conflict with what he was told by the Irish Government?</p>

<p>I think that that must be a matter for the hon. Member for Abingdon. All I have seen in this respect is a Press report.<br/>
I have spoken so far of the measures we are taking and propose to take in Northern Ireland, but they cannot be viewed in isolation from those of the Government of the Republic of Ireland. We continue to attach the highest importance to achieving active co-operation across the border in a wide variety of security matters with the authorities in the Republic. There has been a steady advance since the discussion I had with Ministers of the Republic at Baldonnel in 1974. I may add that I regard that meeting as one which stimulated a great deal of what has happened since. My latest talks were on 28th and 29th May, when I visited Dublin and reviewed, with the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Justice of the Republic, a number of areas in which this co-operation has been developing. Co-operation between the RUC and the Garda is developing steadily.<br/>
This co-operation is important in two ways: first, to ensure that the efforts of our respective security forces complement and reinforce each other, and, secondly, to ensure that incidents involving the legitimate activities of the security forces on either side of the border against terrorism do not cause friction between us. My exchanges with the Ministers in Dublin were, of course, confidential, but I can say that the programme of co-operation covers all the vital practical issues, such as communications, control of explosives, exchange of information and joint planning.</p>

<p>There is one point about co-operation with the Irish Government that I should like to put to the right hon. Gentleman. I was in Dublin only yesterday. One of the biggest stumbling blocks to greater co-operation between the British and Irish Governments is the continuance, whether the right hon. Gentleman likes it or not, of talks between his officials and representatives of illegal organisations in the North. They are wholly condemned in the Republic.</p>

<p>I think that we must get this point clear. My officials do not talk with members of illegal organisations in the North. They never have done. The hon. Gentleman has put his finger on the point at issue. They do not negotiate or talk in the sense of Panmunjom and the rest. They do not take place nearly as often as people tend to believe. [<i>Interruption</i>.] There may be occasions when it may be necessary, and that is the position I take.</p>

<p>The difficulty&#x2014;it is one which we all share&#x2014;is that the distinction between legality and illegality which distinguishes the Provisional IRA from the Provisional Sinn Fein is to a large extent unreal. Everyone knows that a communication with the Provisional Sinn Fein is the equivalent of a communication with the Provisional IRA. I agree that legality is a matter of importance in certain contexts, but it is part of the anxiety which is felt that the right hon. Gentleman does not seem to understand

the tension that is created by these contacts with the Provisional Sinn Fein.</p>

<p>I think that I do understand. But in terms of Ireland&#x2014;the point was that there was concern about some talks which may be taking place&#x2014;these bodies, which I am saying are legal, are legal in the South as well and stand for election. In terms of Ireland as a whole, while I fully accept what was being said about an overlap, there are organisations which are legal. Indeed, on the Protestant side, the UDA is a legal organisation in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>It may not be right, but large numbers of politicians in the North associate with it from day to day. At the time of the Ulster workers' strike, they did that whilst still Members of this House. All I am seeking to prove is that the point about legality or otherwise is not as simple as is sometimes understood this side of the water.</p>

<p>Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that it is possible for a man to belong both to the Provisional IRA and to Sinn Fein and, in addition, that it is well known that the two bodies have broadly the same objectives and are in communication with each other?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-06-14a.58.4" hansard_membership_id="381" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/19979" speakername="Mr. Rees" colnum="58" time="">
<p>The link between what is called the Irish Republican Army and the political wing, Sinn Fein, must be true. The right hon. and learned Gentleman tells me that it is well known for people to belong to both organisations. If they are in the North and if this is so well known that he can prove it and will let me have the information, I will pass it on to the police, because it is an illegal act for which they can be brought before the courts. It may be thought that it is well known, but it cannot be well known, otherwise the police would have acted. A number of people tell me that certain men are associating with or belong to illegal organisations, but nobody gives me the evidence on which the police can work. I simply tell the House that it may prove to be necessary, whatever happened in the past, and if it is necessary to do that with organisations which are not illegal, it would be my duty to do so.<br/>
Finally, I should like to refer to the arrangements which came into force on 1st June 1976 under the Criminal Jurisdiction Act 1975 and provide for co-operation between the two Governments to ensure that terrorists cannot escape the consequences of the law by removing themselves into the neighbouring jurisdiction. Terrorists can now be tried in the courts of the one jurisdiction for certain crimes in the other. The RUC, the Garda and the legal authorities concerned are in regular contact to ensure that all the practical arrangements are ready to enable these procedures to work effectively. In all these areas it remains the Government's intention to work for the most effective understanding and practical co-operation between ourselves and the Republic. We share the same aims. If the terrorists were ever to achieve their aims in the North, the outlook for the South would be bleak.<br/>
The achievement of peace in the North through the rule of law will take time. Violence will not disappear overnight. The terrorist faces a bleak future. He cannot win. The Government will never surrender their obligations and responsibilities.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State, quite near the beginning of his speech, said something that has often been said from the Dispatch Box, regardless of who happens to be speaking, to the effect that no solution can be lasting and stable in Northern Ireland unless there is agreement. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will forgive me if I say that that search for wider agreement has often deflected and distracted us from what should be the task of winning the war against the terrorists.<br/>
There are various political reasons for the existence of the United Ulster Unionists as a separate party in Parliament, but there are also reasons that fall within the scope of this debate on Northern Ireland security. Whatever the Government and whatever the personalities, we on the United Ulster Unionist Bench feel that on occasions we have seen and heard it all before. There is no doubt in my mind that this mood&#x2014;almost of resignation&#x2014;stems from what is generally known as

the bipartisan policy. Whatever that may mean in Parliament, if it means anything, it is certainly something that the average citizen in Northern Ireland totally fails to understand.<br/>
In 1968 and 1969 the Labour Government certainly misread the situation. They failed to understand and identify the forces then at work. It is no good saying that the Provisional IRA came into existence at a later stage in reaction to certain other things. Whatever the position may have been at that time, the manipulators who are manipulating the situation to this day were in existence in 1968.<br/>
As a result of the Government's failure to understand, they took the incomprehensible step of breaking up and destroying the internal security forces of Northern Ireland. That was about as sensible as abolishing a fire brigade in the belief that its existence encouraged acts of arson.<br/>
To be fair, the Labour Government did not walk alone. The bipartisan policy ensured that measures, over which they might then have hesitated, were embarked upon with gay abandon. As the Secretary of State remarked, he has wondered since whether the people who took the decisions at that time really understood that they were committing the Army to a task from which it might be difficult, if not impossible, to extricate it.<br/>
I recall that my predecessor, in a speech in this House, asked the question: did Her Majesty's Government at that time understand the task, and how long a task it would be, to which they were committing the Army? We on this Bench derive some satisfaction from the fact that the pendulum has now swung the other way, but this House should never be permitted to forget that the concession in those early years to the No. 1 objective in the little red book of the international terrorist&#x2014;to destroy the internal security forces of the State&#x2014;encouraged the terrorists and made the task of the security forces so much more difficult.<br/>
The No. 2 terrorist objective of undermining and destroying the Government was carried out by a different firm of demolition experts&#x2014;the Conservative Government of 1970/74&#x2014;for the destruction of Stormont was perhaps the greatest


triumph that the terrorists could have hoped to achieve.<br/>
When the then Prime Minister was asked what was the object of the exercise, he said "We have done this to end the violence and to bring the two communities together." "End the violence indeed. One might ask how many innocent lives have been sacrificed in that process. It was that act of lunacy which not surprisingly, convinced the IRA that it had been given so much that it would soon be given all.<br/>
Again, I must be fair. My clear impression is that the Labour Opposition would not have engaged in such a foolish act as to destroy the established Parliament in Stormont with no clear idea of what was to be put in its place. The Labour Opposition did not join the few of us&#x2014;my right hon. Friend the Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) was one of the few, other than the Ulster Members&#x2014;who tramped through the Lobby on various occasions to point out some of the consequences of that act. The blessed bipartisan policy again came to the rescue of the Government of the day.<br/>
At a later stage, as if the lesson had not already been learned, the then Secretary of State met the IRA in face-to-face talks. We made our opposition known at that time, so that at any rate we on this Bench are entitled to tell the present Secretary of State that even the talks that have taken place between his officials and that other nebulous body&#x2014;the Provisional Sinn Fein, the Provisional IRA or a combination of both&#x2014;are highly dangerous and should stop. They cannot in any circumstances be justified. We feel&#x2014;the Secretary of State may agree with us&#x2014;that whatever limited intelligence advantages may be gained are far outweighed by the enormous political disadvantages.<br/>
Towards the end of that same Parliament both parties connived at the imposition upon Northern Ireland of a form of government that would never have been tolerated in any other part of the Kingdom. The crowning folly was Sunningdale, which the SDLP&#x2014;represented here by the hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt)&#x2014;was frank enough to admit established the machinery for transferring Northern Ireland to the Irish

Republic. We were grateful to him and his party for that warning.<br/>
The then Secretary of State, who is not present today, said about the Sunningdale Agreement that if people took the trouble to read it they would not become confused and would not misunderstand it. The people in Northern Ireland can read. It was precisely because they read it that they saw what was involved. They saw what was intended and what was planned to be their fate, for they rejected Sunningdale.<br/>
It is no good saying, as the Secretary of State seemed to imply today, that that was why the people were involved in the Ulster workers' strike. The verdict on Sunningdale was given in February 1974 by the electorate of Northern Ireland. Whatever minor local difficulties the House might have been engaged in about the future of the trade union movement, in Northern Ireland that election was fought on the Sunningdale Agreement. It so happened that 11 out of 12 of those who opposed Sunningdale were returned to the House. The message was clear, the writing was on the wall. Both Front Benches at that time should have recognised the message. They should have acted upon that assessment. Had they done so, the Ulster workers' strike, with all its consequences, would never have taken place.<br/>
Is it any wonder that terrorist morale remained at such a high level for so many years? On the other side of the coin, is it surprising that the Northern Ireland citizen might have come to the point of wondering whether he was on the losing side when he saw his wishes ignored and the objectives of the terrorists granted on so many occasions?<br/>
I am astonished that so many right hon. and hon. Members fail to understand the mood which we on this Bench try to reflect. For example, they cannot understand why we have no vested interest in provoking a General Election in the United Kingdom. One answer to that is that we have had three times as many elections in Northern Ireland as have the electorate in Great Britain. People then ask "What notice have they ever taken of our elections?" When we have been returned to the House and have said what we stood for and described the mandate


on which we stood in two General Elections, people say that that does not matter. They say "This is the Parliament of the United Kingdom and we do not take any notice of that."</p>

<p>I take the hon. Gentleman's point. He is saying that feelings in Northern Ireland are different and that we should take account of those feelings. That is most important. If we had done so we on our side might not have made grave errors over the years, although I am not saying that there are not grave errors on the other side as well. But the hon. Gentleman cannot have it both ways. If Parliament votes in a way that is not liked by the members of his party, does that mean that there is loyalty only so long as the rest of the United Kingdom agrees with the view of the small number of Northern Ireland Members?</p>

<p>No. I think that the Secretary of State, with his customary fairness, will admit that I have always upheld the sovereignty of Parliament, even at the time when, unfortunately, successful attempts were made to transfer it to Brussels. I hope that some day we shall get back that element of sovereignty&#x2014;but I am straying outside the terms of the debate.<br/>
It is not a question of the people of Northern Ireland being fed up with tramping to the polling stations; it is a question of their having expressed their opinion in the clearest possible terms. There was a clear expression of opinion in the border poll, when the vast majority of the people said that they wanted to remain part of the United Kingdom. What did the Government of the day do? They proceeded to have a conference at Sunningdale and said "Yes, we know you want to remain part of the United Kingdom, but we intend to set up this machinery to transfer you out of the United Kingdom."</p>

<p>I am glad to be able to confirm that statement. I hope that it will be noted by those who may be tempted to try such an experiment in future.<br/>
If the Government are determined to demoralise the IRA&#x2014;and demoralisation is probably the most telling factor&#x2014;there is no better way than to demonstrate that from this day onward Northern Ireland will be treated in exactly the same way as any other part of the United Kingdom, to which it belongs and to which it will continue to belong.<br/>
Turning to the physical and material conflict, it is undesirable to create new forces or formations. In my experience of war-time service, such activities tend to lead to confusion. There are already four branches of the security forces of the Crown, very well equipped to perform the task of coping with terrorists. In this debate we ought to address our minds to methods of making fuller and more effective use of the existing forces. For a start, we the elected representatives&#x2014;and in that I include those who are not at present with us today&#x2014;have a clear duty to encourage recruitment into the existing security forces of the Crown. In fairness, I think most of us have carried out that responsibility and we continue to do so. We want to assure the Secretary of State, in case there is any doubt, that that will be our continuing aim.<br/>
There is, however, another side to the question. The Government also have their responsibility. They must do all they can to remove obstacles placed in the way of suitable persons making themselves available and applying for membership of these forces. It makes no sense to me&#x2014;it is a position that I cannot defend&#x2014;to be given firm evidence of a case in which someone who has served with distinction in the Armed Forces of the Crown, who has perhaps lived most of his life abroad and has no connection with political, let alone para-political or para-military forces in Northern Ireland is rejected by the Ulster Defence Regiment or by the RUC Reserve.<br/>
I know that the Secretary of State is determined, and I make this appeal to him. The best service that he can render to assist us in what we are trying


to do to co-operate with him in increasing the effectiveness of these forces is to ensure that the people in control of the vetting procedures really get down to realities and exercise far more flexibility than they have in the past.<br/>
Her Majesty's Government have already given indications that they are sympathetic to the establishment of full-time formations of the Ulster Defence Regiment. We urge most strongly that they press on with this with all possible speed. On that point, it might not be too much, before the debate ends, to ask whether the Government will be in a position to give us some reassurance about their intentions.<br/>
I have said before&#x2014;this is no criticism whatsoever of the Army&#x2014;that it is far more difficult for the Royal Ulster Constabulary&#x2014;the RUC on the ground or the intelligence section of the RUC&#x2014;to co-operate with the Army, which is being switched around at four-monthly intervals, than to co-operate with the Ulster Defence Regiment element, which would be in a state of readiness and availability right round the clock seven days a week. It makes sense to aim at this.<br/>
If I were in the position of the Secretary of State, I would not become too depressed by the rumours about the Ulster Defence Regiment not being acceptable in certain areas, presumably on the ground that too many of them happen to be of one religious persuasion. I do not think I need point out to him that in those areas&#x2014;and they are a very limited number&#x2014;anyone representing authority would be rejected. If the Mothers Union were equipped with sand bags to extinguish fire bombs they would be rejected, as the Ulster Defence Regiment is being rejected. I hope, therefore, that the Government will not give too much priority to that objection.<br/>
I am sorry that the Under-Secretary of State for Defence for the Army is not present, because I should like to congratulate the Army on the tremendously difficult job that it has been doing. I wish to congratulate it particularly on the success it has had in apprehending terrorists immediately after acts of terrorism. Having progressed so far, I do not think it is too much to project and consider means of preventing these acts&#x2014;in other

words, apprehending the terrorists before they can reach their objectives. I concede that this may be a very difficult job, but it comes back again to the question of intelligence. It means that it cannot be solely an Army job. There must be greatly increased intelligence.<br/>
The Secretary of State has already conceded this. There must be greater cooperation between the RUC and the Army. The right hon. Gentleman was quick to pay tribute to the co-operation and collaboration that exist at top level; at least, that was my understanding of what he said. I am not so certain that that co-operation exists at all levels. This is something that could be usefully examined, because it does not really make sense for two arms of Her Majesty's security forces to be acting in one area in complete ignorance of what the other is attempting to do.<br/>
On the point that the Secretary of State made about law enforcement and bringing terrorists before the courts, I agree that there is not much point in the Army or the RUC picking up terrorists and criminals unless they can be convicted. This question comes back largely to intelligence. In this respect we welcome the integrated intelligence centres that have been set up, I understand, on the initiative of the new Chief Constable.<br/>
I began with a quotation from the Secretary of State, and I shall end with a reference to another quotation that he made in this House about 10 days ago. He repeated something that I said in his absence three days before, so I do not think he was paying me the compliment of repeating what I had said. He delivered one simple sentence which, I think, if repeated, would be more effective than all the hot air that is expended by all sorts of commentators who pretend that they know all the answers. He made a simple statement, with, for him, unusual vehemence from the Dispatch Box. He said that we must convince the terrorists that under no circumstances will they be permitted to win.<br/>
This House can do no better service to the people of Northern Ireland and to the people of the United Kingdom, than echo that statement today.</p>

<p>Though Honours is currently a


touchy subject, I think this is the first time, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that you have been in the Chair since you were awarded the Privy Councillorship. I am sure that I speak for everyone on the Government Benches when I say that we congratulate you.<br/>
Perhaps the low attendance at this debate simply serves once again to reveal the extent to which the House of Commons, if not the Government, has opted out of the problems of Northern Ireland.<br/>
Almost throughout the debate the Government Front Bench, plus the Parliamentary Private Secretaries and the Whips, have outnumbered the Back Benchers by two to one.<br/>
Frankly, I do not wonder at the extent to which many people in Northern Ireland resent what they see as a lack of interest by politicians on this side of the water. Perhaps it is not so much lack of interest as resignation&#x2014;weary resignation&#x2014;to which the hon. Member for Antrim, South (Mr. Molyneaux) referred just now.<br/>
From 1969 to 1975 I was one who publicly said that I felt there was nothing that the British Army could do in Ireland. I never understood why my right hon. Friend&#x2014;as hard-working a Minister as one could find&#x2014;or the right hon Members for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Whitelaw) and Sidcup (Mr. Heath) or my right hon. Friend the Member for Huyton (Sir H. Wilson), ever thought that they could succeed in Ireland where Gladstone, Cromwell and Stratford and, indeed, Edward Plantagenet had failed.<br/>
I never understood why they ever supposed that they could be successful. But now everyone says that to withdraw the Army would cause a blood bath, and one must accept that since so many people say that it is so. Many of us now simply shrug our shoulders and wish our Ministers well.<br/>
I should like to ask several questions. I hope that my first question does not display a lack of taste, but one is often asked what is the total financial cost&#x2014;the human cost cannot be counted&#x2014;of the Northern Ireland emergency.<br/>
I ask for the roundest figures available, and I must ask the question because I have been asked it so often myself.<br/>
Secondly, what encouragement, if any are the Government giving to the Dutch and to people such as Edward van Thijn, of the Dutch Socialist Party, who, with a number of other Europeans&#x2014;not only those in the European Parliament&#x2014;has tried his best to achieve some kind of dialogue? With their history the Dutch may have some part to play. Although it may seem far fetched, any straw is worth grabbing.<br/>
I must register a most unpopular, possibly ill-informed and perhaps naive opinion about the people who criticise the Secretary of State for allowing his officials to talk to people. As an outsider, I go back to back to the old Churchillian principle that jaw-jaw is better than war-war.<br/>
I have been to Northern Ireland and talked to both sides, although perhaps I have not been there as recently as I should.<br/>
Nevertheless, it seems to some of us that some kind of communication line must be kept open. Whatever one's feelings about talking in that situation, the idea of keeping open a line of communication is, at any rate, worth while, and the Secretary of State should not be vigorously attacked on this count.<br/>
The hon. Member for Antrim, South asked whether people realised in 1969. The frank answer is "Yes". Some people did realise in 1969. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will forgive me for referring to our late colleague, Dick Crossman, because he and others, who may have been wrong on other issues, said that more thought should be given before sending troops to Northern Ireland. Sending in an army is one thing, but extricating it is another&#x2014;one hundred times more difficult.<br/>
Thirdly, if, if, if, there are to be assemblies in Edinburgh and Cardiff and if, if, if, there are to be the same number of Scottish and Welsh hon. Members, which appears to be the pledge of the Labour Party, how in Heaven's name can we deny the Northern Irish membership, without Stormont, at least 18 to 22 hon. Members? Again, that is a question of politicians thinking things through before they act.<br/>
That is why, in the rest of my contribution, I propose to address myself to the widely reported speech of my right


hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Central (Mr. Short)&#x2014;the former Leader of the House&#x2014;which he made on 11th June. I have given him notice that I intend to do that, but perhaps my telephone message has not been received and I therefore acquit him of any discourtesy and hope that he will not accuse me of discourtesy.<br/>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Central said that the rejection of the Devolution Bill by Westminster would re-create the tragic story of the rejection of Home Rule for Ireland in the early years of the century, which led to a separate Irish State. That proposition should not have been formulated in that way.<br/>
It was like holding a pistol at the collective head of the House of Commons and saying "Reject my devolution brainchild and there will be civil strife". That is not the situation as it affects Scotland.<br/>
It will not be an absence of assemblies in Edinburgh and Cardiff that may cause civil strife. The remarks of my right hon. Friend, which might have been taken out of context, caused widespread resentment in Scotland&#x2014; a fact that was commented upon at a meeting yesterday afternoon of the West Lothian constituency Labour Party.<br/>
But my right hon. Friend deserves an answer, and it is this: should we not reflect on the close resemblance between the novel proposal in the White Paper and the structure of Stormont? There is an uncanny and spine-chilling resemblance between the two. To what extent did the Stormont system lead to a small, inbred, inward-looking society, which created the conditions for the tragedy that we are discussing today?<br/>
To set up a Stormont in Edinburgh could create conditions for a far less healthy society than we have in Scotland now.<br/>
Mr. Tom Nairn, one of the speakers from the Devolution Unit at the Devolution Conference in Edinburgh, talked in terms of the Edinburgh Assembly's having a single Scottish police force, responsible to the Assembly.<br/>
I want to register that some of us do not want any Scottish police force responsible to any Assembly. In his speech

my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said that rumour was in inverse proportion to fact. That is what can happen in the Press of a small inbred community.<br/>
For all its undoubted faults, shortcomings and exaggerated inefficiencies, Westminster has been a force for tolerance and understanding in what my right hon. Friend calls a system of devolved Government.<br/>
In Scotland we have, no less than in Ireland, our folklore and our history. Do not let any Scot imagine that we do not have our folklore and history. On 26th June there will be a mass rally at Bannockburn&#x2014;a place with emotive feelings. Therefore, all the malicious misinterpretations to which my right hon. Friend referred could easily be repeated.<br/>
Unlike my right hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Central, I conclude that Stormont-like Assemblies in Edinburgh and in Cardiff taking powers from the regions and the local authorities&#x2014;which are the subject of unprecedented attack&#x2014;will do little to benefit the people of Scotland and could do them untold harm. If debates of this kind have any purpose, they should serve as the kind of warning that might have been taken years ago in relation to the tragic problems of Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>Our debates on Northern Ireland are frequently clouded with distorted views of history, but until now I had not heard the Battle of Bannockburn brought into them. However, I can join the hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) in saying that, unlike the honours in some Honours Lists, your elevation to the Privy Council, Mr. Deputy Speaker, will give great satisfaction in all parts of the House. We were very glad to see it, Sir.<br/>
I can also agree with the hon. Member for Antrim, South (Mr. Molyneaux) that we in the House approach debates on security in Northern Ireland with a certain degree of resignation. It is almost seven years since I, with various hon. Members from my party, first went to Belfast and Londonderry and saw British soldiers on the streets in support of the civil power. If we proceed towards victory over terrorism and the restoration of peace at our present pace, it seems all


too likely that those soldiers will be on the streets in support of the civil power for another seven years.<br/>
The Secretary of State spent some time defending himself against the possible accusation that he was taking too many speedy initiatives. I would not accuse him of ever having taken a too-speedy initiative in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>I do not think that in his remaining time in office the right hon. Gentleman is likely to deserve our condemnation on that score, but there are four areas in which I believe he should take legislative action quickly.<br/>
First, as my hon. Friend the Member for Abingdon (Mr. Neave) mentioned, we should have legislation on the offence of terrorism. My hon. Friend and I and the Secretary of State have often agreed that the principal problem in Northern Ireland security is the inability to get at the men who organise violence. It is comparatively easy to pick up the front-line troops. It is not easy to get at the Godfathers. Since the Gardiner Report was published there has been an increasing flow of opinion towards the belief that the offence of terrorism should be put on the statute book. I hope that there can be action soon.<br/>
Secondly, we should have prompt action on the question of proper identification and control of movement. That means identity cards, first in part of Northern Ireland and then in the rest of Northern Ireland and the whole United Kingdom. The Government recognise that there is a problem, but they do not know what to do about it, as anyone who has read the report of the debate on 26th April on the Order affecting movement between Northern Ireland and the rest of Great Britain can see. They are hovering on the brink of introducing a proper system of identification when people move between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland and between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. I hope that they will be prepared to take effective action soon.<br/>
Thirdly, there is the question of the control of detonators. When some of us were in Northern Ireland in the second

week of April, we were told that there had been 4,849 explosions in Northern Ireland since the beginning of the emergency. I suspect that there have now been 5,000, a grisly milestone to pass. Their one common factor is that they have been set off by detonators.<br/>
Some of us are not satisfied that the present laws on the control and registration of detonators are adequate. The former commander of the bomb squad in Northern Ireland, Colonel George Styles, is perhaps the greatest expert on the matter. He is vehement in his belief that we need fresh legislation on it. My hon. Friend the Member for Esher (Mr. Mather) has introduced a Bill on the subject which, alas, has been blocked by Labour Members. I hope that the Government will take up that legislation or at the very least publicly state their reasons why they are not prepared to act to make the proper identification, control and recording of detonators mandatory.<br/>
Some of us are not satisfied that the technical advice that the Secretary of State and the Home Secretary are receiving on the subject is entirely correct. We should like a full Government statement so that we may see the thinking behind their decision not to implement the measures so sensibly put forward by my hon. Friend.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-06-14a.72.0" hansard_membership_id="9004" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29055" speakername="Mr. Carol Mather" colnum="72" time="">
<p>To do the Secretary of State justice, I should say that he has not been part of the operation to block the Bill, but the Home Secretary wrote to me saying that it was not acceptable. However, the security forces in Northern Ireland have been pushing for it or a similar measure for many years. Perhaps the Secretary of State will say&#x2014;</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-06-14a.72.1" hansard_membership_id="381" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/19979" speakername="Mr. Merlyn Rees" colnum="72" time="">
<p>Nobody has ever pushed me on this matter in the two and a half years that I have been in Northern Ireland. But I am concerned about detonators, and we are co-operating with the South on the matter. I spend a great day of time looking at it. I am not prepared to stand by and be told that I have resisted pressure from anybody in Northern Ireland on the control of detonators. Indeed, I am informed that it is very well done.<br/>
The other factor is that many of the detonators do not travel through normal


lines of communication as they do over here. They are home made, and so on. I am happy to look at the matter, but I will not be told that somebody put it to me and I rejected it, because that is not true.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-06-14a.73.0" hansard_membership_id="4953" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/15370" speakername="Mr. Goodhart" colnum="73" time="">
<p>I hope that the Secretary of State will consider it as a matter of urgency. Having talked to members of the bomb squad and its most distinguished former member, I can have no doubt about the vehemence of their feeling on the matter.<br/>
There is also the question of compensation for injuries. This is being investigated by a committee that has been sitting for more than 15 months, yet we still find that compensation of &#x00A3;20,000 is awarded to former terrorists&#x2014;I agree that that is an award that is under appeal and has not yet been paid&#x2014;while many members of the security forces and their dependents&#x2014;widows and children&#x2014;receive substantially less. Surely the problems are not so complicated that we need 15 months to go into the matter. Even if the committee reported now, it would take at least another nine months to get any change in the legislation on to the statute book. Can we sit back without criticising a two-year delay in making a comparatively minor alteration in the law?<br/>
I was sorry to hear the Secretary of State say that he did not intend to publish, in the form of a White Paper, the report, or even part of the report, of the committee that has been carrying out the long-term review of the security situation in Northern Ireland. But such is the state of security in certain sections of the Government in Northern Ireland that we can assume that the contents of this report will no doubt reach the UDA, and perhaps the Provisional Sinn Fein or the Provisional IRA. Perhaps somebody can look to them, or certainly to somebody in Northern Ireland, to make available to Members of this House the contents of that report.</p>

<p>I do not think that this is a matter for amusement. Many people are being killed in Northern Ireland, and we know that material gets out. I shall in future put to the House the general conclusions of the report, but there are large sections involving intelligence and intelligence collection which

I would be a fool to publish&#x2014;even if it means that the hon. Gentleman can have a little joke about it.</p>

<p>I would not dream of suggesting that the entire contents of the report should be published. Of course, we would not press that suggestion, but I should like to see a general outline of the report published. Indeed, I am delighted to hear the right hon. Gentleman say that there will be publication of a bowdlerised report, which was all we expected anyway.</p>

<p>I shall be giving the House the general contents of the report in the debate to renew various legislative provisions. It will not be in the form of a White Paper. I believe that I have a duty to give the House the general passages, but not the detail of the report.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-06-14a.74.2" hansard_membership_id="4953" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/15370" speakername="Mr. Goodhart" colnum="74" time="">
<p>I hope that the Secretary of State will go into some detail and will not confine himself to generalisations. However, clearly that is a matter for discussion later when we see what happens. I hope that even before publication, or before the Secretary of State mentions those matters in a speech to the House, we shall have further news about recruitment of a full-time section of the Ulster Defence Regiment. Many people have pressed for such recruitment for a long time, and it was also mentioned in the speech of the hon. Member for Antrim, South. The Ulster Defence Regiment carries out most valuable work, but it is composed largely of part-timers. This means that its work is confined largely to night-time and weekends. Much valuable work at checkpoints could be carried out by full time members of the UDR. I hope that we may be told that a substantial number of such personnel will be recruited to the UDR.<br/>
Finally, I turn to another regiment which has done much good service in Northern Ireland without attracting many headlines. I refer to the Royal Military Police who provide a valuable interface between the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the rest of the Army. Many of them spend many years in Northern Ireland. Service in that corps normally involves two years' service in Northern Ireland. I have been concerned about some of the problems in co-operation between the Royal Ulster Constabulary


and the Royal Military Police. Difficulties arise when the Royal Ulster Constabulary work side by side with the Royal Military Police, whose members are paid at a very much lower rate. That is perhaps unavoidable in the present situation, but I am certainly concerned about the long hours put in by the Royal Military Police at the present time. They serve in Ireland for a period of two years, and the hours imposed upon them must constitute a great strain. We in this House must never take the high morale of our security forces for granted, and we must take care not to impose an unbearable strain on those who bear the task of guarding society.</p>

<p>Last week in the House we were treated to a number of helpful and constructive debates on Northern Ireland. One dealt with the subject of industrial relations and the other debate centred on the question of fair employment. In contrast to those helpful debates, today's debate can do nothing for the people of Northern Ireland. Today's debate will heighten the divisions that we all know exist in Northern Ireland, it will be completely unproductive, and it will do nothing to allay fears or de-escalate tension.<br/>
I wonder why the right wing of the Conservative Party sought to bring forward such a debate at the present time. Perhaps it is attempting to ingratiate itself with those hon. Members who represent Northern Irish constituencies. Those on the right wing can be sure that on security questions there will be a unanimity of outlook between Northern Irish Unionists and Right-wing Conservatives.<br/>
In a debate that is supposed to be dealing with the security of Northern Ireland, with its consequences for the United Kingdom as a whole, there is a notable absence of the vast majority of hon. Members in the House. No doubt some Opposition Members are being fitted out with their finery for Ascot week, but we shall see what happens to attendance in the House on other days this week.<br/>
I feared that today's debate would take the form as we have seen it today. In other words, the contributors to the debate so far have spoken as though there

is only one class of terrorist in Northern Ireland&#x2014;namely, the Provisional IRA. Nobody so far has referred to any other type of terrorist in Northern Ireland. I believe that it is my duty to make the House and the country aware of the fact that there are other types of terrorists in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>In this House I have repeatedly made my position clear. I have said that the Provisional IRA is the prime cause of violence. We have subsidiary and subordinate forms of violence that will have to be dealt with and rooted out, no matter by what name they are called.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-06-14a.76.1" hansard_membership_id="4429" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/14891" speakername="Mr. Fitt" colnum="76" time="">
<p>I am now delighted that I came along to this debate&#x2014;if only to hear that admission by the hon. Member for Antrim, South (Mr. Molyneaux). That admission was not made earlier in the debate, and I am glad that it has been made, because people could have been given the wrong impression.<br/>
A number of deaths in Northern Ireland in the past two or three weeks, many of them atrocious murders, have been carried out by Loyalist murder gangs rather than IRA gangs. A Loyalist gang was responsible for machine-gunning the Clorane Bar. Furthermore, there was the attempted murder of a young Italian family at Mountainview Park, allegedly in return for the IRA killing of a Mr. Parsons, in Woodvale. Therefore, when we are talking about terrorists in Northern Ireland, we are talking about all terrorists.<br/>
I have made my position quite clear about the IRA. I believe that every terrorist in Northern Ireland, whatever cause he espouses, should be taken out of Northern Irish society.<br/>
I have noticed recently that the Opposition do not seem to have any policy on Northern Ireland other than to adopt a hawkish attitude. If they were in control there would be blanket searches, the IRA would be chased over the border, and the attempt to find a military solution would be completely divorced from any political developments. Those members of the Opposition at present in the House are not noted for their liberal views. We have only to look at them and at the constituencies they represent to know that if they were in government they would embark on policies that would


bring about absolute disaster in Northern Ireland.<br/>
If ever I have any doubt about going into the Lobby to vote for the Government&#x2014;and there have been a few occasions&#x2014;all I have to do is to look across at the Opposition Front Bench and all my difficulties are resolved. As I told my party yesterday afternoon, the military solution that would be sought in the event of a Tory Government coming into power headed by the present Tory Front Bench would bring us nothing but further disaster and tragedy.<br/>
Hon. Members have spoken of the UDR. It has been said that we should create full-time regiments. I know that Irish Sunday newspapers are not readily available in this part of the United Kingdom. I would, however, advise those who wonder why the UDR has not been openly and fully accepted by the Catholic minority to read yesterday's edition of the <i>Sunday Independent,</i> in which there appears an article written by my colleague in Northern Ireland, John Hume. The facts are there. He lists the names and addresses of members of the UDR&#x2014;the persons involved&#x2014;the dates on which they committed offences, the courts before which they were brought, the verdicts of the court, the convictions, and the fact that most of these people&#x2014;and there is a long list&#x2014;were found guilty of the most serious firearms offences. Further, my colleague reveals that some are in prison awaiting trial on charges of murder&#x2014;the murder of Catholics in Northern Ireland.<br/>
That is why the Catholic population cannot find any great enthusiasm for members of the UDR. I have deliberately stated on many occasions, and I do so again today, that, whatever criminal actions may be committed by members of the UDR and however serious the offences may be, there is no justification for attacks by the Provisional IRA on members of the UDR in Northern Ireland. Whatever reservations I have about the UDR, which I express on behalf of the minority population in Northern Ireland, I do not say that attacks by the IRA on the UDR are justified. I advise those who are interested in discovering why there is not total acceptance of the UDR to read the article to which I have referred.<br/>
After I had listened to the speech of the hon. Member for Antrim, South I was not too sure what this debate was about. The closed circuit television tells us that it is about security in Northern Ireland. I have not heard much about that. We had a little history lesson, starting from 1968&#x2013;69, Sunningdale, the UWC strike&#x2014;[<i>interruption.</i>] My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State confined himself to the security aspects of the debate. The hon. Member for Antrim, South went through Sunningdale, the Assembly, the Convention, and completely misrepresented Sunningdale. He said that those who participated in Sunningdale on behalf of the SDLP saw the Sunningdale agreement as the vehicle that would change the constitution of Northern Ireland, lead to the abolition of that State and bring about a Northern Ireland Republic.<br/>
That is completely untrue. That was never the intention of the SDLP participants at Sunningdale. There were so many in-built guarantees in the agreement that it would have been absolutely impossible, because of the veto held by the then Chief Executive, Brian Faulkner, for the agreement to lead to the downfall of the Northern Ireland State. This is not the time or place to go into the reasons for that political development.<br/>
I entered the debate to advise the hon. Member for Abingdon (Mr. Neave) that if he is seeking a military solution to the Northern Ireland conflict, to the total exclusion of any political progress being made, he is taking on an impossible task. There cannot be peace in Northern Ireland in the absence of political development.<br/>
Whatever disagreements I may have had with the hon. Member for Antrim, South, I hope that they will not have any deleterious effect on the talks now taking place between representatives of my party and the party of which he is a member, the official Unionist Party. Both sets of negotiators in Northern Ireland have, rather belatedly, seen the sound common sense brought into Northern Ireland by the right hon. Member for Belfast, East (Mr. Craig). There is movement on the political front. I hope that hon. Members representing English constituencies will not say or do anything which will hinder the success of those discussions. I hope that the political


movement which is taking place will be speeded up until eventually political agreement is found. As for the solution now being promulgated by the Tory Front Bench, I advise my right hon. Friend, after his experience in Northern Ireland, totally to reject the military solution now being put forward.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman is completely misrepresenting my view in saying that I was seeking a military solution. I said that there could be no constitutional progress until order was restored in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>This is where the hon. Gentleman and I disagree. I believe that the attempt to eradicate, to defeat, the terrorists, must take place alongside the search for a political solution. One cannot be done without the other. I realise that there may not be 101 per cent. agreement between the Irish Government and this Labour Government on the security question in Northern Ireland. But there is a hell of a lot more agreement with this Government than there would be with the point of view put forward by the Right Wing of the Conservative Party.<br/>
I know that the Irish Government are not very happy about interpretations which have been put on discussions held recently with the hon. Member for Abingdon. I believe that it had to take the unusual course of issuing statements to refute statements which it knew would appear in the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>. There is a bipartisan approach to Northern Ireland in this House. I hope that the hon. Member for Abingdon, or anyone else who thinks like him, will not go to the Irish Government and try to persuade them to make comments against the Labour Government. I believe that some attempt has been made in that direction over the past few days and that the Irish Government have rightly said that they will make their own decisions, without being influenced by hon. Gentlemen.</p>

<p>It is also uppermost in my thoughts that the people of Northern Ireland will be saying "What, another security debate?" They will be saying "Let us have less talk and more action." I can understand their feelings. My difficulty is to convince them that action leading to success is being taken. To that extent today's debate is useful and important.<br/>
Unhappily, I see little evidence to enable me to go to the back streets of Belfast to say that the job is being tackled in a wholehearted way. I cannot even go to the people in the back streets to tell them that the hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt) broke new ground today. My constituents would like to hear the hon. Gentleman say "We wholeheartedly back the forces of law and order, warts and all." It is vital that the forces of law and order receive the support of every section of the community. I can understand the difficulties in the hon. Gentleman's way, but that it is a hurdle that has to be jumped. The sooner it is jumped the sooner all can make progress.<br/>
I agree with the hon. Gentleman that when talking about security it is important to consider the political side of things. The two factors cannot be separated. I was rather glad that the Secretary of State made that point. I look forward to a future date when he will expound more on the political side. I do not agree that we should push ahead seeking only a military solution. As I understand the problem of terrorism, the first thing to do is to apply one's mind to the question how to starve the terrorists' appetite. It is necessary to consider how to deprive them of hope of success. It is not good enough merely to say that they are not going to win. Their appetite must be blunted, they must be robbed of all hope of succeeding. That is where the political aspect of security is vital.<br/>
I have no doubt that if we can achieve some sort of political settlement among the politicians of Ulster we shall have enormously strengthened the hands of the security forces. As we count the horrible toll of dead and mutilated and


the serious economic cost of the past seven years, each one of us should be resolute in our efforts to find agreement on future forms of government in Northern Ireland. The greatest strength the IRA has at present is the uncertainty about the form of government in Northern Ireland.<br/>
Direct rule, as it is misnamed, is probably not as dangerous today as it would have been regarded some years ago. No longer do the majority look suspiciously at this form of government, suspecting that there is some plot to break the Union and bring about a united Ireland. No longer do they suspect that direct rule will result in unwanted forms of government being pushed upon them. But that is not to say that the form of government that we have today is not in itself very dangerous. I believe it is incapable of bringing peace and stability to Northern Ireland. It is not likely in any way to diminish the conflict that exists in Ulster. At best it can hope only to contain it. That is not good enough when we think of all the people being slaughtered in our streets. We have had seven years of that, yet we can still debate in the Chamber in a manner that indicates that we shall tolerate the thing going on for a couple more years. If that is to be the attitude, we cannot express annoyance and surprise if people in the streets at home decide to take a hand in the game themselves.<br/>
It is our duty to convince the people that we shall tackle the problem and tackle it now. I know it is easy to say that and that we cannot deal with it by producing new gimmicks. I can understand the Secretary of State's saying that there are no quick and easy solutions, but I hope he will understand me when I say that it is not good enough merely to wipe out seven years of terrorism as though it had not happened. The pressure must be stepped up. The primary responsibility is with Ulster politicians to reach a settlement in Ulster, but the right hon. Gentleman has his responsibility.<br/>
Although the Ulster politicians have not yet made progress, I should not like to see the Secretary of State take a posture that suggests "If they cannot agree among themselves, I am washing my hands of the situation". That would be a policy leading to ever-increasing dis-

aster. Something must be done. If there is not the will in Ulster to reach a political settlement among the present breed of politicians, we must try again. We must also ask the people how they look upon the failure.<br/>
Assuming that we cannot make progress, the security policy has to make the best of a bad decision. It is right and proper that more and more steps should be taken to Ulsterise the security forces to a greater extent. It is a matter for discussion whether that should be done by creating new full-time formations. We want to see a much greater r&#x00F4;le being played by the RUC Reserve and the Ulster Defence Regiment.<br/>
I mention in passing a minor point relating both to the Reserve and the UDR. With the present growing unemployment we find a situation in which men who wish to serve in the Reserve and the UDR are barred from giving such service because if they do they lose their unemployment benefit. Although the numbers may not be great, it is not a good policy to allow that situation to arise. A man who is unhappily unemployed should still be allowed to give his service to the part-time Reserve and the part-time UDR without putting his benefit at risk.<br/>
It is right to talk about the primacy of the police, but we must talk about it in a realistic sense. I find myself increasingly confused by the terminology that is being used. In the Ulster situation, or in any situation in which the police have to cope with terrorism, it is nonsense to say that they are not to be in a position to act on their own to enforce the law against terrorism.<br/>
Any country that has to cope with the problem of terrorism is making a serious mistake if it organises its police on the basis that the army has to be called to the aid of the civil authority. It is not good government to allow a situation to arise in which it is necessary to call the army to the aid of the civil authority to cope with terrorists. That in itself gives an incentive to terrorist organisations to strike and to force the Government into that position. However we structure our police, matters must be organised so that the police can undertake all the necessary actions to combat terrorism.<br/>
I strongly support the steps being taken to improve the position of the police, but I say to the Secretary of State, with all humility, that he has not moved fast enough. I think he is placing too much emphasis on the difficulties that lie in the way&#x2014;for example, unacceptability in certain parts of the community is being continually overstated and is becoming a political shuttlecock.<br/>
Having stressed the work of the police, I do not want hon. Members to think that we were not conscious of the valuable work being done by the Army. The Army is doing a first-class job, and it is difficult to suggest how it can be better used, but the underlying strategy must not be based on day-to-day reactions. I am faulting not the Secretary of State but perhaps myself and other politicians who from time to time react to the events of the day. Recently there was an escalation of the situation in South Armagh and there was pressure on the Government and on the security forces to step up the presence there. There has been increased pressure in Belfast. We must not be seen to react to day-to-day pressure. We must base our strategy on properly deploying the security forces to cope with the situation throughout the Province.<br/>
Perhaps the hon. Member for Abingdon (Mr. Neave) had a point when he said that the border was a special problem. It is special in that it is a source of supply to the IRA. Anything that can be done more effectively to police the border is to be welcomed. I wish to put on record my appreciation of the policies of the Government of the Irish Republic. They have been good. But that is not to say that further steps cannot be taken.<br/>
I should like more consideration to be given to the idea of a narrow strip of joint patrolling along the border, but before we go that far we must insist on better co-ordination between the forces on both sides of the border. There could be parallel patrolling, which would mean some sort of joint operational control. If such a long land frontier is to be covered, it is necessary to have mutual co-operation in the deployment of forces. I am aware that the Government of the Republic, naturally and properly, are circumscribed, in that they fully accept

that their army is there only in support of the civil police and must act within that constraint. Therefore, we cannot push them too far on that score.<br/>
I should like to deal briefly with some aspects of the law. Steps to be taken in the new criminal jurisdiction Bills of both countries have been over-estimated. They will not be as valuable as has been represented to the people of both countries. However, I have noticed that in the European Community steps are being taken which seem to bring a new dimension to the law of extradition, and I should like to be assured that the British Government are doing all they can to hasten developments in the European Community, leading to a change in the law of extradition between the United Kingdom and the Irish Republic.<br/>
As the Secretary of State said, the law is only as good as the capacity to enforce it, but I agree with those Members who have said that the law can be strengthened. I should have liked to have had more time to debate the Gardiner approach to the law on terrorism. It is illegal to belong to certain organisations in Northern Ireland, but there are few convictions on record for that offence. In the Irish Republic there is a long list of people who are in custody because they belong to illegal organisations. It is the nature of the law and the standards of proof which create this disparity.<br/>
I know that the Secretary of State has an aversion to detention, and I can understand his thinking on it, but as the law stands he will not be able to get at the men who are really behind the violence. I urge him to think very seriously about adopting a new approach to the law dealing with the terrorist. I should like him to consider the question of penalties. I know that it is emotive to talk about the death penalty, but the gallant men and women of the Royal Ulster Constabulary face a long, hot summer. They have paid a heavy price, being the prime target of the IRA. Are not we justified in considering the request from the federation that capital punishment should be introduced for the murder of a member of the security forces in the course of his duties?<br/>
I am sorry that I have not more time to speak. I do not wish to presume on the House. I therefore close by saying that the situation in Northern Ireland is more depressing than most people here


seem to realise. We have debated it today in a cool, relaxed, conversational tone. However, the tensions and fears in Northern Ireland are increasing daily. I appeal to all Members to seek the way forward, but first to achieve a measure of certainty about our constitutional position, thereby improving the chances of the security forces bringing peace and stability to our beleaguered Province.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State said that this House and the people of Northern Ireland should be prepared for a long haul. Although he and hon. Members may be able to settle themselves to that thinking, it is not likely to be well received in Northern Ireland.<br/>
Coming off a late flight from London on Friday night, I was confronted with a newspaper headline which read:
<q>War footing call to the people.</q>
I paused, thinking that one of my rasher colleagues&#x2014;some perhaps would say one of my more realistic colleagues&#x2014;had had a rush of blood to the head, until I looked more closely and found that the Northern Ireland Labour Party had urged that the whole community should go on a war footing to fight terrorism. This call was not the call of those of us who are thought of in more extreme or Right-wing terms.<br/>
It is useful that Members from Northern Ireland, when going home, should see headlines like that, because there is a danger of our becoming complacent through our membership of this House. There is a danger of accepting the violence and of becoming detached from the realities of daily life in Northern Ireland by the artificiality of this place and of becoming increasingly brutalised at weekends by the events in our constituencies until it takes acts of the utmost savagery to make us react. I speak as a Member with a constituency which has had its fair share, if not more than its fair share, of such acts. We are in danger of falling victim to the cancer in our society, which is not the violence but

the acceptance of the violence, and of believing that a growing tolerance of it is the way forward.<br/>
That is why I welcome the poster campaign being mounted in Northern Ireland this weekend. It poses the question "When will you become a direct rule statistic?" Some may think that that is an underhand way of continuing a political campaign, but the reality is that for six, seven or perhaps a dozen people in Northern Ireland the answer will be very simple in the next week. They will have become a direct rule statistic, even on the basis of the figures given by the Secretary of State, by this time next Wednesday.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State has me wrong. I am not making the point to justify their comment or to sustain what they are saying. I am saying that one needs to be posed the question whether one is likely to live until tomorrow or until next week to be jolted back to reality.<br/>
We were told, though I hasten to add not by the present Secretary of State, that direct rule was a panacea. For that reason, we can cross swords with some right hon. and hon. Members of this House. That is why I welcomed reports of the Wolfe Tone commemoration ceremony in Bodenstown. I reminded the House this time last year of statements made there by spokesmen of the Provisional IRA who were also vice-presidents of Provisional Sinn Fein and their comments about the ceasefire, in the course of which they spoke about the gallant deeds of young IRA men. In their bloody terms, I suppose that they achieved quite a lot.<br/>
This year, we were told by a spokesman who was accompanied by Joe Cahill that they had met and defeated the British forces for the past seven years and would continue to meet and defeat them until the war was won; there would be no stop, and nothing could halt the fighting youth of Ireland. Anything that could have been thrown at the IRA had been thrown at them in the past seven


years. The IRA had met and defeated everything, whether it was the might of the British Empire or the activities of Free State Quislings.<br/>
If that spokesman had been addressing a group of two or three dozen demented hooligans, I could understand it. But he was addressing a meeting of 6,000 demented people, the majority from Northern Ireland, every one of whom was quite prepared to believe what he said. I welcomed that report, because it brought me face to face with reality.<br/>
I welcomed even more the fact that the principal of a secondary school in Belfast thought it worth his while, even after seven years of becoming used to conditions in Belfast, to telephone me in Westminster this morning to tell me that a bomb had been planted 50 yards from a college where he was overseeing a GCE examination. He thought it worth mentioning, bearing in mind the general educational controversy and debate taking place here, in order to draw attention here to some of the realities which educationists have to face in Northern Ireland. I was encouraged by that man. After seven years, he is not prepared to lie down. He is still prepared to telephone Westminster to complain so that the situation might be brought to the attention of right hon. and hon. Members in this place.<br/>
Before I received that message, I read on the ticker-tape that two bombs had been planted in Belfast. A policeman standing nearby said to me "It would not be the same if it had not been there." Although he was in no way defending the situation, in its own way his remark was a commentary on the attitude of this House, of this country and even of the people of Northern Ireland to what is happening<br/>
What are the Government doing? Over the past couple of months, they have introduced a number of measures which have restricted and angered the community. We have measures to deal with unattended vehicles. We have measures to deal with unlocked and immobilised vehicles. We have measures restricting entry into town centres. We have legislation to control movements at the border, and it is well known that it will never mean anything. But we have had to

pass the legislation in order to be seen to be doing something. We have restricted and controlled the sale of fertilisers and explosives. We have heard from the Government of their talks with Provisional Sinn Fein. But all that we have done as a result is to anger and to inconvenience the law-abiding community.<br/>
We do nothing really to take up the challenge of the terrorist. Why cannot we take away the forces and the manpower involved in carrying out these measures, which in many ways merely provide the IRA with a challenge to get round them, and use them instead to tackle the problem at source? Why put an iron barrier round a town centre when we should be diverting our attention to capturing the bomb-maker before the bomb is made? If we dismantled many of the structures that we have heaped one on top of another and diverted the resources to a more positive and vigorous campaign, we might get better results.<br/>
Recently we have seen a vigorous recruitment campaign for the security forces being conducted on television and in our newspapers. However, last Saturday morning I was visited by a former member of the Territorial Army. He served for 18 years, for 11 years as a sergeant and for the last five years as a company sergeant-major. He resigned in December. He was pronounced medically fit and given a recommendation from his commanding officer. He applied to join the UDR in January or February, and only last week he received a note saying "We are sorry. You are not acceptable." Presumably he was good enough to defend this country in the face of conflict here or in any other part of the world, but apparently he is not considered good enough to defend his community in Northern Ireland. A case of that kind makes nonsense of the thousands of pounds spent on security. How can we encourage people to join when we all know of cases of that kind?<br/>
A year or two ago, we managed to get a fairly large recruitment into the RUC Reserve. However, recently I received a request to meet a group of them. They came to me as my constituents and told me that between 20 and 30 of them had been sent to a police station in an area where members of the SDLP complained about the lack of security. In that station


they found neither the equipment nor the resources to do the job. As a result they are thinking of quitting. There seems little point in our taking people in if we are not in a position to use them properly.<br/>
The Northern Ireland Office has at last learned what any intelligent Northern Ireland politician learned seven years ago. It has learned to get into the war of words, which rules that when it is impossible to do anything about the problem in Northern Ireland the best course is to issue a statement and hope that it will convince people that something is being achieved. The Northern Ireland Office avoided this for a number of years, but during the past six months or so there has been a change. If there is an atrocity in my own constituency, before I can make a statement about it I often find that the Northern Ireland Office has issued a statement. The only difference is that I issue a statement because I cannot do anything. I get the impression that the Northern Ireland Office makes a statement because it does not intend to do anything.<br/>
I deliberately relate my next comment to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. It is to remind him that in the Greater Leeds area there are 1,500,000 people. There is no point in the right hon. Gentleman reminding us that we are discussing Belfast and not Leeds. If there were 100 policemen dead in Leeds, together with 300 soldiers and 800 or 900 innocent civilians, the Englishman would be quick to defend his castle. I am the first to express my gratitude to those members of the security forces who have died. Indeed, many of my own constituents joined the security forces and played their part. My point is that we are confronted with a situation where willing people cannot get into the security forces, where people feel for whatever reason that the security forces are not giving them adequate protection and where they see their neighbours killed, and no one can be blamed for saying that he will take action to defend himself. It is very difficult for me to condemn that kind of attitude, especially amongst my constituents, because I have to try to understand them.<br/>
I support what the right hon. Member for Belfast, East (Mr. Craig) said about

capital punishment. However, I would not restrict its application to the killing of policemen or soldiers on duty. Right hon. and hon. Members of this House have to understand that for some people in Northern Ireland it is as easy to kill someone as it is to take a cup of tea in the morning. It is as easy to say to someone "Here is a gun, so take it and kill the first Protestant or Catholic you see" as it is to turn over in bed and pull up the blanket round one's head.<br/>
Life has become cheap. People kill with impunity simply because of a person's religion, believing that somehow it evens the score. I differ from my right hon. Friend the Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) in this, I know. But we cannot apply the same criteria when we discuss the death penalty in relation to a situation like that in Northern Ireland as we would all wish to apply in Great Britain. Life is cheap. We have to put a price on it again.<br/>
It is all very well for those who argue against the death penalty to talk about the value and sanctity of human life. For the seven people who will die this week, their lives will not have been worth a snap of the fingers. For those who have already died, their lives were not worth that much.<br/>
To go out and kill someone, whether it be by throwing a bomb in County Armagh and killing Catholics or by standing 10 workmen up against a bus and gunning them down, is as easy to perform in Northern Ireland as any day-to-day activities. I talked to the one survivor of the workmen's massacre&#x2014;hon. Members would be horrified to hear the details&#x2014;and the one thing that struck him at the time was the cold-blooded, quiet way in which the orders were given to gun the men down. There was no panic, there were no raised voices. The order to finish them off was given quietly and cold-bloodedly. That survivor is not living in Northern Ireland any longer. He left, hoping to find peace elsewhere, but he will not find any peace of mind anywhere else. Therefore, I think that capital punishment should be given serious consideration in the context of Northern Ireland.<br/>
Special mention has already been made of a full-time UDR, and I shall not dwell any further on that matter.<br/>
Concerning the rank structure for RUC reservists, legislation already exists for such a structure. I hope that the committee will look at a separate rank structure within the Reserve in order to utilise the men in it properly. On equipment for the RUC, one moment we are told that they have adequate equipment and the next moment we are told that they do not. Half the time, I do not know which way to turn. I have continual representations from the police, who complain that they do not have the equipment to do their job. The sooner we clear this up, the better.<br/>
A lot has been said about the introduction of the Special Air Service into South Armagh. I know that its introduction was considered unacceptable by many people for a long time. I do not want to tempt fate, and I do not doubt for a minute that the IRA could be guilty of a terrible atrocity in South Armagh this very night. There is no point in keeping our fingers crossed and closing our eyes to the possibility. But the point is that for five months in South Armagh, since the SAS went in, we have had a degree of civilisation, much more so than we have had there for a long time. There may be an incident tonight or tomorrow that will change the situation immediately, but even this will not change the fact that the introduction of the SAS has made a difference.<br/>
In conclusion I say this to the hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt). Just because one section of the community in Northern Ireland is not prepared to play its part in defending the community, there is no reason why the other part should be stopped from doing so.</p>

<p>The bipartisan approach to the problem of Northern Ireland security rests on the need for national unity in support of the security forces, who are at grips with revolutionary terrorists. Against terrorist of whatever colour, and I say of whatever colour purposely in reply to the hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt), who has repeatedly misrepresented us, there is only one British side to be on.<br/>
The Opposition have backed the Government in measures to restore the

Queen's peace and the Queen's writ in Northern Ireland. But an Opposition which cease to offer necessary and constructive criticism with the sense of responsibility expected of an alternative government fail in their duty. If an Opposition thus abdicated their (unction, they would be extinct.<br/>
The Opposition, and pre-eminently my hon. Friend the Member for Abingdon (Mr. Neave), demanded the closing of the notorious "incident centres" which gave <i>de facto</i> recognition to a one-sided ceasefire which the Government refused to acknowledge <i>de jure</i>. In due time the incident centres passed away.<br/>
Last summer my hon. Friend and I expressed indignation about the state of anarchy in part of Armagh. The hon. Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker), who has spoken with his usual force today, took me around the southern part of his constituency&#x2014;that territory described by the IRA as "liberated" and by the Secretary of State as "bandit country". Our protests were eventually vindicated by the intervention of the previous Prime Minister, the right hon Member for Huyton (Sir H. Wilson). He described South Armagh not as "bandit country" but as "a special emergency area". That phrase was a rhetorical flourish.<br/>
Psychological and physical results, des pite the misgivings of the hon. Member for Belfast, West, came from the belated introduction of the SAS Regiment. I could put the right hon. Member for Huyton on a little personal honours list for that. However, it remains our duty to expose and oppose the flabby political direction of the best trained and most chivalrous counter-insurgency troops in the world.<br/>
A pamphlet published by the Bow Group, and much admired in the Monday Club and throughout the Conservative and Unionist Party, is entitled "Do You Sincerely Want to Win?" That question has been put today by the right hon. Member for Belfast, East (Mr. Craig), who spoke from ministerial experience on the security problems of Northern Ireland.<br/>
It is disappointing that without any explanation the Secretary of State in his speech rejected the demand of many of us on this side of the House, notably my hon. Friends the Members for Beckenham


(Mr. Goodhart) and Esher (Mr. Mather), for full-time units in the UDR.<br/>
In these troubles I have been privileged to accompany on patrol the County Down, County Fermanagh and County Tyrone battalions of the UDR and I have seen how many of those fine men and women are on patrol or other duties perhaps three times a week after a full day's work. They would have to be superhuman not to feel the strain.<br/>
I hope that the Government will be less negative towards the arguments which some of us advanced during the passage of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Bill and which were advanced again today by my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham for travel documents or other identity papers for residents of the United Kingdom. My hon. Friend referred to the Detonators Bill of my hon. Friend the Member for Esher, but the Secretary of State has claimed that he was in no need of being pushed. But the Home Secretary is, and, there is collective Cabinet responsibility for the security of the realm.<br/>
The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has reminded us that Northern Ireland is not a colony but is part of the homeland, yet some lessons can be drawn from the considerable British experience of counter-insurgency overseas. In Cyprus, for example, there were joint operations rooms working to a common plan from a single place. In Ulster there are no joint operations rooms for the Regular Army, the UDR and the RUC.<br/>
It has been said that the military and the police cannot be fully integrated because the RUC has duties other than those of security. But crime and terrorism are evils which nourish each other. The protection racket and the private army are intimately connected. Mafias that manipulate co-operative and other enterprises and get rich quickly and bloodily have their political connections. The endeavours of the CID, the Special Branch, the Fraud Squad, the new regional crime squads, the Royal Military Police, the UDR and Military Intelligence, praised by my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham, all receive information and should be more closely coordinated. The hon. Member for Antrim, South (Mr. Molyneaux) said that it was

not only the Army's job, and I welcome his support for the line we have taken.<br/>
In Ulster, as in Cyprus, the Army acts in aid of the civil power. In Cyprus the Governor and the Commander-in-Chief combined civil and military functions. In Ulster the GOC is the Director of Military Operations, but not of all security operations. The question in the minds of millions is who is in charge in Ulster. I presume that the answer to that question is the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. Yet in his relations with the Army command the right hon. Gentleman seems to have reversed the saying that war is too serious a matter to be left to the generals, a saying even truer of guerrilla war than of a war of formation.<br/>
In his dealings with the Chief Constable&#x2014;and we should wish to join the right hon. Gentleman in wishing Mr. Kenneth Newman all success&#x2014;he seems to disclaim any intention of intervening. That would be a very proper attitude if Ulster was England and the RUC was the Essex Constabulary. But it is not enough to rely for co-ordination on committees and the undoubted good will and good sense and ability of Commanders. It is for Ministers, and the Secretary of State who is supremely responsible to the Crown and to Parliament, to get a grip on the organisation of security, to knock heads together if necessary, and always to give leadership and inspiration.<br/>
We were again disquieted by the insistence of the Secretary of State on the usefulness of talks between his officials and Provisional Sinn Fein. The Secretary of State
<q>cannot pursue a resolute campaign of law and order, if at the same time he is agreeing to a verbal contact with the leaders of the group responsible for the greatest density of law breaking in the North of Ireland.</q>
Those are not my words but the words of a colleague of the hon. Member for Belfast, West&#x2014;Mr. Paddy Devlin.<br/>
We on this side deeply deplore the negative response of the Secretary of State to my hon. Friend's idea of a border force and a border zone. We can only regret that the idea has not found favour in the Republic. I think that in time the Secretary of State may come round to our point of view. If he does, it will not be for the first time.<br/>
Others of my hon. Friends have suggested that there should be a two-mile air corrider for surveillance by the aircraft and helicopters of both sovereign Powers, and for aerial hot pursuit.<br/>
We will continue to offer our suggestions as we should. Certainly we must beware of being impatient. Perhaps the Secretary of State thinks that we are being impatient when we assert that the report of the Ministerial Committee on Law and Order should be available shortly. Impatience and a demand for quick solutions show a characteristic weakness in democracies.<br/>
Impatience can only bring comfort to the Provos and the squalid "troops out" movement for which the hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) will not give his support, I am sure, in spite of the views he expressed today and in spite of his reminiscence of the late Dick Crossman, as much a friend of mine, I hope, as of the hon. Member. Dick Crossman was dominated in his appreciation of these matters by his experience of Palestine.<br/>
We must persevere for as long as is necessary. We agree with the Secretary of State that we must be prepared for a long haul. But there is no acceptable level of violence and no acceptable term for its continuance. I therefore conclude with words not wholly dissimilar from the Secretary of State's peroration. There can be no doubt of the outcome once the terrorists are convinced that our rulers possess an unbreakable will to win.</p>

<p>Perhaps, by leave of the House, I may say a few more words. The hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mr. Biggs-Davison) said that we must firmly have the will to win. That will is present. It is present among the security forces. Underneath that I come back to my earlier point about the nature of the violence in Northern Ireland and the political background to it. The violence is not just seven years old. I was told in Belfast yesterday by one solid citizen that all this had happened before. He told me that they had it in the 1920s, the 1930s, the 1950s and the 1960s. Obviously, the violence then was not on the scale that it is now. It is sometimes put to me that on those earlier occasions the violence diminished

and eventually ended. The view which is put to me is that this is what will happen again. It has happened that way in Ireland over the past 200 or 300 years. In the past, however, the violence has subsided only to reappear five, 10 or 15 years later.<br/>
Our job, therefore, is to deal with the security situation but to try to achieve political agreement so that generation after generation in Northern Ireland does not expect and accept violence as part of the story of the Province. I must make one point to the right hon. Member for Belfast, East (Mr. Craig). Apparently talks are taking place between the political parties in Northern Ireland, and apparently they are not explanations but negotiations. I believe that it would be a mistake for me even to begin to intervene in those talks. Also, if the belief suddenly bubbled up that there was a political agreement, and if that were to fall flat on its face, we would then be in a worse position than we are now.<br/>
We have to choose the right moment, and that moment will be when those who lead the major parties in Northern Ireland come to the Government and say that they are prepared to work together for the good of Northern Ireland. Once that general statement is fully agreed, all the rest will fall into place. The mechanics of government are not too difficult to find.<br/>
We are in the position referred to by the hon. Member for Antrim, South (Mr. Molyneaux) and my hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt), who dealt with what happened at Sunningdale. The only point I make about Sunningdale is not what could be read into it or what the words said. For Sunningdale to have caught on in Northern Ireland, it had to have the support of the people, not the politicians. There may well have been a time when that could have been achieved. However, whatever the words that we used at Sunningdale, they were not believe by many of the general public in Northern Ireland.<br/>
It would be a mistake for me to intervene in these talks on the basis of what I read in the newspapers or what I hear talked about. We know that the best way forward is to get a form of government in which the communities can work together. I well remember that when I


first went to Northern Ireland there was a great outbreak of violence in the Belfast area while the Assembly was meeting. That violence was designed to bring the Assembly and the Executive down. It was also designed to test the arrival of the new Secretary of State and the new Government. There were many new factors involved. If I say that on the political side we are ready to help when necessary and that it will be a long haul, that is not to be defeatist. It is rather that to have a sudden initiative or a rush of blood to the head at this moment would, in my view, be a mistake.<br/>
A number of points have been raised in respect of security, and I shall take one&#x2014;the question of identity cards within Northern Ireland. I make no comment about the wider issue of identity cards here. This question has been examined by security advisers a number of times since I have been dealing with Northern Ireland. If I put it to security advisers, it is not because I believe that they should tell me what to do. However, it would be no good my going in breezily and saying "Let us have identity cards" and then finding that it was not working. There would be an administrative burden in establishing such a system as well as the burden of enforcing it. I am advised that the benefits would not outweigh that.<br/>
Identity cards could be useful if they were accepted by the community. I am advised they would not be accepted by a part of the community, and we might well be in a position&#x2014;a sort of civil rights situation&#x2014;where identity cards were burned and people said "We are not going to have identity cards issued by an imperialist Government at Westminster". We would then be in the position where a good idea had fallen flat on its face again. It would also be a very heavy burden on the security forces, and I am advised&#x2014;I accept it&#x2014;that the system would cease to have security value.<br/>
The problem in Northern Ireland is not the identification of people. Powers exist to enable the security forces to achieve that. What matters is the problem of producing evidence.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, West asked about total costs. I cannot give a total cost because some of the later figures would be estimates. The main element would be the extra cost of keeping the troops in Northern Ireland,

which from 1969 to 1976 has been &#x00A3;180 million. The cost of compensation for damage to property and injury to persons is about &#x00A3;170 million. There are other governmental costs, which can only be estimated, such as the extra costs falling on the judicial and prison system as we are more and more successful at putting people in prison as opposed to putting them into an open compound, which was the previous system, based on lack of prison accommodation.<br/>
I have to add to that the cost of the 500 additional cell places being made available. Part of that number is now available. More places will have to be made available, and I am already spending money. There is the extra cost to the economy of lost production and investment and loss of jobs and so on. But I think I have given my hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, West the sort of figures involved.<br/>
The question of detonators was also raised. It is not for me to be involved in the question of detonator control in Great Britain. I am concerned about the question of detonator control in Northern Ireland. Arrangements are rigorously enforced by the police in the explosion and control of detonators. Also, needless to say, any detonators recovered by the security forces are examined carefully to see whether their origin can be determined. The movement of explosive materials in border areas is a subject on which there is close communication and co-operation with the authorities in the South. If the hon. Member for Epping Forest has anything he wishes to put to me about the stricter control of detonators or explosives, I shall examine it willingly. I was firmly under the impression, and I was so advised in Northern Ireland, that the control of movements by the RUC was first-rate.</p>

<p>The problem of movement and control in Great Britain is completely different from that in Northern Ireland. If it needs to be done in a Northern


Ireland context, that is a matter for me. In the course of my discussions on explosives&#x2014;and there are many&#x2014;I have been working on the basis of the advice given to me that the control of explosives and detonators is done extraordinarily well in Northern Ireland. There is, for instance, the control of explosives which have to be used for industrial purposes and so on.<br/>
With regard to the UDR and the question of its not being accepted, my hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, West referred to the article in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>, which I read. The article mentioned the names of people in the various battalions starting way back in 1972 and coming up to 1976. It contained their battalion addresses but not, I am glad to say, their home addresses, what charges they had had, and so on. That is a matter for the Ministry of Defence. Anyone in the UDR who gets involved in this way is quite properly dealt with.<br/>
Another point which was raised was that when people attempt to join the UDR they are told that their services are not required. That job is done by the UDR itself, working under the Ministry of Defence. I play no part in it at all. It is done in the same way as anybody joining the Armed Services is dealt with. It is not a political judgment on my part. In every case the examination of credentials, if that is the right word, is undertaken by the Army itself.<br/>
With regard to Regular members of the UDR, most of whom are ex-Regular soldiers, there is already a large number of these who are known as "consolidated rate" men who are paid by the hour for their work in the UDR. I have been strongly advised by everybody&#x2014;I have had no disagreement on this&#x2014;that the Regular battalion aspect of the UDR would be a wrong approach.<br/>
With regard to the question of Regulars within the battalion and the use which could be made of them, when a UDR company or a group of companies moves down to the border on certain days of the week they have to have the regular "con rate" men preparing for the journey and organising it. They perform a most valuable r&#x00F4;le. We are looking at this aspect of it with the Ministry

of Defence as part of the long-range investigations which are taking place. I have had it put to me in the last week or two that unemployed men are joining the UDR and getting paid for their work in the UDR but are having their unemployment pay or social security docked. The point is put to me that they ought to be able to claim both.</p>

<p>Of course, in terms of service to the community in Northern Ireland, that is not prevented. All I say to those who have raised this question is that I am constantly faced with the problem of payment to people who do jobs in Great Britain while they are on social security and who, quite properly, lose the money which they get from the State. Legislating to make an exception of the UDR would mean that there were other people in a similar position, and the whole problem would escalate.<br/>
Many other questions were raised such as that of compensation. I wish that it were as simple as the hon. Member for Beckenham (Mr. Goodhart) believes it to be. There was also the question of the law, and we are certainly looking&#x2014;</p>

<p>I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.<br/>
I do not see many veterans of previous Greater London Council (Money) Bills here, so I should explain that, due to the complexities of the London Government Act, the capital spending of the Greater London Council has to be regulated by an annual Money Bill which has to cover not only the current financial year but the subsequent six months as well. Therefore, this Bill covers the estimated loan and capital spending of the GLC for the current financial year and the six months ending 30th September 1977 and provision for the Inner London Education Authority.<br/>
When one looks at the Bill, one is struck first by the sheer size of the figures&#x2014;&#x00A3;510 million for the current financial year alone. That is just about equal to the total capital spending of all other local authorities in the country and about four times as great as that of all the local authorities in Wales. It represents about one-fifth of the capital spending of all local authorities in England. This underlines the impact of the GLC on the local government scene and the comment, which I have heard more than once in my brief membership of this House, that, compared with our Welsh and Scottish colleagues, those of us representing London constituencies have scant opportunity to debate and question Greater London local government issues.<br/>
In the present financial climate, and bearing in mind the present attitude towards local government, hon. Members will be particularly concerned to known what trends in GLC capital spending are revealed by the Bill. The internal capital programmes show an increase compared with 1975&#x2013;76 of just under &#x00A3;27 million. This is mainly due to the impact of inflation, particularly on materials and on building and construction work. On the other hand, loans by the GLC are planned to fall by &#x00A3;50&#x00B7;5 million compared with last year and, therefore, there is an overall reduction in the current financial year compared with last year of over &#x00A3;23 million. If one takes the whole 18-month period covered by the Bill the reduction is about &#x00A3;53 million, which, I suggest, is a substantial contribution both to the attack on inflation and on to need to hold down public spending.<br/>
If we look at detailed comparisons, we find that reductions are taking place in seven areas of capital expenditure. There are small reductions in the spending on museums, on staff offices&#x2014;which I am sure will commend itself to hon. Members on both sides&#x2014;on Thames landing stages and on the grants to London Transport and British Rail. Larger cuts are shown for road schemes&#x2014;this is Item 5 in Part I of the schedule&#x2014;which are down by &#x00A3;9 million, due in part to a higher rate of Government grant and in part to a reduction in the roads programme. There is a reduction of &#x00A3;3&#x00B7;5 million due to a lower rate of school building and site acquisition. Planning spending is proposed to go down by &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;5 million, basically due to a slow-down of provisional redevelopment schemes.<br/>
Increases are proposed in three areas. In refuse disposal, the increase is &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;5 million compared with last year. This is basically due to acquisition of a site for the new solid waste transfer station at Hammersmith and associated spending on other transfer stations. Flood prevention shows an increase of &#x00A3;2 million compared with last year, basically due to continuing work on the Thames barrier and associated flood prevention works. Those of us who represent low-lying constituencies near the river will be glad to know that that scheme is continuing.<br/>
The main item of increased spending comes under Item 10, housing. Here we find that the GLC's capital schemes show an increase of almost &#x00A3;39 million. On the other hand housing loans, under Part II of the schedule, show a reduction of &#x00A3;50 million compared with the revised 1975&#x2013;76 figure, which is after reductions made during the passage of the Money Bill last year. Housing is the largest element in the Bill. As I presume that it will loom fairly large in the debate, it is reasonable to make one or two comments about the GLC's housing policy.<br/>
First, the GLC, like all housing authorities, has to operate now within a nil growth situation inside local government, and the new building programme for 1976&#x2013;77 therefore remains the same as for 1975&#x2013;76, at a rate of 5,000 new starts per annum; and improvement and rehabilitation will be continued within the limits of central Government control.<br/>
I recall that in our debate on the Money Bill last year I referred to the emergence


of the strategic housing plan, something which many of us and the GLC have wanted to see for a very long time. I am glad to be able to report that discussions between the GLC and the London Boroughs Association have proceeded on the basis of the strategic housing plan and on the five main elements within it.<br/>
The first of those elements is that there should be targets for new building, conversions, demolition and rehabilitation. These targets have been agreed between the GLC and the London boroughs. Even more important, it is agreed that the implementation of these targets should be very closely monitored.<br/>
The second clement is that whilst the r&#x00F4;le of the boroughs as the primary housing authorities is recognised, the plan is based on the recognition of the essential nature of the GLC's back-up r&#x00F4;le to ensure new housing schemes throughout the Greater London area.<br/>
The third element in the plan aims at an ambitious co-ordinated allocation system for all local authority housing in the Greater London area, to be followed possibly by the transfer of the GLC's 180,000 houses to the boroughs&#x2014;something which many of us welcome because we believe housing management to be an essentially local responsibility. The fourth element is that there is to be the largest possible increase in rehabilitation and conversion of unsatisfactory houses and flats.<br/>
The fifth and final main element of the strategic housing plan is the aim to coordinate policies to get the maximum benefit from housing association activity and from municipalisation, because these are seen as the best means of tackling the problems of neglect, overcrowding, harassment and obsolescence in the private rented sector. Discussions are continuing on the basis of the strategic housing plan, and it is hoped that agreement will be reached very soon.<br/>
I relate these aims to the Bill. In the details of the housing policy, site acquisition shows an increase from the 1975&#x2013;76 revised figure from &#x00A3;14 million to &#x00A3;23 million. This is mainly for continuing acquisition of sites already approved. These sites, together with others already acquired, will provide the bulk of the

land needed for the current five-year programme up to 1981.<br/>
Secondly, the purchase of existing dwellings shows a reduction from last year's revised figure of &#x00A3;15 million down to &#x00A3;10 million. The actual spending last year was about &#x00A3;11 million, and that produced 1,450 homes. I think we have to recognise that the reduced level of spending on this sector will mean that it will make only a comparatively small contribution to London's overall housing needs in the coming year and that there will be a further deterioration in the condition of property in the private sector and, therefore, in the living conditions of many private sector tenants.<br/>
In the acquisition of dwellings under construction, there is a reduction from &#x00A3;21 million in 1975&#x2013;76, to &#x00A3;13 million. This programme supplements the number of new lettings available to families in need and makes a substantial contribution to the GLC's programme of providing to retired tenants cottages and homes at the seaside or in country towns. I am advised that the &#x00A3;13 million provided will produce 900 extra homes, mainly outside Greater London.<br/>
Next, the heading for new building, which is the largest element in the increased spending on housing, shows the figure going up in gross terms from &#x00A3;76 million to &#x00A3;120&#x00B7;5 million in this financial year. This is due to increased tender prices of contracts let in 1974 and to the increasing impact on wages and materials prices, but it represents a continuation of the programme of 5,000 housing starts a year.<br/>
On improvements and rehabilitation, the spending is up slightly from &#x00A3;19&#x00B7;5 million last year to &#x00A3;20&#x00B7;5 million this year. It covers improvements to estate dwellings and acquired properties subject to the approval of the Government under Section 105. It also covers spending in general improvement areas and housing action areas. There are also proposals for the general improvement of amenities on certain older GLC estates.<br/>
The estates programme provides for full modernisation of flats and cottages which still do not have separate bathrooms. It also covers the range of improvements on a package basis to 2,250 flats with separate bathrooms but which


fall below modem standards in other amenities.<br/>
Under Part II&#x2014;loans&#x2014;of the schedule the total housing spending is reduced from &#x00A3;125 million to &#x00A3;75 million. Home loans are subject to Government allocation. Last year provision was made for &#x00A3;95 million. As a result of Government cuts, the figure was actually held down at &#x00A3;55 million. Provision is again made at &#x00A3;55 million, although we understand that Government approval will limit advances to &#x00A3;52 million. It is reasonable to point out that this compares with actual spending in 1974&#x2013;75 of &#x00A3;110 million. That shows how far the GLC's home loans scheme has been curtailed.<br/>
Many of us welcome the somewhat happier situation of the building societies regarding home loans. Nevertheless, we recognise the continuing need for the GLC to assist families for which building societies do not cater because those families do not have an adequate income level or because the properties that they seek to buy do not come up to building society standards.<br/>
Finally, I turn to loans to housing associations. The figure of &#x00A3;20 million advanced in 1975&#x2013;76 has been retained in this year's provision. In fact, few new schemes will be processed&#x2014;only those basically already in hand. However, the GLC hopes to make loans available for a limited number of schemes aimed at encouraging co-operative housing ventures. For example, in housing action areas it is hoped to provide loans to private sector tenants seeking to set up their own housing co-operatives. In one or two cases it is hoped to provide new loans for housing co-operative building ventures.<br/>
I hope that those remarks will be of assistance to the House in considering the Bill. I commend it to the House.</p>

I am a little surprised that there is no Minister on the Government Front Bench. Although this is a Private Bill, it involves the expenditure of &#x00A3;268 million

of public money. The fact that there is no Minister from the Department of the Environment on the Front Bench shows the Government's casual regard towards major blocks of Government expenditure.

<p>How very touching that the appetites of Ministers should take precedence over their ministerial duties. There are enough Ministers in the Department of the Environment for at least a junior Minister to be here. We are discussing real money&#x2014;&#x00A3;268 million&#x2014;and there is no Minister on the Front Bench.<br/>
I want to speak about item 7 of the Schedule. The hon. Member for Woolwich, East rightly spent a good deal of time on housing, but I should like to reiterate what I have said before on many occasions&#x2014;that the GLC is not an efficient or a particularly effective housing authority. I should like the London boroughs to be made individually responsible for all housing within their areas and for the management of GLC housing estates.<br/>
From my experience of representing two London seats, I know that the GLC estates are not as well managed as are the local borough estates, and that there is a feeling of remoteness. In London we get to know the housing directors of our boroughs and some of their staff when dealing with cases. The GLC's staff always seems that much more distant and remote and, indeed, infinitely slower than the staff of the local boroughs. I believe that the overall housing authority should be removed from the GLC.<br/>
Members may say that that would mean that the poorer boroughs would suffer. I believe that it would be possible,


through the London Boroughs Association, which is growing in effectiveness, to arrange for the swap of tenants, which is done now, and for the allocation and rehousing of tenants from the deprived inner areas to the outer suburbs.<br/>
I appreciate that much of the debate will be about housing. Therefore, I want to turn to Item 7&#x2014;the capital expenditure of the Inner London Education Authority. That amounts to &#x00A3;23 million next year. I think that all London Members will appreciate that this is only a small part of the total ILEA expenditure. By far the largest amount&#x2014;over &#x00A3;400 million&#x00A3;is on revenue account. Therefore, ILEA will be spending &#x00A3;426 million in the course of the year, of which over &#x00A3;23 million is on capital account. Compared with the spend six years ago, it is a staggering increase. In 1970 ILEA's capital expenditure was &#x00A3;16 million, with &#x00A3;95 million on revenue account, making a total of &#x00A3;111 million. Today, six years later, it is &#x00A3;426 million&#x2014;a massive fourfold increase. I am talking in cash terms, but it is infinitely larger than the fall in the value of money.<br/>
During that time there were 35,000 fewer boys and girls at school in the Inner London Education Authority area, because there has been a rapidly declining school population. In 1970&#x2014;the year that I quoted&#x2014;there were 250,000 boys and girls at primary schools and 164,000 at secondary schools. This year the figures are 199,000 at primary schools and 180,000 at secondary schools. There has been a drop of about 10,000 pupils a year in primary schools in the ILEA area. No other education authority can possibly be experiencing that kind of drop in numbers of pupils at school. At secondary school level the drop between now and 1980 will run at about 2,000 pupils a year. Despite that, the ILEA is still spending increasingly large amounts of money each year. As I said, in the six years from 1970 to 1976, there was an increase from &#x00A3;111 million to &#x00A3;426 million and a drop of 35,000 pupils.<br/>
I wrote to Sir Ashley Bramall, the Chairman of ILEA, and asked what the pupil estimates were for the next five years. He told me what they were. I then asked what the expenditure proposals were for the next five years, which I

think was a reasonable question, and he told me in his letter that it was not possible to forecast ILEA's expenditure over the next five years. I think that he should have a word with the Secretary of State for Education and Science, who is asked to do precisely that&#x2014;to forecast educational expenditure over the next five years&#x2014;because included in that forecast is ILEA's expenditure.<br/>
All that I can deduce from this is that ILEA is reluctant to specify where it will make substantial expenditure cuts. If the number of primary school pupils is dropping at the rate of 10,000 a year and the number of secondary school pupils is dropping at the rate of 2,000 a year, inevitably there must be substantial expenditure cuts to match the drop. So far, ILEA has not made these expenditure cuts. The increase in capital expenditure in the last six years has been from &#x00A3;16 million to &#x00A3;24 million and in overall expenditure from &#x00A3;111 million to &#x00A3;426 million.<br/>
I am concerned about the whole constitutional position of ILEA. It is a constitutional hybrid. It has all the trappings of local democracy, with elected members, but even hon. Members would be hard put to name more than two members. One might recall the name of the chairman and the leader of the opposition. I and many Londoners have the feeling that ILEA is literally out of democratic control. It is a remarkably remote institution. Once again, the London boroughs would be much better left to run their own education, without ILEA.<br/>
ILEA pops above the horizon only when something has gone dramatically wrong. At 8 o'clock tonight "Panorama" is to be devoted to the William Tyndale affair. Vast sums of money are spent on experiments of that sort, which have more to do with social engineering than with educational improvement.<br/>
My constituency is affected, because part of the capital programme this year is the merger of St. Marylebone Grammar School with a local secondary modern school. That merger has been opposed for over 10 years. My right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition rejected the scheme in 1972, but it has been resurrected by Sir Ashley Bramall, the Chairman


of ILEA, who gave it such a high degree of priority that he became chairman of the governors to put paid for good to St. Marylebone Grammar School.<br/>
The proposals have been laid before and approved by the Minister, but the parents have taken the governors to court. They want an injunction delaying the merger, because of certain clauses in the charter, which goes back 200 years. The Government have decided not to go through the courts but to cease to maintain the school. That is a further example of the use by the Government of administrative methods to overthrow entrenched legal rights. The parents clearly would have obtained the injunction, but the Government impatiently said "Enough is enough, we want the end of this school so we shall stop signing the cheques for it." That is a use of administrative methods to achieve political ends&#x2014;a use that overrides individual personal rights. If anything has characterised the last six months of our political and constitutional history it is the scant regard that the Labour Party has shown for entrenched legal rights.<br/>
I am disinclined to support the provisions contained in the Bill for the expenditure of ILEA. The expenditure of ILEA is literally and physically out of control, as I believe ILEA is out of control. The officials, not the elected members, run ILEA. It is time we made constitutional changes to ensure that ILEA and the education services of London are run in the interests of the people who elect ILEA.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for St. Marylebone (Mr. Baker) used some characteristically broad phrases in describing what he believes to be the lack of democracy in the Inner London Education Authority. I remind the House that every member of the Greater London Council is a member of ILEA. In addition, each London borough has one nominated member on that authority. No doubt Paddington also has a member. I cannot, therefore, follow the hon. Gentleman's assertion that there is no democracy in ILEA.<br/>
There is always argument&#x2014;indeed, there is argument between this place and Whitehall&#x2014;whether the democratically

<p>My hon. Friend has an important point there. The hon. Member for St. Marylebone might know the answer.<br/>
According to Item 13, capital grants to London Transport Executive and British Railways Board amount to &#x00A3;22 million for the year ending 31st March 1977. I support the Bill, and this payment, but I suggest that the House and the citizens of London might look at the value they will get for this substantial sum of money.<br/>
In 1933 the House passed the London Transport Act. Subsequently the income from all the buses, London Transport railways and the four private main line railway companies was pooled. That meant that fares in the London area were equalised and there was no direct competition for money between the agencies involved. I do not think that this system operates today, but it might have advantages for the travelling public<br/>
The Greater London Council and the Department of the Environment have considered the co-ordination of rail services in London. The Barron Report, which was published some time ago, recommended the setting up of a co-ordinating committee to deal with rail services in London. The committee has not yet been appointed, although the GLC and the Government believe in principle that it should go ahead. I have asked several Questions of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment. I have written to him asking why there is a delay, and he has replied courteously. I hope that the Government will shortly appoint the committee so that the &#x00A3;22 million can be spent in the best way and the London travelling public get good value for their money.<br/>
A great deal of the money goes on the replacement of equipment, and I do not want to go into the merits of the


question whether that money is wisely or unwisely spent. I wish to draw attention to the amount of money involved and the possibilities for dockland. East London is under various pressures, of which the House will be aware. The resuscitation of Dockland depends on its transport links. We have the port, and the river is the first and most important means of transport. We have certain roads, some of which could be improved, and we have railways.<br/>
In my constituency there is an ancient railway, quite well used industrially, which has a passenger service, but the links between that service and London Transport are not good. The Barron Report suggests the building of additional platforms at West Ham to enable passengers to move from the District Line to the North Woolwich/Tottenham Line. That could have been done at the end of the last century. It should have been done after 1947 when both railways became publicly owned, but it has not been done. I have requested the GLC to get it done by Christmas. The people of East London are fed up with hearing about the plans, many of which were abortive, introduced by the right hon. Member for Worcester (Mr. Walker) when he was Secretary of State for the Environment. There is no reason why the construction of a relatively small platform, which need be no longer than the Chamber, and the realignment of a few railway lines, should not be completed soon.<br/>
I support the expenditure of &#x00A3;22 million for next year, and I confidently expect that the GLC, preferably before Christmas, will be able to afford a few pounds for a new railway platform at West Ham. That will be the first visible sign to the people in my constituency and in East London as a whole that the powers that be have a realistic attitude to Dockland redevelopment. This simple interchange, recommended two or three years ago by the Barron Report, would be a sign that those who have the power know what the people want and are willing to make sure that small sums are spent. In this case it would be a small sum compared to &#x00A3;22 million, but for East London it would be a sign of hope.</p>

<p>I do not wish to delay the House for many minutes as I understand that the Front Benches wish to give the Bill a Second Reading and discuss the Instructions.<br/>
This debate gives me an opportunity to raise one matter which I would not normally raise, not being a London Member, but I think I have every right so to do and I wish to follow the hon. Member for St. Marylebone (Mr. Baker) who spoke of ILEA and item 7 of the schedule. Some of the &#x00A3;23,200,000, I assume, will be allocated to the St. Paul's field site at Hammersmith. If it is not included under that heading, I presume that it is referred to under another heading dealing with housing.<br/>
I believe that this site should not be developed as proposed. It was never intended that it should be so developed when it was under the control of the old LCC. About 4&#x00BE; acres were intended for housing and the remaining 10 acres were to be open space. Unfortunately, all this has been overruled, and the local Members of Parliament have not thought fit to support the 11,320 people, many of them well known in all walks of life and all of them respected people, who have signed a petition asking for this development not to take place.<br/>
It is not that they are against improved housing. Of course not. They, like myself, have seen many thousands of houses in the City of London and the boroughs standing empty for up to 10 years. I try to play some part in remedying this situation by being involved in a housing association. The objectors say that this scheme is completely unnecessary and that there is a perfectly adequate alternative site which can be adopted if in fact it is needed at all.<br/>
One wonders about this Bill, in view of the cuts which have already been announced in education and particularly in teacher training. The old LCC, when it bought the 14&#x00BE; acres some years ago, decided that 4&#x00BE; acres should be allocated for housing and that the remaining 10 acres should be retained as a public open space, but the GLC now plans a large new ILEA building for West London's further education college. I do not know why such action is proceeding when these


cutbacks are going on. A further 8&#x00BD;acres is to be used for 296 flats. Even Labour-controlled Hammersmith has called this gross over-development, and local councillors have opposed it.<br/>
I ask that this matter be given further consideration when the Bill goes into Committee. Although it would be wrong to put down an Instruction to reduce that amount of money, because it would not have the desired effect, I think this matter ought to be reconsidered by the GLC, by ILEA and by the local Hammersmith Borough Council. I ask hon. Members to consider this in greater detail in Committee.<br/>
This matter comes somewhat ironically when we have this measure before us on the very day after the Secretary of State has thought fit to see Labour councillors at Transport House and tell them how concerned he is about the additional expenditure of local authorities in the London areas in this financial year. Here is an area where a decision could be taken, even at this late hour, to make some savings by the use of alternative sites. The housing is not needed on this site. It is much more important that the public open space remains. Hammersmith is a borough which has a vast need for more open space.<br/>
I know that the Secretary of State has decided not to intervene. I know that the protesters have tried to fight this matter through the courts but, unfortunately, have run out of money, so that they have not been able to pursue it very far. I ask that those hon. Members present will give some consideration to what I have said.</p>

<p>As the hon. Member for the Fulham constituency in the borough of Hammersmith, I should like to make a few comments on what has just been said.<br/>
The need for housing, and for council housing, which is the only way nowadays by which rented accommodation can be provided at moderate rents, is very serious. The need for the college has been demonstrated on several occasions over a period of years. The plan now put forward is not substantially different from the one which was approved by the GLC when it was under the control of

a different political party from that which now controls it, and under a Tory Secretary of State.<br/>
Over the years there has been much argument about this matter. At one time, when the borough of Hammersmith for three years had the misfortune to be ruled by a Tory council, the council's idea was that the site should be used for private housing and an hotel. What shocks me is that the people who now claim to be so concerned about the site made no protest at all about that proposal. It is apparently only when it is to be used for housing some of their poorer fellow citizens that we get these petitions and parades. The borough of Hammersmith, as has been pointed out, raised some objection, but that objection was met by the GLC by reducing the density, and the proposal now has the support of the GLC and of the borough of Hammersmith.<br/>
A real injury will be caused to the people in the borough, and particularly those on the housing list desperately waiting for housing, if this plan is interfered with now. It is all very well for people whose own housing situation is well provided for to sign petitions to prevent those who are less fortunate from becoming well housed.<br/>
In a situation like this, those who complain, those who, to put it bluntly, do not want council housing too near where they live, can of course, be identified. One cannot identify the people who will ultimately benefit from the building of this accommodation, but, although they cannot be individually identified, they are none the less real people with real needs. After the long years that we have waited for this project I am glad that the Secretary of State has given his approval, and I trust that this scheme will be carried into operation as soon as possible.</p>

<q>That it be an Instruction to the Committee on the Bill to reduce the total sum of '&#x00A3;96,000,000' mentioned on page 8 (Part III) of the Schedule by &#x00A3;45,000,000 by&#x2014;</q>

<q>in column 3, by leaving out, '&#x00A3;30,000,000' and inserting '&#x00A3;415,000,000'.</q>
The first Instruction deals with item 10 in Part I of the schedule and refers to the acquisition of property, while the second Instruction, dealing with item 24 of Part III of the schedule, refers to contingencies, where our aim is to reduce the requirement from &#x00A3;60 million to &#x00A3;30 million.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-06-14a.115.2" colnum="115" time="">
<p>For the convenience of the House I shall deal with the Instructions in reverse order, as I feel that the Instruction on contingencies may prove to be less contentious than that dealing with municipalisation. Although this is not a matter of party political debate, we believe that provision of &#x00A3;60 million for contingencies or "other purposes", as described in the schedule, is both excessive and unreasonable. <br/>
It is alarming to find that the amount earmarked for contingencies by the GLC has grown over the years from &#x00A3;10 million in 1965&#x2013;66 to the present high figure of &#x00A3;60 million. Even five years ago the amount stood at only &#x00A3;12 million, and at no time in the past 10 years has the amount actually drawn exceeded &#x00A3;15&#x00B7;6 million. Indeed, in the two years 1971&#x2013;72 and 1972&#x2013;73 the amount drawn was less than &#x00A3;1 million. There is still some discussion on the precise figure drawn last year 1975&#x2013;76, but at the highest estimate it is unlikely to be more than &#x00A3;20 million.<br/>
We are told that a contingency provision of that size is required to provide statutory authority for any unforeseen event, to allow for inflation and to reflect possible changes in Government and GLC policy during the year. I am dubious about those points. Unless one anticipates that the present Government's anti-inflation policy will face total collapse, it is fair to assume that the inflationary pressures facing the economy during the next 12 months will not be significantly greater than in the past 12 months.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-06-14a.116.0" colnum="116" time="">
<p>On any changes in Government or GLC policy one must equally assume, particularly in the light of the speech by the Secretary of State for the Environment last night, that any changes in the next 12 months are more likely to take the form of cuts than increases in expenditure. Halving the contingency item along the lines that we propose would act as a salutary financial discipline upon those in charge of GLC policies at a time when it is more important than ever that local government should operate within strict guidelines and strict financial targets.</p>

<p>We maintain that a contingency item of that size is unnecessary and undesirable and that a reduction to &#x00A3;30 million would not only be more appropriate and realistic but would reflect the needs of the moment to contain and curtail local government spending. In saying that, I hope that I shall carry at least some hon. Members on the Government side with me. I am not as hopeful of carrying them with me in the next part of my speech as I turn to the other Instruction, which deals with housing acquisition or municipalisation.</p>

We are informed that of the total amount in item 10&#x2014;it is a large figure&#x2014;about &#x00A3;13 million relates to the proposed acquisition of dwellings under construction by private developers. Of that &#x00A3;13 million, about &#x00A3;9 million is already fully committed and a further &#x00A3;2&#x00BD; million is morally committed by agreement of terms with developers. For that reason, we propose to cut Item 10 by &#x00A3;1,250,000.</p>

<p>Our basic objection to municipalisation is that it does not add a single new home to London's housing stock. Where the houses acquired by the GLC would otherwise have been sold on the open market, the GLC's intervention sometimes helps to keep house prices artificially high. Where the houses acquired would otherwise be available for letting, the GLC's action further restricts the amount of rented accommodation in the private sector.</p>

<p>All hon. Members know of countless cases of young people, in particular students, single people and newly marrieds, who can never accumulate sufficient housing points to he housed from a council's waiting lists, although they are in desperate need of accommodation. In the past, the private sector predominantly met the needs of such people. Today, however, largely because of the 1974 Act, that type of accommodation has virtually dried up.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Ravensbourne (Mr. Hunt) has made an interesting speech, much of which I can agree with so far. But it is a bit thick to say that the reason why local authorities have had to try to provide homes in London and the boroughs is the huge success of private enterprise in supplying them. The contrary is true. The GLC and other local authorities have had to provide as many homes as possible because the private sector has lamentably failed.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Ealing, North (Mr. Molloy) has missed the point. Many categories of people, because of the operation of the points allocation system, will never qualify for a council house. For that reason, they

can never look, either through ordinary council development or through municipalisation, for rehousing by local councils. Therefore, the private sector has a r&#x00F4;le to play, but that r&#x00F4;le has been undermined by the 1974 Act, which has virtually dried up the supply of accommodation upon which those people previously depended. One has only to look at the advertisement in the London evening newspapers today and compare them with those of four or five years ago to see the extent by which the amount of furnished accommodation available for letting has slumped dramatically since the passing of that Act.<br/>
A survey published in February this year by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors showed that the number of furnished properties available in the inner urban areas and in London in particular 20 per cent. since the introduction of the 1974 Act. That understimates the position in Greater London.<br/>
I beg the Government and the Labour leaders of the GLC to recognise the heartbreak and anguish caused to so many people because of the shrinking market in private rented accommodation. The GLC should hesitate before it accentuates the problems by its policy of municipalisation. It has already acquired more than 6,000 properties at a cost of about &#x00A3;46 million. The majority of those houses were already occupied, so that no contribution has been made to the reduction of housing lists. The time has come to call a halt to the expensive and dubious municipalisation exercise.<br/>
The GLC's excursions into what is euphemistically called social ownership have been none too happy. I give just one example, the Cardigan Estate in Enfield, where in February 1975 132 houses were acquired. Nine months later 20 stood vacant, and many were said to be unsuitable for reletting because of rising damp and defective flooring and roofs&#x2014;not exactly a triumph for municipalisation or Socialist planning.<br/>
Therefore, we are bound to ask why the GLC is so eager to pursue its municipalisation programme. It already holds land sufficient to build 38,000 dwellings, which, on the basis of the current completion of 5,000 dwellings a year, as we were told on Second Reading, represents enough for at least the next seven years One would expect financial prudence,


apart from any broader policy considerations, to make the GLC hesitate before going ahead with the acquisition of private developments in preference to development of its own acres which are lying unused.<br/>
In the supplementary statement which we received from the GLC's Solicitor and Parliamentary Officer&#x2014;and I gladly pay tribute to the helpful notes and information which are sent to us on all these occasions&#x2014;we were told that the GLC's acquisition programme
<q>makes a major contribution to the Council's scheme of providing homes for retired tenants at the seaside or country towns.</q>
I am sure we all agree that it is sensible for the GLC to enable retired people to move out of London and thus free the council accommodation which they occupy for younger applicants with families. As Conservatives, we welcome and support that policy.<br/>
But the GLC does not stop there. I understand that it is currently committed to spend no less than &#x00A3;97 million on general housing activities outside its own area, mainly in the Home Counties. The young as well as the elderly are being encouraged to move out of central London, thus accelerating the population decline in our inner areas. If only a fraction of the money spent on this out-of-London development had been used to make a start on the redevelopment of Dockland, we should by now be seeing a beginning of the restoration and rejuvenation of those neglected areas of inner London which stand as a decaying monument to the drift, delay and indecision at County Hall on this matter.<br/>
Our debate on the Instructions has been invested with great relevance and topicality by the speech last night of the Secretary of State for the Environment, in which he warned representatives of Labour-controlled local authorities, including the GLC, about their present levels of expenditure and said that overspending could not be tolerated. I understand that Mr. Tony Banks, Chairman of the GLC's General Purposes Committee, and Mr. Richard Balfe, Chairman of its Housing Development Committee, have today both expressed some doubts about whether further cuts can be made. I hope that the Secretary of State will make it clear to them that he means business.

Our Instructions provide him with a ready-made weapon to do this. They call for a modest but significant reduction in GLC spending.<br/>
In the light of yesterday's ministerial speech, it will be interesting to see whether our Instructions are to be challenged by Labour Members in the Division Lobby. If the Secretary of State meant what he said&#x2014;and he is an inner London Member&#x2014;he should be using all his efforts and influence tonight to persuade his colleagues to support our Instruction on municipalisation. If he fails to do that, and if it is opposed, we can only conclude that, like so many speeches from this Government on public expenditure, the Secretary of State's words are all wind and waffle.<br/>
The test will come later tonight. We shall wait and see what happens. In the meantime, I commend the Instructions to the House in the hope that they will receive widespread support.</p>

<p>It is easy to see how we could fall into the trap of accepting the Instructions put forward by the Opposition. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has made a serious appeal to local authorities to consider the expenditure in which they are involved, to consider the national needs, and to look ahead to the coming year and make decisions about priorities. In effect, that is what the GLC is doing in advancing its recommendations tonight.<br/>
We on the Labour Benches are naturally very concerned about the situation in inner London. We are very concerned about the housing position for many central London families. It is interesting that in talking about the needs of central London the hon. Member for Ravens-bourne (Mr. Hunt) said that both old and young were being encouraged to leave the centre of London, leaving a vacuum which is not to be filled. Properties now standing empty in their hundreds of thousands are to remain empty, because it seems that there are not enough people in the lower income bracket to purchase them.<br/>
If the housing problem in London could be solved through the vacant houses being purchased by those in housing need, if money were available from the building


societies for those young families who are anxious, willing and intending to live in central London because of their family, social and work ties, there would be no need for the GLC to make this kind of provision. Instead, we have the picture of not just council-owned but privately-owned properties not in the rented sector standing empty for many years. It is no wonder that eminent housing experts talk about the British housing failure, which is the failure of all sectors to make the right kind of provision to meet housing needs.<br/>
If we look across the spectrum at those young people with families, desperately saving up in the face of rising costs to obtain their deposits and qualify for mortgages, we see that they are unable to enter the housing market. If they were, there would not be hundreds and hundreds of potential owner-occupied properties with "For Sale" notices outside them.<br/>
In the privately-rented sector there are vast estates, some of which have been the subject of property speculators over the years. From time to time those estates have been occupied by furnished tenants, or have been deliberately kept unoccupied in the hope of a private sale. One often sees such properties standing empty. We also have experience of families, elderly people, and transient workers, all in desperate need of housing and with few people&#x2014;and here I criticise the Government, the local authorities and the private landlords'&#x2014;taking anything near the action required to cope with the situation.<br/>
The Greater London Council has been making a great effort to take into public ownership privately-rented accommodation and also formerly owner-occupied properties that are standing empty. The tragedy is that the authority has not made satisfactory arrangements for those properties to be reoccupied. Therefore, in the past two years people have taken the law into their own hands and have seized control of many of these properties.<br/>
The hon. Member for St. Marylebone (Mr. Baker), in deploying his arguments, had a great deal of reason on his side. Nevertheless, the power rests with the GLC as a strategic housing authority. So long as that is the case, the GLC has not only the power but the duty to

look after London's strategic housing needs.<br/>
I believe that we shall fail in our duty if we do not insist on the council taking a greater initiative in trying to do something to deal with the scandalous housing position. It will be of no avail if we refuse to proceed with the GLC's request for funds tonight on the pretext that we shall hand the powers to the London boroughs and leave them to deal with the problem. However, in the long term that course may have to be considered.</p>

<p>I am sure that my hon. Friend is aware of the long discussions that have taken place between the Greater London Council and the London Boroughs Association in working out a joint strategic housing plan, as a result of which the GLC will transfer 180,000 houses back to the London boroughs. Is not that the best way to share these problems?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-06-14a.122.1" hansard_membership_id="9305" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30516" speakername="Mrs. Miller" colnum="122" time="">
<p>We are still moving at a snail's pace in these matters&#x2014;indeed, that was the case that when I left the London Boroughs Association some years ago. Nevertheless, the GLC, because of its strategic powers, must taken on the responsibility for provision in the first instance, and then the London boroughs can begin to take up the slack as a management task. In the meantime, faced as we are with vacant properties in various housing areas, we must apply pressure to make sure that these powers are properly used.<br/>
The problem for those who want to own houses is that building societies are not taking a hand to make sure that people at the lower end of the housing market have the opportunity to become owner-occupiers. Although I admit that there have been some moves on that score, I believe that far too little has been done to date to make such properties the homes they should be for younger families.<br/>
It is all very well to talk about the problems of ILEA and to say that the authority is costing London residents more for a deteriorating service. The fact is that the imbalance of London's population makes it more expensive to cater for everybody because so many families left in central London are in a sense social casualties who are more expensive in terms of care. That argument applies to


the elderly who are left behind and who make great social service demands, and it also applies to immigrant groups who are newly arrived in this country and who are more costly to maintain in central London.<br/>
All these factors mean that in central London living expenses are far greater than they should be. This creates a total picture in which the GLC, ILEA and all the local authorities in central London are carrying a heavier burden of cost in proportion to the numbers of population. As people look back over the post-war years at the London scene, following reorganisation of London government, they remember the disruption of communities in the London area. Therefore, we must consider not only the question of the profligacy of present local authorities or of the authorities as they existed following the introduction of the Housing Act 1974, which was aimed at preventing evictions of families from furnished properties; we must also consider uprooted communities who have been taken away from their settled jobs and settled ways of life. It would be most unfortunate if the GLC's request in trying to cope with the problems that face the area today were to be rejected by the House. We must not deprive the GLC of the opportunity to do something practical to assist in the present situation.<br/>
There is one other matter that is relevant to the situation in London today. I refer to the subject of rents for council properties and the approach that might be taken following the proposals to review housing finance in the future. In recent weeks there has been much comment about the higher rents proposed for council properties. I should like to take this opportunity to mention a site that has received a great deal of adverse publicity.<br/>
I refer to the Branch Hill Estate in the borough of Camden. That estate has provided a bonanza for the media in seeking to show how local authorities waste public expenditure. As chairman of a committee in the London borough of Camden, I was involved in the acquisition of that site&#x2014;one of the finest sites in London. The Branch Hill Estate, in Hampstead, consists of 10 acres of land and was purchased in 1965 for a sum of &#x00A3;464,000. For those people who are

acquainted with land values in the London area, I do not need to say that that was a modest figure indeed. That site was purchased from the family who had resided there for many years. It is a very beautiful estate on the outskirts of Hampstead and is almost a wing of Hampstead Heath. The family had lived in a beautiful house on that site for many years, surrounded by those 10 acres of land.<br/>
The property was purchased with the object of providing an old people's home, a residential school and local authority housing. I well remember one of the local Members, my hon. Friend the Member for St. Pancras, North (Mr. Stallard), who is present tonight&#x2014;arguing for the purchase of this property so that the people of the densely-packed areas of Kentish Town could be allowed to breathe the clean air of Hampstead and enjoy the amenities of that beautiful area.<br/>
Unfortunately, during the period from 1965 to 1968, while the plans for development were being undertaken, it was discovered that there were many covenants on the use of the land that that these would necessarily delay development. Meantime, the old people's home was provided at a cost of about &#x00A3;35,000. Part of the land was used for the council's nursery. It was decided that there would not need to be a children's home. Eventually, the Conservatives took control of Camden Council. One of their first acts was to try to sell the Branch Hill Estate to private speculators. There was a tremendous campaign in the area to prevent this.<br/>
No suitable purchaser was forthcoming, despite great efforts on the part of the Conservatives. The land stood fallow for another three years, until 1971, when a Labour council was returned. Owing to the problem of the covenants, which had not been resolved by going to the Lands Tribunal in the intervening years, it was not possible to develop more than a small part of the site. At present, a small fraction of the site, about 1&#x00B7;65 acres, is being developed for housing. It is an expensive development. It would be possible to criticise the borough of Camden for the style of housing being developed there, but this is essential until the covenants on the land are cleared.<br/>
I want to draw attention not merely to the historic situation but to what has happened to the cost of the land in the


meantime. I have already told the House that the land&#x2014;10&#x00B7;3 acres in all&#x2014;was purchased in 1965 for &#x00A3;464,000. The cost being charged to the housing account today in respect of the 1&#x00B7;65 acres is &#x00A3;1,025,000. That is an indication of the way to which our housing finance is being handled, so that we are able to get headlines in every newspaper and reports in the media about the profligacy of a council which bought five times as much land for approximately half as much money&#x2014;and that to include a number of other facilities.<br/>
That position contrasts strangely with another current situation. My right hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Construction has been pressed about cut-price housing, namely, the sale of council houses to tenants. He has said that he accepts that the house cost should be reduced by about 17 per cent. as long as it does not go below the historic cost of provision. Perhaps the Under-Secretary, in replying, will be able to reconcile these opposing points of view. If council houses are sold to tenants they may be sold at historic cost. When a council is charging rent to its tenants it has to do so on the basis of current market value. May I know how this equation is worked out? Can we reconsider the justice of the way in which we organise our housing finance?</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Ilford, North (Mrs. Miller) began her speech by saying that she was concerned about the housing shortage. I do not doubt the genuineness of her concern. The problem is that Labour Members will never face up to the long-term policies needed to relieve the housing shortage. Time and again I have heard them&#x2014;this includes several Labour Members who are present tonight, such as the hon. Members for Ealing, North (Mr. Molloy) and Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Mr. Brown)&#x2014;say that nothing must be done to remove any more industry from the London area but, on the contrary, industry must, as far as possible, be retained and even augmented<br/>
The more we do to retain and augment industry, and hence employment in London, the more the area will act as a magnet to those living outside it. It is inevitable, as night follows day, that if

we promote employment in Greater London we shall never solve the terrible housing shortage from which London has suffered since the Second World War. The former London County Council recognised this and systematically worked to reduce the amount of industry and employment in London, largely with a reduction of the housing shortage in mind. Yet Labour Members now argue against this and advocate policies that will perpetuate the housing shortage.<br/>
I do not doubt the concern of Labour Members on social matters, but they will not face up, logically and honestly, to making a choice between two contrary policies.</p>

<p>Will the hon. Gentleman bear in mind that what he is saying is only partially true? In my constituency many artisans have lost their jobs because industry has moved out of the area. We are asking not that people should be brought in but that there should be jobs for those who are there.</p>

<p>If industry comes into the area, or remains in it, some of the jobs will be offered to people who are living there already, but others will be offered to those who are attracted from outside, who come to London speculatively and take up accommodation in the hope of finding work. It is not possible at the same time to seek to relieve the housing shortage and to encourage industry to remain in London for the sake of employment.<br/>
I support the Instruction. I have no wish to be wholly critical of the GLC. Much of what it has done is useful and valuable. I have especially in mind its work on flood prevention, for which many of my constituents are most grateful&#x2014;both the local flood prevention works and the Thames Barrier, which is due to be completed in 1979 and which will at long last remove the growing danger to Londoners of flooding, with consequent risk to life because of the increasing likelihood of larger North Sea surges.<br/>
I wish to criticise the GLC on three scores. The first concerns its handling of the traffic problems on the A316, the Great Chertsey Road, following completion of the M3 Motorway into London.


The GLC has improved three roundabouts along the A316, one at Hospital Bridge Road in my constituency and two at Richmond, in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond, Surrey (Sir A. Royle). However, the GLC has left three other roundabouts unimproved. The result is that there are the most appalling traffic jams. Every day, thousands of my constituents and tens of thousands of other people who live elsewhere are held up for between 20 and 25 minutes by these jams at St. Margaret's roundabout, because the GLC has failed to improve the traffic-carrying capacity of that roundabout to match the newly completed M3 and its own short dual carriageway link from the end of the motorway at Sunbury Cross to the Hope and Anchor roundabout at Hanworth.<br/>
The failure to complete work on these roundabouts, coinciding with completion of the motorway, has resulted in a great deal of traffic spilling over into residential side roads in Whitton and Twickenham. For example, the inadequate capacity of the thresholds of the Whitton Road and London Road roundabouts has resulted in traffic spilling over into Redway Drive, in Whitton, and many other roads in that area. It is appalling that the GLC, by lack of forethought, has not prevented these problems from arising.<br/>
There is inordinate delay in dealing with planning applications and traffic management schemes at County Hall. They never take less than from six to eight months to be considered, and they usually take a year or 15 months. There is a vast bureaucratic machine, which fails to handle these matters with efficiency. The result is that London boroughs and the general public are kept waiting when they put these matters to County Hall.<br/>
In my constituency we have been waiting for three years for traffic lights to be installed at the junction of Hampton Hill High Street and the Uxbridge Road, Hampton Hill. We have been waiting as long for small roadworks costing &#x00A3;40,000 to take place at a dangerous bend on the Uxbridge Road. The GLC seems able to find between &#x00A3;7 million and &#x00A3;10 million for the link between the M3 and the

A316, yet unable to find &#x00A3;40,000 to iron out a dangerous bend. These small roadworks have been put off year after year, but I hope that the work will commence next year. I hope that it is not to be further delayed because of cuts in public expenditure.<br/>
At the same time, there is thoroughly wasteful expenditure. I have in mind the magistrates' court at Richmond, where some of my constituents are tried for offences that they are alleged to have committed. There may be many people in such a position, but there are nothing like enough to justify the colossal white elephant that was constructed and opened with great ceremony a few months ago by the Lord Chancellor.<br/>
It is unbelievable that the GLC, which is responsible for magistrates' courts and which employs so many skilled architects&#x2014;indeed, it is famous for its architects' department&#x2014;should fail to allow for the fact that the new magistrates' court is directly underneath the flight path of the aircraft landing at London Airport. The GLC installed glass roofs without double glazing. It did so in an area in which there are about 600 aircraft movements per day. At times the aircraft noise is so great and so frequent that I am told by justices of the peace, criminals and barristers that the court works at only 50 per cent. efficiency. The building cost more than &#x00A3;1 million. It is a piece of unnecessary and extravagant incompetence. Labour Members need not wonder that I support the Instruction.</p>

<p>I was not quite clear about the point that the hon. Gentleman was making about the magistrates' court. Is he suggesting that the court should be removed, or is he asking for the removal of Heathrow Airport? Which of those things does he think is the fault of the GLC?</p>

<p>The magistrates' court is the direct responsibility of the GLC. It built the court under the approach route to London Airport, used by the planes that overfly the constituency of the hon. Gentleman and the right hon. Member for Fulham (Mr. Stewart). The court was built without adequate soundproofing, at a cost of about &#x00A3;1 million.<br/>
The siting of London Airport at Heathrow was due to the lack of forethought


of a Labour Government about 25 years ago. In the late 1940s a Labour Government decided to site one of the greatest airports in the world close to the built-up area of London. The alignment of the runways meant that planes had to fly over built-up areas. People have been suffering from that because of the lack of forethought shown in the late 1940s. I should like to see the Maplin scheme reinstated, with all the noisiest planes made to go through Maplin and only the quiet planes permitted to go through Heathrow.</p>

<p>It will not come as any surprise to my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Mr. Jessel) when I say that I disagree with him about airport policy. It may come as a bit more of a surprise to him and to the hon. Members for Ealing, North (Mr. Molloy) and Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Mr. Brown) when I say that I disagree with my hon. Friend's criticism of those hon. Members' views about jobs in London.<br/>
I take the same view as those two hon. Members. I believe that there is a serious job problem in London. There is the especially serious problem of manufacturing jobs and non-office jobs. The shortage of that sort of employment is causing growing problems and will cause severe problems before many years have elapsed. The situation is especially serious when there are no jobs of the sort that can be done by the non-academic stream of lads leaving school. There should be jobs for those people in London without their having to uproot themselves and move away to Peterborough or Milton Keynes, for example.<br/>
If I were a youngster leaving school in inner London, or in many other parts of London, I should deeply resent the long-standing policy of successive Governments gradually to force manufacturing industry out of London. If London is to remain a great city, and a decent city in which to live, somewhere along the line we must put a stop to the progress to which I have referred. [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] I am glad that I carry with me Labour Members. I know that I do so, because I know that they see the problem as I do.<br/>
As much of what I say will be about housing, I should declare an interest. I am the Assistant Director of Information of the National Federation of Building Trades Employers. Some of what I have to say may not suit its book. Indeed, some of my comments will militate against the short-term interests of some builders. However, because I work for the federation for part of the time I do not have to stick all the time to what is necessarily good for it. My first concern is for my constituents and my second concern is for London. Indeed, London is my particular concern this evening.</p>

<p>I had to put it in hock. I am a bit hard up this week.<br/>
I am a fortunate Member of Parliament to represent a constituency such as Chingford. There is little substandard housing in the constituency. Although I shall criticise some aspects of the GLC, the largest GLC estate in my constituency, Friday Hill, is generally a very well-liked area. It is popular with its tenants. There are almost no vandalism problems. The houses are well cared for and the estate is a credit to all those who have anything to do with it. The worst housing problem in my constituency involves a large and more modern estate, built by the borough. However, that has nothing to do with this evening's proceedings.<br/>
It is wrong for Labour Members and for some of my hon. Friends to believe that only municipal ownership can provide the rented accommodation that is needed in our great cities.<br/>
The hon. Member for Ilford, North (Mrs. Miller) missed the point when she referred to the problems of unsold homes which would-be purchasers could not afford. She made two errors. First, she forgot that the remedy of municipalising such properties keeps the price above what it would otherwise be and therefore pushes the property out of the reach of more people. Possibly that will hurt some developers, who have been happy to get much better prices by selling to local authorities half-completed estates which they could not sell on the open market. We had such an example in my constituency. A developer paid too much for the land, and he built too expensively.


I should have loved to see him suffer the proper penalty for his misjudgments, but unfortunately the local authority bailed him out; it got him out of trouble, which kept up the price of the houses beyond what it would otherwise have been. This is a marginal but real effect. Therefore, the hon. Lady was slightly wrong in that respect.<br/>
Secondly, the hon. Lady was wrong to assume that those houses had to be bought by the local authority or by the GLC in a municipalisation programme before they could be rented. Sooner or later, we shall be forced once again to concede that there is a case for privately rented housing. If we were to concede that property coming on to the market for the first time&#x2014;new property, which has never been rented&#x2014;could be derestricted, it would be of great assistance to builders, who could carry on building through troughs in demand knowing that their houses would not remain empty.</p>

<p>Of course they will not do it while there is a strong likelihood that, even if they were granted by a Conservative Government the legislation that is needed to promote it, it would be reversed subsequently and they would lose badly.<br/>
If we could get it out of our heads that there must be a polarisation and a total schism between the owner-occupier and the municipal tenant, and could consider the matter more flexibly in terms of different forms of tenure&#x2014;100 per cent. equity-linked mortgages, and so on&#x2014;we would do a great deal more to solve London's housing problems than by indulging in almost mindless municipalisation.<br/>
Tenants in London should be able to decide matters much more freely than they do. I am not talking about tenants who can afford expensive places such as Dolphin Square and the Barbican. I live in the Barbican, and many hon. Members live in Dolphin Square. We can make our decisions about how much we want to spend on housing. We can decide whether we want to spend the maximum and buy the maximum, or spend the minimum and buy the minimum. However, most tenants in London, who are

council tenants, have no choice about what they will buy with their money. The transfer system does not work. Once they are in, they are stuck.<br/>
We know how many people plead with us at our advice bureaux because they cannot get a transfer. They have to account to clerks in offices in great detail about their family problems merely because they want to leave their parents or take a job on the other side of London. The machinery does not work.<br/>
What is more, such tenants cannot say "I am a bit better off. I should like somewhere nicer to live and to spend more of my money on it." If they have accommodation that is costing them more than they want to pay, they have difficulty in moving down market so that they can dispose of more of their income on something else. There is a restriction of choice, because there is no market.<br/>
Hon. Members on the Government Benches may say "You cannot have a market when there is a shortage." But until there is a market, there will be a shortage.</p>

<p>The tenants of the GLC are much more mobile than other residents. Many transfers take place every day. It is easier for people to move from building to building if they are housed by the GLC than it is for them to go through the procedure of selling their houses and buying others.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman must deal with a different GLC from the one with which I deal, or his tenants must get different treatment from the treatment that mine receive. Some of his hon. Friends are nodding in agreement with me. We should try to deal in realities and not in imaginings.<br/>
The famous case of the &#x00A3;90,000 flats in Camden has been played up as being something quite extraordinary. It is quite extraordinary. None the less, it establishes that municipal housing is not cheap housing. It will not be economical housing. The subsidy on those flats will be huge, whoever owns them and whoever lives in them.<br/>
I agree that if we are to keep people in central London doing the more humble and lower-paid jobs that we need done in central London we shall have to subsidise their housing under any form of


tenure conceivable in a mixed economy. However, I feel that paying that subsidy through the sort of organisations that the GLC is, is the least efficient way that we could devise of doing the job. I am sure that there are much more efficient ways of doing it and that they would be no less humane than the GLC. However hard the GLC tries to be humane, it is just too big.<br/>
A few weeks ago I had a letter from a junior official in the GLC's housing management department which came after some correspondence that I had had, sticking up for what I thought was a reasonable demand by a GLC tenant in my constituency for some work to be done in his house. Eventually, I received a very offhand letter from a junior official who told me that I had my priorities wrong and that the work was at much too low a priority to be carried out for some time. Of course, he put it slightly more gently than that, but not sufficiently so for me. His boss got a sharp letter back from me with the suggestion that he might have taken the trouble to write to a Member of Parliament in the way that Ministers, however busy they are and however much they think Members are mucking them about, still write back polite letters and sign them themselves&#x2014;</p>

<p>I am feeling benevolent tonight, so I shall not argue with the hon. Gentleman.<br/>
Interestingly enough, it eventually emerged that at the time the junior official was writing to me saying that my priorities were wrong and that the work was at much too low a priority to be done, it had already been carried out, a few days before. That sort of inefficiency, which grows up in these large, highly bureaucratic organizations&#x2014;certainly they are not customer-oriented or marketoriented&#x2014;is a prime cause of the escalation of Government expenditure in recent years.<br/>
We would do well, on those grounds alone, to fire a warning shot across the bows of the GLC about municipalisation

by clipping its wings to the tune of the couple of million pounds that we are discussing on this Instruction&#x2014;to remind it to think, to remind it that this House and those hon. Members who represent Londoners will not indefinitely tolerate inefficiency and bureaucracy merely because it exists in the GLC.<br/>
If that was not a good enough reason for doing this, we had an even more pressing reason put to us in the newspapers yesterday. I say that because we were not invited to that less-than-cosy occasion when the Secretary of State saw fit to call together the leaders of Labour authorities to tell them not merely that the party was over but that he would not pick up the tab for any more drinks.<br/>
I think that we would be less than loyal and less than fair to a Secretary of State who is trying as hard as he can to hold back local government expenditure in the general public interest if we did not back this device of my hon. Friends and myself to clip that couple of million pounds off the housing vote, and clip the contingency allowance by half, to remind the GLC of its responsibility towards its citizens and the country at large.</p>

<p>If the House were to accept the recommendations of the two Instructions we would be placing the GLC in a very difficult situation. I am bound to say, as is always the case with these debates, that I agree with very much of what hon. Gentlemen on the Opposite side have said on certain aspects of GLC administration. I certainly agree with the hon. Member for Chingford (Mr. Tebbit) about the petty officials at all levels, who are getting more and more bumptious and insolent in the manner in which they deal with some of our correspondence. At times it is almost impossible to get any official in the higher or middle ranks in the London boroughs or the GLC, yet it takes only a few minutes to get hold of the Home Secretary or any other Cabinet Minister. This is becoming increasingly irritating, and on these points I can agree with all that has been said.<br/>
However, all these points have not really made a case for supporting these


Instructions. If there is a demonstration, beyond peradventure, of the real quality of the Conservative case, it has been made by the hon. Member for Twickenham (Mr. Jessel). He scraped the bottom of the barrel by pleading for more justice for the criminal classes in his constituency. He said that they could not hear the charges read against them because of aircraft noise. I know that the hon. Member has waged a strong campaign against aircraft noise, and it seems that he has to involve everybody in that. This is proof that the Opposition case is scraping the barrel. At the same time the hon. Member argued that we could not ask for a reduction in unemployment because that would mean that London would be a magnet again, more people would come here, and then the housing situation would be even more serious than it is now.</p>

<p>The hon. Member's submission is this: do I want a high degree of unemployment or do I want a high degree of housing problems? This is an absurd situation to put to a Socialist. It is a dilemma for a Tory, but quite absurd for me. As a Socialist I do not want either. I am trying to find ways and means of achieving a situation in which everyone in London has a decent job and a decent home. What is particularly pernicious about that? If the hon. Member argues that at all times there must be a degree of unemployment and homelessness he must then nominate who shall be without a home and who shall be without a job. That is the problem in Twickenham. In my constituency of Ealing, North the answer is simple. No one shall be without a job or without a home, so I do not have the hon. Member's problem.<br/>
It would by myopic to support both Instructions. I am committed to the creation of a Greater London plan. I believe that we could have achieved much more if we had had the old LCC and the destroyed for party political motives by the Conservatives. Those boroughs were 28 metropolitan boroughs which were

small. I do not think that anyone in Fulham lived more than a twopenny bus ride, as it was then, from the old town hall. Now in the London borough of Ealing the people who live in Northolt have immense problems getting to the town hall, whereas those who live in Southall or Acton do not have such difficulties. When there were three town halls it was much easier for everyone. We can, therefore, blame the remoteness of local government on the Conservatives who tore up the old system.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend and I gave evidence at a public inquiry in 1962 in Lambeth Town Hall. Does he recall that we made then the very point that he is making now, but that we were overridden by the Conservative Government?</p>

<p>Not merely was the evidence overridden, but arguments were produced to try to prove how wrong we were. Now, however, every time one of these GLC Bills is introduced the Conservatives put forward the same argument, but for a different reason. It would be only politically honest for the House tonight to pass an emergency motion condemning the Conservatives for their handling of this whole issue because the monster they created still remains.<br/>
The present administrators and the present leadership and, to a degree, the Conservative administration, have done their best to humanise our local government, but they face a tough job. We are concerned not merely with industry having been enticed under both Governments to leave Greater London. It is about time Governments realized&#x2014;I hope the Labour Government will&#x2014;that Greater London, though not officially a region, happens to be the home of one-fifth of the population of this country. Unemployment is a serious problem and it is growing. One can suffer anguish, pain and frustration by being a Greater Londoner just as much as one can in Liverpool, South Wales or Scotland. It is about time this was appreciated. I believe that Back Benchers on both sides of the House now realise this more than hon. Members who sit on the Front Benches.</p>

<p>The answer to the last part of the question is "Yes". I certainly agree. As to the first part of the hon. Gentleman's remarks, I wish he remained on the Front Bench. I would go further and hope that all successive Conservative Shadow Ministers will always remain on the Opposition Front Bench.<br/>
My submission is a serious one. It is not merely a question of the growth of unemployment in Greater London. It is not only a question of industry moving out of Greater London as it has been encouraged to do under both Governments in a laudable endeavour to try to relieve the high unemployment which existed in the so-called regions. We must ensure that one does not simply transfer the problem and that, by trying to resolve the scourge of unemployment in one area, we simply create it in another. The danger is much more serious in Greater London. We can see what has happened in many of the Inner London boroughs and Outer London boroughs where industry has moved out.<br/>
Of course, one could argue that we should press for their return or the creation of new industries, but how does one do that when we are now seeing the mushrooming of warehouses on the sites where those factories existed? On sites which at one time employed 500 or 600 people, perhaps even 2,000, we are now seeing the construction of warehouses which employ half a dozen clerks and four or five forklift drivers. That is the problem we have to face when trying to resolve the problem of Greater London.<br/>
It has been inferred, and I agree, that this is bound to have an effect on the education of young Londoners. In my own constituency education, under both Tory and Labour local administrations, had, to a degree, been geared to the skilled artisans required for the industries of the London borough of Ealing. Some of them were very skilled, like glassblowers and people working in the glass container industry. Special courses were run for young people about to leave school, but now they have been disbanded. They are no longer required because there are no factories where glass containers are made both for this country

and for export. This happens all over London.<br/>
Many of us, on both sides of the House, have pleaded with both Administrations to take cognisance of this fact. I think that we should all repeat it till we get an acknowledgment of the situation from the Government. We should not have to wait till we can say "Now you must do something because there is as much unemployment in Greater London as in any other part of Great Britain. That would be an absurd situation.</p>

<p>The GLC could help far more in the provision of small, low-cost sites for small firms out of which, one hopes, larger firms will grow in due course. Does not the hon. Gentleman agree that, as redevelopment goes on on a vast scale across London, it becomes more and more difficult for the small chap to start a small firm?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-06-14a.138.1" hansard_membership_id="9164" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/31479" speakername="Mr. Molloy" colnum="138" time="">
<p>I have a great deal of sympathy with that submission. I believe that we should resort to an idea which I put some time ago and have repeated several times. There should be a Greater London plan, involving representatives of the trade unions, the employers, industrialists and the London boroughs, brought together by the GLC.<br/>
I believe that the GLC should take over sites, as the old London County Council used to do. It could arrange them properly, with sensible planning. One has to be careful where one is putting a factory or a warehouse because one must have consideration for people living nearby. That was, indeed, the policy of the LCC, but it seems to have been forgotten. I believe that the GLC could show the Government an example of Greater London planning and achieve the sort of objective that the hon. Member for Chingford and I want in purchasing small or large sites. The ramifications would be enormous. For example, such a scheme would help refurbish artisan training in the schools in London. But I remind the hon. Gentleman that it cannot be done if the House passes this Instruction, because the money will not be there.<br/>
There have throughout history been calls for reductions in public expenditure, but how often have we Known an increase in expenditure as the only way to relieve


the scourge and misery of unemployment. The only remedy has been to increase rather than to curtail public expenditure. We saw that process succeeding under Franklin D. Roosevelt in the United States, and there have been other examples in Europe. The paradox is that if there had not been mass unemployment in Britain before the war many of the schools, town halls and roads which were constructed to help relieve it would not have been built. What would have happened in 1940 if there had been demands for great reductions in public expenditure? Let us all be wary of what we are told by all these brilliant economists who advise us. I am justified in drawing the conclusion that if all the economists in the world were placed end to end they would never reach a conclusion.</p>

<p>Would my hon. Friend bear in mind that the Government have made some concession to the pressure which he and I and others have put on them, in that, from 1st May, the IDC figure has been increased from 10,000 to 12,500? That is a major step forward.</p>

<p>I agree, but my hon. Friend will also acknowledge that it was not offered: we had to fight for it. That is what hurts me. If we had been one of the great regions we would have been summoned to be told of this wonderful new proposal by the Government. We would not have needed to fight for it. We had to fight to get our case heard, and we then gained some of the welcome concessions mentioned by my hon. Friend.<br/>
I cannot agree that public housing is the terribly wicked thing which it is made out to be. I should like to make one point which I ask hon. Members on both sides of the House to consider. What would be the position in Greater London today if all the London boroughs and the GLC had not got involved in building homes for ordinary people? The revolution would have taken place years ago.<br/>
It is amazing that, when we talk of cuts in public expenditure, people both inside and outside this House will submit that we can cut everything except education, housing, defence, new roads and so on. Everybody has a special feeling for some subject&#x2014;whether it be edu-

cation or housing&#x2014;which in no circumstances should be cut.<br/>
We cannot operate like that. It would not make sense. We must have priorities. The provision of housing by local authorities, and particularly by the GLC, is a major feature in bringing about contentment for ordinary people in Greater London. I repeat, what if the London boroughs and the GLC had never built houses? I think that hon. Gentlemen opposite acknowledge that there may be things wrong with the administration of some aspects of GLC housing, but we have never heard an outright condemnation of the principle of public housing. Without public housing the story of Greater London would be very sad, because literally millions of people would not have homes.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend may recall that public housing came into being only at the turn of the century. George Peabody came from America to build homes for the working class of this country because he was so horrified at the situation under private enterprise. The Suttons, the Guinnesses and the Rowntrees were motivated because Tory Governments of those times refused to accept that there was any necessity to house the people of this country.</p>

<p>The people mentioned by my hon. Friend wanted to do something about it. We have decided to maintain that principle by trying to eradicate private opulence and public squalor. We have moved a great way towards that aim in the past quarter of a century, but the problem has not yet been resolved.<br/>
With the best will in the world, we cannot leave it to private entrepreneurs to build houses. There are many people in the private sector whose firms and industries build schools, roads and public housing. They are not with the Conservative Party in wanting to reduce public expenditure in those areas. Many well-known firms shudder at the thought of a Tory Government in power. Dramatic cuts in public expenditure on education


worries those who print books, make pencils and build schools. Other dramatic cuts would cause worry to people who build houses, from the carpenter and bricklayer up to the director.<br/>
The Conservatives must not think that we all believe that the answer to our ills is to stop doing anything in the public sector. We have to maintain the principle of providing homes. We must not think that because the nation is going through a difficult period everything should stop. We have never adopted that attitude.<br/>
One of the most audacious debates in the House of Commons was in 1943 when we discussed what form education should take when the war was over. That debate resulted in the Education Act 1944. Our enemies thought that we were a bunch of lunatics to be discussing education at such a parlous time. Let us say that we shall continue to build homes as best we can, and that we shall continue to maintain a high standard of education.<br/>
If the GLC is faced with more difficulties in the future it will have to have the right to spend more money. I understand the problem which the GLC faces. It has to make precepts on local authorities, and they in turn have to impose a rate burden on the ratepayers. That is the system. I think we all agree that there is an urgent need to do something about the rating system.<br/>
Because times are difficult, we must not abandon the principle of continuing great public works. Despite its many problems, the GLC has done a remarkable job in Greater London.</p>

<p>Does not my hon. Friend agree that the Government are with the GLC in promoting housing in London and urge the GLC to build houses?

<p>There is a great deal in what my hon. Friend says. Far too often we fall into the trap of criticising the GLC and the London boroughs for the manner in which they operate within

the terms of reference of an Act of Parliament. That is grossly unfair.<br/>
The GLC has shown courage in continuing to build. The day will come when our economic circumstances improve and the country will be back on its feet. The Government have achieved great success, particularly in industrial relations. We surely have enough confidence in the administration of the GLC to say that we appreciate its difficulties, we acknowledge its money problems and we shall have no part in adding to those difficulties by supporting these Instructions.</p>

<p>The House is being asked by these Instructions to reduce the provision that the GLC should be able to make to provide for the housing needs of its citizens. The first reason for such a suggestion advanced from the Opposition Front Bench is that housing needs could be met if only private landlords were not interfered with by Rent Restrictions Acts and by making provision for the security of tenants. It is extraordinary how people can go on believing that year after year in face of all the evidence to the contrary.<br/>
The Rent Act 1974 has been blamed. I think there were some Divisions on the amendments to the 1974 Act, but I do not recollect anybody voting against the Second Reading or Third Reading of the Bill. Opposition Members knew, whatever their theories about rents and private enterprise, that in our position it was essential to provide security of tenure.<br/>
We are told that since that Act was passed there have been fewer advertisements of furnished property in the newspapers. What did so many of those advertisements mean? They meant that tenants had been pushed out of their property. The advertisements did not reflect the amount of accommodation. They reflected the frequency with which tenants came in and were bundled out again.<br/>
Before that, the Rent Act 1957 was heralded with the argument "We shall get rid of rent control, and there will be plenty of housing for all." After that had produced the evils of Rachmanism, the Government who introduced it had slowly to retreat. There seems to be a belief in some quarters that somewhere


or some day there either was or will be a real market in housing, that housing was provided at rents that people could afford and that they had plenty of choice of the kind of house they should have and where they should live. That sort of situation never has existed and there is not the slightest evidence to suggest that it will. The supply of private rented accommodation, as has been pointed out more than once in the House, has steadily declined over the years, whether the trend of legislation has been towards greater or less rent control.<br/>
There is, therefore, no point in suggesting that the GLC does not need these powers and this money because if only all the Rent Restrictions Acts were scrapped the problem would solve itself. That has been tried before and it has failed. It is not only a stupid experiment. It can be a very cruel experiment in view of the effect it has on tenants while the experiment is carried through.<br/>
The second suggestion why we should agree to these Instructions is that even if we have to have houses provided by a public authority it should not be done by the GLC. The hon. Member for Chingford (Mr. Tebbit) said that the GLC is too large and remote. But who created this monster? My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, North (Mr. Molloy) has given the answer. We all know the history of this matter. The old London County Council was an authority of admirable size and it did a very good job for housing. It was destroyed because the Conservative Party was unable to win a majority on it. Now that the Conservatives find it difficult to win a majority on the Greater London Council, they want to destroy that.<br/>
If we could wave a wand and go back to the LCC and the old boroughs, I would rejoice. We all know what a fearful thing any attempt to do that by legislation would be for the officials. We really cannot carve up London government again once every few years to meet the electoral needs of the Tory Party. Therefore we have got to accept the GLC, at any rate for some time.</p>

<p>I do not think that the right hon. Gentleman is being altogether fair. I think he will agree that it is very likely that whichever Government had

been in power we would have found the impetus towards the GLC overwhelming. [HON. MEMBERS: "No."] Hon. Members say "No", but our experience is that it would have been. Our experience is that we ought to reform the GLC at least to make it a strategic planning authority&#x2014;we need a strategic planning authority&#x2014;but to get it out of the business of trying to be a council in the conventional sense.</p>

<p>There is no evidence for supposing that everybody was enamoured of the idea of the GLC. The case was fully argued in the House, and I am certain that if the matter had rested with us we would never have done anything so silly. Clearly, there is an unanswerable case for the existence in London of something larger than the London boroughs. There is a case for the LCC, and there are certain functions that could only be properly performed by an authority larger than the London boroughs.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman made a helpful proposal on how to promote small industrial enterprises in London, but one would need something larger than a borough organisation to do that. The same is true of certain aspects of housing. London is so compact that people frequently want to move from one borough to another. There are also the special problems of a capital. Many students come here from abroad. The country is proud that people come here to study, and in the long run it is of great advantage to have people all over the world who obtained their further education here.<br/>
Several other problems, including housing, require something larger than a borough to solve them. The Opposition suggest that the problem could be solved by agreement between the boroughs through the London Boroughs Association. Having all the boroughs sitting together in conclave trying to sort out the need for transfers and the possibilities of each borough would be more difficult than going to the London authority whether it he the size of the old LCC or the present GLC.<br/>
The issue of the debate revolves round the present housing powers.</p>

<p>I am in sympathy with the remarks of my right hon. Friend the Member for Fulham (Mr. Stewart).


The London Boroughs Association arranged for a London housing office to enable the 32 boroughs to come together. The problem was that boroughs such as Bromley, among others, remained intransigent about taking their share of the burden. As a result, the GLC cannot build in that area. Bromley is operating on a silly, low-density concept of building. Even the GLC is not big enough to build in the area unless the Government allow it to do so.</p>

<p>I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Mr. Brown) did not think I was speaking contemptuously of the London Boroughs Association. It is a valuable organisation, but it is only a conference, not an authority in the full sense of the word. Authority is needed. There is no dodging that.<br/>
It is a fallacy to say that the problem will be solved by allowing private enterprise to charge what rents it likes, and it does not lie in the mouths of those who created the GLC to say that the GLC is not the body to solve the problem.<br/>
I now turn to the problem of population and industry in London. I was among those who urged that action should be taken to ensure that the population of Greater London was reduced and that industry be sent elsewhere&#x2014;or that the continued multiplication of industry and more commercial jobs should be stopped. I am sure that that was right.<br/>
Before the war, the area which now comprises my constituency had twice as many people living in it as it has now. One wonders how those people managed, but one realises that people's standards were then much lower and that they simply put up with conditions. It was understood that when one got married one must live with one's in-laws, perhaps indefinitely.<br/>
It was essential, if London's housing and traffic problems were to be brought anywhere near to being under control, that the total population of the area should be reduced. If everything had gone smoothly, as it never does in this world, the number of jobs available in London and the population seeking them would have declined evenly over the years. But it would defy the wit of any planner to get that to happen. The

decline in jobs, particularly industrial jobs, has been running faster than the movement of population, and we have the general difficulty about employment that is affecting the country as a whole.<br/>
The remedy is not to take action to try to sweep more and more people back into London. I should welcome anything, whether on the lines suggested by the hon. Member for Chingford or anything else, that would secure more industrial employment in London. However, where are the people doing the less-well-paid jobs to live? The policy of the Conservatives in my constituency is simple. Their attitude is "If we can help it, they will not live round here". That was the object of the agitation over the St. Paul's School site mentioned by the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Ross).</p>

<p>I have written the right hon. Gentleman a note, because I had not intended to raise that matter until a quarter of an hour before the debate started. I apologise to him because I was probably discourteous. It is not just people living in the area who are concerned. About 200 teachers have petitioned the Secretary of State against the ILEA development at Hammersmith. They are not against housing but are against a development they do not believe in.</p>

<p>I have received numerous petitions, not only from teachers but from other people interested in education of all kinds, including adult and adolescent, who note the need for that college and the desperately inadequate premises in which it is now working.<br/>
But that is by the way. I was emphasising that all too often it is the policy of London Conservatives to try to push people doing the less-well-paid jobs out of what the estate agents will call the nice areas. The only way to prevent that kind of development, with all the social evils that it involves, is for there to be an effective element of public housing in London. That is what we are discussing. That is why the House should resist these Instructions.</p>

<p>I must first apologise for not having been here at the beginning of the debate. I felt


it my duty to support an old parliamentary colleague, the right hon. Member for Huyton (Sir H. Wilson), who was being installed in a new position in a scene of brilliant pageantry and national grandeur. I felt that it was a parliamentary gesture to do that. Except for a few peers, I did not see many Labour Members standing shoulder to shoulder with their old leader on this occasion of pomp and ceremony, which perhaps they felt might be embarrassing for them, in view of the egalitarian stand that he has always taken.<br/>
However, occasionally it is appropriate to make a speech untrammelled by having listened to arguments from either Front Bench. It gives a certain freshness, naivety and insouciance to one's remarks, and saves the embarrassment of using an argument of which neither Front Bench has heard.</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Ravensbourne (Mr. Hunt) for making the situation clear. Fortunately, I shall be able to place the final straw in the balance, which will persuade the Government spokesman to accept the sensible view that I am sure was put forward by my hon. Friend.<br/>
I wish to put forward four important but not particularly intellectual reasons for supporting the Instruction in respect of Part I of the schedule. First, I oppose the spending of this large sum of money, because surely the under-occupation of much of the GLC-owned municipal housing could be solved immediately by a shuffling round of the occupants. I do not believe enough effort has been made by the GLC to persuade those who occupy three or four bedroom flats to move to smaller accommodation and to allow those who live in overcrowded conditions to move into the larger units.<br/>
Secondly, I believe that the time has come for many of the GLC houses to be sold off. In this way the funds in the GLC exchequer can be increased. It is also a way of giving those who have lived in council accommodation for a

long time the opportunity to own their own houses and therefore to make this vast new expenditure requirement unnecessary.<br/>
My third reason for opposing the provision in the Bill is that I believe, as do many others, that the building that has been carried out by the GLC, and by its predecessor, the LCC has been on the wrong lines. For the past 25 years I have been a member of the Bethnal Green East London Housing Association. We have insisted on trying to retain single-storey dwelling houses, even though we have modernised and improved them. I do not think that we have pulled down any single-storey dwelling when it has been necessary to build flats, and only in one or two cases have those new units of accommodation been more than two storeys high. I believe that the London tower block has been a social disaster.</p>

<p>I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will agree that tower blocks have been built in places other than London and that they have not been very acceptable in those other areas, either.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Lady. I am, however, desperately trying to keep within the rules of order. I do not want to stray and receive a rebuke. The serious thing is that the experts&#x2014;the architects&#x2014;have perpetrated these monstrosities all over. Even now, one sees in parts of Hackney some of the old squares that have been partly demolished. This is tragic when one thinks of what lovely homes could have existed there.<br/>
I have received an amazing amount of ecumenical support for what I have said. I wonder whether my last point will be similarly received. The extra money that we are discussing should not be spent on housing until the Government accept the view that for that present, and for the next three to five years, no further immigration for settlement from any source should be allowed. Thus, we would be reducing the demand for homes&#x2014;and if the demand is reduced the amount of money set out here will not be required. The right hon. Member for Bermondsey (Mr. Mellish), now that he has hung his whip in the hall and put on the poacher's uniform again, was very wise, and was speaking for many people all over Lon-London, when he said recently "Enough


is enough." Let us accept the Instruction and by doing so demonstrate that we believe that enough is enough.</p>

<p>We have had a wide-ranging debate on the two Instructions tabled by my colleagues and I. What a difficulty we London Members find ourselves in when we have to use pretexts such as this to debate our capital city. I hope that the Under-Secretary will convey that remark to his right hon. and hon. Friends. More time for debating the affairs of London would be most acceptable to all those present this evening. There are two Instructions, the second of which has received very short shrift from the House. It was referred to by practically no one. I can only deduce that there is general acceptance for the proposition put forward in it, although I agree that the hon. Member for Ealing, North (Mr. Molloy) said that its acceptance would create a difficult situation.<br/>
We are suggesting in that Instruction that the contingency reserves should be reduced from &#x00A3;600 million to &#x00A3;300 million, for the good reason that never in the past, to the best of my knowledge, has more than &#x00A3;15&#x00BD; million been spent out of the contingency reserve. We would not have thought that this would create great hardship. The matter was not dwelt on by anyone who spoke, although the Under-Secretary may wish to give us his views upon it.<br/>
Most of the discussion&#x2014;when it related to the Instructions&#x2014;dealt with the first Instruction, which concerns municipalisation, which Labour Members know we do not very much like. It was suggested by the right hon. Member for Fulham (Mr. Stewart) that we had more or less advocated an end to public housing. We have done no such thing. We are advocating striking a balance. We believe that the GLC has gone much too far in one direction. We believe that the GLC should be a strategic planning authority. That is why I was extremely interested in an interjection by the hon. Member for Woolwich, East (Mr. Cartwright). I believe he said that in housing matters the GLC should be strategic and not management. I am pleased to see that the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mrs. Jeger) and some of

her hon. Friends nod in agreement. We believe that the original intention that management should be undertaken by the boroughs is devoutly to be wished.</p>

<p>No doubt if the hon. Gentleman catches your eye, Mr. Deputy Speaker, he will have a chance to elaborate.<br/>
It is with some surprise that we must question whether it is the intention of the members and officers of the GLC that the council should wither away in housing management terms. That is especially so when I hear from my hon. Friend the Member for Ravensbourne (Mr. Hunt) that it has acquired about 6,000 new houses in recent years and is proposing to acquire more should the Money Bill go through unamended.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Fulham spoke of the GLC as a monster. His reason for doing nothing about the monster seemed to be that it was created by Conservatives. It has always seemed to me that one of the least acceptable arguments is to say that something was done by someone else and that therefore one need not do anything about it.</p>

<p>If the Minister is suggesting that the GLC is not a strategic planning authority, perhaps at some other time he will tell us what he believes it to be.<br/>
I continue with the problem of municipalisation relating to the second Instruction. Is the House aware of the level of home ownership in London a couple of years ago? These are the latest figures in my possession. London came ninth in a list of 11 regions. Only 46 per cent. of homes in London were privately owned. The London figure headed only Scotland and the Northern Region. Of the areas surrounding London, there was 61 per cent. home ownership in the South-West and 60 per cent. in the South-East. That gives some force to our disinclination to see increasing municipalisation in the capital. We should very much prefer to see an increase in home ownership.<br/>
I now turn to some of the remarks made by my hon. Friends the Members for Chingford (Mr. Tebbit) and Ravens-bourne. My hon. Friends discussed the inefficiency and the bureaucracy of the Greater London Council. I have always found its officers courteous and helpful, but it cannot be claimed that it is always an outstandingly good landlord. My hon. Friend the Member for Ravens-bourne mentioned the situation at the Cardigan Estate, Enfield and I refer to the situation at Mulberry Close, Chelsea, SW3, which was acquired by the GLC in 1975. A covenant exists between the landlords, the freeholders and the GLC. Many of those living in Mulberry Close have a leasehold. The covenant entails certain legal obligations, which I am advised the GLC is not proposing to honour, or at least at present is not honouring.<br/>
I understand that the same situation is occurring at the Hereford House Estate, Chelsea. Not long ago the estate was acquired by the GLC. It is difficult to believe that the GLC is ignoring its legal obligations, but such is the information that I have been given.<br/>
The hon. Member for Ilford, North (Mrs. Miller) spoke of the problem of empty properties. The House must agree with what she said. The right hon. Member for Fulham spoke of homelessness. One of the most bitter sights for the homeless must be empty properties.<br/>
I cannot avoid the thought that the continuing large numbers of empty properties owned by the GLC and by local councils, such as Lambeth, must be due to the inability of the housing officers to cope with those large numbers. I propose to read an excerpt from a letter from the GLC&#x2014;I shall not say from which officer&#x2014;in answer to a query that I raised about a GLC property that had been empty for some time. He confirmed that the house had been converted into two flats and was purchased by the GLC in 1975. Various work was carried out and the house had been handed to the GLC for letting late in 1975. He said that in this regard
<q>notification that the property was ready for letting went astray&#x2026;and it was not until the flooding was reported &#x2026; that we realised that the house had not been let".</q>
He went on:
<q>Perhaps I should conclude by saying that this 'losing' of a property is one of our nightmares and something which we spend a good deal of time over to try and prevent".</q>
When the GLC discovered that it had the house, it was repaired. In the flood, water had poured into the street and neighbours had said "Who owns this house?" I wonder how many other houses have been "lost" by the GLC. That is a sobering thought, which may explain a few of the empty properties in London.</p>

<p>I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's point about the lack of local authority care in these matters, but it is more than paralleled in the vast numbers of privately rented properties that stand empty for years, with nobody being aware of the floods going on in them and nobody doing anything about them. What the hon. Gentleman says about the letter from the GLC official is indicative of the nightmarish situation which the officials foresee. They care enough to be concerned that they should not "lose" properties when dealing with such vast numbers.</p>

<p>The hon. Lady is right. I am not saying that the officers do not


care; of course they care. It is a nightmarish situation. The hon. Lady is supporting my point. The GLC owns so many properties that the problem has become a nightmare for it. Is it for the House to persuade the GLC to own more properties?<br/>
I wish to say a few words about the cost of municipalisation. Mr. Richard Balfe said, after the famous meeting yesterday, to which the Conservative leaders were not invited&#x2014;perhaps, unlike their Labour colleagues, they are not overspending&#x2014;that the GLC was overspending by only 1 one per cent. He went on to mention an over-spending of &#x00A3;15 million.<br/>
The net average GLC rent is &#x00A3;5&#x00B7;50 a week. If this had been tied to the London earnings index since 1973, it would now be &#x00A3;7&#x00B7;30&#x2014;an increase of 30 per cent., more or less equivalent to a penny rate. If GLC rents had increased according to the earnings index, we could perhaps be charging the ratepayer a penny less. This is a sobering thought if we are proposing to increase rather than reduce its stock of houses. I shall not go into the argument about the comparative prosperity of the GLC tenant and the comparative prosperity of the tenant in privately rented accommodation, but most hon. Members will acknowledge that there is no longer much difference between them. It is not impossible that the family of the private tenant has a smaller income than that of the GLC tenant.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Ravensbourne quoted the remark of Mr. Tony Banks, the Chairman of the GLC General Purposes Committee, that the council had cut its spending to the bone. He went on:
<q>We are prepared to look again, but the fact is that we are down to the bone, and when you take away the bone, everything else collapses.</q>
After this debate, the word "nerve" might be more in keeping when it is suggested that the GLC is down to the bone.<br/>
We have before us two Instructions, the first of which reduces contingency reserves by &#x00A3;30 million&#x2014;</p>

<p>As the hon. Member for Streatham (Mr. Shelton) said, this debate has gone somewhat wide of the Instructions in some of the issues which have been raised. I make no complaint, because they are genuine London issues which should be debated in this House. However, it was unfortunate that immigration should have been dragged in right at the end of the debate.<br/>
I turn first to the contingency provision. The Instruction was moved very beguilingly by the hon. Member for Ravensbourne (Mr Hunt), although it is a somewhat novel Conservative financial concept not to make sensible provision for the unexpected. It seems to be suggested that this is an unusually large provision for contingencies. However, I notice that the figure proposed in the Bill is the same as that proposed in last year's Bill. It compares with a figure of &#x00A3;52 million in 1974&#x2013;75. If we go back to much less inflationary days, in 1967&#x2013;68 it was &#x00A3;22 million. In proportion, &#x00A3;64 million in this Bill is nothing out of the way.</p>

<p>Do not the figures which the hon. Gentleman is quoting indicate that the pattern shows that over the years the contingency allocation has been consistently too high? He referred to the year 1974&#x2013;75, in which &#x00A3;52 million


was sought whereas only &#x00A3;14&#x00B7;4 million was spent. Taking the record of those years, does not the hon. Gentleman agree that this year's request is excessive?</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman interrupted me a little too soon. I was about to underline the reasons given by the GLC for this level of provision. However, before doing that it is reasonable to make a point which has not come out in any reference so far to the contingency provision. It is that it it not the case that, if we vote this sum to the GLC, it can spend it happily at any time. It is subject to Treasury approval. Therefore, there is a very substantial safeguard for that provision.<br/>
Perhaps I might refer to the reasons given by the GLC for requiring a contingency provision at this level. It points out that the figures of expenditure in Part I of the Bill are prepared broadly on November 1975 price levels. It goes on to say that subsequently higher expenditure imposed by inflation could have an impact. Even, for example, when inflation operates at the rate of 7 per cent., the sum needed to cover that inflation would form a very substantial part of the contingency provision.<br/>
Secondly, if there are changes in Government policy to stimulate demand, to get the building industry moving, for example, as the upturn in the economy occurs, the only way in which the GLC can take advantage of that is by drawing on the contingency provision. Thirdly, any stimulation of the house purchase scheme would again have to come from the contingency provision, and I am advised that even a 10 per cent. increase would involve, over a 12-month period, an additional &#x00A3;8 million to be drawn from the contingency sums.<br/>
There is also a technical problem about the possible need to treat the sum of &#x00A3;20 million of revenue expenditure for capital purposes. If that were to occur&#x2014;there is a real risk of it&#x2014;and if the Instruction were carried, it would leave the GLC with only &#x00A3;10 million for any other problems which might arise. I do not suggest that it would be quite impossible for the GLC to operate if the Instruction were carried, but the GLC's financial advisers, who are sober people and like all local council treasurers, not

given to wild exaggeration, take the view that it would be very difficult and that there would be a number of worries involved if the contingency provision were halved as the Instruction suggests.<br/>
On the housing question, the hon. Member for Ravensbourne said that municipalisation itself did not add one new home to the housing stock. If one talks about homes in terms of bricks and mortar, clearly it does not add an additional house or flat. On the other hand, municipalisation enables us and gives us the opportunity to use the existing housing stock to better advantage. All of us have in our constituencies tenants in private rented accommodation who say that their present houses or flats are too big for their needs. However, they point out that, unfortunately, there is no way in which they local authority can house them because they are not in housing need in the accepted sense. There are also many other who are in accommodation which is not suitable, but because they are tenants of private landlords and are not in desperate need there is no way in which the local authority can house the</p>

<p>Over-occupation and under-occupation are considerable problems, and the GLC housing authority is the worst in the world in this respect. Therefore, to give it a greater housing stock would merely be to give it more houses for its housing managers to make a mess of.</p>

<p>I was coming to that point later, but as it has been raised now I shall deal with it now. I accept, and all of us on this side accept, that the GLC is not the easiest organisation in the world out of which to extract a transfer. In my view, this is an argument for devolving powers of management to the borough councils rather than the GLC.<br/>
Nevertheless, I do not understand how the ability of tenants to move flexibly and freely from one accommodation to another is improved by maintaining a privately-rented system. Some local authorities, having purchased properties for municipalisation, keep those properties empty for too long. None of us on this side of the House would defend that. Local councils in London understand that problem and are making


strenuous efforts to ensure that they do not keep property standing empty.<br/>
The hon. Member for Chingford (Mr. Tebbit) argued the need for differing forms of ownership. I accept that completely, but I challenge whether differing forms of ownership should include a retreat back to private landlordism. What we want to see is the development of housing co-operatives of all sorts to give tenants a greater stake in their own homes. If we had more experiments in turning over to tenants the responsibility for managing their own properties as housing co-operatives this would give tremendous scope and opportunity for development. I pay tribute to my right hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Construction for what he has done in this respect.</p>

<p>Does my hon. Friend agree that, although municipal and GLC housing has its faults, some of the housing estates stand where some of the vilest slums in history existed before? Although there is a chance for this sort of co-operative to operate on the new estates, one could hardly expect such a co-operative to have been formed in those former days among slum dwellers to take care of the filth in which they lived.</p>

<p>I accept that the problems of urban renewal in many of our cities could not be, and never have been, tackled by private enterprise. The job has always been left to the municipal authorities.<br/>
Nevertheless, many of us are worried about the "them and us" relationship which is developing between some tenants and some housing departments. The cooperative approach is one way of trying to bridge that gap. One aspect singled out for attack by the Conservatives was the acquisition by the GLC of properties</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-06-14a.158.0" colnum="158" time="">
<p>under construction. The &#x00A3;13 million provided under this heading will enable the council to provide some 900 new homes outside the London area, many of them under the scheme allocating seaside and country homes for elderly tenants. There are 5,000 people on the waiting list for this scheme, and they are occupying family houses which could be put to better use. The scheme therefore offers a substantial gain both in housing and in social terms.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-06-14a.158.1" colnum="158" time="">
<p>Some hon. Members have sought to attack what they regard as unlimited GLC spending, but it should be remembered that there are substantial reductions in this Money Bill compared with that of last year. For example, spending on education is down by &#x00A3;3&#x00B7;5 million compared with last year, which hardly bears out the statement by the hon. Member for St. Marylebone (Mr. Baker) that ILEA spending is totally out of control. Spending on roads is down by &#x00A3;9&#x00B7;5 million and on planning schemes it is down by &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;5 million. There are substantial reductions under the various headings for the GLC housing programme. All this underlines the point made by many of my hon. Friends that the GLC is playing its part in holding down local government spending to a reasonable level.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-06-14a.158.2" colnum="158" time="">
<p>Perhaps I may recall just one figure which I quoted on Second Reading of a &#x00A3;53 million saving over the 18-month period under this Bill as compared with the 18 months of the previous Money Bill. That is a substantial contribution by the GLC to holding down spending and attacking inflation. For those reasons, I hope that the House will reject both Instructions.</p>

<p>I am obliged to you, Mr. Speaker.<br/>
The effect of the amendment would be to postpone until 1979 the obligation on London boroughs to provide sites for gipsies. Many of us are surprised to see the clause before us once again. The only change I can detect is that it is now Clause 10 instead of Clause 12, but that is no consolation. During the Second Reading debate the sponsor of the Bill, the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Mr. Brown), said that he found it objectionable that the Department of the Environment had slipped this clause into a Private Bill and that he had little enthusiasm for it.<br/>
During that debate hon. Members on both sides of the House expressed disapproval of Clause 12, as it then was. The hon. Members for Peckham (Mr. Lamborn), Ealing, North (Mr. Molloy), Woolwich, East (Mr. Cartwright) and I all condemned Clause 12 as it then was. We received an undertaking from the

sponsor of the Bill that the matter would be reconsidered in Committee. We are somewhat distressed that, in spite of the reservations expressed by hon. Members on both sides of the House, the clause has returned to us unamended.<br/>
The notes on the Bill, which have been thoughtfully provided by the Greater London Council, state that
<q>Many of the powers proposed in the Bill are being sought at the request of the London Boroughs Association and are designed to benefit the ratepayers of London generally.</q>
Clause 10 certainly does not come under that heading. The London borough of Ealing has made clear that it does not favour Clause 10 because it makes it mandatory on the council to spend a substantial sum of money to provide facilities for gipsies.<br/>
I quote again from the brief in support of the clause:
<q>in the 1968 Act, Parliament placed a duty on the Inner London Boroughs to provide gipsy caravan sites and clearly Parliament must have been satisfied that this was an appropriate duty in all the circumstances.</q>
Since then, the Minister has made clear that he is not satisfied with the working of the 1968 Act. In reply to a Parliamentary Question by the hon. Member for Peckham, he said that he was not satisfied and that he was appointing Mr. John Cripps to review the working of the 1968 Act as far as it related to the obligation to provide gipsy sites. It is totally wrong to prejudge the finding of Mr. John Cripps and in the meantime make it obligatory on London boroughs to provide gipsy sites.<br/>
I quote what the GLC says about the attitude of the London Boroughs Association:
<q>the LBA have reaffirmed their unanimous support for the clause as it stands".</q>
I do not know how the GLC got that impression. I have with me a letter from the Town Clerk of the London borough of Ealing which states:
<q>Having consulted the Leader of the Council. I am certain that this council would be unhappy with the imposition of mandatory powers in respect of caravan sites, and feel that the situation would best be met by legislation giving permissive rather than mandatory powers.</q>
I confirm that that is still the position of the London borough of Ealing. It is most unhappy about the obligation.<br/>
Why should we resist the clause? It is common ground between all of us that there is a crisis in local government spending, and this was reaffirmed yesterday by the Secretary of State. It has been said time and again that local authorities must cut back. If the clause is unamended, however, the London borough of Ealing will have to spend &#x00A3;275,000 on 16 pitches for gipsies and there will be an annual deficit of &#x00A3;34,000, which works out at over &#x00A3;2,000 per pitch. It is absolute madness for the Government to compel London boroughs to make provision on this scale when the London boroughs are having to cut back on other services.<br/>
Time and again the Government have said that we must all make sacrifices. It is only reasonable to expect that the gipsies, like everyone else, should have to make sacrifices. If the Minister would care to come to Ealing and explain to my constituents why the Government are insisting on cut-backs in the provision of telephones for the disabled, in school books and in many other essential services while the Minister is insisting that the London borough of Ealing must spend this amount of money on providing for gipsies, he would get a rough reception from his own supporters as well as from Conservatives. People in London simply cannot accept that the Government have their priorities right if they insist on provision for gipsies while cutting back on services for other residents who have a greater call on their obligations.<br/>
I ask the Government to wait until Mr. John Cripps has reported. In a recent Adjournment debate initiated by the hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden (Mr. Douglas-Mann), the Minister said that he did not wish to prejudge Mr. Cripps's findings, yet if the London boroughs are obliged by the Bill to go ahead with this provision it will, in effect, be prejudging the situation. The London boroughs, particularly Ealing, Lambeth and some others, are hoping that the Government will have second thoughts before they bulldoze this provision through. I repeat that I find it objectionable that the Government should use a Private Bill to put right national legislation. The former Under-Secretary of State said on Second Reading that he found it regrettable that this had happened. I hope that the Minister will accept the serious reserva-

tions that many of us have and reconsider the clause.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-06-14a.166.0" hansard_membership_id="11123" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20556" speakername="Mr. William Shelton" colnum="166" time="">
<p>I support my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young). The distressing business of gipsy caravan sites has plagued many hon. Members in inner and perhaps outer London as well. I hope that this will be regarded not as a political matter but as one of concern to all London Members.<br/>
We have all received the helpful notes from the GLC. They contain the rather pathetic phrase:
<q>This clause has understandably given rise to a certain amount of disquiet.</q>
Having read that, I read on hopefully to see whether it was proposed to make any alteration to the clause, but it was not. I, too, must express my surprise at that. On Second Reading there was concern generally among hon. Members because it was felt that the Bill was not the proper place for the introduction of such a provision and that the Government should find their own way to solve their own problems and not look to a Private Bill to do so.<br/>
On Second Reading the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Mr. Brown) said:
<q>The House should have put its own house in order rather than involve the Bill in this way.</q>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman still feels the same, because I agree with him. The then Under-Secretary of State for the Environment made the excellent remark:
<q>With hindsight, I have considerable sympathy with what my hon. Friend said. I do not think that this is the proper way to go about this matter."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report</i>, 3rd March 1976; Vol. 906, c. 1393, 1399.]</q>
It was with some relief and satisfaction that we listened to that debate, because we thought that at least there would be some consultations with us before decisions were made. We were told that there would be consultations. I understand that there have been consultations between the Department of the Environment and the London Boroughs Association, but I was not consulted. I shall be interested to hear whether other hon. Members were consulted.<br/>
Despite the assurances that were given on Second Reading, I was not consulted, which predisposes me to the amendment.


However, my main contention and the main reason why I was among those who tabled the amendment is that the Minister, wittingly or unwittingly, has failed properly to use the powers available to him under the Caravan Sites Act 1968. Clause 6(2)(<i>a</i>) of that Act provides that the Minister may give exemption from caravan sites when
<q>he is satisfied&#x2026;that suitable land within the borough is not available".</q>
Cost must be a criterion of suitability. I defy anyone, especially the Secretary of State, who spoke to his colleagues yesterday, to refute that statement.<br/>
Lambeth has spent &#x00A3;150,000 to provide places for 15 caravans at a cost of &#x00A3;10,000 each. That shows that the land was not suitable. The people of Lambeth are especially bitter about the &#x00A3;150,000 spent and the &#x00A3;20,000 a year in running costs to be taken from rates and taxes to provide caravan sites for people who do not pay rates and who will compete against other people who are pursuing their trades in Lambeth. The caravan site dwellers may pay &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;50 a week in rental towards the &#x00A3;20,000 a year cost of maintaining the site, but I cannot believe that that is a proper way to spend Government money. Meanwhile, Lambeth has pre-empted this debate by moving the gipsies on to the unfinished site which has no water or lavatory facilities.<br/>
We should oppose the Government for two reasons. First, they should do their own job and introduce their own legislation to put right the difficulty that they have encountered. Secondly, it is right and sensible at least to delay the matter until Mr. Cripps has given us his conclusions, which I am told we can expect by August.<br/>
Passing the amendment will give hope to those who have been concerned with what has been going on. When the Government get round to passing legislation, we shall have heard from Mr. Cripps and the situation may have been clarified and made easier.</p>

<p>It may be for the convenience of the House if I speak at this stage, particularly in view of the two speeches to which we have just listened. I want to

correct one or two misunderstandings which some hon. Members may have had and which may possibly give them the wrong impression of the situation.<br/>
One fair point was made and I shall repeat it. It was made by my predecessor in this office who said that possibly there was room for criticism for the provision appearing in the Bill. But that does not mean, as the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) said, that the Government are bulldozing the clause through the House. I want to put it on record that the Government have done no such thing. The suggestion was made, and it was taken up with the agreement of the London Boroughs Association and the Greater London Council, that it would be of benefit to Greater London. But there was certainly no question of the Department of the Environment forcing the clause or anything like it upon the London Boroughs Association or the GLC.</p>

<p>I recognise that there is no question of forcing the GLC to put the clause into its Bill. I understand, however, that there was a request to the GLC from the Department to put it in. Why did not the Government put it in the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, where it belongs?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-06-14a.168.2" hansard_membership_id="944" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30575" speakername="Mr. Barnett" colnum="168" time="">
<p>That Bill was concerned entirely with generalising legislation that had appeared in local Acts made by local authorities. I understand that every provision in that measure is precedented. I shall check on the answer, but probably the provision would not have fallen naturally into that Bill, which was carried through the House with the Opposition's co-operation because it was precedented in local Acts.<br/>
My hon. Friend is correct to suggest that the Department welcomed the fact that the London Boroughs Association and the GLC were glad to see this clause in this Bill. There was every argument for its being there, because it applied totally to the Greater London area. As I understand it, the clause is, in effect, designed to rectify an error which appeared in Schedule 30 to the Local Government Act 1972. When Conservative Members complain about the


Government's putting right something that the Government got wrong, I reply that it is something that not this Government but the last Government got wrong. Here is yet another anomaly in legislation passed by them. It had to be put right.<br/>
The Government very much welcome the fact that the error is proposed to be corrected in this clause, because the error appears to have the effect of depriving the London borough councils of their powers and duties in relation to caravan sites under Part I of the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act 1960. I am certain that it was not Parliament's intention to do that.<br/>
Although I want to say something about gipsies, I should make it clear that the clause has little or nothing to do with them. Despite all that was said on Second Reading, in our view the error affects all caravan sites with the exception of gipsy sites, which are provided for in accordance with the duty imposed by the Caravan Sites Act 1968. This duty was specifically reaffirmed in the main body of the 1972 Act. My firm legal advice is that, where a statute imposed a mandatory duty on an authority, the power follows that duty. I know that at least one London borough has had independent legal advice to that effect. In short, it will make no practical difference to the obligation on London boroughs to provide gipsy sites whether Clause 10 is included or omitted.</p>

<p>Is it a fact that under the Act to which my hon. Friend is now referring&#x2014;and I take his point&#x2014;the Minister had the power of exempting a London borough? Is it also a fact that the Minister of the day&#x2014;I think one of our Ministers&#x2014;exempted the London borough of Westminster, for reasons I do not understand, but refused to exempt the London borough of Southwark? I believe that that was done under the original Act. If so, why?</p>

<p>Again, we are going a little wide. My right hon. Friend is correct to say that some London boroughs are exempt&#x2014;namely, Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea. It is also true to say that my right hon. Friend's borough is not exempt.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-06-14a.170.0" hansard_membership_id="9202" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/18312" speakername="Mr. Mellish" colnum="170" time="">

<p>I cannot answer that question offhand. I am not sure why, and I think that my right hon. Friend will be glad to look into this matter in regard to the London borough of Southwark. There is certainly a case in respect of that borough. Nevertheless, the fact is that in the legislation there was the possibility of exemption.<br/>
A good deal of disquiet has been expressed on the subject of gipsies, and I remind the House that the Cripps Committee is studying this subject in detail. We hope to provide the remedy for which many hon. Members are seeking on the subject of gipsies after that report has been completed. However, I must make it clear that my legal advice is that this clause has no relevance to the question of gipsies.</p>

<p>May I refer the Minister to a document issued by the GLC to hon. Members in which the council says:
<q>The best view&#x2014;a view taken by the Department of the Environment's legal advisers&#x2014;is that the 1972 Act repealing certain provisions has had the completely unintentional effect of depriving London boroughs of their powers under Part I of the 1960 Act."?</q>
If that is the case, there must be some doubt about the duty of London boroughs to act in providing gipsy camp sites. Will the Minister comment on that statement?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-06-14a.170.3" hansard_membership_id="944" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30575" speakername="Mr. Barnett" colnum="170" time="">
<p>I was about to come to that point&#x2014;namely, that Clause 10 will not affect the duty of London boroughs to provide gipsy sites. Without the clause, however, the boroughs are at risk in relation to activities on other caravan sites. That is the situation as we understand it in the Department of the Environment. It is not as the hon. Gentleman has put it.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-06-14a.170.4" hansard_membership_id="3100" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/32485" speakername="Mr. George Cunningham" colnum="170" time="">
<p>It is difficult to understand the situation. Right from the beginning, when the GLC was pressing hon. Members about the purposes for which that clause was included, it always spoke in terms of gipsy sites. Presumably the GLC cleared that with somebody, presumably with the Department of the Environment. Are we now to take it that the Department takes a different legal interpretation from that


which was taken earlier, or that it has always thought on the lines that my hon. Friend is putting forward? If there is a difference, if the Department is right now, it was wrong then; and if it was wrong then, how can we be sure that it is right now?</p>

<p>The Department of the Environment has always taken the view which I have just expressed. I cannot accept responsibility for any advice which the GLC may have taken in the past. The advice I am giving to the House this evening is the advice which I have just enumerated&#x2014;namely, that this provision does not cover the gipsy situation because that is covered by a different Act. In view of that situation, the Government would like the House to pass this clause, because it would give an advantage to London and bring it into line with the situation which already exists in other parts of the country.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Minister is doing extremely well, and I address these remarks to him in a friendly way. As for inner London, nobody in his right senses would want to put caravans in that area. The only people who might want to put caravans in inner London are gipsies. Therefore, when we are talking about caravans, obviously we are thinking of gipsies. Incidentally, if I had time I would go into the question of whether they are gipsies. However, we are obviously confused about the situation. If we are dealing here with caravans and the use made of them, let us admit that we are thinking of the use made of them by gipsies.</p>

<p>I said earlier that I have a lot of sympathy with what my right hon. Friend is saying. I do not think he will find the answer to his problem by rejecting the clause. He will find an answer to the problem through administrative action and also as a consequence of the recommendations that will be made to my right hon. Friend by Mr. Cripps when he reports. This clause is primarily concerned with the provision of caravan sites, not in inner London&#x2014;because I would not have thought that anyone other than probably a gipsy would want to have a caravan in my right hon. Friend's constituency&#x2014;but in parts of outer London where a person might

wish to do so. That is why I commend the clause to the House.</p>

<p>Before the Minister sits down, may I return to the point he raised earlier? I must ask him to look again at page 7 of the brief provided by the GLC a few days ago&#x2014;at least, I received my copy only a few days ago. It says:
<q>there must&#x2026;be some doubt about the duty of London boroughs under the 1968 Act to provide gipsy caravan sites".</q>

<p>I can only repeat what I have said, that gipsy caravan sites are provided in accordance with the duties imposed by the Caravan Sites Act 1968. This duty was specifically reaffirmed by the 1972 Act. The duty is imposed by that Act, and the clause with which we are concerned relates to the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act 1960.</p>

<p>I am grateful for this opportunity to say something in a non-partisan spirit about Amendment No. 1 and Clause 10. I shall not be able to agree entirely with my hon. Friends the Members for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) and Streatham (Mr. Shelton) but I take the point they make. My constituency is one of those in Greater London which has recently been afflicted with a gipsy problem. It seems that in my part of South London the problem is to some extent a seasonal one, with gipsies descending on the area in greater numbers at about the time of the Derby and the Epsom races.<br/>
This phenomenon is evident this year, with the usual adverse effect on many of my law-abiding, tax- and rate-paying constituents, specifically the residents living in the area of St. Helier Open Space, bounded by Shaftesbury Road, Robertsbridge Road, Middleton Road and Green Wrythe Lane. They have had to put up with an invasion of as many as 40 or 50 gipsy caravans, with all the lorries, cars, electric generators, children and dogs which go with such an invasion. This has caused considerable anger to many of my constituents, who resent being kept awake at night, who are alarmed by the risk to public health and who are affronted by the


apparent ability of gipsies to go where they like and do as they please without incurring any of the normal obligations which weigh upon the rest of the community.<br/>
Obviously, such people must be moved off open sites and green areas that are intended for adult and child recreation and for the use of bona fide residents. I recognise that it is not enough simply to move gipsies on. There must be a co-ordinated, considered and compassionate response to a problem which affects thousands of people throughout Greater London. The only long-term answer, in my view, is the adequate provision of permanent sites for gipsy caravans. I therefore accept that Clause 10 is a necessary step in that direction, first of all, as the Minister said, to rectify the present unsatisfactory legal position caused by the Local Government Act 1972, and more widely as part of a broader strategy to deal with the gipsy problem.<br/>
I understand that the Cripps Committee, which is looking into the workings of the Caravan Sites Act 1968, is expected to report some time before the autumn. I hope that when its report is available&#x2014;and assuming that it will contain sensible proposals for the tightening up of the law&#x2014;the Government will not hesitate to put forward further legislation, if that should be shown to be necessary, to deal with the problem more satisfactorily.<br/>
10.45 p.m.<br/>
No reasonable person should hold anything against gipsies themselves. But I believe, however, that it is intolerable that law-abiding citizens should be prevented from sleeping, should have their children's health and safety put at risk and should have their general peace disturbed by the unwanted presence of gipsy encampments which, it seems, grow up almost overnight in residential areas.<br/>
I cannot support the amendment, which seeks to delay by five years the London boroughs' implementation of Section 29(1) of the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act 1960.</p>

<p>As I understand it, and as my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State has argued, we are not talking necessarily about gipsy sites. However, anyone who talks about sites for caravans

in the Greater London area knows of the sort of person who is called a gipsy.<br/>
I recently visited the office of my right hon. Friend the Minister for Planning and Local Government. He received me and my local authority representation in a courteous manner. One of the officials to whom I was introduced was what my right hon. Friend called the Gipsy Officer. I asked him how he defined a gipsy. I was brought up to believe that a gipsy is a man with a bandeau round his head who strums a guitar and sings romantic songs before an open camp fire. The term "gipsy" in that sense is not applicable to what I have been seeing in recent days. Many of the types who understandably have a life of their own are what are called didicoi. They need open space to break up cars. That is part of their livelihood. They seem to pay no rates, although I am sure that they pay taxes. They do not seem to conform in any way.<br/>
The borough of Southwark has more than its share of astonishing people. It has got me for a start. But it has vagrants, meths drinkers and social welfare problems of a sort that are unbelieveable. When we say "Pack it up, we cannot take any more social problems on our back", we are not talking about gipsies singing melodious songs around a camp fire. The term "gipsy" has become intermixed. We have in mind those who live a life which is quite extraordinary. I suppose that they are nomads. They move from site to site.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State is an honourable man for whom I have great respect and affection, but I suggest that the word "gipsy" has become intermixed and that we are really looking after what are called nomads. What humbug we talk.<br/>
What are we doing with the nomads or didicoi? 'They go to a site and they are oppressed, shouted at and screamed at. They live in filth for month after month and we move them out. We put them in another site and erect some barricades so that no one will see them. This is the humbug of it all. I am not told that they will stay at the site which I have in mind for a limited time because the area is wanted for something else. They will be moved to another site, and I have a


shrewd idea that it will be next door to where I am operating a headquarters.<br/>
The people who do the planning operation do not understand the people I represent. I do understand them. Those who do the planning do not live in the area. Oh, no, they have nothing to do with that. They said to me "Look, Mr. Mellish, you have a great deal to say about a lot of things. The Minister decided under the Caravan Sites Act to exempt the boroughs of Westminster and Chelsea. He has the authority and power to excuse the London borough of Southwark." I said "All right. I will go and have the argument." That is how it came about: how to define "gipsy", and why cannot my area, with the heartaches that we have, be exempted?<br/>
We are one of the victims of the Industrial Revolution and all that flows from it. Right across my borough were built the famous railway arches which daily help to transport the thousands of people who run up and down between their place of work and their homes in the southern belt, and good luck to them. But we have to suffer from the noise, the turmoil, the dirt and the arches. As if we have not enough heartaches and problems&#x2014;</p>

<p>Perhaps I can help my right hon. Friend, since he is so concerned about moving the didicoi from one site to another and he thinks that he knows where it is. I can tell him where it is. It is in my constituency. They have just arrived, and they have come from the Walworth Road. I take it that my right hon. Friend has done something to get them out of his area and into mine.</p>

<p>That puts my case perfectly. I am a selfish, self-opinionated local Member of Parliament whose life started and almost ends with my beloved people, and I do not care where these people go as long as they are out of my area. My hon. Friend has them. He can keep them, look after them and care for them. But do not ask the London borough of Southwark to take on more than it can.<br/>
I have the impression that much of this debate is irrelevant&#x2014;my hon. Friend the Minister will not be surprised to hear that much of what goes on in this House is irrelevant&#x2014;but this is not. As I under-

stand it, what the GLC is trying to do in this General Powers Bill&#x2014;and half the time I do not know what it is up to&#x2014;is to rectify that which was in doubt in order to make certain that that doubt is removed so that the London boroughs collectively will be compelled to do something which they doubted whether they should do, anyway, and which it was doubted whether the Minister could authorise them to do. It is in that context that all this argument arises.<br/>
I end with a plea. I agree that these nomads&#x2014;I do not use the expression "didicoi"&#x2014;have a right to live their lives in their own way. But the rest of society is sick of the idea that they will not conform, send their children to normal schools, use normal toilets and live the normal way of life that everyone else does. Therefore, they become a problem. I concede that there should be sites where they might live and have a future which is secure. At the moment, they have no secure future where they are. In this speech, I warn my own local authority that if it pushes them into the area where I think it intends to push them, it had better watch out. I think that it knows that. I am saying that something should be done, and I am taking this opportunity to say a few words about it. I have great respect for the hon. Member for Ravensbourne (Mr. Hunt), but if I had my way, they would all be in Ravensbourne.</p>

<p>The effect of the amendment will be to defer the duty of London boroughs to deal with the problem of gipsies. I want, however, to distinguish between people who are gipsies, didicoi and nomads and those who are caravan dwellers who live in established places of residence on sites provided by local authorities.<br/>
I have a site in my constituency at West Drayton which has been provided at considerable expense by the London borough of Hillingdon for caravan dwellers. The amendment does not affect people of that kind. The people whom we are discussing are those who fester the countryside, breaking up old cars, burning motor tyres and the rest of it. I have these people in my constituency at the moment in the village of Fairfield, and no doubt soon they will make their way towards Shoreditch, Bermondsey or somewhere else in London.<br/>
My purpose in intervening is to make the point that this Bill is not the right place in which to deal with gipsies. I believe that the time has arrived when the Government should deal with the problem by new legislation specifically enabling local authorities, particularly local health authorities, to deal with gipsies and didicoi. It is a persistent problem which every Member of Parliament and every local authority dreads, because no one has sufficient power to deal with it. Therefore, I ask the Minister to take account of the very strong feelings which clearly exist in the House.</p>

<p>It is not my understanding that the association supports it unanimously. That being the case, what I have said is entirely relevant to the debate.

For that reason I support the amendment.</p>

<p>I am not clear about the preferred legal view of the consequences of the various provisions. When I looked at the original Clause 12, I took up the matter with the GLC in bilateral correspondence, and the reply I had from the GLC's legal advisers makes clear that their view is founded on what they conceived to be the Department of the Environment's view at the time.<br/>
The 1960 and 1968 Acts were linked to one another, and some of the sentences may be of use to the House. I shall read what the GLC says:
<q>The best view (which is the view taken by the Department of the Environment's legal advisers and one with which I agree) is that the provisions of the 1972 Act has unintentionally deprived the London boroughs of their powers under Section 24 of the 1960 Act. Inevitably, if this is so, London boroughs are also relieved of their duty under the 1968 Act to provide gipsy caravan sites, as it is tied to the powers under Section 24 in the 1960 Act. This seems to be the best view of the

position, yet it is arguable that the London boroughs in fact still have powers and the duty imposed by the 1960 and 1968 Acts. The council was approached last year by the Department of the Environment, who set out the legal position as they saw it, and suggested that it he clarified and rectified in the next General Powers Bill, as there is no imminent Government Bill in which the provision could be suitably included.</q>
Whatever the unsuitability of the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, it is more suitable than this Bill for public legislation and the correction of a mistake, which was a mistake not of the Government but of the House. If that is the situation, the provision of sites for gipsies is at issue&#x2014;that is the point.<br/>
11.0 p.m.<br/>
Secondly, I should like to take this opportunity of raising with my hon. Friend the Minister the criteria used for not granting exemption. If the London borough of Islington is not entitled on general grounds to exemption from the obligation to supply gipsy sites, I do not know what part of London would be so entitled. We have housing stress greater than almost any other part of the country, with 13,000 families on the waiting list and waiting. To argue that, because a person is accustomed to living in a mobile home, he should have a better chance of acquiring a home in Islington than the 13,000 people on the waiting list is preposterous.<br/>
Islington borough's application for exemption was turned down, however, with this explanation in a letter from the Department of the Environment to the council:
<q>As regards your application for exemption, it is noted that there are no gypsies in the Borough. The view of our legal advisers is that, in such a situation, since there is no duty to provide adequate accommodation for gypsies who are not in fact residing in or resorting to the area, there seems little point in granting exemption from an obligation that does not exist.</q>
The Department then argues that if it tried to grant an exemption it would be necessary to go through the necessary formalities, and, since there is no point in it, why bother?<br/>
How does the Department know that there will be no gipsies resorting to the borough? "Resorting to" the borough presumably means something different from "residing in". That means that if gipsies come to resort to Islington, the


borough acquires the obligation to find sites. Do the words "resorting to" imply coming intermittently to the borough, or do they mean, as I would have thought, people who had not in the past lived in the area but who start to come there and look for sites for their caravans? I hope that in the appropriate instrument, which is obviously not this one, that point will be cleared up and the Inner London boroughs at least, who by no commonsense criteria can be regarded as suitable places for gipsy sites, will be clearly exempted from this obligation.</p>

<p>My constituency is suffering from its annual invasion of gipsy caravans and my constituents look upon them in much the same way as do the constituents of the right hon. Member for Bermondsey (Mr. Mellish). Perhaps this is one of the problems which illustrates that simply passing a law does not mean that we can deal with a fundamental, almost intractable human problem.<br/>
When the House passed the Caravan Sites Act 1968, the theory was that, provided sufficient local authorities could be persuaded to provide sufficient sites, there would in the end be sufficient accommodation for the gipsy population, and it would then be possible to introduce compulsion over their movements outside these sites.<br/>
In practice, however, there have been so many exemptions, no time limit on the duty of local authorities to provide sites and such a bad underestimation of the number of sites needed that even today, after eight years of the operation of the Act, we have come nowhere near to providing adequate permanent sites for the gipsy population. I do not think sites have been provided for more than 20 per cent. of the 1968 figure for that population, and the population has risen since then.<br/>
We must look at the problem again, and I am glad that the Cripps Committee is considering it. We have to approach it from an entirely different point of view in future. Personally, I believe that the only possible solution lies in the registration of every gipsy family, or every gipsy caravan, entitled to a site under the 1968 Act. Once we

get registration, we shall know the numbers involved. We shall know by the simple matter of arithmetic how many sites each authority which normally expects to be invaded by gipsies has to provide.<br/>
It is impossible for us to go on as we are, imagining that we are solving the problem by passing an Act but in practice suffering all this nuisance. If the provisions of the Bill are intended to restore to local authorities powers which they have lost, and if the intention of the amendment is to deprive them of any power at all to deal with this problem, I believe that the provisions should be supported.</p>

<p>I do not think it matters whether we call them "gipsies" or give them any other name. That is not the point. What is really depressing is that it does not matter whether these caravan dwellers are in Ealing, North or Ealing, Acton or Bermondsey or anywhere else. It is not that such people live in caravans. Rather is it their behaviour&#x2014;that is what frustrates, irritates and annoys.<br/>
Certainly, the London borough of Ealing has leaned over backwards to provide education even to the point of getting teachers to go to the caravans and encourage the children to take an interest in going to school. The borough has also provided water and toilet facilities&#x2014;the whole lot. It is with great reluctance that I have to say that all this has been in vain.<br/>
What is more, as my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Cunningham) rightly pointed out, the link between the 1960 Act and the 1968 Act almost comprised a felony. It created an impossible situation for the local authorities. The present legislation makes the situation almost impossible for the police, who have discovered that under the legislation it is almost an impossibility for them to act.<br/>
How absurd can one get? If people drive on to a park or open space in the London borough of Ealing, provided they are not using a caravan the police can shift them, but if they use a caravan, dress in a peculiar way and claim that they are gipsies, they can almost get away with murder. The Department of the


Environment must have run out of excuses by now. It has made a complete mess of the original legislation. It has not endeavoured to find proper reforming legislation.<br/>
The last thing I want is for my remarks to be regarded as being anti-caravan dwellers or anti-gipsy. But there is a problem, and we have to find the right way of dealing with it. The way the existing legislation has been drafted has made the situation absolutely impossible.<br/>
I am not making a party point, but a reasonably constructed letter was sent by the town clerk or chief executive officer of the London borough of Ealing to the Department of the Environment in 1972 following the passing of the Act, and it took nearly two and a half years before there was a reply. It must have been an extraordinarily difficult situation for those who had to give the answer to the letter.<br/>
By putting this provision in this Bill we have made a mistake. There is a need to look at the initial legislation and for a proper Bill to be introduced into this House in order to clear up this difficult situation once and for all.</p>

<p>In the course of my remarks on the Second Reading of the Bill I said that I took great exception to the then Clause 12, and I stated my reasons. I said on behalf of the promoters that I was expecting discussions to take place during the Committee stage in order to ascertain the true facts about this clause, since there was little doubt that there was confusion in the Department, in the Greater London Council and in the boroughs.<br/>
I am now informed by the promoters that a meeting was held between the London Boroughs Association and the Department of the Environment consequent on the Second Reading debate at which the London strategic approach to the gipsy problem was debated. The conclusion reached at that meeting was that it was essential to proceed with the clause, which is now Clause 10, so that the unsatisfactory legal position could be rectified.<br/>
The LBA has reaffirmed its unanimous support for the clause and considers that the right way of dealing with the gipsy problem is not by rejecting the clause but

by way of the enactment of legislation in pursuance of the Cripps Report which is expected in the autumn. We have an assurance from my hon. Friend the Minister that he will produce an interim report in July to give us some idea of what Cripps is saying. Those are the facts, which I give to the House.<br/>
The LBA can apparently do nothing to remove these itinerants who arrive in the area. I can amplify from my own experience what everybody else has said. No doubt I shall now do as my right hon. Friend the Member for Bermondsey (Mr. Mellish) proposes to do, and I shall try to push these gipsies into Islington a bit further and get them out of my constituency. It is a silly situation.<br/>
One of the problems is that the Department is dilatory. We are satisfied that, even though the 1968 Act provides for an appeal by the boroughs, we have seen in inner London that that is virtually worthless. Islington and Southwark, and I believe, Lewisham, sought to appeal, but it has been refused. These are all areas of great stress. Yet Westminster and Kensington can apparently get what they want without any problem. The rest of the inner London boroughs have already seen the colour of the Department's money and they do not like the colour of it. It is no good saying "If you have problems, you can appeal to the Executive." We have seen what that is worth. The Department is culpable to the extent that it has shown that there is no purpose in appealing, because the appeal will not be allowed.<br/>
The Department must understand that this burden must not be placed on inner London boroughs. There is no suitable accommodation in the inner London boroughs. I gave my word to the Minister that I would not vote against the clause tonight, but I want him to understand that I do not think the best solution has been found. Many London boroughs have spent vast sums of money on providing caravan sites under the Caravan Sites Act, which has nothing to do with gipsies. Because of their obligations in connection with the maintenance of those sites, I am assured that the London boroughs will have acted <i>ultra vices</i> if the clause is not passed, and they will be faced with a great problem. I am informed by the London


Boroughs Association that this is an important element. I therefore urge my hon. Friends to oppose the amendment.</p>

<p>With the leave of the House, I should like to reply.<br/>
We have had an interesting debate on the amendment. I must point out to the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Mr. Brown), who sponsored the Bill originally, that it is hon. Members, not the London Boroughs Association, who represent Londoners. I am not bothered that the LBA wants the clause. I am satisfied, having consulted my constituents, that they do not want it. I know that I speak for them in registering my concern at what the GLC is trying to do in the Bill.<br/>
I am more confused now than I was at the beginning of the debate. There has been some difference of legal opinion between the Department of the Environment's advisers and the GLC's advisers on the current situation. I did not find the Minister's explanation satisfactory. He reminded me of something from "The Mikado" about
<q>apologetic statesmen of a compromising kind".</q>
There he was, a London Member, telling a disbelieving House comprised of other London Members that the clause was in the interests of Londoners. With two exceptions, no one believed him.</p>

<p>Does the hon. Gentleman recall another quotation from "The Mikado" when someone is drawing attention to a fault in a statute? The Mikado says:

<p>I am obliged to the hon. Gentleman. I am sure that we could draw on even more quotations from the Gilbert and Sullivan operas if we wished to amplify the argument.<br/>
Whatever Parliament may have wanted to do in 1968, the situation has changed. The Department has said that the 1968 Act is unsatisfactory and it has instituted a review. To my mind it is wrong, while the review is proceeding, to extend the Act to London. Secondly, there is no

money. It is wrong to compel the London borough of Ealing to spend &#x00A3;250,000 on provision for gipsies when it is having to cut back on everything else. I urge those who spoke in favour of the amendment to record their support in the Lobby.</p>

<p>With the permission of the House, I should like to speak briefly again. The House has had an interesting debate on the subject of gipsies. In view of all that has been said, I should make it clear that I cannot answer many of the points that have been made because the Cripps Committee is studying the problem. However, I assure hon. Members who have raised issues concerning their constituencies that these matters will be passed on to Mr. John Cripps and taken into account in the study which he is undertaking.<br/>
I recognise that many hon. Members feel deeply concerned about the issues which have been raised. But when we consider the problems of stress, to which reference has been made, it should be remembered that the GLC area&#x2014;the London boroughs as a whole&#x2014;has provided no fewer than 405 sites. I think that the six counties around the GLC area could have made a much greater contribution than they have made. My figures suggest that those six counties, which have a greater area available than the GLC, have provided only 386 sites.<br/>
There is a major problem here. The hon. Member who said that the problems of today are different from those of 1968 was absolutely right. The numbers are greater, and the problems are therefore greater. I want to emphasise what I said earlier. The clause makes no practical difference to the obligation on London boroughs to provide gipsy sites. In that respect, it does not matter whether the clause is included.<br/>
A number of London boroughs are concerned that, because of the small legislative error to which I referred, they might be acting <i>ultra vires</i> in relation to other kinds of caravan sites. That is presumably why the LBA supports the clause. The London boroughs have in mind particularly their functions under the 1960 Act. The distinction is clear between the provision of sites for gipsies under the 1968 Act and the provision of sites for other caravan dwellers under


the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act 1960. I therefore repeat my earlier recommendation that the clause is acceptable.</p>

<p>I beg to move Amendment No. 2, in page 13, line 4, at end insert:
<q>'(3) In the event of the Camden Council not exercising its powers as aforesaid, the Greater London Council may exercise such powers from 1st January 1980 and on their so doing their shall be substituted the name of the Greater London Council for that of the Camden Council (wherever this appeals) for the purposes of the operation of this Part of the Act'.</q>
I emphasise that this amendment and subsequent ones in my name are not put forward in a party political spirit. Nor are they tabled with the intention of delaying the House. If there is an issue, it lies not between the parties but between the London borough of Camden and local residents in the adjoining constituencies, various amenity bodies in the area and organisations concerned with the preservation of Highgate Cemetery as a national monument.</p>

<p>The clause gives Camden power to enter upon and make use of the cemetery and eventually to purchase it compulsorily. The clause does not impose a duty upon the council to do that. It is permissive and it is a power which lasts only until 31st December 1979. If the power to enter and acquire is not exercised by the local authority within the three-year period stipulated by the Bill, the powers will lapse and no public body will have the power to enter upon the cemetery and look after it.<br/>
The House must consider what that would mean. The cemetery, which was fully described on Second Reading, is regarded by many as an important national monument containing the graves of many renowned people and as a unique example of Victorian funeral architecture.

The Royal Fine Art Commission considers it to be worthy of preservation and conservation.<br/>
In 1969 the cemetery was bought by the company which now owns it, and since then it has been allowed to fall into dereliction and become overgrown and vandalised. Virtually no security exists. People who have relatives buried there make protests daily and complain about the way in which the cemetery has been allowed to fall into disuse. That is a matter of grief for them. The cemetery is also of interest to the nation as a whole. If Camden decides within the three-year period, not to do anything, that unhappy and unfortunate state of affairs will continue.<br/>
The object of the amendment is to give a long-stop power to the GLC to take over, if Camden decides to do nothing within the three-year period. It does not impose any obligation upon the GLC to do that if it does not so wish, and it does not give the GLC the power to interfere with Camden in any way. The amendment would give rise to this power should Camden decide not to exercise it within the three-year term that the Bill gives it. Therefore, the GLC would have power from 1st January 1980 to enter in and take over the management, maintenance and upkeep of the cemetery in the national interest.<br/>
Camden can have no objection to the amendment, for the reasons I have given, but there is possibly one minor objection. That is, that the GLC is not a cemetery authority. Generally speaking, we have given the powers to look after cemeteries to the London boroughs and not the GLC, but to give the GLC the power in this Bill will not make it into a cemetery authority. Its powers will be limited to this cemetery if Camden does not wish to exercise the powers itself. What the GLC can then do is circumscribed and defined by the Bill.<br/>
I hope that in those circumstances the House will accept the amendment.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-06-14a.190.0" hansard_membership_id="1778" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/31092" speakername="Mr. Ronald Brown" colnum="190" time="">
<p>On Second Reading I gave undertakings on behalf of the promoters that they would do their best to meet the objections advanced by the hon. Member for Hornsey (Mr.


Rossi). There has been a series of meetings between the hon. Gentleman, Camden Borough Council and the promoters, who have moved a long way to meet the objections that he put forward on behalf of the amenity groups. Hon. Members will see in the statement circulated to them a long list of amendments brought forward by the promoters to meet the hon. Gentleman's requirements.<br/>
I was surprised that this amendment was selected, as it seemed that it would extend the Bill and could, therefore, be construed to be out of order. As it has been selected, however, we must accept that.<br/>
The GLC has made it abundantly clear that it does not wish to be involved in the matter, which was initiated by Camden Borough Council. That council believes that the cemetery should be its responsibility. It has seen the two societies involved&#x2014;the Highgate Society and the Friends of Highgate Cemetery&#x2014;and has tried to put forward their view of what can be done to put the cemetery back into good order and use the land surrounding it.<br/>
The promoters have honoured their undertaking to do everything possible to ensure that the safeguards asked for were given, and I therefore hope that the House will reject the amendment.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-06-14a.191.0" hansard_membership_id="4206" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20268" speakername="Mr. Rossi" colnum="191" time="">
<p>With the leave of the House, I should like to say that I accept that the promoters and Camden Borough Council have gone a long way to meet a number of original objections to the Bill. We can deal with these matters on other amendments, because that meeting of objections in no way relates to the amendment, which was not the subject of the earlier discussions to which the hon. Gentleman referred.<br/>
11.45 p.m.<br/>
This is a novel proposal, in case of what may happen because of prevailing economic circumstances, among other reasons. Camden will be under pressure from the Government. It is &#x00A3;1&#x00BD; million overspent in the current year, and will be asked to cut back on its expenditure. The taking over of this cemetery may involve the council in an initial cost of &#x00A3;350,000 and thereafter continuing expenditure of &#x00A3;50,000. That expenditure

might be found to be unacceptable to Camden in the next three years. A burden of that nature is not of such great significance to the GLC as it is to a single London borough.<br/>
Although the GLC may not at this point have contemplated taking over this burden, it could well be that in the three-year period in question during which Camden has to make up its mind, if the Bill is amended as we suggest, it will be possible for Camden and the GLC to discuss the matter to see how the cemetery can best be looked after. We hope that the amendment will afford an opportunity for a discussion of that kind to take place.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-06-14a.192.0" hansard_membership_id="9305" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30516" speakername="Mrs. Millie Miller" colnum="192" time="">
<p>I can understand the hon. Gentleman's concern about this matter, particularly as he appears to be representing amenity societies rather than the general population of the borough of Camden or of the whole of London. However, it seems to me to be somewhat incongruous that he should be pressing for this addition to the contingency expenditure of the GLC at a moment when the House has just finished counting the votes in a Division in which the Opposition voted against such a contingency.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-06-14a.192.1" hansard_membership_id="4206" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20268" speakername="Mr. Rossi" colnum="192" time="">
<p>I assure the hon. Lady that the representations I have received come not only from amenity bodies but from ordinary citizens in Camden as well as in my own constituency. I assure the hon. Lady that there are many people in those amenity bodies who are deeply concerned about the future of the cemetery and the graves of their relatives in it.<br/>
In regard to the second part of the hon. Lady's intervention, I accept that any increase in public expenditure by local authorities at this point in time involve great difficulties indeed, but if the amendment were accepted by the House it would not impose on the GLC any financial burden whatever. This is simply an enabling amendment to entitle the GLC to take over the responsibility in four years' time if in the meantime Camden decides not to take it over. It could still happen that neither Camden nor the GLC decides to spend the money. In that case, no public expenditure at all would be involved. If the amendment is accepted, in four years' time the GLC,


with the greater resources available to it, may find itself in a position to undertake a burden which, in the immediate future, Camden may find itself unable to undertake.<br/>
Frankly, I fail to understand why Labour Members seek to resist the amendment. It can do absolutely no harm to anybody. It is an insurance in the likelihood of certain events happening, and that is all. Surely Labour Members should welcome an opportunity of seeing that the cemetery, which is a national monument, is preserved, if that is at all possible, rather than be allowed to fall into dereliction and be vandalised.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-06-14a.193.0" hansard_membership_id="1778" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/31092" speakername="Mr. Ronald Brown" colnum="193" time="">
<p>I cannot understand what the hon. Member for Hornsey (Mr. Rossi) is getting at, because that is exactly what Camden Council wants to do but the hon. Gentleman is making it impossible for the council to take that action. He has already been told that if this situation continues Camden Council will withdraw from the whole matter. There is no reason why the people of Hackney should be involved in this awful cemetery because the hon. Gentleman has been playing politics with it.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-06-14a.193.1" hansard_membership_id="4206" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20268" speakername="Mr. Rossi" colnum="193" time="">
<p>I do not understand the hon. Gentleman's point. How can it inconvenience Camden in the slightest if power is given to another body to take over this responsibility if Camden decides that it does not want to take action? The amendment says that Camden is completely free for three years to decide whether it wants this responsibility. In the Bill as it stands if Camden decides to do nothing, nothing will be done or can be done. With the amendment added, if Camden makes that same decision and does nothing there will be the possibility of someone else doing something&#x2014;merely a possibility.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-06-14a.193.2" hansard_membership_id="8360" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30739" speakername="Mr. Phillip Whitehead" colnum="193" time="">
<p>May I, as a member of the Friends of Highgate Cemetery Society, say that one of the fears that some of us have about the hon. Gentleman's position is that it looks as though the amendment would be an open invitation to Camden Council, under present or future control, to do nothing, whereas the purpose of an amendment such as this should be to express the concern of Parliament that something should be done?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-06-14a.194.0" hansard_membership_id="4206" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20268" speakername="Mr. Rossi" colnum="194" time="">
<p>It would not be an open invitation to Camden to do anything at all, because there would be no guarantee that ultimately the GLC would do anything. It is merely an enabling provision. I can see that I have not persuaded Labour Members. I believe that they have come here determined not to be persuaded. I have set myself an impossible task. I shall not detain the House further.</p>

<p>Clause 15 is one in which Camden Council has already made considerable concessions. They were made as a result of negotiations with the amenity bodies, and as far as they go they have been received gratefully and with appreciation. The original clause, when it came before the House, would have given Camden Council the power to use the cemetery for physical recreation purposes, for athletic clubs and for all kinds of activities unrelated to the use of a cemetery, or to use it as a nature reserve, which is the purpose for which most of the people concerned in the amenity bodies would like to see it used.<br/>
Certain offending words have been removed from the clause, but there still remain words which cause a certain amount of concern. I refer to subsection (2)(<i>a</i>)(iii), which would enable Camden Council to use the cemetery.
<q>for the purposes of centres for the use of clubs, societies or organisations having social or educational objects".</q>
I am advised that the word "centres" would enable the building of totally inappropriate structures within the cemetery. It is the concern of the amenity body to try to preserve the cemetery in very much the way it was conceived, constructed and landscaped. They wish to avoid giving a power which could


enable ugly obstrusions to be built within the cemetery.</p>

<p>This is a matter of some importance to the people of Camden, the people of London and those who live around the cemetery, among whom I number myself. It is important that the area should remain the pleasant and quiet spot that it is. I cannot believe that any responsible local authority, be it the present council or any future Camden Council, or the Greater London Council, having decided to embark on the adventure of buying a redundant cemetery at public expense, would turn it into anything resembling a centre for pop festivals. Such a use would be entirely out of keeping with the whole of the district. It is right to say that we are talking about a privileged area. Those who live in the area have considerable areas of open space on which, if they so desired, they could hold pop festivals. There are ample facilities in the area.</p>

<p>I welcome that assurance from someone who represents Camden. It would be unthinkable if this area were used for a pop festival. Camden would find itself in considerable difficulty were it to be so unwise as to seek to use High-gate Cemetery for that purpose. However, my hon. Friend the Member for St. Albans (Mr. Goodhew) was seeking to make the point that the clause confers upon the authority the power to make such use of the cemetery were it so minded.</p>

<p>The planning authority would happen to be the Camden Council. That raises another problem and another difficulty. The authority would be judge and jury in the same matter. Whatever

may be the present intention of the authority, we are legislating not only for today or next week but for the future. The prevailing circumstances today are not necessarily the prevailing circumstances of the future. The Bill, when passed, would give the authority power to build centres for social or educational purposes. We cannot imagine that the authority would be as extreme as to hold pop festivals, but it could build completely inappropriate centres.<br/>
I understand, for example, that Camden has in mind the use of the cemetery as a centre for elderly people. Perhaps that is not particularly appropriate, but I am assured that that is what it has in mind. That is what I have been told in all seriousness. It also wishes to use the cemetery as a centre for a youth club. If it were used for that purpose&#x2014;although we have the assurance that this would not happen&#x2014;it would be possible for totally inappropriate buildings and structures to be erected and for inappropriate activities to take place. The amendments seek to remove that possibility. They would remove the word "centre", so that no structure could be built. Therefore, the simple purpose would be for the use of clubs, societies or organisations.<br/>
I have been asked to remove the word "social" because of the wideness of the word, the many interpretations that can be put upon it and the wide powers that it could confer, and to replace it with the words
<q>passive recreation and educational purposes",</q>
so that the area would be used for strolling&#x2014;using the area as an open space, as a nature reserve, as a place of beauty.<br/>
That is the intention of those who asked me to put down these amendments on their behalf. Again, I hope that the House will consider these requests from people living in the area who are deeply concerned with the cemetery and treat it with all the seriousness that it deserves.</p>

The Camden Council feels that it has moved as far as it can possibly go in terms of inserting into the Bill, at the request of those organisations, the safeguards which they require.<br/>
I hope that the House will reject the amendments.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Mr. Brown) has just referred to Clause 16, which deals with consultation with an advisory body still to be set up. The object of the amendment is to take the matter a little further and to ensure that the Camden Council reaches agreement with the advisory body before any action is taken to change the character of the cemetery and that, in the event of any dispute between the advisory body and the council, the matter can be referred to the Secretary of State to act as arbitrator in the last resort.</p>

<p>The promoters of the Bill take the view that they have gone as far as it is possible to go. Their view is that these amendments seek to bypass the usual local authority consultation formulae. The local parties are accustomed to exercising consultation functions in many areas. There is no indication that they exercise these functions other than in a bona fide manner. Camden has already inserted Clause 16 as a safeguard in this respect.<br/>
I promised the hon. Member for Hornsey (Mr. Rossi) that on behalf of the promoters I would put on to the record of the House the undertakings they are prepared to give, in order that everyone might understand the position.<br/>
I put it on record, on behalf of Camden, that
<ol>
<li>"(<i>a</i>) It is to agree the formation, the constitution and the functions of, and participate in, the advisory trust;</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) It is to treat the advisory trust as an appropriate organisation for the purposes of Clause 16 and to consult it in accordance with the requirements of that clause;</li>
<li>(<i>c</i>) It is to prepare special management regulations for Highgate Cemetery in place of the council's standard cemeteries regulations;</li>
<li>(<i>d</i>) So far as the matter is not covered by the consultation obligations imposed by Clause 16, it is to use its best endeavours to relocate within the cemetery any tombstone removed from its present position under Clause 17."</li></ol>
As I understand it, that is what the amenity group was looking for, and the promoters consider that those undertakings adequately meet the need.</p>

<p>This series of amendments is put forward on behalf of relatives of


those who are buried in the cemetery. Many of the relatives are concerned by the powers which Camden is taking unto itself to close up tombs, remove tombstones and disinter bodies.<br/>
In Clauses 17, 18 and 21 these powers are conferred upon the council. If the interment took place after 1946, the council must take certain steps to notify the relatives of its intentions. It must post a notice on the gates of the cemetery, circularise a notice in the local newspapers and send a notice to the last known address of the relatives. If the interment took place before 1st January 1946, there is no need at all for the local authority to notify the relatives. One could have a situation in which someone whose mother or father who was buried in the cemetery in 1945&#x2014;which is not so long ago for the human memory&#x2014;was not notified and found that the tomb had disappeared completely without his knowledge.<br/>
The object of my amendment is to move the time limit back from 1946 to 1926. Of course, the period of time is a matter of judgment. One has to take account of people's feelings. One cannot push the date too far back to make it ridiculous, but I think that 30 years is too short a period for this type of operation.<br/>
Another amendment replaces the year 1966 with the year 1946. This relates to the clause by which people are given the right to reinter their relatives' remains themselves. As the Bill stands, that right exists only where there has been an interment after 1966, which is only 10 years ago. That is too short a period, and the right should be given where interment has taken place since 1946. Again, it is a matter of judgment to get the right year. In these circumstances, I believe that the right of interment should be extended back 30 years rather than left at 10 years.<br/>
Although I have not carried the House with me so far, I hope that on this issue, on which human feelings run very deeply, I shall strike a chord of sympathy.</p>

<p>I had long discussions this afternoon with the promoters of the Bill on this very human problem. They admitted that 1st January 1946 is a compromise between, on the one hand, an obligation on Camden to

establish the names and addresses of and serve notices on individual owners of rights of interment and, on the other hand, their being able to establish any active interest in interments after more than 30 years. The 30-year period was accepted by Parliament in almost identical provisions in the 1975 General Powers Act in respect of Nunhead Cemetery. We are therefore dealing with an accepted standard adopted by the House as recently as last year. Thirty years is accepted as a reasonable period by interested Government Departments.<br/>
It should be borne in mind that in all cases there will be newspaper and on-site advertising under Clause 2, Clause 18(2)(<i>a</i>) and Clause 21(2)(<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>). Therefore, the obligation to trace owners and relatives in respect of interments since 1926 would seem to be the promoters to be unduly onerous, particularly since the House declared its view as recently as last year.</p>

<p>I do not speak as a London Member although I was born in London and was educated very near Highgate. I am worried, however, that Camden does not seem to have any recognition of consecrated ground. The hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Mr. Brown) spoke lightly of the fact that 30 years is long enough to remember someone who has died. This is a matter which should cause us to pause a little and ask how safe are our graveyards and monuments. We are remembering not only famous men but anyone who has died. People may have been famous only in their own families. How, therefore, can Camden so lightly disregard consecrated ground in this manner?</p>

<p>I agree with the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Crouch). I speak not as a London Member but as a Camden ratepayer who is connected with the Highgate Cemetery. Many members of my wife's family were buried there a long time ago. Highgate Cemetery, which is a monument to the great Victorian obsession with death, was essentially filled up in the 1920s, and we are talking, therefore, of a comparatively small number of people who are concerned about what might happen to the future of the graves.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Mr. Brown)


said that the House had declared itself on Nunhead Cemetery last year. That may be so, but it did not declare itself on Highgate Cemetery. There is a comparatively small number of graves kept up by emigr&#x00E9;s living in this country who tend them carefully. Many of the graves date back to the 1920s and 1930s. It is not satisfactory for the promoters of the Bill to say that there can be no compromise and that the date 1946 must stand.<br/>
There is a body of opinion in the Highgate area which wants these graves kept and wishes to see proper sanctions retained. By accepting the amendments we would be respecting the views of those people, however small a minority they are, within the general community. Secondly, we would be adding just one other sanction in respect of the disposal of the graves, the remains, the gravestones and so on. It would be harder for the other lurid possibilities which the hon. Member for Hornsey (Mr. Rossi) raised earlier to come into effect, because Camden Council would be showing respect to the large number of people who have a direct personal link with the cemetery.</p>

<p>Even in these times there are married couples who wish to be interred in the same grave. An interval of 30 years is not very long when one thinks that many men nowadays die at very young ages due to heart and other ailments.

That seems exceptionally hard, and I hope that the council and the House will think again.</p>

<p>It seems to me that there are certain hon. Member in the House this evening who are prepared to be somewhat cavalier about this matter. I do not think it is a matter which the House should let pass lightly.<br/>
I am even more disturbed when I realise that earlier amendments which would give freedom to use parts of consecrated ground in the cemetery for social purposes have been ignored. That is an entirely unattractive approach to the treatment of a cemetery. Although I do not represent a Greater London

constituency, it seems to me that we are speeding down a rather unattractive road in imagining that we can simply brush aside the feelings of people by deciding that we should like to make a place of this sort into a social centre. In view of the general tenor of the amendments I hope that we might at least have support for this one, which would ensure that we are not so casual and cavalier about the feelings of people who may still be alive today.</p>

<p>I can only say to the hon. Member for Hornsey (Mr. Rossi) that he is drawing a picture of Highgate Cemetery as if it was somehow a remarkable place and the Camden Council was moving in and dealing with the matter in a bad fashion. The cemetery is in a derelict state primarily from interment of earlier years. It is so bad that the council decided something had to be done in all decency and humanity. To try to portray Camden Council as having misbehaved is appalling.<br/>
The House decided that 30 years was a sufficient time to advertise for any relatives of persons who had been interred. I do not think a case has been made for extending the period an extra 20 years. I can only tell the hon. Gentleman that this matter was gone into in great detail. The promoters felt that there was nothing to be gained by the amendment and that it would only make it much more difficult to get on with the task of putting the cemetery into good order.<br/>
I can only say to the hon. Gentleman that the promoters initiated this task. The Friends of Highgate Cemetery expressed the view that the council should do it. The private owners of the cemetery have failed to do it for all these years. I should have thought it


was important that the House should try not to put any obstacles in the way of Camden Council in doing this work.</p>

<p>The Bill provides in various circumstances for the payment of sums of money by the Camden Council to the relatives of people whose remains have to be removed from their existing graves and also for the removal of tombstones.

The amendments seek to increase the upper limits of payment. That does not mean to say that the sums now proposed would be payable. The cost would still have to be proved. These are upper limits.<br/>
The object of increasing the upper limits as contained in the Bill is simply to take care of the inflationary situation because, although the amounts suggested in the amendments are somewhat higher than in the Bill as originally proposed, they still do not allow for the full amount of inflation that would take place.</p>

<p>I should like to comment that the amounts in virtually identical provisions in the 1975 General Powers Act were, respectively, &#x00A3;120 and &#x00A3;150. Those amounts were accepted by Parliament as realistic. The amounts in Clauses 21(5) and 22(8) have been set at &#x00A3;180 and &#x00A3;225&#x2014;an increase over last year of 50 per cent. The advice of the Camden Cemeteries Department is that these figures are realistic, and they have been accepted as such by the relevant Government Department. The promoters of the Bill consider that the increases suggested by the hon. Member for Hornsey (Mr. Rossi) are excessive. The figure of over &#x00A3;300 is extremely high and cannot be justified.</p>

<p>I beg to move
<q>That the Food Subsidies (Increase of Financial Limit) Order 1976, a draft of which was laid before this House on 14th May, be approved.</q>
The Order before the House tonight raises no new issue of principle. Therefore, I need not greatly detain the House.<br/>
Section 1(6) of the Prices Act 1974, as amended by Section 1(1) of the Prices Act 1975, limits expenditure on food subsidies paid under the Prices Acts to &#x00A3;1,200 million. However, Section 1(3) of the 1975 Act provides that this ceiling may be raised to a maximum of &#x00A3;1,700 million by an Order made with the approval of a resolution of this House. The situation envisaged by Parliament when the 1975 Act was being considered has come about and it is necessary to bring forward this Order to enable the food subsidies to continue to be paid.<br/>
Up to the end of May expenditure under the Prices Acts amounted to &#x00A3;1,072 million, and I expect that the total will reach the existing ceiling of &#x00A3;1,200 million within the next few weeks. The purpose of the Order, therefore, is to increase the limit to &#x00A3;1,700 million in order to enable the payment of food subsidies to continue for the rest of this financial year and, indeed, into the subsequent financial year.<br/>
I need not hold up the debate which I imagine will follow with a detailed repetition of the reasons which, in the Government's view, justify a food subsidy programme. We have fully debated this issue of principle in the past. I should simply like to recall briefly that at the time when we took office, early in 1974, food prices were rising sharply and there was a widespread fear among many pensioners and others on low incomes, who inevitably spend a substantial proportion of their income on the necessities of life, that their modest standard of living was under threat.<br/>
Unfortunately, selective schemes of social assistance have a poor record of take-up and effective non-selective schemes take time to prepare. We therefore developed the food subsidies pro-

gramme in order to provide quickly some measure of protection for the poorer members of our community from the worst effects of severe inflation. We developed the programme which had been begun by the Conservative Government by the introduction of substantial subsidies on milk and butter.<br/>
We have always made it clear that subsidies were intended as an interim, but important, measure. I have considerable sympathy with those of my hon. Friends who take the view that these subsidies should be maintained or even increased. Nevertheless the rate of inflation is moderating, and we have in this period made substantial progress in the social field. We can look forward to further advances on both fronts, although we have still a hard haul to bring down the rate of inflation to that of our competitors overseas, and progress in the social field cannot run too far ahead of improvements in the economy generally.<br/>
Food subsidies, therefore, have a substantial part to play in maintaining the standard of living of the less-well-off members of our community&#x2014;a substantial, albeit a declining, cointribution which will have to continue for some time to come. The Government's plans are set out in the White Paper on public expenditure&#x2014;</p>

<p>Before the hon.

<p>My hon. Friend who dealt with the Child Benefit Scheme made plain that it was not public expenditure considerations alone which led to the Government's plans being brought forward. Therefore, the hon. Gentleman's comments are not wholly germane.<br/>
In the circumstances I have described, the Government must provide for the continuation of food subsidies, and the passage of the Order tonight is therefore imperative. It is right to take this action now to raise the limit on expenditure to the maximum permitted under existing legislation. I accordingly commend the Order to the House.</p>

<p>In opposing the Order, which seeks to make available to the Government a further &#x00A3;500 million to spend on food subsidies&#x2014;the final &#x00A3;500 million under the Prices Act 1975&#x2014;we are not being inconsistent with the amendment we moved on 12th March 1975 during the Report stage of the Prices Bill 1975 to peg Government spending on food subsidies at &#x00A3;1,000 million. That would have allowed for &#x00A3;485 million to be spent over three years, or whatever period the Government chose to phase out food subsidies altogether.<br/>
Since rejecting our amendment, the Government have already spent another &#x00A3;550 million in just over one year, according to the figures given by the right hon. Lady the Secretary of State and according to the figures in the Public Expenditure White Paper. It would therefore not be inconsistent if we were to reject the Order and say that no further money should be made available.<br/>
However, we have always accepted&#x2014;as we did during the debate on the Prices Bill in 1975&#x2014;that we cannot phase out food subsidies overnight and that they cannot be phased out without considerable expense and some trauma. We warned of that when food subsidies were first announced, and we repeat that warning tonight.<br/>
In moving our amendment last year we proposed a three-year phasing-out period which was approved by the Food and Drink Industries Council. The first year of that phasing-out period has already been completed, albeit totally inadequately. We propose that if the Government produce a new Order&#x2014;to replace this one&#x2014;providing for a further &#x00A3;300 million we would not oppose it, because that amount should be sufficient&#x2014;and considerably more than we proposed in our amendment last year&#x2014;to complete the phasing-out process over the next two years. [<i>Interruption</i>.] The hon. Member for Newcastle-upon-Tyne, East (Mr. Thomas) laughs, but that means a saving of considerably more than the difference between &#x00A3;300 million and &#x00A3;500 million.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, under the procedures of the House I am forced to face the Labour Party, which is not always a pleasant prospect.<br/>
When account has been taken of the cuts already made in the cheese and butter subsidies and the saving we would be proposing in limiting the remaining subsidy money available to &#x00A3;300 million, the total saving would be about &#x00A3;700 million, which is, by coincidence, not much more than the Bank of England is reputed to have paid out in support of sterling this week alone. If the Government had accepted our amendment in the first place in 1975, less money would have had to be spent and the phasing-out programme could have been completed already. It is the Government who are responsible both for the delay and for the extra expenditure. It would be quite superfluous, as the Under-Secretary said, and particularly at this time of night, to rehearse all over again the arguments we had and the case we proved over and over again against the present Government's programme of food subsidies.<br/>
At the same time it would be wrong not to discuss the effect that our rejection of the Order and the substitution of an Order allowing &#x00A3;300 million expenditure on food subsidies would have on families struggling against the worst inflation we have ever known in this country. So far, food subsidies have saved about 2&#x00B7;5 per cent. on the Retail Price Index since they were first introduced, but they have cost over &#x00A3;1,000 million, and during that period prices have risen by over 50 per cent. So they have hardly made much impression despite that astronomical cost. At the same time as food subsidies have saved 2&#x00B7;5 per cent. on the RPI, the fall in the value of the pound, according to the Chancellor of the Exchequer's own calculations, has added about 7 per cent. to the RPI by the time the fall to date has worked through.</p>

<p>May I ask the hon. Lady a serious question? Now that the Opposition have said that it is their policy to try to work with the trade unions, has the hon. Lady or anyone on the Conservative Front Bench discussed this with the trade


unions to see what their views are before she comes here?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-06-14a.209.0" hansard_membership_id="4233" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/19146" speakername="Mrs. Oppenheim" colnum="209" time="">
<p>I do not think we are committed in any way to discuss with the trade unions the way in which we may react to the Government's policies at this moment in time. [Hon. Members: "Oh."] But of course the TUC will be as concerned as every right hon. and hon. Member by the fact that the tall in the value of sterling has put 7 per cent. on the RPI, and the TUC will want to seek, in the way every right hon. Member should want to seek, to strengthen sterling to prevent its erosion and the effect that this has on inflation in this country.<br/>
It follows that any minimal benefit that food subsidies may have had has been more than cancelled out by expenditure on them and by the effect which that has had on confidence in the pound. In other words, if food subsidies were abolished tomorrow, even if that were technically possible, which it is not, that news itself might boost sterling so that the effect on the RPI of that abolition would be totally negatived.<br/>
In case some Labour Members think that I am overstating the importance of the relationship between the value of the pound and current levels of Government spending, and between the public sector borrowing requirement and inflation, I shall reinforce my argument by quoting from a speech I came across the other day. Because I am in a generous mood tonight, and despite the hour, I shall offer a prize to any hon. Member opposite&#x2014;[Hon Members: "Name it."] Half a pint of cider. I shall offer a prize to any hon. Member who can identify the author of this speech.<br/>
The speaker said:
<q>The truth is beginning to emerge about prices &#x2026; world shortages are one factor in price inflation, but only one. Equally important is the fall &#x2026; in the value of the pound compared to other currencies. The Government floated the pound, and then did nothing to help it swim. Its policies of borrowing thousands of millions of pounds to finance its expenditure have weakened our vulnerable currency. In short, the Government has financed through inflation, hitting the poor much more than the rich, what it lacked the guts to finance through taxation.</q>

Who said that? No one has won the prize. The speaker was none other than the Secretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protection during the February 1974 election campaign, speaking at Dudley on 14th February. She continued:
<q>A third factor in rising prices is the commodity markets. Frightened of inflation, investors put their money into physical assets &#x2026; raw materials. The speculators buy forward &#x2026; and in doing so, drive up prices. &#x2026; It can be controlled, and it should be.</q>
The right hon. Lady went on to talk about the fourth factor being the fact that the Price Commission's controls were not on cash profit margins. She is not here, and I regret that I have to quote in her absence. She complained about the fact that after four years of Conservative Government the pound had fallen by 20 per cent. In just over two years of Labour Government it has fallen by just over 30 per cent. The right hon. Lady complained of Government borrowing to finance public expenditure. It was then, after four years of Conservative Government, &#x00A3;4,500 million; it is now &#x00A3;14,000 million. The public sector borrowing requirement which she also complained about was &#x00A3;4,500 million; it is now &#x00A3;11,000 million.</p>

<p>Not at all. I am stating a case for diminishing the Government's public expenditure and their level of borrowing. The Order is about Government expenditure&#x2014;&#x00A3;500 million.<br/>
The right hon. Lady also spoke of the need for cash profit margins to be controlled under the Price Code, and I have not noticed that she has done anything about that either. That is not to say that I am advocating it. Did she really believe all the things she said on that occasion, or was this just another example of the double standards of this Government? Does she say one thing in Opposition and then renounce it when in Government?<br/>
I quoted from the right hon. Lady's speech not only to reinforce what I was saying about the relationship between the level of Government spending and borrowing, the value of the pound and inflation, but also to illustrate once and


for all the dishonest duplicity which brought this Government to power in 1974, of which food subsidies were but a small part.<br/>
In that same speech, the right hon. Lady spoke of the "three-bob loaf" and the "near bob egg"&#x2014;I am not sure why she put it in those terms since we had then had the decimal system for nearly three years. She may find it ironic, however, to reflect that the "three-bob loaf" which she subsidises is now 18p but that the "near bob egg" which she has left to market forces is now 3&#x00BD;p. The whole food subsidy programme was part of that infamous period of connivance and delusion.<br/>
How earnestly we were told that food subsidies were aimed at the poorer families and pensioners and that, although more of the subsidies was going to the better-off, they were paying in taxes to pay for them very much more than they were getting. What has happened? That has proved to be yet another of this Government's cheats, because the value of food subsidies is now worth about 16&#x00BD;p per person per week to the average family while, to pay for them, in direct taxes, which are paid by everyone, have gone up by more than 50p per person per week and for the poor families by about 30p per person per week. That is a great deal more than they are getting from food subsidies&#x2014;some bargain for poorer families and pensioners. If the Minister questions that figure, I suggest that he refers to the welter of conflicting parliamentary replies from the Treasury which provide the foundation for that calculation.<br/>
If the Government had really wanted to help the poor and the pensioners, as they pretend, they could, for a fraction of the cost of food subsidies, have introduced family allowances for the first child immediately, or, as <i>The Guardian</i> of 4th June said, the 88 million spent last year on subsidies on butter&#x2014;90 per cent. of which was imported&#x2014;was seven times as much as spending on FIS. For half of what they propose to spend on food subsidies this year they could raise family allowances by one-third, which would put money into the pockets of the families that need it.<br/>
It is no wonder that the Secretary of State is not here tonight and has sent

the Under-Secretary sneaking in at 12.45 a.m. to ask for another &#x00A3;500 million for this disreputable, cruel and wildly extravagant piece of political sophistry.<br/>
If the Government want to take the Order away tonight and return with another, giving a final &#x00A3;300 million for subsidies, we would not oppose it. That would mean that in the current year they would have &#x00A3;200 million to spend instead of the &#x00A3;336 million that they propose, and &#x00A3;100 million next year against the &#x00A3;216 million that they are planning to spend.<br/>
The effect of that would be to reduce food subsidies by 7&#x00B7;p per person per week to the average family this year, 4p next year and another 4p the year after. The Secretary of State has already reduced the value of subsidies by 5&#x00B7;p per person per week, so the cuts that we are suggesting would be little more than those she has already made this year, but less next year and the year after, while saving about &#x00A3;700 million on the present programme. There would be no difficulty in substituting another Order, as the Department has already demonstrated. The maximum price Orders have already been altered seven times for butter, seven times for bread, six times for cheese, twice for flour and twice for tea. A total of 24 new Orders have been introduced because of price increases.<br/>
We are not insensitive to the effect of the withdrawal of even such a comparatively small sum of money from poorer families and pensioners, but there is no alternative and the Government are to blame for seeking to destroy and disguise reality.<br/>
We warned that food subsidies would be difficult to phase out. But the effect of the withdrawal of subsidies that we are proposing is as nothing compared with the terrible rate of inflation imposed on people by the Government over the last two years. How can the Government claim to be sensitive about pensioners and the poor when they have decided to do pensioners out of the full increase that they had expected and to cheat on the family benefits scheme?<br/>
The Public Expenditure White Paper shows that the Government are willing to contemplate cut-backs in proposed programmes in forthcoming years in education, social welfare and health, and


they are likely to be forced to impose greater cuts as soon as our creditors take over, as they surely will. How can the Government hope that the people will accept the need to postpone repairing schools or to defer the building of badly-needed new hospitals and other projects when they subject us to the spectacle of such profligate expenditure as is involved in food subsidies?<br/>
The Prime Minister boasts of achieving a historical consensus. But there can be no popular support for the policy of widespread retrenchment which is now unavoidable unless the Government introduce sensible and just priorities which they have manifestly failed to do. They embarked on this policy when we were not living as wildly beyond our means as we are today. There was little justification for it then on either social or economic grounds, and there can be none today.</p>

<p>I shall not follow the hon. Member for Gloucester (Mrs. Oppenheim), who has been suddenly converted to all sorts of desirable social objectives, into her jungle of meaningless statistics.<br/>
I welcome the way in which my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary introduced the Order, particularly his statement that he agreed with many of us that there was a need not only to maintain the level of subsidies but possibly to extend them in certain directions. Our concern is about whether the amount here&#x2014;I realise that it comes from the 1975 Act &#x2014;is adequate to maintain the type of subsidies that we should wish. We have already seen this month a fall in the help for the average family with two adults and two children from 70p to 65p a week. Unlike the hon. Lady, I believe that that is a retrograde step, because we should help families in every way possible.<br/>
With the recent butter price increases we have taken &#x00A3;34 million out of the pockets of poor people and stuffed it into the pockets of the richest taxpayers. There are obvious arguments, which are widely accepted on this side of the House, for the maintenance of those subsidies. The first is the nutritional one. There

is considerable evidence that whenever prices rise there is a tendency among poorer families to move away from nutritional foods.<br/>
Subsidies are aimed particularly at a range of nutritional foods for which there is an inelastic demand. There is an inflationary argument. As was seen at the time of the thresholds, there is no doubt that these subsidies are very effective in cutting down the rate of inflation. No hon. Member could disagree with the need to curb inflation in every way possible. However green the hon. Lady may be, this Government have an excellent record in their progress towards curbing inflation.<br/>
The subsidies have a useful stabilising effect. My right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food knows full well that, above all, the agricultural community wants stability in the prices of its products. The subsidies have made a contribution in that direction also.<br/>
The main reason, however, why my hon. Friends and I support this form of subsidies is that they have a useful redistributive effect. That is why they are so hated on the Opposition Benches. For the very poor, they provide a benefit of &#x00A3;11 to &#x00A3;13 a year to the individual.<br/>
Where does the money come from? These subsidies have always been part of a package in which the money has been taken out of the pockets of the richer sections of the community. [<i>Interruption</i>.] Why are Conservative Members so much against it if it is not fact? The statistics show that &#x00A3;200 million of the money found to meet these subsidies comes from those earning incomes of over &#x00A3;70 a week. There is no question that the subsidies have a useful redistributive effect. That is why, the Opposition hate them. We can ignore all the Opposition's cant about alternative benefits. These benefits certainly never appear when a Tory Government are in power.<br/>
Our short experience of this subsidy has been&#x2014;[An HON. MEMBER: "Disgusting."] It may be disgusting from that hon. Gentleman's point of view, but subsidies provide significant help to the poor person. These subsidies are a useful Socialist redistributive tool&#x2014;a tool that should be sharpened and strengthened.</p>

<p>After that interlude of Celtic fervour, let us pause to reflect on the facts and try to keep to the point.<br/>
For some of us who found the statistics of my hon. Friend the Member for Gloucester (Mrs. Oppenheim) amply meaningful, let me remind Labour Members of other statistics. One statistic which they should be asked to bear in mind is that during the short life of this Labour Government inflation has been at a level of 50&#x00B7;9 per cent. The annual rate of inflation rose at its highest peak last August to 26&#x00B7;9 per cent.&#x2014;an unholy and unheard&#x2014;of rate of inflation in this country, a rate of inflation worthy of any South American banana republic. That happened under a Labour Government. Even now, the annual rate of inflation is running at 18&#x00B7;9 per cent.<br/>
Hon. Members will notice the recurrence of the 0&#x00B7;9 per cent. figure. That is important because it is estimated that food subsidies have an effect on the Retail Price Index of 0&#x00B7;9 per cent. Last year the Secretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protection spoke about cutting the top off the mountain.</p>

<p>It is perhaps an adequate commentary on the achievements of the present Labour Government that some of their supporters are forced back to quoting the Second World War, involving a period of restraint and all the rest of it.<br/>
It has been said that the money for subsidies comes from wealthy citizens in the United Kingdom. The amount of money dealt with in the Order is &#x00A3;500 million. That amounts to two weeks' borrowing abroad by the present Government. In other words, we are sustaining these subsidies by virtue of borrowings from our friends abroad.<br/>
It is a matter of great concern to those of us who follow these debates to see such hesitation and diffidence in pursuing the Government's programme of phas-

ing out subsidies. We have had this time and again recently. Just when we saw a glimmer of light, when we thought the Government were about to act in accordance with their undertaking to phase out subsidies, they recoiled from the prospect. Perhaps they were dissuaded from doing so.<br/>
In the Budget of April 1975 it was said that food subsidies would be cut by &#x00A3;150 million and housing subsidies by about half that amount. By July, less than three months later, food subsidies were increased to 70 per cent. and housing subsidies were increased to keep council house rents down. Later last year we had proposals to reduce food subsidies in the shape of school meals. School meal prices were to rise from 15p to 20p. When it is realised that the subsidy on school meals costs the taxpayer &#x00A3;362 million, representing a subsidy of 64 per cent. one would think that the phasing out of the subsidy was long overdue.<br/>
Before anyone rises in indignation from the Labour Benches to tell me of those who cannot afford even the price of school meals and of those for whom a school meal is the only good meal they have each day, let me say that the figure I have given does not take account of free meals supplied to the children who need them. If we take free meals into account, the subsidy rises to 71 per cent. As a result of the further negotiations with the TUC, however, that programme is also to be put into abeyance and school meal charges are not to be increased.<br/>
We were promised by the Secretary of State that these indiscriminate food subsidies&#x2014;which lavish an 11p per lb. subsidy on butter for business men gorging themselves on business lunches, which undercut the price of cheese and which bring great joy to the cheese producers of the EEC&#x2014;would give way, if not soon, at least in the fullness of time, to much more discriminating, selective and sophisticated schemes, such as that proposed in the Child Benefit Scheme. All that is now to be abandoned. Why? It is not for reasons of social justice but because it is felt that this would be to transfer money to the mother, to the purse of the person who might provide for these poorest families.<br/>
Instead we have a scheme introduced which, in the opinion of the Child Poverty Action Group, will make many


of the poorest families worse off, not better off. If aid is to be given, we ask that it be given selectively to the families which need it most. This the Government are failing to do. That is why we oppose food subsidies as an inadequate means of helping those who need help.<br/>
For the Under-Secretary to be sent along here tonight to propose an expenditure of &#x00A3;500 million, a large sum of money, is some indication that the Government are losing their own case. They lack confidence and their lobster quadrille impresses no one. We should be thankful that at least lobster is not yet subsidised. That may come too. If we can at least have an assurance that this will be the last of such Orders at this time of night, or at any other time, we may gain some hope. In the meantime, we would do well to oppose the Order and help the Government to help themselves.</p>

<p>The method put forward by the Government tonight is a method of pricing and social support for which I have argued for a long time, and I welcome the fact that it is being introduced. I was surprised by what the hon. Members for Gloucester (Mrs. Oppenheim) and Romford (Mr. Neubert) had to say. They were willing to wound but afraid to strike. The Conservatives have this permanent fear of being exposed as the party of the rich. I sometimes wish that they would face up to it.<br/>
Why have food subsidies? One of the reasons has to do with the abnormally rapid rise in food prices following our entry into the Common Market. Because of the rapid and unwarranted rise after our entry&#x2014;for which Conservative Members are responsible because they negotiated the initial settlement&#x2014;it is right for the Government to cushion the effects, particularly as they are felt by the poorer sections in our society. The nonsense that we hear about the need for selective support betrays the social attitude of the Tories. They are hankering after the means-tested society. It is as simple as that.<br/>
The advantage of food subsidies is simple. They are non-discriminatory support. That is why we support them. We hear nonsense from the Tories about

business men's lunches, but, if business men would pay for their lunches a little more often instead of taking the price of their meals as one of the perks of the businesses for which they work, price increases would not be so great.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman and many of his right hon and hon. Friends talk about the means test, but under this Government everyone who is on supplementary benefit has to undergo the means test.</p>

<p>Yes, and my right hon. and hon. Friends bitterly regret that pensions are not sufficient to remove the requirement for supplementary benefit. The difference between the two major parties is that the Tories wish to create a supplementary benefit society while we wish to remove the needs for supplementary benefit.<br/>
The truth is that the poor pay more as consumers. They pay more in absolute terms because in general they have to buy in smaller quantities. They often buy on a daily or weekly basis. As Conservative Members should know, that is a much more expensive way of buying. Secondly, it is relatively more costly for the poor because a larger proportion of a poor person's income is spent on food than is spent as a proportion by Tory Members. Both absolutely and relatively, the poor pay more. That is particularly important as regards food, because the easiest thing to cut down on when there is a squeeze is food. People have to keep the house going and a number of other things, but as soon as pressure is brought to bear on a person's income it is food that he or she finds easiest to cut. We should be asking not for the phasing out of food subsidies but for an increasing level of subsidies.<br/>
I turn to the non-discriminatory aspect of subsidies. The subsidy is a method of redistribution that avoids all the obloquy of a selective structure. Let us remember the shame that free dinners bring to families. Let us remember the shame that is felt about receiving supplementary benefit. Every child and every parent who has to go through the selective structure feels an acute sense of shame.<br/>
The redistributive element of the nondiscriminatory subsidy favours the poorer sections of the community. That is


because a high proportion of their money is spent on food. The subsidy is a useful social weapon that avoids the bad element of selective support. It is especially effective for the poorer sections of society. That is why we should argue for a higher level of food subsidy. That would be of direct support to old people and poorer families, and it would not bring in the means test aspect.<br/>
Subsidies should be supported and increased because they are a useful form of price control and agricultural support. They should be written much more strongly into our social consciousness, but we deal with these matters in a negative way. We have attempted price control, but we should be much more positive towards food subsidies. Let us not forget that in 1945 the aim was to make a free school dinner available for every child. We have nowhere approached that.<br/>
Therefore, we want to expose the hypocrisy of the Opposition and to remind the Government that they have secured a deal with the trade unions in the past. All honour to the trade unions for that. Whether one agrees with the policy is another question, but I sometimes wish that the Opposition would recognise the contribution and the sacrifice made by the trade union movement in dealing with the problem of inflation. I wish that some of the people round the business lunches that we have heard about had made the same contribution as the trade union movement in accepting a pay policy. But one thing is certain. There will be no pay policy if we cut into such matters as food subsidies. If we want the kind of pay policy which will help in the battle against inflation, the right proposal is to achieve a higher level of food subsidies rather than a lower level.<br/>
The trade union movement is not a selfish organisation. It has taken a lead in fighting for increased pensions for old people. It recognises the problems of poor families, quite apart from reflecting its own individual trade union members, and it has been defensive for society over the past few difficult years.<br/>
Therefore, I welcome this increase. I hope that the Government will look again at the level and at the linking, which has been lacking, between this and an

intelligent food and agricultural policy for our country.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Renfrew-shire. West (Mr. Buchan) gave the impression that there was a cleavage between the two sides of the House about whether we supported food subsidies. It is clear from the speeches of both Front Bench spokesmen that that is not the issue between the parties officially. The only issue is whether subsidies should be phased out rather more speedily than the Government propose.<br/>
I was disappointed that the Minister did not try to justify the subsidies in food price terms or even in social terms. I hope that before the debate ends he will answer a few questions about how things are going.<br/>
I was glad to hear my hon. Friend the Member for Gloucester (Mrs. Oppenheim) emphasise in a sympathetic manner the way in which rising food prices are causing immense hardship. Having listened to the Minister tonight, I was surprised to re-read an answer I received from him on 27th May. I asked him how much food prices had gone up in the 18 months before the October 1974 General Election and how much they had gone up since. His Answer conflicted with what he said tonight.<br/>
The information which I was given was that seasonal foodstuffs had risen 14 per cent. in price in the 18 months before the election and 81 per cent. since. That is a very dramatic increase. Non-seasonal foods went up by 28 per cent. in price in the 18 months before the election and by 34 per cent. since then. So the Minister was wrong in saying that this Government brought in food subsidies because prices were rising dangerously before the 1974 election. On the basis of his own figures, they has risen a great deal more since then.<br/>
I hope we shall have an indication from the Minister of how he sees food prices going over the next year. All the information that I can gather from those of my farming friends who are still my friends and from other sources is that food prices will rocket over the next year. If we take together the effect of inflation,


the effect of our transition to the Common Market, which has been a lot more than the famous 1 per cent. about which we used to be told, and the effects of the green pound, there is no doubt that food prices will rise substantially in the next year.<br/>
As the Minister said, and as the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West repeated, poor people will be harmed if we do away with part of the subsidies. But has any attempt been made to discover whether rising food prices have resulted in a change in the diet of the average family? I am not thinking of working-class, middle-class or upper-class families. I am thinking of changes in people's diets. If a survey were carried out, I think we should see that there has been a dramatic change. We see evidence of it in our local shops. Only last week I was at the butcher's when a lady wanted to buy five lamb chops. She was told that they were 74p each. She said she could not afford to buy them, and she bought some wretched cold meat instead.<br/>
I am sure that that is happening throughout the country. People are changing their diets. I hope that the Government will sponsor a survey to find out whether eating habits are being changed. All the stories I have heard indicate that people are cutting down on buying good food and meat, and instead are buying a lot of rubbish, such as pies and cakes. I think it is high time, now that food prices are soaring, for the Government to undertake a survey.<br/>
We have heard from the Opposition Front Bench that we Conservatives would do away with indiscriminate subsidies and give them only to those in need. But we are in danger of creating a real social nightmare. Just as inflation and the Common Market have caused a prices nightmare, if we go ahead with subsidising those most allegedly in need we shall cause a social nightmare. Those who are at the lowest end of the scale are entitled to more and more benefits. More and more people are finding that it is simply not worth while to work because of the massive tax burden and rising fares to work. [<i>Interruption</i>.] Labour Members may laugh, but there are many people who, because of controls on wages, rising fares and high taxation, say that it is not worth while working. There is a very real danger that if we keep on putting

more and more subsidies for a limited group of people who are allegedly specially in need, and if we make this burden payable by those earning wages, we shall create a great nightmare.<br/>
Is it really worth while going ahead with subsidies of limited effect? We have a ludicrous situation in which we are paying so much money into agriculture within the EEC when more and more food is being provided to go towards more mountains at prices which no one can afford. It is monstrous that we should be haggling about 5p a pound on tea or 6p or 7p a pound on butter more food being produced in every country within the EEC, in order to produce more expensive surpluses. We are simply tilting at windmills when we talk about these small subsidies which the Government are going to phase out.<br/>
The problem is that families are finding it more and more difficult to pay the prices they have to pay for decent food. Whether the figure is &#x00A3;300 million or &#x00A3;500 million as in the Order will make very little difference unless we tackle this monstrous situation in which a lot of money goes towards encouraging farmers to produce more and more food which we cannot afford to buy.</p>

<p>I congratulate the Government on coming forward to increase the food subsidies because I think that this is essential at present.<br/>
In this country since the end of the war we have pursued a cheap food policy. Tonight we are talking about subsidising the consumer, but for many years we subsidised the farmer without hearing any objections from Opposition Members. We did this in order to obtain food far more cheaply than was possible in other countries. The common agricultural policy has had a disastrous effect upon food prices in this country. If we are to remain in the EEC, we must completely revise that policy. It seeks to harmonise prices in this country with those on the Continent, and continental prices are based on the inefficient farming methods of the rest of the Common Market.<br/>
We on the Labour side have supported policies initiated by Tom Williams


and carried on by successive Governments under which the farmer was subsidised. The farmer operated an efficient system and the housewife enjoyed the benefits of cheap food. The Government must try to safeguard the housewife now from the high food prices which are inevitable in the EEC.<br/>
The TUC special congress will meet on Wednesday. We hope that it will deliver the goods and carry through the policy of restraint on personal incomes for a further 12 months. One of our major problems is inflation, and pay restraint is a vital element in the fight against it. The Conservatives tried a statutory incomes policy and it failed miserably. That led to the February 1974 General Election. [<i>Interruption</i>.] It is a pity that those who have been speculating over sterling have not shown the same patriotism as that which will be displayed on Wednesday at the TUC.<br/>
Food subsidies are a part of the social contract. If the workers are to be expected to exercise restraint over their pay increases, it is incumbent upon the Government to pursue policies that will restrain price rises. The Opposition can speculate about how many pence per week the subsidies are worth to families. A few pence may not mean much to the Tories, but to the family which must watch every penny the subsidies are an important factor.<br/>
The Government are right to seek to increase the amount in the Order. Food subsidies are part of the wider strategy with which the Government are succeeding. If we can get a change in or abandonment of the CAP and a return to the policy of cheaper food, things will improve. In the meantime, let us support the Government on food subsidies. In that way we can encourage the trade unions to support the lead given by the TUC and back the incomes restraint which will get us out of the inflationary spiral.</p>

<p>Inevitably some of the debate has gone over ground that we have covered before on this subject, but it has reinforced our view that food subsidies are of little or no use in the fight against inflation. My hon. Friend the Member for Gloucester (Mrs. Oppenheim) made

our position quite clear. We think that these food subsidies ought to be phased out more quickly than the Government are intending and more quickly than the Government have announced in their public expenditure plans.<br/>
I was a little puzzled by the attitude of the Under-Secretary of State when he expressed some sympathy with and interest in the idea of extending and prolonging food subsidies when, of course, the Government have made clear in the Public Expenditure White Paper their intention to phase out subsidies. Let us hear nothing from the Under-Secretary about hon. Members on this side of the House trying to face two ways at once, because that is precisely what he is trying to do tonight.<br/>
We believe that a figure of &#x00A3;300 million rather than &#x00A3;500 million would be a realistic figure under the Order. That would halve the rate of subsidy next year.<br/>
The Conservative Opposition have made it clear that there are a number of objections to the principle of food subsidies. The first is the distortion which may be caused by lowering the price of subsidised foods relative to other goods. We have seen the problem of the consumption of margarine relative to the consumption of butter. We have seen the Secretary of State herself admitting the over-consumption of cheese, and she has had to reduce the subsidy by 2p per 1b as from 25th June this year. There is also the possibility that food subsidies may lead to increased imports of some particular foods. That has led to rumours on the Continent of Danish and Dutch farmers erecting statues to the Secretary of State because they see the benefit to them and their exports of food subsidies.<br/>
Our second main objection to food subsidies is a public expenditure one. It is well known that the Conservative Opposition feel that the level of public spending, and the level of borrowing, is too high and that this is putting our economic situation at enormous risk. It is one thing to borrow enormous sums of money for investment; it is quite another thing to borrow enormous sums of money simply to finance consumption. That is what we are doing at the moment, and that is how we are living beyond our means.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman's interjection about borrowing in the private sector has very little to do with borrowing by the Government and borrowing in the public sector. Indeed, it is the size of the borrowing in the public sector that has put enormous pressure on the private sector and has endangered jobs and the standard of living.<br/>

<p>As the Minister is well aware, we are talking about food subsidies. Here we are giving a specific example, with specific figures, of where public expenditure would be cut. Hon. Members cannot say, as they do so often, that this would lead to unemployment. Here we have an example of where public expenditure could be cut back quickly without any effect whatsoever on employment.<br/>
Furthermore, as my hon. Friend the Member for Gloucester has emphasised, if the Government took a firm line on public expenditure it could lead to a strengthening of the pound, and that could dwarf the effect of subsidies on the Retail Price Index. We saw in March that the pound slipped by 5 per cent. in one week That has a larger effect on the RPI than food subsidies have in a whole year. Since the beginning of the year we have seen the pound slip by an amount which over the next 12 months will add about 4 per cent. to the RPI, again dwarfing anything that could happen through subsidies.<br/>
Let hon. Members opposite realise, if they are prepared to face up to the need to cut public expenditure to put our national finances in order and pursue policies that could strengthen the pound, that that will have a much more dramatic effect upon the RPI than any fiddling around with subsidies.<br/>
The third reason why we reject the food subsidies is that they have nothing to do with overcoming the problem of inflation.<br/>
To doctor the Retail Price Index is merely to tinker around with the symptoms. It has nothing to do with the real underlying causes of inflation. All the money poured into food subsidies&#x2014;&#x00A3;1,000 million&#x2014;cannot prevent the price of food continuing to rise. The &#x00A3;1,000 million has not prevented all foods going up by 54 per cent. in price since the present Government came to office. The subsidy on milk has not prevented its price going up by over 54 per cent. The subsidy on cheese has not prevented the price going up by 56 per cent. The subsidy has not prevented fresh foods going up in price by 60 per cent. All of this, too, is dwarfed by the fact that since the present Government came to power the Retail Price Index has gone up by over 50 per cent.<br/>
Hon. Members opposite say&#x2014;and the Under-Secretary said it again tonight&#x2014;that inflation is now coming down, that we shall be back on course and we shall get down to single figure inflation possibly by the end of the year. If that is the case, it has nothing to do with &#x00BE;p per person per week on the tea subsidy. It has nothing to do with &#x00BC;p per person per week on the flour subsidy. That is not why inflation is coming down. The reason why inflation is coming down is the depth of the recession and the fear of unemployment.</p>

<p>The whole tenor of the hon. Gentleman's speech during the past five minutes has been against food subsidies. Could he explain&#x2014;nobody on the Benches opposite has done so yet&#x2014;why hon. Members opposite are prepared to spend &#x00A3;300 million more on food subsidies and not the &#x00A3;500 million that the Government are proposing? Are they not facing both ways at once?</p>

<p>I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman has just come into the Chamber, but the position has been explained several times. We have always said that subsidies should be phased out rather than cut out immediately. We are against food subsidies in principle, but we recognise that the adjustment has to be made gradually. That seems to me to be an overwhelmingly reasonable and sensible approach to take.<br/>
The fourth and last reason why we are against food subsidies is that they are an extremely inefficient and ineffective way


of helping the poorer members of the community. They are like buckshot. A lot of it simply misses the target. They are indiscriminate subsidies which go to help tourists visiting the country, businessmen dining, property developers at l'Ecu de France eating imported cheese. It is a totally indiscriminate subsidy.<br/>
I have no doubt that the Under-Secretary would choose to single out a different list of people. He would choose to single out one-parent families, low-paid workers and a whole lot of other similarly selective cases, all of whom are no doubt getting tired of being trotted out for every bogus piece of social justice.<br/>
The fact is that more help should be given to the needy in other ways. The Chancellor of the Exchequer told us that, although the subsidising of bread could undoubtedly help the millionaires, if any millionaire felt guilty about it he could send a donation. It is not millionaires who should feel guilty about wasting money. It is the Government who have connived at this scandalous misuse of public money.<br/>
We have had the scrapping of the Child Benefit Scheme. The hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) said that by harping on cash benefits and saying that the money could be used in other ways we were favouring a return to the means-test State. But there are many benefits which could be improved with this money and which would not involve a means test. Subsidies are indiscriminate in their help. Something like 52 per cent. of the population gets 50 per cent. of the benefit of food subsidies. In 1975, when food subsidies were costing just over &#x00A3;500 million, we were told by the Secretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protection that for less than half that amount&#x2014;&#x00A3;160 million&#x2014;one could have given a social security benefit which would have provided the same amount in cash as we have been given much more expensively through food subsidies.<br/>
The hon. Member for Cannock (Mr. Roberts) justified and supported food subsidies on the ground that they were redistributive. I do not know whether he saw the article which appeared in <i>New Society</i> in January 1975 by Mr. Ritson, of Reading University, who argued that a large part of food subsidies

was going to the middle- and upper middle-income groups. He said that those earning between &#x00A3;41 and &#x00A3;70 a week were receiving about &#x00A3;200 million&#x2014;</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman says that they paid taxes. We know from the Chancellor of the Exchequer's Budget Statement in late 1975 that food subsidies were financed out of indirect taxes. That is not my claim. That was the right hon. Gentleman's claim. He told us that it was necessary to put up indirect taxes to maintain the food subisidies. That is why food subsidies are such a pious fraud. Those who benefit from them are those who have to pay for them. They are financed largely out of levies on cigarettes, beer and tobacco. That is why less than one-quarter of the benefit is going to low-income families.<br/>
We cannot go on with the level of public spending that we have. We cannot go on with the level of borrowing that we have. Unless this House is prepared to face reality, reality will face it soon. It will face it with the growing lack of confidence of our creditors and in our currency. Food subsidies are not an effective way of helping the worse-off. They are not an instrument of social justice. They are not an instrument for defeating inflation. They simply contribute to our overspending and over-borrowing. For that reason they make our economic situation even more dangerous and precarious than it is. I urge my hon. Friends to vote against the Order.</p>

<p>With the leave of the House, I should like to say that this debate has highlighted yet again the Opposition's complete failure to come to terms with the realities of economic inflation. The speech by the hon. Member for Kingston-upon-Thames (Mr. Lamont) encapsulated the paucity of thinking that the Opposition have demonstrated from the beginning on this matter. It does not matter what policy


the Government produce&#x2014;whether it be a tightening of the Price Code or the introduction of the Price Check Scheme&#x2014;the Opposition oppose it. When we bring forward measures to enable consumers to have better advice about their purchases in the shops so that they know whether they have been getting value for money, the Opposition oppose it.<br/>
The hon. Member for Gloucester (Mrs. Oppenheim) refused to go to the opening of the consumer advice centre in Gloucester yesterday. [<i>Interruption</i>.]</p>

<p>The hon. Lady has made clear her opposition to consumer advice centres by her refusal to be present at the opening of the centre in Gloucester, which was reported in the Press. [<i>Interruption</i>.] I think that the hon. Lady accepted the invitation and then withdrew. It appears that on that matter, as on other matters, she was facing two ways.<br/>
The hon. Member for Gloucester attacked my right hon. Friend for not opening the debate. The hon. Lady has been in the House long enough to know that Orders of this kind are normally introduced by junior Ministers, and it indicates petulance on her part to suggest that there should be a departure from normal procedure.<br/>
The hon. Lady devalues these debates, which are important and raise issues of principle and public expenditure, by slinging around the Chamber accusations of cheating, fraud and dishonesty. It adds nothing to the quality of the debate that the hon. Lady should choose to use this sort of language.</p>

<p>Does my hon. Friend realise that the whole House is fed up with both side. By a majority of two-thirds the people of the United Kingdom, knowing what they were doing, were prepared to vote, amongst other things, to go into the European Community, knowing that that would increase food prices. Here we are, wasting public expenditure which could be better spent on old-age pensions or other benefits.

The hon. Member for Gloucester (Mrs. Oppenheim), the hon. Member for Kingston-upon-Thames (Mr. Lamont), the Secretary of State and the Under-Secretary have never mentioned this.</p>

<p>I have some sympathy with my hon. Friend's irritation, which is not surprising. Perhaps I can give him a lift home afterwards and have a chat with him about it.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) properly identified the issue raised by the debate. He at least was prepared to confront the issues of principle involved in the Government's policy, to support them and to ask whether it was appropriate to run down food subsidies at the rate adumbrated in the White Paper. The case for the rundown of food subsidies to the extent outlined in the White Paper can be made out in terms of the other social benefits that have been introduced and that were not available at the time food subsidies were brought forward, and in terms of the Government's success in moderating the rise in the cost of living.</p>

<p>No, I cannot give way. I have too many points to make.<br/>
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor), in a thoughtful speech, questioned the policy of his Front Bench in promoting the case for selective assistance to the less well off. I was not clear from his speech whether he was advocating no help at all to the needy or was on this occasion backing the Government in continuing the food subsidy programme, which we consider meritorious because it does not lead to the sort of problems he described.<br/>
The hon. Member for Cathcart asked for a progress report on how the country was doing in the battle against inflation. We can take encouragement from the trends now clearly established. We have had eight months of decline in the rate of inflation, month by month. We have seen improvements in the food index which are particularly relevant and encouraging in the context of this debate. The food index in respect of all items, including seasonal foods, has been seriously distorted in the last few months


by the potato shortage, but even in respect of the food index including seasonal foods there is some encouragement to be taken from the fact that from December the rate has fallen, on a year-on-year basis, from 26 per cent, to 19&#x00B7;9 per cent. in April.<br/>
In respect of the food index&#x2014;less seasonal foods&#x2014;the picture is encouraging. It shows a steady decline from the peak month in June, when it stood at 29&#x00B7;1 per cent., to April, where it was as low as 13&#x00B7;8 per cent. This marks genuine progress in the Government's battle against inflation and gives us reason to believe that we are on course towards the target which the Chancellor has set.<br/>
Today, the wholesale price indices have been announced. Here again there are some grounds for encouragement. It is known that the picture on the output side has been encouraging for a number of months. The change in the index for all manufactured products measured over a 12-month period has now fallen for 12 successive months. The figure fell from 15&#x00B7;8 per cent. for April to 14&#x00B7;6 per cent. for May. In respect of the input prices, again we can note a distinctive improvement this month over last&#x2014;</p>

<p>I shall not give way to the hon. Lady. Other Opposition Members made more constructive speeches than that of the hon. Lady, and they deserve an answer. The hon. Lady asked for the facts. These are the facts. The facts are that this Government's policy to beat inflation is working and is being seen to work. If the hon. Member for Kingston-upon-Thames thinks that food subsidies, the Price Check Scheme, the Price Code, the consumer advice centres, and the price comparison schemes conducted by local authorities, have noth-

ing to do with it, he will convince very few people.</p>

<p>No. I shall not give way. This country is succeeding and it is succeeding because the people of the country are determined that we shall succeed in beating inflation. This time last year, when the policy of wage restraint was being debated by the trade unions, the scepticism voiced by hon. Members opposite about the success of that policy was tangible. We have heard similar but somewhat less sceptical comments this time. I venture to prophesy&#x2014;I agree that it is dangerous&#x2014;that we shall achieve the targets we have set ourselves, and in achieving those targets the policy that we have chosen, of sub. sidising food that constitutes an import. ant part of diet of the less well off, about whom the hon. Member for Kingston-upon-Thames felt is merely appropriate to joke, is important. The hon. Member has belittled, as have other hon. Members opposite, the value of the food subsidies. At present, they are worth 5&#x00B7;4 points on the food index&#x2014;not a negligible amount. To a typical family of father, mother and two children, they are worth 65p per week&#x2014;not a negligible amount. They are worth 39p to an old-age pensioner couple&#x2014;not a negligible amount.<br/>
In bringing forward suggestions as to alternative priorities for further social expenditure, it is a mistake to underrate the value of the role and acceptability of food subsidies.</p>

<p>I am grateful to have the chance of catching your eye, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I am sorry that the Minister was unable to give way, for I was awaiting the clarion call of his commitment to the phasing-out of food subsidies on time according to the programme. It has been noticeable in the debate that there is a vast difference of view among hon. Members on the Government Benches on the question whether the policy of discontinuing food subsidies is to be adhered to. Hon. Members below the Gangway who are fundamentally concerned with social engineering&#x2014;including the hon. Member for Cannock (Mr. Roberts), with his


nutritional interest in the tea subsidy&#x2014;take a different view from that of the Government, and I respect it.<br/>
The Under-Secretary of State failed to demonstrate that the case for continuing subsidies at this level has to be made on exceptional grounds. The hon. Gentleman will surely understand&#x2014;the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) has an interest in means-tested benefits&#x2014;that the whole country is going through a means-tested benefit in this case.</p>

<p>I am grateful for the confirmation that there is to be no attempt by the Government to accept the arguments from their own side that there should be an increase in food subsidies. We obviously agree with that proposition.<br/>
The hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West argued about means-tested benefits. The country is experiencing the greatest crisis of all time. When we discuss the expenditure of items such as &#x00A3;500 million on food subsidies the only question that we must ask ourselves is that which my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston-upon-Thames (Mr. Lamont) asked &#x2014;namely, are we justified in the present state of Government expenditure and borrowing? We have to say that there are no reasons for justifying it. Not one reason has been advanced. We know that a proportion goes to the poor families on low incomes and to pensioners&#x2014;</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. In the motion that you have called we are asked to consider petitions of general objection and the question whether they are to be referred to a Joint Committee. Those petitions are not available. How on earth are we to decide what the documents contain if we are unable to read them?<br/>
The Clerks of the House have done a very fine service, because I understand that they have placed the petitions in the small room behind Mr. Speaker's Chair. However, if all my colleagues were to pour into that room to read those petitions, it would not result in a very good debate. The movers of the motion have not had the courtesy to provide right hon. and hon. Members with copies of the documents that they want us to debate. In those circumstances, are we to proceed with this debate?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-06-14a.239.3" hansard_membership_id="6551" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/16559" speakername="Mr. Deputy Speaker" colnum="239" time="">
<p>I am advised that copies of the document were in the Private Bill Office, had inquiries been made there.</p>

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Do I take it that this is private business? I would judge from what you say about the petitions being available only in the Private Bill Office that the business we are now to discuss is private business.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-06-14a.239.5" hansard_membership_id="6551" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/16559" speakername="Mr. Deputy Speaker" colnum="239" time="">
<p>In matters of this nature the documents are normally to be found in the Private Bill Office.</p>

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. It is most inconvenient for Members to be able to read the documents only in the Private Bill Office. Normally copies of any documents that we are called upon to debate are placed in the Vote Office and we are able to take them away to study before the debate.</p>

<p>The normal procedure that it adopted in a case such as this has been adopted. The documents have been available and, had precautions been taken by those who wanted to read

them, they would surely have looked for them in good time, rather than a moment or two before the debate started.</p>

<p>There is no indication that it is private business. This is the procedure that I am advised is always adopted under this Act.</p>

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. If this is not private business I think we are entitled to ask the Leader of the House to make sure that documents are available, so that the House may carry out its proper procedures.</p>

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Like my right hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil (Mr. Peyton), many of my hon. Friends would be grateful if you could tell the House whether this is private or public business. Surely it must be one or the other&#x2014;unless it is another hybrid piece of business.</p>

<p>Is it not a fact that on 13th February 1968 a similar procedure


to that being adopted tonight was used when the Order under discussion was the Humber Harbour Order?

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I am not objecting to the procedure. In fact, the precedent has been mentioned, and I find that I was a Teller on that occasion.

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I am sure you will agree that we are in some difficulty. Whether it is public business or private business, and whether the documents should or should not have been available in the Vote Office or elsewhere&#x2014;you have been good enough to tell us that they are now placed in a small room somewhere behind your chair&#x2014;I think that anyone taking an interest in this matter will understand that a number of petitions are involved. Anyone who has been in this place for more than five minutes will know that a petition is a long and complicated legal document. I am sure that you would, agree, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that whatever sort of debate we are to have, and whatever the result is to be, it must be without more confusion than is necessary. There are four or five petitions and one of them is in Welsh&#x2014;that of Mr. Ednyfed Austyn Prys&#x2014;which may involve us in some translation. I hope that that will not delay us unduly. Surely the best

way out of the undoubted difficulty in which we find ourselves is to adjourn the House so that those of us who are becoming increasingly suspicious about the matter have the chance to study the documents in question before we proceed any further.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. A map is referred to in the Order, a copy of which is apparently deposited in Cardiff and in the offices of the Blaenau-Gwent council. However, I find that no copy of the map has been deposited in this place. We wish to give proper and full consideration to the matters referred to in the Order, and one of the matters to be considered will be the precise areas geographically to be acquired for industrial development. I respectfully suggest that it will be quite impossible for the House to give proper consideration to the matter unless we have a chance to view the map. I ask for your advice and direction on this matter.</p>

<p>I beg to move,
<q>That the Petitions of General Objection of Mr. William John Williams, Mr. W. G. Rowland and others, Mr. H. Bennett and others, Mr. Ednyfed Austyn Prys and others, and Mr. E. J. Thomas and others, against the Blaenau-Gwent District (Rassau North Industrial Estate) Compulsory Purchase Order 1974 be not referred to a Joint Committee.</q>
I trust that the sort of behaviour that we have seen from the Opposition is not indicative of the way in which they will listen to what I have to say, which involves serious matters affecting large numbers of people in the county of Gwent.<br/>
The first point that I make is that this is a power that this House seldom exercises but that it is proper to do so where


the petitions raise important questions of principle and Government policy.<br/>
Since there seems to be some misunderstanding on the part of the Opposition, I shall spell it out. I move this motion on the authority of Section 1(4) of the Statutory Orders (Special Procedure) Act 1965, which reads:
<q>A petition of general objection shall under Section 4(2) of the Act stand referred to a joint committee of both Houses unless either House of Parliament has&#x2026;resolved that it be not so resolved.</q>
The short history of this matter is set out in the first paragraph of the first petitioner's petition, which was deposited in the Private Bill Office on 4th May 1976. It reads:
<q>An order entitled the Blaenau-Gwent District (Rassau North Industrial Estate) Compulsory Purchase Order 1974 was confirmed by the Secretary of State for Wales on the second day of March 1976 under Section 112 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1971 following a public local inquiry held in the Civic Centre, Ebbw Vale, from 29th July to 5th August 1975. On the same date the Secretary of State for Wales gave consent under Section 22 of the Commons Act 1899 to the grant of enclosure of 234 acres of land at Rassau Common for the purposes of its development as an industrial estate.</q>
That Order was laid before this House on 14th April 1975 by the Secretary of State pursuant to the Statutory Orders (Special Procedure) Acts 1945 and 1965. The effect of the Order is to authorise the Blaenau-Gwent Borough Council to purchase compulsorily about 356 acres of land for the purpose of developing it for industrial purposes as an estate to be known as the Rassau North Industrial Estate.<br/>
I hope that Opposition Members are now fully seized of the facts of this motion.<br/>
It has to be said&#x2014;and I say it with some measure of regret&#x2014;that the inspector's findings were, to say the least, capricious and eccentric, and that the conclusions to which he came ran counter to the evidence adduced before him and, indeed, almost all the views that have ever been expressed on the questions of priorities, industrially and otherwise, for North Gwent. It was quite plain to anyone who read those findings in his report &#x2014;and Opposition Members can still have their opportunity if they so wish&#x2014;</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Surely the hon. and learned Gentleman wishes to help the House. He has made it quite clear that he thinks that we should have an opportunity to consult the documents from which he is quoting so liberally. We are back where we started. If we are to reply to what he is saying and to deploy a case of any merit, we need time. He says that we can still consult these documents, but what can be the good of doing that if the House has already voted to disallow these unfortunate people to put their case? Surely this is the time to give us an interval in which we can study this matter before we proceed any further.</p>

<p>I want to get away from these bogus points of order and get on with the debate. There is a very important matter of principle involved here, and I hope that Opposition Members will be able to contain themselves for a little longer.<br/>
It is important to spell out one or two matters. There can be no doubt whatever that important matters of principle and Government policy are involved here. Government policy is affected of course in the matters pursued by the council to meet unemployment in Wales in general and in Blaenau-Gwent district in particular.<br/>
We have set up a Welsh Development Agency, a Manpower Services Commission, a Training Services Agency, and an Employment Services Agency, and we have passed the Employment Protection Act. Also, &#x00A3;12&#x00B7;6 million was given by the Government to the borough council at the time of the Beswick announcement.<br/>
The Secretary of State has made it plain that, and I quote:
<q>The special arrangements made for Ebbw Vale, both financial and administrative, are a prime example of how the Government has taken the lead in the industrial sphere. Ebbw Vale is my greatest problem.</q>
[<i>Interruption</i>.] If Opposition Members were among the 2,000 men unemployed in Ebbw Vale they would not find the matter so amusing. In view of the growing unemployment situation in North Gwent it is our view that it is grossly irresponsible for the petitioners to seek to pursue the matter further. They have certainly cast their net wide in seeking signatories for their petition, because some of the signatories come not from Ebbw Vale or Blaenau-Gwent but from places like Wakefield and Wembley.</p>

<p>Does the hon. Member, in all honesty, not agree that the great majority of signatories came from the immediate locality?

<p>No. The position is clear. The site must be developed at the first possible opportunity, because the matter has been protracted since before 1974. The original compulsory purchase order was made in 1964 and the development can afford to wait no longer. The size of the site and the facilities of the ground combine to give it qualities possessed by no other site in the area.<br/>
In a letter to the town clerk of Blaenau-Gwent my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said that considerations affecting the economic factors were of overriding significance in this case. Land for industrial development was needed at once, and in view of the imminence of the remaining stages of the Ebbw Vale closures he was of the opinion that the provision of additional land and its development was of such urgency that consideration of the feasibility of developing alternative sites, with the long delay that that would entail, would not be justified.<br/>
Let me spell out the exact position in North Gwent. Seventy-four per cent. of those employed in the Ebbw Vale exchange area are employed in the steel industry. Ninety per cent. of those live in the Blaenau-Gwent district. Between 1951 and 1974 the population of Ebbw Vale itself fell by over 5,500. Against this background the loss of 4,500 jobs in the British Steel Corporation between


1975 and 1978 assumes even graver importance and significance. In March this year the number of persons unemployed in the county was 12,400&#x2014;an increase of 80 per cent over the year. [HON. MEMBERS: "Disgraceful."] Hon. Members say "Disgraceful", but it is a fact that these proposals were initiated by the last Tory Government. [HON. MEMBERS: "Your Government."] In fact we undertook to investigate them and review them. As a result we had the Beswick Report. Hon. Gentlemen should not simply call out "Your Government"; it was their Government who initiated these proposals-<br/>
An increase of 80 per cent. in unemployment in Ebbw Vale over the last 12 months means that the unemployment rates are well above the national average. It is increasing more rapidly in Gwent than in Wales or Great Britain as a whole. In Ebbw Vale the labour force has already fallen by some 2,300 since October 1973. A further 2,000 may go by March 1978. On the basis of the comparison between the number of vacancies and the number of persons unemployed the ratio of vacancies to unemployed increased from 1 to 8 in March 1975 to 1 to 25 in March 1976.<br/>
Finally, may I ask the Opposition whether they are really prepared to put in jeopardy the prospect of 5,000 jobs? That is the reality of what we are debating in this motion. If they vote against the motion the people of North Gwent certainly will never forgive them, because the Conservative Opposition will be seen as the party which pays lip service to the doctrine of employment but which, when confronted with the opportunity of a cheap procedural victory, places in peril the future of whole communities in Gwent. I ask the House to approve the motion.</p>

<p>What could have been a reasonable and informative debate has put us in an impossible position by our not having the documents that we are debating. The hon. and learned Member for Abertillery (Mr. Thomas) has based his case on petitions that we have not got before us and quotations from the report of the inspector who held the public inquiry, which report we also have not got before

us. It puts the House in an almost impossible position to debate this Order properly. Indeed, we do not even know the area covered by the Order.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. If the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) took time to look in "Erskine May" he would discover, as he ought to know from his vast experience of this House, that this House is, in fact, not able to go into the details of what the inspector said or did, because it is a departmental matter.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-06-14a.248.1" hansard_membership_id="7490" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/32714" speakername="Mr. Page" colnum="248" time="">
<p>It is very strange that the hon. and learned Gentleman now tells us that we are not allowed to go into the details, when he was quoting from the petition and from the report of the inspector. The purpose of the special procedure under which this Order is made is to provide a simpler form of local legislation for matters that would normally have to be dealt with by a Private Bill, and also to expedite by secondary legislation the application locally of principles that have already been laid down in primary legislation.<br/>
In the case of this Order, therefore, there has, as the House now knows, been a local public inquiry. That local public inquiry has resulted in a report, which I wish all of us could have read. That report recommended that the compulsory purchase order should not be confirmed. The hon. and learned Gentleman has taken upon himself to say that that report was capricious&#x2014;and I thought he said it in a rather pompous manner. It was the report of an inspector who had heard the facts of the case, had come to his conclusions, and had made his report and his recommendations to the Secretary of State. Nevertheless, the Secretary of State has made this Order against those recommendations.<br/>
Under the procedure there follows a 21-day period in which petitions can be put before this House. When those petitions are presented, the Chairman of Ways and Means and the Chairman of Committees of another place are charged with the duty of deciding whether those petitions are petitions for amendment or petitions of general objection. In this case the Chairmen, in their wisdom, have decided that these petitions are petitions of general objection.<br/>
As I said before, I have no complaint about the procedure. The procedure is that this House can say that these petitions of general objection shall not go to a Joint Committee and nothing more shall be done about them. It is not merely a matter of saying "They shall not go to a Joint Committee. We shall consider them in the House." The hon. and learned Gentleman has said that we cannot go into the details of those petitions here and now. We can never go into the details of those petitions if this motion is passed tognight. Those petitions are thrown into the dustbin.<br/>
These petitions are from hundreds of people whose lands are affected. Although the Chairman quite correctly decided that they were petitions of general objection, because they contained material that went to the root of the Order, they also contain material that amounted to a plea by individuals that their land was being taken unnecessarily.<br/>
It is true that the procedure allows the House to prevent those petitions going to a Joint Committee, but the House ought to be very careful in denying to individuals a right that was given them by statute to bring this kind of petition to the House. This seems to me to be a very simple point. Are we going to deprive those people of the right to put their case to a Joint Committee merely because, in their petitions, they have also said that the whole of the Order is unnecessary and ought not to be made?<br/>
If the motion is defeated, it means a delay of no more than six to eight weeks. There is no need for any further delay than that. The Order was made in 1974 Are we to deprive many individuals of their right to put their cases about their land being taken away from them, because it will take another six weeks? This matter has already taken two years.<br/>
This matter ought never to have been brought before the House in this manner. The hon. and learned Member for Abertillery let the cat out of the bag, in effect, by saying that he was frightened that the Joint Committee might return to what the inspector recommended to the Secretary of State.<br/>
I hope that my right hon. and hon. Friends will vote against this motion, which defeats the right of individuals to

protect themselves by petition before this House.</p>

<p>I presume to speak on this matter because, having had some responsibility for planning at the Department of the Environment, it has fallen to me from time to time to consider the reports of inspectors following public local inquiries. I understand that in this case the inspector had before him numerous witnesses and a large amount of documentary material. The inspector, having considered the matter in detail, arrived at a particular conclusion&#x2014;that the compulsory purchase order should not be made.<br/>
As my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) suggested, it is frequently the case that a Minister will, on advice, disagree with the findings of his inspector. No doubt in this instance the Secretary of State had his reasons for arriving at that decision. But the hon. and learned Member for Abertillery (Mr. Thomas) gave no indication whatsoever of the reasons that may have led the Secretary of State to overrule his inspector in this matter. The hon. and learned Gentleman simply clouded the issue.<br/>
There were three very unusual features in the hon. and learned Gentleman's speech. I hope that I shall have the attention of the Secretary of State when I put them to him. First, it seems extraordinary that in this matter, which concerns land&#x2014;</p>

<p>I shall complete this point and then give way to the hon. and learned Gentleman. I understand that almost all this land lies within the constituency of Lord President of the Council, the right hon. Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Foot). In short, he ought to have accepted the responsibility for explaining to this House what is happening in the area that he represents. Instead, he has hidden behind the inadequate shadow of the hon. and learned Member for Abertillery.<br/>
The first question to which the House is entitled to an answer is: why did the right hon. Gentleman not deal with this matter in his own constituency and come clean with the House about what is going


on there? I now give way to the hon. and learned Gentleman.</p>

<p>Talking of shadows, the Shadow Cabinet like shadows come and like shadows depart.<br/>
I should like to answer the hon. Gentleman's last point first. My constituency is within the Blaenau-Gwent borough boundary. I was born in part of that district which is actually called Bleunau-Gwent, and was brought up in that constituency. What is more, I worked in Ebbw Vale for long periods. Therefore, I feel quite adequate to deal with questions relating to the Blaenau-Gwent district.<br/>
In answer to the hon. Gentleman's first point, I referred to what the Secretary of State said in answer to the inspector's report. I quoted from a letter&#x2014;the hon. Gentleman would have heard of it if he had been listening instead of making a noise&#x2014;which my right hon. and learned Friend wrote to the town clerk of Blaenau-Gwent, dated 3rd March 1976.</p>

<p>The hon. and learned Gentleman has merely succeeded in clouding the issue still further. I return to the question that I put. Nearly all the land in question is within the constituency of the right hon. Member for Ebbw Vale. He owes it to the House to explain why he is overrulling his inspector's decision and proposing that a Joint Committee of Parliament should have no opportunity to consider the matter. In short, the Lord President is saying that he shall be judge and jury and decide that the House, shall have no opportunity to consider the matter.<br/>
The hon. and learned Member for Abertillery described the judgment of the inspector as being capricious and eccentric, and said that the inspector misdirected himself. These are grave charges to be made against a public servant who has no opportunity to defend himself either in the House or in any other place. The hon. and learned Gentleman will know that if he had used those words outside the House he could easily have found himself the object of a suit for damages. If he uses those words in the House he owes it to the House to give the evidence upon which he bases those serious comments, but he has not done that. He is traducing the inspector, on whom the

Secretary of State from time to time must reply, but he has not given the House the evidence on which he bases those accusations.<br/>
The hon. and learned Gentleman used extraordinary language to justify his case. He said that the Joint Committee might come to a different conclusion from that of the Secretary of State. When there was objection from the Opposition Benches, he went on to say that he was not saying that this would necessarily be the case, but was just telling the House what would happen. Out of his own mouth he confirmed the impression that the Opposition had formed, that if the Joint Committee, objectively weighing the evidence, had been able to study the matter in detail it might have come to the same conclusion as that of the inspector. That is the heart of the problem.</p>

Therefore, it does not fall within the Standing Order that you have quoted to exempt it from Standing Order No. 1. That being the case, our proceedings at this moment are <i>ultra vires</i>. Surely we can occupy ourselves better than by indulging in <i>ultra vires</i> proceedings.</p>

<p>I apologise for intervening in the observations of the "Official Solicitor" to the official Opposition in these matters. I want briefly to make three more points. Many other of my hon. Friends wish to speak.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman alleged that if the House did not accept this Order, 5,000 jobs would be put at risk. He has no basis in fact for saying that. All that is 'at issue tonight is whether or not is Joint Committee should consider the proposal. The hon. Gentleman must be implying that if a Joint Committee, objectively considering the matter, were to come to a different conclusion from that of the Secretary of State, that of itself would mean the loss of 5,000 jobs. Is that not a most extraordinary charge? Is it really suggested by the hon. Gentleman that this House has so little concern for the employment of his or the Lord President of the Council's constituents that it would lightly put that at risk? Surely the whole point about a Joint Committee is that it is perfectly capable of weighing all the evidence, taking account of planning and environmental considerations, of questions of equity and justice in respect of taking peoples land away from them compulsorily, of the national interest, and

of the Government's policy. These are matters that a Joint Committee is preeminently suited to consider.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman has no right and no basis in fact for suggesting that a Joint Committee of this House would be incapable of weighing those matters and arriving at a balanced conclusion. Therefore, I believe that the hon. Gentleman's blackmailing suggestion, that if this House does not agree with the way the Secretary of State wants it that would put 5,000 jobs at risk, is not the language of Parliament. It is the language of the Reichstag. The hon. Gentleman has no right to level that kind of accusation against a Joint Committee that is perfectly capable of arriving at a sound conclusion.<br/>
The basic objection that I have to the hon. and learned Gentleman's speech and the support that he appears to get from the Government arises wholly from the suggestion that it is inadmissible to put this matter to a Joint Committee, because it might arrive at a different conclusion from that of the Leader of the House. On many occasions in the past the House has arrived at different conclusions from those of the right hon. Gentleman, and there will be many future occasions&#x2014;and he knows it. Nothing should go out from this House to suggest that where the House disagrees with the right hon. Gentleman it is the House that is wrong and he who is right. That is an inadmissible proposition to put before Parliament.<br/>
Whether or not the examiners, in considering these petitions, have come to the conclusion that they should be regarded not as petitions for amendment but as petition of general recovery, I take it that they are seeking to give other than general objections that may be levelled on policy grounds&#x2014;those objections that might arise, for example, from local authorities or statutory bodies&#x2014;and are incorporating within those objections a number of private objections.<br/>
What is being done, therefore&#x2014;I hesitate to use the word, but the very term "general objection" implies it means a certain hybridity, in that there are private as well as public objections to be considered. What the House is in practice doing, if this proposition is accepted, is saying that, because Government policy


deems otherwise, the private rights incorporated within a general objection shall have no effect and shall not even be considered. That is inequitable, unjust, and something that I am surprised that the hon. and learned Gentleman has commended to us.<br/>
I put three questions to the right hon. Gentleman&#x2014;I was about to say not to the monkey but to the organ grinder. First, in respect of this land, what is it that is going on in Ebbw Vale that he is trying to hide? He should tell the House. Secondly, why is he frightened of putting the matter to a Joint Committee? Has he no confidence in such a Committee, on which, I suppose, the Government would have a majority?<br/>
Finally, why has the right hon. Gentleman lent his name to abusing the House, as the hon. and learned Gentleman did, in suggesting that the House would have so little care for the people of this area as cavalierly to say that there shall be no jobs, no further employment, when he knows that the House and a Joint Committee are perfectly capable of considering these matters and arriving at a better conclusion than that of the Secretary of State himself?</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I have now had an opportunity of studying Standing Order No. 3(1)(<i>b</i>), and I find that it is quite clear that we are not engaged in a matter pursuant to the Act that you mentioned. Pursuant to the Act, these petitions would go to a Select Committee. What we are doing, if anything at all&#x2014;which I beg leave to doubt&#x2014;is endeavouring to evade the Act. That cannot be described as a proceeding pursuant to the Act. By no stretch of the imagination can a motion to evade the Act be constructed as a proceeding pursuant to the Act.<br/>
What the hon Member for Abertillery (Mr. Thomas)&#x2014;who is believed to be learned, although I have not checked that fact&#x2014;is endeavouring to do is to go outside the provisions of the Act. It was open to the Government to put down a suspension motion, with due notice, on the Order Paper, so that the House could proceed with business that falls outside Standing Order No. 3 after 10 o'clock. They simply did not do so.<br/>
The Secretary of State was, perhaps, hoping that the Lord President would move it, the Lord President was, perhaps hoping that the Prime Minister would move it and the Prime Minister was hoping that the Whip on duty would move it. That did not happen. We are engaged in <i>ultra vires</i> action, and it is an unprofitable way of spending the time of the House.</p>

<p>Perhaps the House will allow me to say what I have to say. Hon. Members will recognise the importance of the matter for my constituency and neighbouring constituencies, whatever are the rights and wrongs of the issue. I have no right to question the manner in which hon. Members have raised the matter in the House.<br/>
I hope that the House will listen to what I have to say for a few minutes because the issue involves serious human problems. I have nothing to hide, and I hope that I can explain why the motion appears today and why it was moved.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) referred to the occasion in 1968 when there was a similar debate. He voted with the minority on that occasion and he then put a case similar to that which he presented to the House tonight. I respect his view on that aspect of the matter. Of course, it is serious when the rights of petitioners are overborne in any way. That is a serious proposition and it is right that the House should carefully consider it.<br/>
As the right hon. Member for Crosby indicated, there are occasions when, according to the arrangements of the House as accepted in the past, it is believed right and advisable that the House should resort to this method of dealing with the problem. That does not in any sense mean that we are ignoring or


deriding the rights of petitioners. I therefore accept what the hon. Member for Crosby said on that aspect, although I do not agree with his conclusion, as hon. Members did not agree with his conclusion in 1968.<br/>
I shall now refer to the document and the events in Ebbw Vale and surrounding areas which gave rise to tonight's occasion. First, there is the question of the date of the Order&#x2014;1974. The matter goes back further than that, to the decision by the previous Government when the British Steel Corporation drew up its plan for the strategy of the whole British steel industry. Included in that plan was a proposal for closing the heavy end of the steelworks at Ebbw Vale involving the running down of between 4,000 and 5,000 jobs. About 10,000 were employed at that time. It was proposed to cut by half over a period of year the total employed there.<br/>
That proposal was recommended to the House by the right hon. Member for Worcester (Mr. Walker) on behalf of the then Conservative Government sometime in 1973. He then came to Ebbw Vale and stated the Government's case for their acceptance of the corporation's strategy, which involved a transformation in the employment situation at Ebbw Vale on a scale proposed for no other section of the steel industry.<br/>
We were to be the first on the list to which the changed system of producing steel was to be applied. As the Government then acknowledged, and as we acknowledged, those proposals involved serious economic and social changes for the whole area. We modified that plan under the BSC's proposals. We promised that we should have a fresh investigation into the plan. but in the main we accepted the corporation's proposals, which had been approved by the previous Government, as they applied to Ebbw Vale, although we knew that they involved extremely serious unemployment problems, or at any rate changes in the employment provisions that had to be made in Ebbw Vale.<br/>
In order to provide the alternative employment, which was the policy of both the previous Government and this Government, we had to have surveys of

the whole area to see where we should be able to build new factories to provide for the 5,000 people who would lose their jobs in a small community over the period between 1975 and 1980. Those surveys started in 1973, when they were initiated by the corporation in concert with the local authorities and the previous Government. Discussions took place, and the first examinations occurred.<br/>
Right from those early times there were two main sites which were possible for the provision of factories, one of which is known as Tafanarbach which is already being developed. Five or six new factories are being built there which will provide work for getting on for 1,000 people when they are fully occupied. But it was already seen in 1973 that if there was to be a proper change over in the steel industry&#x2014;and the test of the whole strategy for a change in the steel industry was whether one could carry out the change in a peaceful, successful, intelligent and humane manner&#x2014;we had also to discover other areas in which we could provide for factories to be built.<br/>
One of those areas was the Rassau site, which features in the Order. In 1974 the local authority went ahead with the backing of everybody in the community, as we thought&#x2014;certainly the whole of the council, the British Steel Corporation and the Government. We went ahead to try to see how we could provide the new factories to give the jobs to the people who would be thrown out of the heavy end of the steelworks. We had hoped&#x2014;certainly everybody working to try to ensure that we could carry out these changes in a civilised way hoped&#x2014;that we should be able to start doing the work on the Rassau site, the drainage and the rest, way back in 1974.<br/>
But objections were made, as they were entitled to be made, by people living in the area&#x2014;commoners and others. There was argument in the community about the matter. Overwhelmingly the community accepted the fact that we must have the jobs, otherwise Ebbw Vale would not survive at all. The view of the elected representatives was that we should have Rassau as an essential site if we were to be able to provide employment for our people on a proper scale.<br/>
All through 1974 we hoped that we would be able to do so. In 1975 we


eventually established a public inquiry according to the provisions of the Act. We were impatient because people were already beginning to lose jobs at Ebbw Vale. We had not the assurance of alternative employment on anything like the scale required in the years ahead. In 1975, however, the inquiry took place and it went into these matters in great detail. All the representations were made at that inquiry.<br/>
I do not comment about the inspector, but many of us in Ebbw Vale were astounded at the outcome of the inspector's report. [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."] I am merely stating the facts of the matter. However, there is a provision in the legislation under which these matters can go to the Secretary of State for Wales and in other cases, no doubt, to the Secretary of State for Scotland or other Secretaries of State, whereby they are able to form their own judgment and make their own decision. They act in a quasi-judicial capacity. That was what happened here.<br/>
The Secretary of State for Wales examined the matter, and he took six months to do so. He undertook that task with great care and sympathy. What happened was that after six months from the end of July until before December&#x2014;the period may have been five rather than six months&#x2014;the Secretary of State eventually made his decision, in which he said that the compulsory purchase order should go ahead.<br/>
We in Ebbw Vale who were responsible for trying to provide alternative employment thought that there would be no further obstacle. But in 1975 and at the beginning of 1976 we were still unable to proceed with the work.</p>

<p>What puzzles me is this. If the Government require this matter to be voted on tonight to avoid further delay, why was there delay between August 1975 when the public inquiry finished to the time in March 1976 when the Order was confirmed? If they had meant to counter the delay, it could have been done within that period of six months.</p>

<p>During the bulk of that period the most detailed consideration was given to the representations by my

right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Wales. He also gave detailed consideration to all the representations made by the petitioners and others, and obviously all matters were taken into account when he came to his decision. He came to a conclusion according to the provisions of the Act. The Act says that the Secretary of State can make such decisions, and that was what has happened in this case. The reason, no doubt, why the Secretary of State reached that decision lies in the overriding importance of trying to ensure that we provide employment for the people there as an alternative to the steelworks that are being run down.<br/>
It was on that basis that we proceeded. Now we come to the proposition that the matter should be held up again. One reason why I believe that the House is right, in the interests of the employment of the people of Ebbw Vale, to accept this motion is that after this period we have the right to say that there should be no more delay. Every month's delay, certainly every few months' delay, will make it all the more difficult to get the factories&#x2014;to get the work done on the drainage and sewerage, for example, and to get all the preparations carried out for putting the site in working order. What is of paramount importance for us in Ebbw Vale is that the Rassau site should be in operation if we are to be able to provide for our people.<br/>
It is also a possibility, and I face it&#x2014;I do not cast any reflection upon what a Joint Committee of Parliament might say&#x2014;that this House will decide that it has the right to make a decision too. That was what happened in 1968. This House can say "We believe that this is a matter of such supreme importance that we can make a decision." That is what we are saying to the House today, and that is the conclusion that the Secretary of State for Wales reached after long consideration.<br/>
I hope very much that the House will think carefully before accepting the advice of those who would try to reject the motion. The House would do itself great injury if it were to say&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh!"] People look to this House&#x2014;</p>

Before the House decides to reject the Order, I trust that it will think carefully about the whole of the background and consider all the consequences. If the Opposition are not interested in the people of Ebbw Vale, they might at least be interested in what is to happen to the steel industry, which is of paramount importance for us all. If there is to be a successful steel industry, there have to be great changes in it. Those changes will be carried through successfully only if we are able to provide alternative employment in other new industries when there is a rundown in a part of the steel industry. If we are to have new industries, we must have places where we can build them. We in Ebbw Vale have been fighting for three years to try to get places to build the factories, and we are being told that the opportunity is to be denied to us. If the House of Commons denies us the means to live, it will be a bad day for the House.</p>

<p>I had no intention of speaking in the debate until I listened to the hon. and learned Member for Abertillery (Mr. Thomas) and the Leader of the House. I am totally appalled by the arguments they have advanced. As I understand it, they say that there is a need for industrial development&#x2014;that is accepted. They say that people have individual private lives, and that is accepted.<br/>
There is a system called a means of inquiry. Under that procedure there is an inquiry, and the inspector finds in favour of the individual and the rights of the individual as against public demand for development. The Secretary of State, as he is entitled to do, but presumably having considered those rights, decides to overrule the inspector. That happens, but the system allows for objectors to take their case to a Joint Committee of the House.<br/>
The hon. and learned Gentleman&#x2014;I ask him to think about this in his capacity as a lawyer&#x2014;has the effrontery to argue before the House that the justification of doing away with that process is that the objectors' case is such that they might win before the impartial Joint Committee. That, with respect, was what he said. It is not a delay of six weeks or eight weeks that concerns the hon. and learned Gentleman; it is the fear that


the Joint Committee, an independent body, might come down on the same side as the independent inspector against the view of the Secretary of State. I must say that that is a principle which I find abhorrent.<br/>
From time to time I battle with the hon. and learned Member for Abertillery in the courts. I ask him to tell the House what is the difference between that which he is arguing and saying to a man who has been convicted by a court of a criminal offence and who has, under the authority of the law, a right of appeal "You shall not be allowed that right of appeal because you might win." I ask the House to consider the principle in that proposal.</p>

<p>I begin by saying that I endorse every word just uttered by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Runcorn (Mr. Carlisle).<br/>
The Leader of the House started his speech quietly. However, towards the close of his remarks he was forced to reveal the poverty of his case by relying on the allegation that no one on these Opposition Benches cared for those who lived in Ebbw Vale or for the British steel industry. That was very poor.<br/>
There is no need for me to go into the facts at any length. They are well enough known. An inspector's report has been rejected by the Secretary of State, who had six months in which to do it, and now Parliament is to be denied six or eight weeks in which to consider the very real points of view of the petitioners.<br/>
We were told by the hon. and learned Member for Abertillery (Mr. Thomas) that the inspector seemed to be "capricious and eccentric". I do not think I have ever heard an inspector described in those words before, especially in the presence of a Minister who did not see fit to qualify that view. Nor have we been told whether the inspector whose findings were so loosely dismissed as "capricious and eccentric" is still employed on such duties. It would be interesting now to hear from the Secretary of State for Wales whether that inspector is still being employed in those duties.</p>

<p>The right hon. and learned Gentleman has done his best with that question. He has acknowledged clearly that there is no official complaint against the inspector. In other words, the remark which was so central to the case made by the hon. and learned Member for Abertillery was wholly bogus and unfounded.<br/>
The hon. and learned Member went on to say that the reason for the motion was that Government policy was being frustrated. If that is so, I wonder why we did not have a Minister moving the motion from the start instead of its being put on the Order Paper under the disguise of the name of the hon. and learned Member for Abertillery, who, putting it very politely, did not make a very good job of moving it.<br/>
The hon. and learned Gentleman then said that it was grossly irresponsible of the petitioners to pursue their rights. That is a remark which should be enshrined in one of the nastier pages of the parliamentary record. I do not recall ever having heard anyone say in this House that it was grossly irresponsible for anyone to pursue the rights which the law has conferred upon him&#x2014;although I fear that this sort of thing is becoming more commonplace in our experience this summer. The hon. and learned Member went on to say that a Joint Committee could come to a different conclusion from that of the Secretary of State.</p>

<p>I wrote the words down as the hon. and learned Member said them, and I shall be very interested to compare them in due course with those in the <i>Official Report</i>. The words I


wrote down were "A Joint Committee could come to a different conclusion from the Secretary of State".<br/>
We on this side of the House do not share that total confidence in the judgment of Ministers when they are sitting in their own cause. I am bound to say that this case causes us considerable anxiety. We are told that the matter cannot wait. The inspector's report, in paragraph 114, gives a finding of fact that other sites are at present available. They have not been developed and are not being developed. The Leader of the House shakes his head. If this is really untrue, it would appear again that the inspector's findings of fact, and not simply opinions, are being challenged by Ministers. I do not believe that that is the case. At least, the right hon. Gentleman does not appear to be pressing his disagreement.</p>

<p>There are other sites immediately available, according to paragraph 114 of the inspector's report, but they are not being developed.<br/>
We are also told that 5,000 jobs are in jeopardy and that we on this side of the House would prefer to see those jobs in peril in order to enjoy a cheap procedural victory. But we have had not a shred of evidence to suggest that 5,000 jobs are in jeopardy, and I do not think the right hon. Gentleman is entitled in a flood of oratory to overlook the facts and overlook his duty to produce to Parliament some evidence upon which we may make a decision. I endorse what was said by my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) and my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Eldon Griffiths).<br/>
My right hon. Friend was sharply told that he could not go into details. That</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-06-14a.266.0" colnum="266" time="">
<p>seemed a very strange piece of advice to the House of Commons. I do not need to prolong my remarks. The Leader of the House referred to the extremely serious human problems in the steel industry today, but he did not give one shred of evidence as to the urgency of the matter or why the tackling of these problems would be in any way breached by allowing Parliament itself the opportunity to give the petitioners their full rights. We have simply not been told why the matter is urgent. We have merely had the reiteration of Ministers' views that it is, and that is inadequate.</p>

<p>The hon. and learned Gentleman said that a Joint Committee might come to a conclusion different from that of the Secretary of State. That means that he could not rely upon the Committee to reach the conclusion that he and the Secretary of State wanted it to arrive at.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman has not dealt either with the availability of other sites and Parliament is, therefore, wholly unable to judge this issue. I am sure that the House would wish to come to a decision on this matter, and I am sure that it will do so with what I am about to say in mind. Even in this day and age the rights of individuals are not lightly to be overridden, and certainly not merely for the purpose of vindicating the judgment of a Minister who helped himself to six months but will not give Parliament six weeks.</p>

<p>Oil production in the North Sea now spreads over 50,000 square miles. There are 22 platforms in position and a further 27 under production, and 25 oil rigs. To this must be added the numerous gas production platforms, together with associated offshore and onshore equipment and installations. Not only this, but of course production is expanding in the North Sea and elsewhere, and we shall soon have to consider protection in the Irish Sea, the Celtic Sea and the South-West Approaches.<br/>
We were told optimistically last week, as was reported in the Press, that in the 1980s Britain's oil revenues in one year will repay the whole of the vast sums of money which the Government have already borrowed. I hope this proves true, as there will clearly be a change of Government in the near future, and if it were not for this the future Conservative Administration would have great difficulty in rescuing this debt-ridden country. Be that as it may, we can all agree that in the next decade North Sea oil and gas will be vital to Britain in a world where

violence is on the upsurge. The question, therefore, is: how is this oil to be defended?<br/>
I suggest that we should take three different threats. I take them in the reverse order of probability: first, defence in war; secondly, defence in time of tension or limited war; and, thirdly, defence against guerrilla activities.<br/>
First, in time of war, it has already been agreed that NATO will take over responsibility for the whole area. The planning and responsibility would presumably fall within the area of CINCLANT, who wears both a NATO and a Royal Naval hat. Therefore, communications, command, control and the necessary on-call forces will be available and the problem will be wholly military.<br/>
I turn, therefore, to the time of tension or limited war. It seems to me almost inevitable that any period of serious tension or limited war would involve NATO. Therefore, the defence arrangements required would be such as to serve as a prelude to war. The most difficult period appears to be the change-over from a peace situation, in which other countries may or may not be involved, to war-time defence operations by NATO. The main requirements would therefore seem to be a good crisis management and much the same command and control arrangements and communications as in time of peace.<br/>
I will therefore concentrate most of my remarks on the third alternative&#x2014;the peace-time protection of the oil and gas fields against threats from guerrilla organisations. These threats could include sabotage by employees or infiltrators; the seizure of a rig or platform by a terrorist organisation, by sea or by air, designed to put pressure on the Government, to exercise blackmail, or to achieve the


maximum publicity for the particular cause which those people represent; and, finally, underwater attack on the legs of the platforms or rigs by frogman or midget submarine.<br/>
Any such attack, as has been pointed out by Mr. Roy Corlett in that excellent magazine <i>Defence</i>, can be most cost-effective. These attacks are comparatively easy and could be very effective.<br/>
I will give two examples which were given by Mr. Corlett in his article. He claims that the false telephone call which suggested that there was a charge on a rig on 25th May last year probably cost the country &#x00A3;250,000. He goes on to say that if two large charges or mines with delayed action or radio-activated fuses, which could cost about &#x00A3;5,000, were dropped near a platform, the cost of the disruption caused could amount to &#x00A3;500,000 a day. One can see from that the kind of threat which can be posed by a small operation.<br/>
Mr. Corlett also points out that there are on average 50 Soviet intelligence-gathering trawlers operating round our coasts and that any one of these could lay a mine without the slightest risk of being caught in the act. He ends by quoting the editors of <i>Jane's Weapon Systems</i>:
<q>In Britain, in so far as is possible to discern a consistent theme in the defence politics of recent years, it would seem to amount to a determination to be taken by surprise whatever happens".</q>
I would only remark that perhaps the cod war is a case in point.<br/>
As regards Government plans, at a Government conference held in Whitehall about two years ago the peace-time defence of the oil rigs was said to be the responsibility of the Chief Constable of Aberdeen. How he was to exercise that responsibility was far from clear. Presumably the Home Office is the Department mainly involved, though clearly a number of other Departments have responsibilities. Collectively, they are called "the civil power", which can request the assistance of the defence services if the situation appears to be getting out of hand.<br/>
The hon. Member for Huddersfield, East (Mr. Mallalieu), in the Navy Estimates debate, spoke of his dissatisfaction with the organisation of the defence of

the oil fields, and raised certain questions which have not been answered. There is in my mind a general confusion as to ministerial responsibility, and that is one of the main issues I wish to put to the Minister.<br/>
In the event of an incident on a rig, who is responsible for taking action at each stage? Is it, on the rig, the oil company or the police? Which Minister is responsible at this stage? There must be one Minister in overall charge. Who is he? Who then decides to call in the Armed Forces?<br/>
Once the Armed Forces have been called in, which Minister is responsible? Is it the same Minister or the Secretary of State for Defence? Once the Armed Forces are given the task, the command and control structure becomes clearer. I understand that Flag Officer Scotland and Northern Ireland at Rosyth takes responsibility from his integrated headquarters. Does the headquarters have a police liaison officer attached to it? What forces does it have under immediate command, as rapid reaction to the seizure of a rig is essential? Presumably, these forces at the moment include HMS "Jura" and HMS "Reward", certain Royal Marine Commandos and helicopters?<br/>
I understand that the four vessels of the "Kingfisher" class are designed for fishery protection, and that the five vessels of the "Island" class will be used for oil rig protection. These latter vessels have a speed of 16 knots, which is suitable only for the "police on the beat", but I understand that they are to be fitted with helicopter pads. Will the Minister please confirm that? The Expenditure Committee has already expressed doubt about the value of these vessels.<br/>
It seems to me that it would have been much better had the Government purchased&#x2014;perhaps they will consider this&#x2014;some of our distant-water trawlers, which are fine modern vessels, made redundant by the Government's recent capitulation to Iceland. These vessels are strong, they are designed for operation in Arctic waters and could be fitted with helicopter pads. They could be used for fishery and oil rig protection while the Government concentrated on building vessels which would be required for fast reaction forces, such as the 24-knot Mexican "Azteca" class, or their faster


follow-up vessels, which I referred to in the Navy Estimates debate. They would allow immediate reaction on the part of Royal Marine Commandos or whatever forces are called in. There is also the possibility of the use of the new type of hyrofoil now being developed for use in rough waters. If an oil rig is captured, the chances are that helicopters will not be able to land and fast vessels will be essential for quick reaction.<br/>
Reconnaissance will be of great importance as the oil areas extend to other seas, particularly when our fishery limits are extended to 200 miles, as I hope they will be next year. Nimrods and Vulcans will, I hope, be available in sufficient numbers, but it is no good our having this information and intelligence unless we are able to react to it.<br/>
I come now to the oil companies. There is the question of the security of the rigs and platforms. This is, presumably, the responsibility of the companies. What are they doing? To put it another way, what are the Government encouraging them to do? The Government now have a very large stake in the oil companies and therefore they have the power.<br/>
The owner's responsibility should include the screening of personnel, restriction and protection of entry points. protection devices such as internal television, security guards, communications to the security forces, control of supply ships, floodlights, radar/sonar, nets, barbed wire, acoustic equipment and other devices.<br/>
I do not believe that nearly enough is being done in this field. The Government must take responsibility for insisting on the maximum protection being provided for each rig or platform. After all, the oil companies could be held up for several millions of pounds in blackmail or ransom. They should, therefore, spend some of their own money on their own protection. The same applies to shore installations, but that is a different problem which I shall not develop now.<br/>
My last point concerns international co-operation. Clearly, the best and most cost-effective form of protection can be obtained by international co-operation between the nations involved in North Sea oil and gas&#x2014;Norway being the country most concerned, but also con-

cerned are Denmark, Holland, Belgium, Germany and France. All are members of NATO, and there are, therefore, great advantages in co-operationg in peace-time protection through NATO in terms of crisis management, communications, joint operations, exercises and so on. I appreciate that some countries, such as Denmark and France, are not keen on this peace-time co-operation for political reasons. But at least we could start with close co-operation with Norway on joint patrols and exercises, and other countries could join in later.<br/>
It would be expensive to create a new system of communications in a time of tension or change-over to a war situation. It would be far easier if the maximum use were made of the existing system in peace time.<br/>
I sum up by asking the Minister five questions. Have the Government put any responsibility on the oil companies to install protective devices on their platforms and rigs? If not, why not? Second, by 1977 there will be a requirement for joint oil rig and fisheries protection, air-sea rescue and pollution control. Have we the necessary ships and aircraft for these tasks? Third, will the Government consider the provision of fast ships for quick reactions forces? If not, why not? Fourth, there have been three meetings of North Sea countries to consider peace-time co-operation, the last on 2nd June, 1976. What progress has been made and what systems of co-operation are envisaged? Finally, what is the sequence of responsibility for dealing with an escalating incident by the civil administration and then by the Services? Above all, which Ministers are directly responsible?<br/>
Clearly, the details of our defence preparations should remain secret but I believe that there is some public disquiet. That is why I tried to sum up with these questions. If the Minister cannot answer them all tonight I hope he will write to me. I believe that they should be cleared up and that they can be cleared up.</p>

<p>I shall not detain the House for more than a few minutes but I wish to widen the debate slightly and take up something which was touched


upon by the hon. Member for Haltemprice (Mr. Wall). He mentioned those vital two words "cod war". Both he and I feel somewhat unhappy about the events which led to its conclusion. Not only will our offshore gas and oil installations need to be safeguarded but so also will the whole of the North Sea fisheries. We shall be faced with immensely increased fisheries jurisdiction.<br/>
There is no doubt that, following the new limits which are bound to come after the Law of the Sea Conference&#x2014;whether it be 200 miles, 50 miles or a wavy line about our shores&#x2014;many more vessels will be needed and there will be a much heavier load for the all-weather patrols beyond this narrow sense relating the oil and gas installations which we have been talking about. Magnificent work was done by the Royal Navy during the cod war but there is no doubt that frigates are not the best vessels in very bad weather. We saw that in the Icelandic dispute.<br/>
I want to say as a Humberside MP that Hull fishing trawlers are operating in the filthiest conditions, sometimes force 6, 7 or 8 gales. They have specially shaped hulls. They sit on the water like ducks and are much more stable than possibly some naval vessels in bad weather. Many vessels laid up in the Humber at this moment could perhaps&#x2014;and I say no more than that&#x2014;be utilized in the larger naval protection squadron or fleet that will be needed so badly in the years to come. I believe that the Select Committee on Defence suggested this not many months ago. It specifically advised this might be looked at. I hope my hon. Friend can say something about that.<br/>
Secondly, the NATO forces are basically there to function in war time. They are defence forces for Western Europe against some unspecified opponent, possibly in Eastern longtitudes. But what about peace time? NATO is a military alliance which is much wider than the EEC. Indeed, it goes as far as Turkey. To many people, including myself, the North Sea is looked upon as a Community fish pond.<br/>
In my view, NATO Powers must co-operate in future much more fully in protecting their interests in the North Sea than they are doing through the com-

mon fisheries policy, the common agricultural policy and so on. But if our hearts and minds, not only tonight but constantly, are governed by logic, why not an international force for the North Sea joined together for peace-time purposes?<br/>
I understand that there was a meeting in Oslo not long ago on the initiative of the Dutch Minister of Defence. Can my hon. Friend say something about that, and whether it is possible in peace time to have more co-operation in the North Sea than we have now? We shall need it, particularly for fisheries duties. If we were ever to exhaust the supplies of fish in the North Sea, Heaven help us.</p>

<p>It is just over a year since the House devoted time specifically to the subject of protecting North Sea oil. No doubt the hon. Member for Haltemprice (Mr. Wall) and other hon. Members recall the previous debate, and no doubt also, like me, they have cast an eye over the <i>Official Report</i> for 23rd May last year.<br/>
In reading my predecessor's remarks, I was struck by the fact that not so very long ago he began by observing that, while the security of the North Sea oil and gas installations attracted a good deal of attention, it also unfortunately gave rise to a good deal of misunderstanding. I am pleased to note from tonight's debate that those areas of misunderstanding are beginning to diminish, and I congratulate the hon. Member for Haltemprice on the efforts he has made, both as the general rapporteur of the Military Committee of the North Atlantic Assembly and in the House, to throw light on the subject.<br/>
I read with great interest the extracts from his status report to the Military Committee last year, which were published in a recent volume of the journal <i>NATO's Fifteen Nations</i>, and I have listened with admiration to his speech tonight, as I did in the Navy debate. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving me this first opportunity to describe the matter as I see it, and, in doing so, I hope to cast a little more light on the areas of uncertainty which remain.<br/>
First, let me briefly sketch in the background. When the Labour Government entered office in 1974, we were immediately concerned to safeguard the country's maritime interests, and it rapidly became clear that the offshore oil and gas reserves, and, indeed, the increased fisheries jurisdiction which was in prospect in the slightly longer term, were of prime and growing importance to the country's economy.<br/>
We saw an extension of the Armed Services' traditional peace-time roles in support of the civil authorities as the best way of meeting the requirement to safeguard these interests, but whereas in the past the Armed Services had been asked to carry out such tasks using only those ships and equipment provided for their primary job of countering external aggression, we decided that additional resources were required for these new and expanding offshore tasks.<br/>
In parentheses, I should stress that, though they are additional, they are, of course, at the same time an integral part of the whole Services inventory.<br/>
We put HM Ships "Jura" and "Reward" to sea in 1975 to patrol the offshore installations, and we also routed other ships and RAF aircraft through the areas. Then, on the basis of a carefully thought-out concept of operations, we ordered five new "Island" class ships, provided for four surveillance aircraft to be allocated, and earmarked a force including Royal Marines, ordnance disposal teams and the required helicopter lift for quick reaction.<br/>
Hon. Members therefore preach to the converted when they underline the importance of the offshore tasks. But I should like to devote a little more time to explaining more fully the concept of operations, since it seems to me that it is misunderstanding of this which prompts suggestions, such as some made by hon. Members tonight, that a different type of ship is required. Firstly, as I know the hon. Member for Haltemprice will be the first to agree, any sensible military strategy is based on the threat which is to be countered. It is not easy to talk about a terrorist threat in public, but I can assure the House that it is kept very much under review. In many ways the threat of accidental

damage is more serious in the North Sea.<br/>
Secondly, the protector has to show the will to protect his assets. Thirdly, he has to dispose his resources to best advantage.<br/>
Our examination of these factors led to our adopting a concept of deterrent sea and air patrols backed by reaction forces. For the deterrent patrol in the Northern Sea areas around the United Kingdom&#x2014;and that, as I well remember, can be the most hostile of sea areas&#x2014;we need to deploy ships and aircraft which are available in all weathers. That is why we have based our deterrent patrols on long-range surveillance aircraft and ships with good sea-keeping qualities which can stay on patrol for extended periods in all weathers. The kind of ship I have described could well be a frigate, since frigates possess admirable sea-keeping and endurance qualities, but I am sure I need not tell the hon. Gentleman that they are very sophisticated and expensive machines for routine patrol work. Therefore, after a thorough search of the market we chose the "Island" class, which, as I said in the recent Navy debate, we believe to be the most suitable and cost-effective ships for the patrolling task involved.</p>

<p>Has the Minister considered the possibility of building less-sophisticated frigates, costing about &#x00A3;20 million rather than the present &#x00A3;40 million, which would be capable of being fitted with more sophisticated equipment later?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-06-14a.278.1" hansard_membership_id="3426" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/14322" speakername="Mr. Duffy" colnum="278" time="">
<p>I am glad to take note of that point and perhaps the hon. Member for Gosport (Mr. Viggers) will permit me to look into it. I shall be in touch with him.<br/>
We have a contingency plan and we exercise regularly. No plans based on deterrence can be seen positively to be successful in the short term, but we have had certain indications of our success. "Jura" and "Reward" have, for instance, been on hand when incidents have occurred on several occasions during the past year. We are learning from our exercises, and we have said that we shall review the arrangements if, in the light of experience, that appears to be desirable.<br/>
Having said that, I must make absolutely clear my view that light displacement fast patrol craft&#x2014;like the Azteca class&#x2014;are not suitable for all-weather patrol in the Northern Sea areas in winter. As the hon. Gentleman knows, the Royal Navy knows something about patrol craft. We know that crew effectiveness declines markedly after a day or two in heavy seas in a fast patrol craft, and the ship has quickly to run for cover. The fisherman, however, in a different shaped hull, goes on fishing in up to force 6 wind conditions and would not ordinarily think about sheltering in less than a force 8. We decided to take a lesson from him, and so the "Island" class design is based on a trawler hull. It will stay at sea long after a patrol craft would have been forced to retire.<br/>
Rapid, accurate and wide-ranging situation reports are provided by the Nimrod aircraft, which can sweep the areas at speed, providing valuable information. When trouble brews the warning may come from these patrols, from the vessels, the installations themselves or from other sources. The Maritime Headquarters at Pitreavie&#x2014;and I cannot stress this too much&#x2014;can then call upon frigates, Sea King helicopters, the Royal Marines and explosive ordnance disposal teams, as required.<br/>
I should like here to underline the role of the Maritime Headquarters at Pitreavie. Those who advocate the creation of a separate command overlook the fact that in Pitreavie the Flag Officer Scotland and Northern Ireland and his RAF counterpart operate ships and aircraft over the relevant areas as part of their routine defence task. It therefore makes absolute sense to operate the offshore resources from the same joint headquarters, which already has close contact with the coastguard, the police, the oil companies and the other authorities involved. Centralisation beyond this would probably be superfluous.<br/>
Now I should like to turn to the question of international co-operation. As the hon. Member for Haltemprice himself pointed out in the recent Navy debate and tonight, in a period of tension or war the oil and gas installations in the NATO area would be defended against attack like any other part of that

area. Britain joins fully in the formulation of NATO plans to this end.<br/>
Now, turning away from the war situation, I should like to take up the question of peace-time international cooperation. It has been suggested that peace-time as well as war-time countermeasures should fall under the NATO umbrella, and, though the arguments in favour of that are, in practical terms attractive, we must be realistic and ask how far the argument really can be taken and to what extent every subject of mutual interest to Europeans or to nations bordering the North Sea should be the concern of NATO. NATO, after all, is regarded by a large proportion of the world as a military alliance. I am very much aware that, as a study of the treaty will show, it is much more than that in our eyes, but we must face the facts.<br/>
It is sometimes difficult to do business&#x2014;and I say this with the very greatest respect to the hon. Member for Haltemprice, who I know contributes enormously to the essential well-being of the Alliance&#x2014;in any forum which is seen to be a military one. The Government, therefore, following the initiative taken by Mr. Vredeling, the Dutch Minister of Defence, announced their intention to pursue their aims of peace-time co-operation in the protection of North Sea oil and gas installations in the forum of an <i>ad hoc</i> non-military grouping named the Regional Conference. The other members of the conference are, as the House is probably aware, Holland, Norway, France, Denmark, Belgium and West Germany, and three full meetings have been held so far&#x2014;in the Hague, in London and, most recently, in Oslo last month. We are satisfied that this provides the most promising way ahead. We accept absolutely that co-operation and co-ordination by the countries bordering the North Sea in solving the problems which occur in this area are essential&#x2014;</p>

<p>If time permits. If not, I shall write to the hon. Gentleman.<br/>
The Secretary of State for Energy is responsible for the safety of oil rigs. The


Home Secretary is responsible for antiterrorist measures. The Secretary of State for Defence can render assistance as required. The Lord Privy Seal is responsible for the co-ordination of all these maritime matters, and procedures have been worked out.<br/>
The oil companies and the Government are in constant touch in considering the physical protection required on the oil rigs in the North Sea. The oil companies are fully aware that they are primarily responsible for the protection of the rigs, and they are given every encouragement to take the necessary protective measures.<br/>
I come to the point about how far trawlers can be taken up from the industry. As the Government made clear in their observations on the Second Report of the Expenditure Committee, we tried

without success to acquire a suitable vessel at a reasonable cost in 1974, when we considered how the interim task of patrolling offshore oil and gas installations could be carried out. In the event, the more satisfactory, rapid and cost-effective solution was to deploy H.M. Ships "Jura" and "Reward". We now have five new ships in build. To take a number of other trawlers, almost inevitably all of different design, out of retirement would not in the short term, we think, prove cost-effective. We are still considering&#x2014;</p>
