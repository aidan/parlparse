<p>It is my policy to encourage the wider availability of freightliner terminals and I have on several occasions pressed my views upon both the National Union of Railwaymen, the Transport and General Workers' Union and the other road transport unions concerned; most recently in my address to the Labour Party Conference.

<p>I do not for one moment accept that we have been unsuccessful in our efforts. The growth in the use of liner trains is most heartening for their future development. There are now 1,000 containers being carried per week compared with 30 in the first week of operation. Six routes are in use compared with one at the start of the scheme. The remaining nine routes of stage one of the network are expected to be introduced next year.</p>

<p>I cannot give the figures, but undoubtedly this decision by the N.U.R. has meant that a large number of additional loads have been carried by the freightliners which would otherwise have gone on our overcrowded roads.</p>

<p>It is not a question of the vested interest of one particular union. We are proceeding to expand the use of these freightliner terminals. British Road Services are now using the Glasgow route and hope to use the Aberdeen

<p>Twenty-two workshops of various sizes have been closed since 1962, because they were surplus to the current needs of British Railways. Their policy is to sell them or adapt them to a new railway use. A general direction is unnecessary.</p>

<p>Is my hon. Friend aware that the railway workshop in my constituency was one of the first to be closed by the party opposite when in office? It is now standing empty and derelict, and it is ugly.

<p>I know of the workshop to which my hon. Friend refers. It was closed on 30th June, 1964, and there has been a two-year delay in selling it, because the developer had to get planning consent, and there were difficulties about access, because part of his plan was to let it in sections.

<p>One reason for the delay is that when the freightliner project was approved by the right hon.

<p>I say in all seriousness to the House that, if we are all united in wanting to make a success of these freightliners and to proceed to their expanding use by industry as a whole, it would be wise to allow the agreements to proceed as they are doing step by step.

<p>Am I to understand from that reply and from the White Paper generally that the Minister has closed her mind completely to the creation of a separate waterways trust on the lines submitted to her by responsible bodies, including the Parliamentary Inland Waterways Group?

Board or its successor and the security of tenure to be granted will be considered carefully before final decisions are made?</p>

<p>As regards the trust referred to by my hon. Friend, my right hon. Friend has set out her intentions fairly clearly in the White Paper. It is not her intention to have a separate trust.

The size of the network and the security of tenure are matters, obviously, which will be raised in the course of the consultations.</p>

<p>I did not make any such statement in New York. I said, and I stand by it, and indeed I have said it in other places repeatedly, that it is essential for us to consider whether we need to go further than the parking controls which were introduced by the previous Conservative Administration.

<p>In reply to the first part of my hon. Friend's question, I would point out that parking fees are a form of licensing by wealth. The alternative to control by that kind of pricing is administrative control. I would prefer this&#x2014;and I agree with my hon. Friend&#x2014;but it raises enormous practical difficulties. How does one decide which is an essential car, and which is not? This is the simple problem which we have to face. In the meantime, every extension of priced parking control is a form of road pricing.<br/>
With regard to public transport, I have made it clear time and again that we are going to encourage it. For the first time the Government are going to give a capital grant for it.<br/>

<p>Any entry to the Common Market would not affect the method of finance. I agree with my hon. Friend: I would have preferred it to have been financed by public money, but there are so many competing claims upon our resources that it is legitimate to use


private capital for this purpose. With regard to traffic resulting in the southeast of England, I would point out that cross-Channel traffic is increasing anyway and that what we shall have here is rather a diversion of traffic to the tunnel. We are, of course, carefully considering the road consequences.</p>

<p>Would not my right hon. Friend agree that, in London, in view of the G.L.C.'s outline plans for a new primary road network, this is very pressing? Would she also agree that the onus is very much on the G.L.C. and her Ministry to make the case to the public for the routes which are proposed?</p>

<p>I understand that my hon. Friend is now complaining about the choice of routes rather than methods of compensation. I am not quite clear from his supplementary question, but as far as compensation is concerned, obviously any changes would, first of all, be very far reaching and would have to affect other than road schemes, and, second, would create as many anomalies as exist at present.</p>

<p>But does not this illustrate one of the great weaknesses in the whole of the Government's outlook, in that, when the community increases the value of somebody's property, the Government proceed to tax it, but when the community damages somebody's property, the Government do not make proper compensation?</p>

<p>I do not accept that for a moment. In the case of the present law about compensation for the effects of road schemes, it is very difficult to establish the extent to which amenity has been damaged and whether there are not offsetting factors. Various Administrations have looked at this and have found it difficult to solve this problem, however much sympathy one may have with those on whom this kind of disturbance has been inflicted.</p>

<p>I will bear the hon. Gentleman's remarks in mind, but there are of course the difficulties of ensuring

that there is not an undue proliferation of these crossings. In 1951, two-thirds had to be done away with because they were not properly regarded. In the meantime, we have to take proper consultations. Divisional road engineers have to have a proper census. Consultations with the police and, in London, with the G.L.C., have to take place, and this may take from time to time a little longer than usual.</p>

<p>asked the Attorney-General whether he will introduce legislation to amend the Consolidation of Enactments (Procedure) Act, 1949, in order to make it possible in one Act both to consolidate and to enact substantive changes in any aspect of the law.</p>

<p>I do not think it would be appropriate to amend the Act of 1949 as proposed. Consolidation procedure, which eliminates debate on the Floor of either House and in Standing Committee, would not, in my view, be appropriate for enacting substantive changes in the law.</p>

<p>Would not my right hon. and learned Friend agree that it is a woeful failing in the procedures of this House that one cannot revise or consolidate a particular aspect of the law in one Bill? Would it not be comparatively simple to devise a procedure whereby the present Consolidation Committee of the House simply approved certain passages of a combined Bill and said that they did not involve any improvement or change in the law, so that the House could deal with real changes in the law in that subject?</p>

<p>The problem is to balance the necessity for Parliamentary scrutiny over substantive changes in the law with speed and efficiency in proceedings. The Second Reading procedure, which the House has already approved, is being helpful in this matter, but I do not think that I could go quite as far as my hon. Friend has indicated, although I assure him that the matter is kept under review.</p>

<p>The explanation of my Answer is that Section 1(5) of the Law Commissions Act, 1965, excludes from their consideration any law of Northern Ireland which the Parliament of Northern Ireland has power to amend. That Act was passed by Parliament and the Law Commission is circumscribed by it. Accordingly, I fear that the anomaly to which my hon.

<p>With permission, I will now answer Question No. 118.<br/>
I am glad to say that as a result of my discussions with the County Councils Association on my proposal for the establishment of road construction units to strengthen the organisation for the design and construction of major trunk road and motorway schemes, I have agreed with the Association the broad lines on which these units will be set up.

I am grateful for the constructive way they have approached the discussions. The respective staff Associations have also been consulted and have indicated that they accept the broad principles of what we are proposing. There will, of course, be further discussions with them on the detailed arrangements affecting their members.<br/>
At present, trunk road and motorway schemes are carried out either by local authorities acting as my agents or by consulting engineers. This system has been able to handle the road programme so far, but its size and rate of growth are now such that it has become essential to make a better use of the scarce engineer resources available, and to streamline the administrative processes involved. At the same time, I am sure that it is important to preserve, although in a new form, the fruitful partnership between my Department and the county councils that has existed for nearly 30 years.<br/>
Under the new arrangements now agreed I hope eventually to set up six large-scale units to cover between them the whole of England. Within its area each unit will be responsible to me for the preparation, design and supervision of construction on the bulk of the larger trunk road and motorway schemes; questions of planning in the wider sense&#x2014;[<i>Interruption</i>.]</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1966-11-23a.1396.0" hansard_membership_id="10930" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29799" speakername="Mr. Speaker" colnum="1396" time="">
<p>Order. It is very difficult for hon. Members who wish to hear this statement if other hon. Members will talk.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1966-11-23a.1396.1" hansard_membership_id="4880" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2084" speakername="Mrs. Castle" colnum="1396" time="">
<p>Questions of planning in the wider sense, and programming, will remain the responsibility of Ministry headquarters and on these issues county councils as such will continue to participate as appropriate. The units will be jointly manned by Ministry and county council officers.<br/>
Staff allocated by the county councils to the units will work in or from their county offices and will remain for purposes of pay and career prospects members of the county council's staff. They will be under the supervision of the county surveyor, who in this respect, will himself be a part time member of the unit acting under the direction of the head of the unit. I do not expect there to be more


than about three participating counties in each unit area.<br/>
The head of each unit, whether he is appointed from the Ministry or county fields, will become an officer of my Department and will be responsible to me for all the work undertaken by the unit. He will be in full overall control of this work and be the engineer for all contracts: the staff allocated by the county councils will, therefore, work under his direction on all the unit schemes. Ministry engineers will serve within the units both at the working level and in the unit headquarters.<br/>
Because the powers of county councils to allocate staff in this way were open to doubt, the necessary provision is being made in the Local Government Bill, at present in another place.<br/>
All county councils, whether or not they participate in these arrangements, will continue to act as my agents for the smaller trunk road schemes, as well as dealing with their own county roads. Non-participating counties will also be able to keep in close touch with the operation of the units through the membership of an advisory committee&#x2014;</p>

<p>As this new arrangement alters profoundly the present structure in the construction of major road schemes Mr. Speaker, I thought that hon. Members would like to have the details and to have an opportunity of putting questions on them.<br/>
If the maximum benefit is to be derived from the new system it will be essential to place on the head of the unit prime responsibility for progressing schemes quickly and efficiently and to this end I intend that he should be given a high degree of delegated authority. I intend, also, that there shall be a streamlining of existing procedures and, consequently, a saving both in staff and time.<br/>
The system now proposed represents a major change both for my Department and for the county councils. I shall very shortly enter into discussions with the county councils concerned on the setting up of a first unit which, I hope, will be in operation in the early part of next year. As the new system may well need modification in the light of the experience that we gain, I have agreed with the County Councils Association that we will keep its operation under close review.</p>

<p>In congratulating my right hon.

May I also ask&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "Too long."]&#x2014;whether the salaries of the staff of county councils who will be working with these units in county council offices will be entirely paid by county councils, or whether any of the cost will fall on the Ministry of Transport?</p>

<p>On a point of order. I seek your guidance, Mr. Speaker. As


there were about 120 Questions to the Minister of Transport today which have been interfered with by Questions to the Lord President of the Council and to the Attorney-General, in what way can we see that the Minister of Transport answers these vitally important Questions?</p>
</speech>

<p>Order. The question whether one set of Questions interferes with another set is a matter of opinion. Hon.

<p>The answer to the first question is, "No". The six units will cover the south-eastern area, the south-western area, the eastern area, the Midland area, the north-eastern area and the northwestern area. My right hon.

<p>It is one of the purposes of the scheme that the county councils should allocate staff which they have been employing on these major motorway and trunk road schemes to the units so that we can have a greater rationalisation and concentration of essential manpower.</p>

<p>It varies in the sense that in the past either the county councils or the consulting engineers acted as my agents. Some of them had only small

stretches of a scheme to deal with. Now, by concentrating the county councils into these six major regional units and pooling their staff and the staff of my Ministry into the units, we can get a saving of scarce engineers and a better follow-through of schemes.</p>

We have now studied Mr. Smith's reply to the terms for a settlement put forward by the British Government. In spite of some further elucidatory exchanges, I have to tell the House that there remains a very wide gap of principle which would have to be bridged before there could be any settlement which we could honourably commend to Parliament.<br/>
However, the Governor has made an earnest appeal to my right hon. Friend the Commonwealth Secretary to pay a further visit to Salisbury to discuss with him the present critical position. In view of the Governor's courageous stand over the past 12 months, my right hon. Friend has decided that this is right. Accordingly, he proposes to leave tomorrow for a short visit to Salisbury. Should Mr. Smith wish to take the opportunity while my right hon. Friend is in Salisbury to convey any further views to Her Majesty's Government, my right hon.

<p>Yes, Sir. I feel it right that my right hon. Friend should meet the Governor. All of us hope that it will still, even at this late hour, be possible to bridge this gap.

the sense of duty and courage which the Governor has shown in very difficult circumstances should, and probably do, commend themselves in every part of the House and that, therefore, any request from him should be met, if possible?<br/>
Would the Prime Minister further agree that, in view of the six principles which are agreed in every part of the House, and which have never been opposed in the Division Lobbies, and as, for the past six months, Her Majesty's Government have tried to negotiate on the basis of those six principles, if the present talks do not meet with success that will indicate that Mr. Smith is not prepared to call off his rebellion and return to constitutional rule?</p>

<p>I very much agree with what the hon. Gentleman has said about the Governor. I am sure that the whole House agrees with him. When I review what the Governor has had to put up with over the last year in his own country, I am sometimes a little ashamed of the way some Members of the House have shown their support for Mr. Dupont.<br/>
It is quite true that the principles have been accepted by practically the whole of the House, by all parties, and, certainly, I would not be prepared to commend a settlement which was in conflict with those principles, or which failed to give copper-bottomed guarantees that those principles will be carried through.

<p>Will my right hon. Friend tell the House quite clearly how much longer we are to have the continued experience of Ministers trotting off to see the Governor and Mr. Smith while all the time all that is happening is that Mr. Smith and his r&#x00E9;gime are digging themselves more firmly in?

<p>The answer to that question was set out in the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference communiqu&#x00E9;, which was agreed to by all the members of the Commonwealth. My hon. Friend had his answer when that communiqu&#x00E9; was published.<br/>
It is not true that Ministers have been trotting off in the way he suggests. My right hon. Friend&#x2014;this was understood by the whole of the Commonwealth at the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference&#x2014;went to Salisbury to discuss with all sections of Rhodesian opinion the decisions which the Commonwealth had reached. I think that it is absolutely right, as the Leader of the Opposition has said, that my right hon. Friend should accede to this request from the Governor.<br/>
If Mr. Smith seeks the opportunity of my right hon. Friend's visit to put new proposals to him which show that he is, even at this late stage, prepared to accept the six principles, and to convert them into reality, no one will be happier than my right hon. Friend.</p>

<p>I shall be very happy to meet Mr. Smith or any other Prime Minister of Rhodesia when Rhodesia has returned to constitutional rule. I am very grateful to the hon. Gentleman for conveying at this late stage his good wishes to my right hon. Friend, because on his last visit my right hon. Friend was made painfully aware of the extent to which Mr. Smith has been encouraged in the view he has taken and in his doubts about the resolution of this Government and this House by some of the remarks addressed to him by unofficial visitors from this House who claim to speak for more than themselves.</p>

<p>Since Mr. Smith does hold these views, and since he is an unrepentant racialist, what is the use of this continual dickering with him? Is it not obvious that no Government of which Mr. Smith forms part can possibly be trusted to advance towards majority rule within the foreseeable future?</p>

<p>I am not going to describe Mr. Smith or anyone else as an unrepentant racialist. I am totally opposed, as all of us are in this House, to racialism in any form. [HON. MEMBERS:

"Not all."] Well, I hope that we are, and I hope that those who take a different view will register their decision in the Lobby when the time comes. That applies whether to white racialism, or, as I have occasionally had to say in Commonwealth conferences, to another, danger, that of African racialism.<br/>
Certainly, I do not believe that this problem will be solved by statements of the kind my hon. Friend has made. It is not a question of dickering. We have made clear for two years our position on the future of Rhodesia, and in so doing have followed our predecessors in what they at that time also made clear. We made clear, also, this year, from January onwards, our willingness, without negotiating with or recognising an illegal r&#x00E9;gime, to talk about the future. This was from January onwards; it was not taken up till April.<br/>
As to trusting any particular group in Rhodesia, the fact that they declared an illegal r&#x00E9;gime rather than accept the honourable terms we had offered a year ago does cast doubt, and this is why we have insisted on certain things in the present Constitution being entrenched and guaranteed beyond all doubt. The gap still remains about that.</p>

<p>In view of the immense importance of achieving a negotiated settlement of this unhappy fratricidal conflict, will the Prime Minister ensure that the Secretary of State goes to Rhodesia not only in a receptive frame of mind, as I am sure he will, and as the Prime Minister said he will, but also in a constructive frame of mind, and willing to make suggestions, as a compromise involves initiatives from both sides?</p>

<p>Her Majesty's Government have taken repeated initiatives here. As regards the mood in which he goes, my right hon.

As to his being receptive and constructive, this he has always been.<br/>
The hon. and learned Gentleman used the word "fratricidal". I do not think that kith and kin arguments are to be based on colour. The whole world is

<p>Her Majesty's Government, on my own visit to Salisbury in October, 1965, put forward proposals which many of my hon. Friends might have been doubtful about, I know, but which we felt provided an honourable settlement. The fact that this was turned down and recourse to illegal methods was taken by the then Government in Salisbury underlines the need to secure something more than words from those who would have to operate any constitutional settlement. This is what I mean by copper-bottomed guarantees. At the end of the day, when, either as a result of an agreement we are able to publish our proposals, or if, as may be the case, as a result of disagreement, we have to publish our proposals, my hon. Friend will see the type of guarantees on which we have insisted.</p>

<p>Yes, Sir. He did that. I do not know what the hon. Gentleman thinks my right hon. Friend did on his visit. There were the fullest consultations with the Governor. The hon.

<p>Yes, Sir, as soon as the position becomes clarified a debate ought to be held. Whatever differences we may have, I think that the House has shown the greatest patience over the past few months in not pressing for detailed information.

<p>That is a perfectly fair question and I should like to answer it. The real issues, when I said that there was a wide gap to bridge, relate to the six principles, and there is also the very important principle of the mechanism of return to constitutional rule. But I do not think that it would be helpful in the job which my right hon. Friend has to do in the next few days for me to go into that now.<br/>
If we do reach an agreement&#x2014;I have expressed my doubts about the possibility of it, though I have said that I hope we can&#x2014;what differences there have been up to now will not matter very much because the House will have to judge on the terms of the agreement; though I repeat that the agreement will be 100 per cent. within the six principles, or we shall not commend it to the House. If we do not reach agreement, the House will be fully informed of those of the principles on which agreement could not be reached.</p>

Will he bear in mind&#x2014;I know he will&#x2014;the great difficulty of accepting assurances on this which come from someone who has already broken certain solemn assurances?

<p>I beg to move,
<q>That leave be given to bring in a Bill to restore capital punishment for the murder of police or prison officers.</q>
It is said that Parliament should not allow itself to be influenced by a passing wave of emotion following the murder of three policemen last August. It should not be assumed that those who are asking for this change in the law are inspired by a temporary feeling of anger and indignation and that they are likely very soon to change their minds.<br/>
The majority of the British people have all along believed in capital punishment and since it was abolished last year public anxiety has expressed itself in massive petitions all over the country. The effect of the callous murders at Shepherd's Bush has been to focus attention on the increased dangers to which the police are now exposed as a result of the withdrawal of the death penalty.<br/>
People are disturbed by the thought that policemen who risk their lives to protect the community are themselves being denied the full protection of the law for which they ask and which, they believe, would increase their safety. This

is not just an emotional reaction. The strength of public feeling on this question is the measure of the nation's sense of responsibility for the safety of its servants.<br/>
It is said that there is no conclusive evidence that capital punishment deters. That may be so. Nevertheless, I think it worth mentioning that, during the two years since executions were stopped, as many policemen have been murdered as during the whole of the previous 13 years. [HON. MEMBERS: "How many?"] It is also worth mentioning that the number of indictable offences involving firearms this year is just about double what it was two years ago. I am sure that all hon. Members, whatever their views on capital punishment, will feel that this shows a very disturbing trend.<br/>
Some people believe that capital punishment would make no difference. Its deterrent effect is, of course, questionable in the case of a murderer who is confident that he will not be found out. But criminals who shoot policemen when trying to avoid arrest have already been found out and in many cases they know that, if they submit to arrest, they will go to prison for terms which will be just as long as the average duration of a life sentence. They have, therefore, little or nothing to lose by trying to shoot their way out. If, on the other hand, they knew that they were risking the death penalty, I am sure that some of them, at any rate, would think twice before taking out a gun and pulling the trigger.<br/>
Similar considerations apply in prisons, where the number of violent criminals is increasing all the time. The Prison Officers' Association has pointed out that since the abolition of the death penalty there has been nothing to deter convicts who are serving long sentences from killing warders when attempting to escape.<br/>
The police and the prison staff look to Parliament to do all in its power to protect those who are fighting the war against crime. They firmly believe that capital punishment will reduce the risk they have to run. If there are any doubts about this, they feel that the benefit of the doubt ought to be given to them rather than to the murderer.<br/>
It has been pointed out that, in any case, the law will come up for review in 1970. But many people regard this matter as very urgent and I am sure that


hon. Members will not wish to take the line that this question if not discussible for another four years.<br/>
The arguments on both sides cannot be adequately presented in the scope of two ten-minute speeches. I therefore hope that the House will allow the Bill to be presented so that this important issue can be further considered.</p>

<p>I hope that the House will not give the right hon. Member for Streatham (Mr. Sandys) leave to bring in the Bill. The police, Parliament and the public are deeply shocked by the three brutal murders which the right hon. Gentleman mentioned, and, of course, the other murder of a policeman in the North. As they have followed the abolition of capital punishment last year, some people have sought to connect the two facts. But however great the personal and the public tragedy of these terrible murders, the fact is that, statistically, no inference can legitimately be drawn.<br/>
There is a matter which the right hon. Gentleman did not mention, but with which I should like to deal before coming to the three murders to which he referred. This is a matter which, judging by my correspondence, has worried many people. There have been four brutal murders, one of them by a boy of 14 who is now charged with that murder. But since 1831 we have not hanged boys of 14, so that recent changes in the law could not have any effect whatsoever.<br/>
That leaves the three murders which the right hon. Gentleman mentioned. They were terrible murders and very significant, it is argued, but certainly not more significant than the figures for the years 1951. I remember them well. I was the junior Minister at the Home Office. In 1951, the number of murders of policemen suddenly went up to three, and that was two or three years after Parliament had refused to abolish the death penalty. I do not see any way in which to draw any positive conclusions from any of those figures and I merely submit that there is just enough statistical evidence to show the danger of drawing positive conclusions from groups of figures.<br/>
The Bill would restore the anomalies of the 1957 Act with the distinction between capital murder and non-capital murder. Under the proposed Bill, the deliberate poisoner, or the man who tortured a child to death, or the man who battered to death an old postmistress, would not be hanged, but the petty thief who shot the policeman who happened to come on the scene would be hanged. Is anything more likely to bring the law into disrepute?<br/>
Of course, the public is horrified by the murder of these policemen, but is there any evidence that the public is willing to make this distinction between capital and non-capital murder? The House passed the Third Reading of last year's Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Bill by considerably more than two to one. Many hon. Members voted for it because they knew that the law would be reconsidered in five years. The Act cannot continue beyond July, 1970, unless both Houses of Parliament separately pass Resolutions asking for the Act to continue. This is a sensible safeguard against legislation prompted by emotion or based on insufficient data. Let us accept the Act and try it for five years and not panic after 12 months.<br/>
I have mentioned insufficient data. The right hon. Gentleman referred to the figures for the carrying of firearms. We have had those figures for only the last very few years, when they were established in our criminal statistics, but I must not chase that too far, because the essential point is that we are discussing a Bill about homicide, and we have statistics for homicide going back for years and years. We know that homicides have increased since the war, but they have not increased in proportion to the growth of indictable crime generally. There is no evidence yet that they have been in any way affected by changes in the law relating to capital punishment.<br/>
But the root of the argument for the Bill is deterrence related to the murder of policemen. The right hon. Gentleman stated as a fact that the abolition of capital punishment increased the dangers to policemen. We have very little to go on in our criminal statistics, but I have the result of a survey made by the University of Pennsylvania showing the figures for 266 American cities over 35 years. It was found that in States where


there was no capital punishment, fatal attacks on policemen were 1&#x00B7;2 per 100,000, while in cities with capital punishment the rate was almost exactly the same, although slightly higher at 1&#x00B7;3.<br/>
Professor Sellin, who conducted the survey, does not make any point of the small fraction of a decimal point, but concludes after this wide study
<q>it is impossible to conclude that the States which had no death penalty had thereby made the policemen's lot more hazardous".</q>
On this side of the Atlantic, in Western Europe only France and Spain find capital punishment necessary. All our other 13 Western European neighbours, from Iceland to Italy and from Portugal to Finland, get along without capital punishment. The Scandinavians, the Dutch and the Belgians, who are not very different in outlook and institutions from us&#x2014;and the social conditions in Belgium are even worse than ours in the sense of industrialisation and overcrowding</p>

<p>In our long European history it is only recently that Europeans have begun to realise the power of the State not only to destroy its enemies, but to destroy its own citizens. We should, therefore, demand that the State do everything to foster any instinct or belief that human life is the most important thing there is. Above all, we should demand that the State set an example and not itself take human life. I have no time to argue as I would like the possibility of conviction in error and the consequences, but I have time to ask one question: would not many of us sleep more easily if Evans were alive?</p>

<p>I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.<br/>
The Bill deals with two kinds of reviews. First, these are reviews under Part II of the Local Government Act, 1958, dealing with changes in local government organisation, and, secondly, the reviews provided for in section 30(6) of the London Government Act, 1963, of the administration of education in inner London and in Section 34(4) of the Youth Employment Service. I will deal with each kind in turn, starting with the local government reviews.<br/>
Under Part II of the 1958 Act, Local Government Commissions were set up to review the organisation of local government in all parts of England and Wales, apart from the metropolitan area, and to make proposals for changes which seemed desirable in the interests of effective and convenient local government. Except in areas known as "special review areas", which were the main conurbations, like West Yorkshire and the West Midlands, the Commissions were not called upon to propose changes for county districts; that was a job for the county councils. The Bill winds up the Local Government Commissions and frees county councils from their obligation to carry out county reviews.<br/>
Before I give the broad background to this part of the Bill, I should mention briefly the position of the Local Government Commission for Wales. The Commission finished its work in December, 1962, and its members went out of office when their warrants expired on 5th January, 1964. The dissolution of the Welsh Commission is, therefore, purely a formality. What I have to say from now on about the Local Government Commission will refer solely to the Commission for England.<br/>
The reason why the Local Government Commission for England is being wound up is that the Government have set up

a new body to carry out a radical review of local government, the Royal Commission on Local Government in England, under the chairmanship of Sir John Maud. I think that I should say briefly why we thought that a new review was necessary.<br/>
Under the 1958 Act, the Local Government Commission was required to suggest changes within the existing structure of local government. It could not propose major changes in the structure and go thoroughly into the question of functions. This was a major weakness in the reviews under the Act. After all, the present pattern of local government has been in existence for over 70 years, and there is a limit to the adaptability of the old to fit the new.<br/>
The last 20 years have seen particularly rapid changes in the responsibilities of local authorities. Although, after the Second World War, some of their functions passed to other agencies&#x2014;and how well I remember the heated debates we had 20 years ago on the subject&#x2014;local authorities have had to cope with a spectacular growth of duties and problems&#x2014;in town and country planning, housing and education, and the motor car alone has made much of our 70-year-old local government organisation and thinking out of date.<br/>
Let me say at this point that I believe that local authorities have coped well with massive tasks for which they were not originally designed. But there is a limit to what can reasonably be expected from a pattern devised when circumstances were quite different, and I am sure that it is in the interests both of local government itself and of the people it serves to consider afresh what form would be best suited to present conditions and to the even greater tasks that lie ahead.<br/>
That is why we set up the Royal Commission, which, unlike the Local Government Commission, can review both the basic structure functions of local government and its functions as well. The House will know that the main associations of local authorities all welcomed the new review. This, in itself, is a clear indication of the increasingly forward-looking approach to be found in local government circles today. The whole climate of thinking, in fact, has changed quite remarkably over the past few years.<br/>
Within the limitations of their terms of reference, the Local Government Commission did a fine job and I should like to add my voice to the tribute which my predecessor paid to the Commission on a previous occasion. The Commissioners produced reports covering about two-thirds of the country, and orders have been made or will be made to put into effect many of their proposals. We intend in fact to extract as much benefit as possible from all the work which the Commission did.<br/>
The Government, however, did not think that it was worth asking the Commission to carry on with reviews of the remaining areas; the procedure under Part II of the 1958 Act is very long drawn-out and no changes under it could have been put into effect in those areas for many years&#x2014;indeed, until well after the time when the Royal Commission will have reported.<br/>
A similar view was taken on the reviews of county districts by county councils. Where a county review had been completed, my predecessor decided that all the work put into it should not just be put on one side, but that it should be considered on its merits. Where, however, a county review had a fair way to go towards completion, or had not been started, so that early changes under the Act of 1958 would not be feasible, it seemed best to leave the area concerned for review by the Royal Commission. Local authorities were told in June, 1966, that, after consulting the local authority associations, my right hon. Friend had decided to confine consideration of further county review reports to those submitted by 31st August, 1966.<br/>
Before I turn to the provisions of the Bill which deal with the 1958 Act, I should mention the position of the members of the Local Government Commission, of whom there were four remaining when we decided to suspend its activities. All four held individual royal warrants of appointment expiring on 30th October, 1967. Although, in view of the nature of their employment, my predecessor was advised that there was no right enforceable at law to salary or remuneration at any particular rate or for any particular period, we felt that there was a clear moral obligation on the Government to provide compensation in some form because of the financial loss they sustained.<br/>
Compensation has now been paid to all four members; and in calculating we four members; and in calculating it we would apply if there were a claim for damages in respect of wrongful dismissal or breach of contract of employment. I know that the House will feel that we were right to do so.<br/>
I turn now to the provisions of the Bill. Part II of the Act of 1958 is dealt with in the Bill in one operative Clause and a Schedule. In Clause 1, subsection (1) provides for the immediate dissolution of both the Local Government Commissions and deems that the duty of the Commission for England to carry out reviews ceased on 10th February, 1966. That was the date when the Prime Minister announced the decision to set up the Royal Commission.<br/>
Subsection (2) provides that the duty of county councils to carry out county reviews shall be deemed to have ceased on 31st August, 1966, the date which I mentioned earlier. Subsection (3), repeals various provisions in Part II of the Act of 1958 because they will be made obsolete, now or later, by subsections (1) and (2).<br/>
Part I of the Schedule contains provisions which can be repealed outright, but the provisions in Part II of the Schedule may still be needed for matters arising from former proposals of the Commissions and from county review proposals put forward by 31st August; these provisions continue in operation for these purposes. Subsection (4) of Clause 1 is simply a technical provision for preserving the effect of the definition in the London Government Act, 1963, of the expression "county review area", which is relevant to a number of provisions in that Act.</p>

<p>Clause 2 of the Bill repeals Sections 30(6) and 34(4) of the London Government Act, 1963, in implementation of the undertaking given to the House by my right hon.

<p>The Act imposed on the Secretary of State for Education and Science an obligation to carry out a review of the arrangements for education, and to lay a


report before Parliament not later than 31st March, 1970, with the object of determining whether, and if so to what extent, all or any of the functions of the I.L.E.A. should be transferred to the inner London boroughs or the City.</p>

<p>The educational service built up by the old L.C.C. was admirable, and won world-wide respect, and my hon.

<p>We expressed very forcefully the view that they introduced an element of uncertainty into the future of the I.L.E.A. which would give rise to a great deal of anxiety in the minds of teachers and parents; and that, having taken the decision that there should be a unified education service in the inner London area, the Government should have been prepared to implement that decision completely.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1966-11-23a.1423.3" colnum="1423" time="">
<p>We believed that it was highly undesirable that the air of uncertainty over the future of this most important service which had existed between the publication of the Herbert Commission's Report and the introduction of the then Government's proposals should be prolonged. To have persisted with the statutory review would have continued the period of uncertainty. Meanwhile, the staff of the I.L.E.A. would have been unsettled, and the authority itself might well have been inhibited from embarking on long-term planning.</p>

<p>This uncertainty might have been acceptable if anything in the nature of positive gain to the education service was likely to emerge from the review. But there is general agreement in the educational world that a unified educational service for the inner London area is clearly desirable, and, I believe, essential to progressive administration and development of the education service.</p>

<p>In view of what the Minister has just said, can he provide evidence that the existence of that subsection in the Act caused staff to leave the Inner London Education Authority; and examples of how long-term planning has been held up or prevented?</p>

<p>The erosion of staff and the reluctance to plan have been avoided by the very clear and specific pledges given by the Labour Party that the I.L.E.A. would be continued in existence, but, had we weakened in our resolve to remove the need for this review, I believe that a new element of uncertainty would have been introduced in the service. It was the very strongly held view of the I.L.E.A. and of the Greater London Council itself that the service should continue as it is at present.<br/>
Both the education and Youth Employment services of the I.L.E.A. are highly organised and efficiently administered and any disruption or fragmentation of their well-balanced service could only lead in our view to a lowering of standards. In the interests of sound local administration, the Government therefore propose to confirm the position of the I.L.E.A. and to preserve the long-established unified service in the inner London area by repealing the review Sections of the London Government Act.<br/>
I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

<p>This Bill is a further chapter in the long story of Government ineptitude, vaccilation and dissimulation. The Minister has done his best to explain it&#x2014;or rather to explain it away&#x2014;but it was, perhaps, inevitable that he would not arouse much enthusiasm on either side of the House. I have some sympathy with the right hon. Gentleman&#x2014;we all have. He has had a dismal inheritance from his predecessor. This is not merely a wholly negative. Measure. It is retrospective as well.<br/>
The Local Government Commissions for England and Wales have already been killed, together with any hope of early progress towards local government reorganisation. Today, we are having only the legal burial service. As the Bill says, the English Commission is


deemed to have been dead since 10th February, 1966, and the Local Government Commission for Wales finished its work in December, 1962. Therefore, as the Minister says, we are really most concerned now with the English Commission, and the effect of the Bill on English local government.<br/>
The publication of the Bill&#x2014;which is, perhaps, significant&#x2014;came just 13 unlucky months after the Minister's predecessor, the present Leader of the House and then Minister for Housing and Local Government, told the Conference of the Association of Municipal Corporations on 22nd September, 1965, quite categorically that he was determined that the work of the Commission should go on. On that: occasion, he said:
<q>I must admit I was tempted at one point to do a Bevan and hoist the Commission on a Ministerial petard; hut not for long. Interminable though the proceedings had often been, the results of the Commission's work mark a real advance, particularly in some of the special review areas. I am convinced that in the North-West there is still time for a real job of work to be done in reorganising Merseyside and the Manchester conurbation. So I take this opportunity of scotching all rumours that the Commission is to be wound up.</q>
Not merely did the right hon. Gentleman say that he was determined that the work of the Commission should go on; he added, for good measure, that its work would be accelerated, and that whenever it made proposals there would be a quick decision at his level. It was the purposive, gritty action that the Government have always offered the British people. In fact, the only decision the Government have made is to do nothing&#x2014;and to do it, of course, for as long as possible. In this context, that is what the Leader of the House had in mind when he talked of "doing a Bevan."<br/>
The House will recall that when the Local Government Boundary Commission set up by the wartime Coalition Government, reported in 1947 that it required wider powers to propose changes in functions which were inseparable from major alterations in areas, it got short shrift from the late Mr. Bevan, who was then Minister of Health and responsible for local government. The previous Labour Government wound up that Commission, which met under the distinguished chairmanship of Sir Malcolm Trustram Eve, now Lord Silsoe. They did so after Mr. Bevan had told the House:

<q>&#x2026; legislation on this particular matter will be highly contentious, highly involved, and unlikely to produce any very great unanimity among the local authorities concerned."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 8th April. 1948; Vol. 449, c. 337.]</q>
What is certain, therefore, is that Mr. Bevan killed the Trustram Eve Commission, not because it came up with some serious and carefully-worded suggestions that contravened its terms of reference, but because its recommendations involved changes that would be highly controversial. Of course, the Minister now says, "We look forward to, and do not mind, controversy, and welcome change, but we do not want it yet, and certainly not in this Parliament."<br/>
The Leader of the House, in effect, in spite of all his assurances to the Association of Municipal Corporations, mortally wounded its successor when, on 14th December last year, he rejected the Tyne-side proposals. Such was his legal right. No one complains about that, but one may doubt the wisdom of his action, particularly as three months earlier he had claimed that time- and money-wasting procedures had been deliberately exploited to frustrate change. The right hon. Gentleman said, "I will not do that. I will make decisions rapidly when the Commission comes forward with its proposals."<br/>
The only difference&#x2014;it is a significant one&#x2014;between Mr. Bevan and the present Government is that Mr. Bevan at least had the courage to say that he wanted to dodge unpopular and contentious decisions. It would be unfair, therefore, to say that the Government have "done a Bevan". They have "done a Wilson" once again, and that is much worse. The trouble has arisen because the credibility gap between what the Government say and what they do is always so wide.<br/>
In the end, it proved too much for the Local Government Commission. Therefore, on 21st December last year, the Commission wrote to the Minister of Housing and Local Government throwing in the sponge and asking local authorities not to bother preparing new material for submission. It is, therefore, a little disingenuous for the Minister this afternoon to say that the Government came to the conclusion that in the circumstances it would be wise not to ask the Commission to do more.<br/>
Who can blame the Commission for the action it took? As <i>The Guardian</i> commented on 22nd December:
<q>This is an unprecedented step which reflects the mounting concern, and, indeed, resentment, created for the Commission by Mr. Crossman.</q>
Thus, so far from speeding up the reorganisation of local government, Socialist Ministers have seriously retarded it and, I suggest, have done so deliberately. Yet as the Leader of the House himself acknowledged, the results of the Local Government Commission's work marked a real advance. The whole House would wish to associate itself with the tribute paid by the Minister to the Commission's work, although it is a bit of a backhanded tribute from him in all the circumstances. We should pay tribute to the Commission for what it has done in contributing to providing effective and convenient local government.<br/>
The House&#x2014;and, indeed, the Government&#x2014;should be aware of the danger of establishing commissions, seeking the help of distinguished public figures and then throwing them overboard for the sake of political expediency. The New Towns Commission is another body which is also extremely worried that it is now under what my hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Graham Page) called suspended sentence of death, a comment which he made recently on Second Reading of the New Towns Bill. We simply will not get people to give up their energy and their time for public service if they are to be treated in such a cavalier fashion.<br/>
The dissolution of the Local Government Commission for England came at the very moment when a flood of recommendations for Parliamentary approval was pouring from the Commission. Of course, every recommendation and resolution would have ben controversial and would have annoyed some local interest. That must be expected in reforming measures. No change, not even for the better, is accomplished without difficulty.<br/>
The Conservative Government faced these decisions, many of which were extremely difficult and controversial. We made it clear that by April, 1965, we would have completed the West Midlands reorganisation, made a decision on Tyne-side, settled West Yorkshire and have had Merseyside and West Lancashire well

on the way. That would have covered the six conurbations by April, 1965. In addition, Tees-side would have been settled. In short, by April, 1965, we would have settled most of the business of reorganisation and we would have got much of it into operation. That was made clear in the House by my right hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, North-East (Sir K. Joseph) on 4th December, 1963.<br/>
The fact is that the party opposite have no policy for local government and they have very litle sympathy for it. They pursued the most bigoted opposition to the reform of London government, as the Minister has today reminded us. They have already buried their pledges to reorganise the finances of local government. For example, the return to percentage grant has gone by the board, and so also has the promise to transfer to the Exchequer the major part of the cost of teachers' salaries. For the rest, as the Minister has explained, the Government have passed the buck to Sir John Maud and his fellow Royal Commissioners. No doubt the Government will try to bury the report when they get it.<br/>
When the Prime Minister announced the names, I commented that it was an exercise&#x2014;and it is an exercise, in kicking the ball into the long grass. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Kingston-upon-Thames (Mr. Boyd-Carpenter) wrote in the <i>Local Government Chronicle</i> on 19th March this year:
<q>There is no need for a Royal Commission on local government. All the evidence required is available. What we want now is action, not words.</q>
Many of us who are interested in local government know that we need that action urgently.<br/>
We on this side have made our policy quite clear. We have said that we want more regional administration with strong and modernised local government. But if, as we accept, larger authorities are needed to handle certain functions over a wider area, we must also see that they are subject to proper democratic control. We say here and now that the economic planning councils and <i>ad hoc</i> bodies appointed by Whitehall and which are at present operating are no substitute for effective regional local government.<br/>
The Conservative Government made a start with the London Government Act,


1963, which was so bitterly opposed at every stage by the party opposite. If there has been a complaint against the Conservative Government, it was that we acted too fast. As the Association of Municipal Corporations said in its memorandum of evidence to the Royal Commission, published last month, at paragraph 280:
<q>Experience of the reorganisation of local government in London emphasises the need for plenty of time to be allowed between the enactment of legislation giving effect to changes in the system of local government and the date of the assumption of responsibilities by the new authorities. The time allowed in London was insufficient".</q>
The A.M.C. added that
<q>in consequence, well-nigh intolerable strains were imposed on members and, even more so. on senior officers. In some cases health was seriously impaired. It must also be possible for further change to be made in the areas of the new authorities and in regard to their functions without undue complexity.</q>
It may be that we tried to get ahead too fast with this important work of reorganisation. I understand the pressures that these changes put upon staff. We accepted, however, the contention of the Association of Municipal Corporations that it must be possible for further change to be made in the areas of the new authorities and in regard to their functions without undue complexity. That was the purpose of the provisions in the 1963 Act for transitional arrangements for housing and certain other functions and, in particular, for a review of the working of the Inner London Education Authority, which, in the horrible jargon of today, we call ILEA.<br/>
The Minister said that it is proposed by Clause 2 of the Bill that that review should not now take place. None of us on this side need be surprised that the Government have decided to relieve the Secretary of State for Education and Science of his responsibilities, cast upon him by Statute under Section 30(6) of the 1963 Act, to review the administration of education in inner London. Understandably, the Government have no desire to have any report to Parliament on the workings of the Inner London Education Authority.<br/>
The activities of that body is one of the chief reasons for their gerrymandering tactics in seeking to postpone next year's London borough elections. On the other hand, it is obvious that, if the Government

undertook a review in present circumstances, it would be simply a whitewashing exercise, so naturally the Minister says, and perhaps we ourselves can agree, that we might as well abandon it.<br/>
Since Parliament cast this clear duty upon the Government of the day, and it was well understood, at any rate for a period of time, that it would be fulfilled&#x2014;and it must be assumed that it will be fulfilled until the Bill goes on to the Statute Book&#x2014;in our view, they are guilty of a dereliction of duty in not carrying out the review. It is a disservice to local government, to education and, above all, to parents who are very concerned about what is going on in the London area at present.<br/>
For our part, I will make our position clear. We reserve the right in due course to review the activities of the Inner London Education Authority, either to dissolve it altogether or to make such changes in its composition, structure and functions as seem to us to be necessary.<br/>
What is needed now is for the Government not just to produce a negative Bill of this kind, nor another Royal Commission. What is needed is a Minister who will say to his advisers, "Our policy for the reform of local government should take place on these lines. Let me know the options&#x2014;regional authorities, city regions, continuous counties, provincial authorities, and the rest." Let us hope that we have such a Minister now. We did not have one before.<br/>
If he had the necessary will, within six months, he could consult the local authority associations. In the light of the work which has been done already by the Local Government Commission, he would be in a position to announce the Government's decisions.<br/>
It is the Government who must decide what to recommend to Parliament. That is what they are elected for. There is no need for a Royal Commission, taking minutes and wasting years, to use a phrase of the old days. What we want is action, not words. Sooner or later&#x2014;and, as far as we are concerned, the sooner the better&#x2014;these decisions have to be made. As they are unlikely to be made by a Labour Government, I will undertake that they will be made by a Conservative Government.<br/>
We have had frozen production and frozen wages. With this Bill, we have what is, in effect, frozen local government. So far from being able to shape the future, the Government cannot even keep up with yesterday.</p>

<p>While I welcome the Bill as a whole, I intend to devote the majority of my remarks to Clause 2, which relieves the Secretary of State of the duty to review Section 30(6) of the London Government Act, 1963.<br/>
This Clause will receive the full support and approbation of the London Teachers' Association, which represents the vast majority of the teachers who serve in the I.L.E.A. area. Many of them will recognise it as the culmination of a campaign which they began when the Royal Commission's proposals for the break up of the old L.C.C. were first announced some years ago.<br/>
Hon. Members will not need reminding that the original proposals of the last Conservative Government were forthwith to transfer all educational functions in the G.L.C. area, including those functions carried out by the old L.C.C. to the new London boroughs. That proposal produced an enormous wave of protest at the time that it was first mooted among teachers, parents and many people who had not normally been active in organisations of any sort.<br/>
As a London teacher in the service of the old L.C.C. at the time, I shudder now to think of the volume of letters, deputations and communications to which hon. Members must have been subjected. But it was made clear that, irrespective of party affiliations, most teachers and parents voiced very strong objections to the break up of the L.C.C. educational service. I remember that in the lobbying of hon. Members of the House which took place many teachers who participated were doing so for the first time in their lives, and probably the last time. I must warn right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite that if there is any attempt to go back on the decision that we are making at present and to break up the I.L.E.A. that will meet with very strong opposition from the same people who opposed it in the past.<br/>
It may be asked why there was that enormous wave of popular feeling against the break-up of the old L.C.C. educational service. It was because teachers, parents and education authorities everywhere recognised the superb education service which had been established for many years by the L.C.C. They recognised the enormous obstacles which would be placed in the way of continuing the service at that very high level if it were broken up and its powers transferred to the new Greater London boroughs and to the City.<br/>
The reasons which prevailed when the campaign against the break up began are as strong today as they were then. Failure to come to a firm decision on the matter and putting off the review once and for all would only do considerable harm to the educational service in London. As 1970 approaches, the I.L.E.A. and officers and employees of the service would not be sure what was going to happen to them after the review had taken place. It is in that spirit in particular that I welcome Clause 2.<br/>
Let us look for a moment at the arguments which have been advanced for the retention of the I.L.E.A. I remember that the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Handsworth (Sir E. Boyle), in the course of the Second Reading of the London Government Bill which changed government in London, stated drastically:
<q>&#x2026; as one gets towards the centre of London so the pattern of schools and technical colleges becomes less and less related to borough boundaries. Furthermore &#x2026; the transport system gets more and more closely integrated so that parents in inner London now take it for granted that their children can travel quite long distances to school."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 11th December, 1962; Vol. 669, c. 238.]</q>
At the primary stage, that is true. At the secondary stage, it is even more true, and a very large number of children attend schools outside the boroughs in which they happen to reside.<br/>
To base any educational pattern on the borough divisions would be quite unrealistic. Some boroughs have more school accommodation than they require for their own children and young people. Others have not got enough. It would be ridiculous to promote arguments about the need for building additional schools in a borough which had not sufficient


schools to cater for its own child population. That is particularly true in London, where there is a tremendous shortage of land for all purposes. In any case, under present arrangements, we have much greater parental choice available to members of the population.<br/>
It may be argued that free trade in education would still be possible if the I.L.E.A. were broken up eventually. But one must ask, why break down the existing system if it would be necessary to recreate a system more cumbersome than the one which exists at present; because the present one has worked very well. Whatever its faults, it would be nothing like as awkward to manage as a system consisting of a large number of boroughs.<br/>
Each London borough would require its own staff. New directors and assistants would have to be appointed, and I maintain that the ratepayers no more want to pay for this than do other people in the educational service. It is possible that over the years standards might gradually vary. So would terms of service, and this would be extremely undesirable. The teacher shortage at the present time is difficult enough in all cities, but it is much easier to tackle the shortages which tend to arise in the less attractive areas covered by the I.L.E.A. than it would be if individual boroughs covering those areas had to deal with this task.<br/>
I do not believe that any borough could sustain the excellent central services maintained by the I.L.E.A., and which were maintained in the past by the L.C.C. I am thinking of things like the equipment centre, the education library, and the special courses which are run by the I.L.E.A. Few individual boroughs&#x2014;in fact, I would prefer to say none&#x2014;would be able to embark on the provision of experiments like the closed circuit schools television service, or the provision of training centres for inspectors, teachers and others, as at Stoke D'Abernon.<br/>
The question has also been raised of comprehensive school reorganisation. I know that many right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite are not particularly happy about this development, but a dreadful state of affairs would be produced if all these proposals for reorganisation within the I.L.E.A. area suddenly went into the melting pot after 1970, where they were

already being developed, by individual boroughs being forced to tackle the problem.<br/>
There is, too, the question of special schools for the educationally sub-normal and other handicapped children. It is necessary to have a large area to carry out the economies of scale. The distribution of special schools is such that it would be utterly pointless, one might almost say criminal, to break up the I.L.E.A. and then try to find some means of vesting these schools in individual boroughs. Why break down something to replace it with another system which will probably be much worse? I therefore welcome very much the Government's decision on this question.<br/>
I believe that it might be fruitful for us to look in the future at whether or not it is better to have educational authorities on the scale of the I.L.E.A. within the rest of the Greater London area. I know that when the London Government Bill was before the House some of my hon. Friends&#x2014;one of whom is no longer with us, George Pargiter&#x2014;moved an Amendment to it to provide for similar authorities to be set up in the north-east, north-west, south-east and south-west of the Outer London area. I recognise the great work which has been done by individual boroughs to set up their own educational services, but I believe that it might have been possible to do it very much more effectively and efficiently if it had been possible in these areas to plan over a wider area than that covered by any of the Greater London boroughs.</p>

<p>I do not altogether quarrel with the hon. Gentleman's view that there is a strong case for looking at the Outer London tier and considering whether fewer authorities might not be a good idea, but surely the experience of the I.L.E.A. could be relevant to this case. I do not want to make an unfair debating point, but the hon. Gentleman has made an argument for a review of the I.L.E.A. and seeing how it works, rather than the reverse.</p>

<p>I think that I agree with the right hon. Gentleman that it would be desirable to look at the experience gained within the I.L.E.A. and see how far it was applicable in the Outer London area, but the purpose of the


suggested review is not to enable that sort of comparison to be made but to break up the I.L.E.A. The right hon. and learned Member for Hexham (Mr. Rippon) said that the Opposition reserved the right to dissolve the I.L.E.A. if necessary, and all the emphasis has been placed on this use of the review. As I said, originally it was made clear that the L.C.C. was to be completely broken up and no I.L.E.A. was to be brought into existence. I am not opposed to the suggestion which the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Hands-worth (Sir E. Boyle) has just made.<br/>
I thought that the 1963 Act was, in many respects, a disaster, because it broke up many services, apart from education, which would have been much better carried on by an authority covering an area of the same scale as the I.L.E.A. covers, or maybe the whole G.L.C. area. I do not accept the argument advanced at the time that this would have resulted in less local democracy, because many of the Greater London borough authorities are now more remote from the electors because the members of these authorities represent larger areas than did the old authorities which they replaced.<br/>
The ratepayers in the outer Metropolitan ring who have been subjected to enormous rate increases certainly do not think very much of the 1963 Act. I can say this with great feeling in respect of my electors in Chingford, many of whom were Conservatives, who have been shocked by the effect on the rates of the Greater London reorganisation which took place as a result of the action taken by the previous Administration.<br/>
I believe that the destruction of the I.L.E.A., if it eventually takes place, could produce the same sort of results in central London on a smaller scale. We might find each borough having to appoint its own staff. This would have to be paid for, and it would result in increased rates for a poorer service.<br/>
It is a great pity that local government reform was tackled in the way that it was in the London area. It is all very well for the right hon. and learned Member for Hexham to refer to gerrymandering activities on the part of the Government in postponing the Greater London Borough elections for a year. Do right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite not

remember the purpose behind the creation of the G.L.C.? Do they not remember that many people thought that the political motive behind it was to wrest London from the control of the Labour Party? The ending by this Measure of the uncertainty which has hung over teachers, parents and officers of the I.L.E.A. since the passing of the original Bill is something which we all welcome, and I think that the Government are to be congratulated on introducing this Measure.<br/>
As I have said, I am sorry that more of the dismembered services of the old L.C.C. cannot be reconstituted at this stage, but the permanent reprieve of those which are still in existence is something which we should all heartily welcome. By taking this action the Government will win the applause not only of Labour supporters but of all those within the London area, including Conservatives, who recognise the great educational work done by both the L.C.C. and the I.L.E.A. I welcome the Bill, and I hope that it will pass speedily through the House.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Epping (Mr. Newens) asked if we did not remember the real purpose of the London Government Act. He made it quite clear that he did not remember. He implied that it was a political racket to take control from the London County Council. I should have thought that that would have been a public service. If he remembered the Bill properly he would recall that the then Minister of Housing left out of the proposed area of the Greater London Council large Conservative-held areas which wished to stay out. If the proposal had been a political racket the Minister would have insisted on their coming in. The hon. Member's allegation was an absurd and unworthy one, which I hope that he is now going to withdraw.</p>

<p>I am sorry that the hon. Member did not seek to withdraw


his allegation. Of course there was pressure, but if the purpose had been what he alleged it would have been withstood, and those areas would have been brought into the Greater London area. My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Hexham (Mr. Rippon) said that we now had a local government freeze. I welcome that local government freeze in a minor way. I welcome the winding up of the previous Local Government Commission; indeed, I introduced a Bill in the last Parliament which would have had that effect, and the year before I moved a lengthy Motion on the same lines. I am glad that the Government have now come round to the same view.<br/>
My constituency was closely affected by one set of proposals of the Local Government Commission, which was to extend the City of Norwich into the fringe parishes, which were in my constituency. Those constituents of mine who were affected were almost unanimous in their opposition. There was a great amount of public feeling; associations were set up and meetings were held. It was very agreeable to address full houses in large schools One parish even created a newspaper. As a result of this great public enthusiasm they won their fight.<br/>
The point is that my constituents, in their opposition, were not merely seeking to defend the past; they felt strongly that the proposals were not relevant either to Norfolk or to Norwich in the twentieth century; they felt that the proposals were interim and would not fit the requirements of East Anglia for the next ten years. Therefore, they were waiting for exciting and imaginative proposals. That, unfortunately, is just what the Government have not provided; they have produced no proposals at all.<br/>
I would have thought that there had been more than enough Royal Commissions and Committees set up on local government over the years and that it was time the Government stopped shuffling its own responsibility on to Royal Commissions, Committees and departmental bodies and all that sort of paraphernalia and acted themselves&#x2014;because the matter is urgent. Local government is the sick man of England. That is a high claim to make at present, because there are many sick men about&#x2014;but local government is the most sick. It does not always understand its own

illness, and sometimes protests its health, but its illness is well known and is plain for all to see. We know the symptoms. Local authorities are the wrong size. There are far too many of them, they have lost power to Whitehall, and they are far too dependent, financially, on Whitehall. The whole system and manner of local government are obsolete. The Government should realise this. It is no good putting off reform.<br/>
I need not diagnose the illness; I am sure that the Minister is aware of it. Indeed, he touched upon it in his speech. Faced with this situation, however, the Government should have acted. To abolish one Commission and set up another does not come under the heading of action. The Government should have decided that the case for larger authorities is proved. They must know that to be so. There is an unanswerable case for regional government. We already have it, to some extent. The choice is between elected and non-elected regional government&#x2014;between representative government and government by the appointees of the First Secretary for the time being. That is not a happy prospect, at any rate to hon. Members on this side of the House.<br/>
The Government should have set up regional authorities. Even if by doing so they had rationalised the structure of local government, nevertheless, the manner of local government would have remained, and that is what needs changing even more than the structure and the system. The sort of reforms that are needed are those which would bring some public interest to local government. The great purpose of local government is that it involves many people in the Government of the country. Under the present manner of local government, a great deal of the time of these people is wasted.<br/>
It will stop being wasted only when the manner of local government has been drastically altered. The recent by-elections in the greater London Area showed this to be true. As a result of the 1963 Act, Local Government in London is much less obsolete than it is elsewhere. It is not right, yet, but it is still better than in most other places. In the by-election in the borough of Brent there was a turnout of 12 per cent. It is true that that turn-out embodied a swing of 17 per cent. to this side, but even though


that massive and mammoth swing means that the result was a good deal better from the point of view of those on this side of the House than of those on the other side, nobody can derive satisfaction from it because it shows the incredible apathy which exists about local government under the present system.<br/>
Even when the boundaries and functions of local government have to some extent been rationalised people still do not care and do not turn up to vote. The undergrowth of committees, subcommittees, aldermen, indirect elections and all the traditional mumbo-jumbo of local government cuts it off from those who elect local government members and cuts it off even more effectively from the much larger body of people who do not elect them. In order to get rid of this barrier, which is the only way that local government can be revived, something drastic must be done, namely, the abolition of the present collective anonymity of local government, together with the committee system.<br/>
The way to do that is to institute direct elections of the chief executives of the regions and the second tier authorities, which in my view should be continuous counties. At present the mayor is a purely honorific figure. He is nobody. He is purely ceremonial. He has nothing to lose but his chains.</p>

<p>That is true, and Mr. Deputy Speaker also has a casting vote, but I would not like to compare him too closely with a mayor. The mayor has that function, but it is not enough. The way to revive public interest in local government is to make the mayor a paid executive, a functional executive, and a powerful executive. The same could happen regionally, where there should be a directly elected governor. Election contests between well known or even powerful and famous characters for the post of governor or mayor would create considerable public interest. One can imagine who those people might be. It is probable that in this country we would not have quite the same enthusiasm for gubernatorial or mayoral elections that they do in America, but some of the public interest engendered there would

be excellent in this country. We are a long way from that situation.<br/>
I do not believe that local government can be preserved in its present form. If we try to do so, local government will just die and we shall have government by civil servants. Therefore, the way to preserve local democracy is to have more of it, not less and to have direct elections. That is the only way to revive local government. Although I welcome the very small step of abolishing the previous Commission which the Government have taken, I regret that they have done absoluetly nothing else to bring in a properly reformed system of local government.</p>

<p>Like my hon. Friend the Member for Epping (Mr. Newens), I am particularly interested in Clause 2 which, in effect, relieves the citizens of London of the implicit threat in the London Government Act of 1963 to wind up what were then the educational functions of the London County Council subsequently transferred to the Inner London Education Authority. Whatever right hon. and hon. Members opposite may say, we are all well aware of the object of the 1963 London Government Act. The Conservatives at that time, in their anxiety to scrap the London County Council, were also prepared to scrap its educational functions and in that way completely to fragment the service which had so well served the citizens of London for so many years.<br/>
However, as my hon. Friend said, in the face of overwhelming public opposition, the Government of the day gave way and instead inserted this review Clause in the Act. The present Government&#x2014;I think rightly&#x2014;have decided that the present system of education in inner London has proved its worth, that it should stay and that no review is now necessary. I had, however, hoped that the Government would go further and perhaps make reference to some of the recommendations on education by the Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater London. Many of these recommendations were completely side-stepped by the Conservative Government of that time in their haste to dismantle the London County Council.<br/>
One of the main recommendations of the Commission was that the Greater


London Council should be the education authority for the whole of London, having certain well-defined powers, responsibility particularly&#x2014;this is most important&#x2014;for the statutory standard of education over the whole of London, together with certain other controls, particularly budgetary controls. The boroughs also, according to the recommendations, were to have the discharge of many important executive powers. Here there would be absolutely no suspicion of any idea of major and minor authorities, as the functions of both types of authority would be very well-defined. There would be co-operation on that basis.<br/>
Therefore, in that way it would maintain the intimate nature of the service&#x2014;education is an intimate service&#x2014;as between the parent and the school and between the parent and the authority. The Commission strongly recommended that any development plan for the Greater London area should be the responsibility of the Greater London Council. Such a recommendation, if implemented, would have the advantage of coherent reorganisation of education over the whole area instead of the piecemeal development taking place at present.<br/>
It has been suggested in the debate that we should look at the experience of the Inner London Education Authority and tie it to the possibility of similar organisation of the outer London authorities. It appears to me to be the other way round, that one should look at the experiences of the authorities in the outer fringe of the London area, see the mistakes being made there, and thus appreciate that, in the workings of the Inner London Education Authority, there is a model of how the educational system should be worked out in the whole Greater London area.<br/>
I would give an example from my own borough of Redbridge, of which my constituency forms part. Here we have a Tory council, which, bound by narrow party considerations, upholds selection at 11-plus and generally opposes the reorganisation of its secondary schools on comprehensive lines. Meanwhile, the neighbouring boroughs are proceeding apace with their plans for reorganisation, leaving Redbridge as a backwater in the stream of educational progress.<br/>
At the same time, there is in Red-bridge a lack of provision of grammar school places. At present, the borough is exporting about 2,000 children to neighbouring authorities. These places, in time, will be less readily available, with the result that the percentage of children from Redbridge to be granted grammar school accommodation will be drastically reduced. This will come as a blow to many of those parents who have a great anxiety for the future of their children. I might also add that the fragmentation of education in the Metropolitan Essex region has resulted in a further shortage of accommodation for educationally subnormal children in the Borough of Redbridge.<br/>
I welcome Clause 2, but hope that the Government, perhaps at some future time, will see fit to introduce a Measure for the greater co-ordination of education throughout the whole of the Greater London area.</p>

<p>It is true of many things, but particularly of local government, that Labour has a grievous disposition when in power for dismantling the half-finished work of previous Administrations. There was in existence a Local Government Commission which the late Mr. Aneurin Bevan wound up in 1949, but it was his own Government who had set it up in 1947. The Conservative Government formed a new Commission in England under the Local Government Act of 1958. One would have hoped and expected it would have been given time to be left alone to complete its work.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman who is now the Lord President of the Council said, when he was the Minister responsible for these matters&#x2014;he said this on 22nd September, 1965&#x2014;that he would not dissolve the Commission. Then, in December&#x2014;and not for the first time&#x2014;he rejected a recommendation made by the Commission. Meanwhile, rumours were rife that the right hon. Gentleman was becoming impatient with this body. This was confirmed by the statements he made later about the relationship between the current work of the Commission and other proposals he had in mind for a committee to consider the long-term reform of local government.<br/>
This led the Local Government Commission to advise local authorities not to


devote special effort to preparing new material for submission, as it was argued that work could not proceed in that climate. Then, on 10th February, 1966, the Prime Minister announced the setting up of a Royal Commission for England, and another for Scotland, and, within an hour, the discontinuance of the Local Government Commission was announced in Parliament.<br/>
Much time, money and effort had been expended throughout England by local authorities who found their efforts utterly wasted. This led to much frustration and, to illustrate this, I cite the case concerning the Borough of Poole, the Dorset County Council and the County Borough of Bournemouth. They had each provided what I can only describe as massive evidence&#x2014;albeit somewhat conflicting and controversial&#x2014;about their views on what would be the best structure for the area. The Commissioners were about to begin work on this problem when the then Minister stepped in and finished it.<br/>
My constituency of Poole had a particular grouse in this case because it was promised, as long ago as 1947, that it would receive consideration about becoming a county borough. Those assurances were repeated in 1955, but, when I asked the then Minister in March last, when the axe had fallen, what would happen, he replied that while he had great sympathy with Poole
<q>&#x2026; I would point out that the time that it would take under our present procedure would mean that Poole could not hope to get any change of status until well into the '70s if I had left the Boundary Commission still functioning."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 1st March, 1966; Vol. 725, c. 1080.]</q>
I regret that the right hon. Gentleman who is now the Lord President of the Council is not in his place because I would like him to hear my comments on this important subject.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman stated on 10th February last that the work of the Royal Commission would not take much more than two years. I find his reasoning strange indeed because, having pointed out that the Commission would not take more than two years to report, he embarked on a much more interesting point, when he said that the Commission would deal with a radical reconstruction and that there would be "a really radical overhaul."<br/>
One wonders how, if there is to be a really radical overhaul, it can be effected and how the Commission can report in the short space of two years. I recall the Prime Minister saying on 7th September, 1964, in a different connection, that Royal Commissions "take minutes and waste time." I appreciate that he was not altogether serious in that epigram, but the right hon. Gentleman said on 24th May, when giving the terms of reference of the Royal Commission, that the review body would probably be the biggest review of local government this century and that "we must not underrate the importance or thoroughness with which the job must me done." That did not strike me as a simple task to be accomplished in two years.<br/>
Already one senses that the climate is changing. One has only to read Press reports summarising the evidence of various bodies being sent to the Royal Commission to comprehend that there may be some remarkable and far-reaching changes recommended in the local government structure when the Royal Commission reports.<br/>
In this connection&#x2014;and one need only listen to the comments of hon. Members like my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, Central (Mr. Ian Gilmour) to realise there are strong views on this matter&#x2014;one can foresee the possibility of an end to county boroughs and county councils as we know them and, with their departure, the last chance of Poole becoming a county borough. That applies also to the other large non-county boroughs which have pursued this ambition for so long. One can see the emergence of much larger units and possibly even some form of regionalism. The Prime Minister said in this respect on 24th May that the Royal Commission would be able to consider this within its terms of reference and&#x2014;</p>

<p>On a point of order. I am reluctant to intervene, Mr. Deputy Speaker, but has it not been the custom of this House for hon. Members to deprecate the reading of speeches? I may be mistaken, but it seems that the hon. Member for Poole (Mr. Murton) is reading most of his speech.</p>

<p>The hon. Member is perfectly


right in saying that the reading of speeches is to be deprecated. It is contrary to the traditions of the House. Hon. Members are perfectly entitled to refer to notes, but it would destroy the reality of debates if the practice of reading speeches were to develop.</p>

<p>Perhaps I may say, in my own defence, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that I have notes rather than a fully written speech. I have had to paraphrase a number of quotations and give several dates. I would find it difficult to remember them without referring to notes. I ask you to bear with me, Dr. Deputy Speaker, because I shortly wish to refer to a document and I am not able to read parts of it without referring to my notes.<br/>
I was about to say that there is also the question of local government finance which the Royal Commission must consider. There is another point. The Association of Municipal Corporations feels strongly about the subject of amalgamating certain police areas. It believes that the recent decision of the Government, through the Home Office, to amalgamate police authorities is, in certain instances, misconceived and it has several ideas which it believes should be introduced to make provision whereby one police authority could assume responsibility for the policing of part of an area of another police authority, as is possible under Section 12 of the Fire Services Act, 1947.<br/>
I do not wish to risk the chance of getting out of order by raising something which is not within the Bill, but I ask the Minister to consider&#x2014;following the representations he has received about the amalgamation of police areas&#x2014;incorporating a provision in the Bill to achieve what the Association of Municipal Corporations suggests. This would permit agreements to be made similar to those applying to fire services and would enable authorities to cope with difficulties in some urban areas where there is a population spillage into rural areas.<br/>
This is a complex measure. The Royal Commission has much work to do and its terms of reference are extremely wide. I doubt very much whether it can achieve its object in two years. I deprecate the fact that many local authorities which have done much work should have their work discontinued and should be frustrated.

Do the Government want radical reconstruction? If they receive radical proposals will they have the courage to put them into effect? Will they bring them before the House as a basis for legislation and not as my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Hexham (Mr. Rippon) said, "Kick the ball once more into the long grass"? That is a good expression because when a ball is kicked into the long grass it is lost. If this "ball" is lost it will mean that more time and money will be wasted and there will be more frustration. Then we shall be back where we started.</p>

<p>To my surprise the debate so far has been one without any great illumination. I usually think that there are two subjects which amongst local government groups, Labour or Tory, generates dissension. One is local government boundaries and the other is water fluoridation, but this proposal for amending local government boundaries has been received quite amicably.<br/>
So far, so good. I part company with the hon. Member for Norfolk, Central (Mr. Ian Gilmour) if&#x2014;and I do not know whether he was quite serious&#x2014;he was contemplating that mayors should be paid officials, paid executives.

<p>I stand to be corrected, but I think the hon. Member used the word "official". I have often said that there are three kinds of uniform for which I have tremendous respect, possibly exceeding the respect I have for any other. One is the uniform of the mayor, which is acquired for selfless service which is unpaid and, regardless of his party, I have great admiration for the mayor's robes of office. The second uniform is that of the mortar board of the schoolmaster. Here is the achievement of dedication to the pursuit of truth. The third is undoubtedly the nurses' uniform. I hope that the mayors of our cities and chairmen of urban district councils will remain as we have them now as elected persons. I have noticed that legislation


has been proposed suggesting that they need not necessarily sit on the bench in future.<br/>
Coming to the subject before us, I suppose that this is a sort of funeral of Caesar. It is the end of a clumsy process which in the past has been used for the purpose of modernising local government. I think the hon. Member for Norfolk, Central described local government as a very sick man. In many ways I agree. Reviews have taken place concerning local government all over Britain, some with advantage and some with disadvantage. These have been made under different Governments, but the reports did not get very far. It was unfortunate that the most populous parts of Britain, Lancashire, London and the South-East comprising two areas most ripe for consideration in local government reform were the last to be considered. In fact the proposals for them were not considered at all. Because of that, I shall try to express some of the thoughts which have been communicated to me and to other hon. Members representing county boroughs in Lancashire where the shoe pinches most.<br/>
The Leader of the House, when he was Minister of Housing and Local Government, said in the debate on 10th February that he had been asked how long it would be before the Royal Commission reported. He said:
<q>I would say the Royal Commission can do its work in not much more than two years."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 10th February, 1966; Vol. 724, c. 645.]</q>
I should like to hold him to that. While most of the rest of the country has been considered by reports on local government in the past, in the great area of Lancashire one can hardly discern which parts are in an urban district and which are in the district of a county borough. This applies right across from Oldham to Liverpool. Without some local knowledge one can hardly determine in which local authority one is. Yet this is an area where the problem of local government boundaries is overwhelmingly important. I therefore regret that, clumsy as was the old machinery, the then Minister of Housing and Local Government decided rather suddenly to cut its throat. My complaint is that he did not give adequate thought to the problem of the

interim period before the new machinery begins to operate.<br/>
What is the interim period likely to be in Lancashire? I do not wish to get out of order. The Home Secretary is righly concerned with the problem of crime, and so are all hon. Members. I shall not debate that question except to say that the problem of dealing with crime involves the question of police forces as related to local government boundaries. Because of the Act of 1964 for which the whole House must carry responsibility, we cannot now deal with parts of police areas. The Home Secretary is committed and compelled because of the problem of local government in Lancashire, in particular, to pay regard to this in his amalgamation proposals. There will be three authorities in Lancashire, the two great cities and the county council at Preston.<br/>
This is pushing local government and local democracy back 30 or 40 years. Great conurbations which have populations of a quarter of a million people are to go back to the old county council structure, however suitable or unsuitable that may be. If the Minister of Housing and Local Government presses on with the work of the Royal Commission to be completed in two years from last February&#x2014;which will be February, 1968&#x2014;and as the Home Secretary says he would like to have the implements with which to combat crime put to the House in the next two or three years, then these two objects could be harmonised. This touches on local government or regional government. Not only in Lancashire, but I have every reason to believe, from special knowledge coming to me, in Yorkshire and South Wales, there is this problem of local government automony and democracy regarding police areas. If they cannot maintain police forces of adequate size they have to go back to the old county basis.<br/>
I therefore hope that the Minister, having entire responsibility for the shaping of local government and its powers, will see there is an urgent need to consider the problems of the Home Secretary in relation to local government boundaries. I hope he will see whether during the next two or three years, through legislation if necessary, we can enable local authorities in a revised form to maintain adequate police forces. It is an amazing fact that about 13 county


boroughs of Lancashire are likely before long to come to this House for consideration of this problem as I gather they have reached a measure of agreement on revised areas. We welcome this. I ask the Minister to bear this in mind. If we are burying a clumsy and old-fashioned instrument which worked so slowly, for how long will the new high-powered body sit? How long will it take the Executive to decide? The case may be strong in Norfolk, but it is ten times as strong in great conurbations such as those in the North-West and I have reason to think the situation is similar in Yorkshire.</p>

<p>The very title of the Bill&#x2014;the Local Government (Termination of Reviews) Bill&#x2014;suggests that there is something in the nature of a wake about this occasion. So it is. For all that, Clause 1(2) has implications which are considerable and far-reaching for one part of the countryside, namely, Shropshire, but which, in turn, have much wider implications for local government as a whole. Therefore, it is not a neat job of disposal which we are being asked to conduct. It may prove to be a much messier operation than that.<br/>
This turns very much on the power in Clause 1(2) to terminate the county reviews. This power is not clean cut. It is not to set aside the whole function of county reviews. It is merely to set aside that function in as much as it has not already been carried out. There are three county reviews which are in a process of gestation. There is the Shropshire County Review, which I think is by far the most advanced. In this, as in so much else&#x2014;for example, being the cradle of the industrial revolution&#x2014;Shropshire is a pioneer, but I am not here to make a constituency speech.<br/>
Some fairly solemn implications can be gleaned from the experience of the Shropshire County Review, and particularly from the experience of the Cornwall and Worcestershire County Reviews. I am delighted and fortified by the presence of my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives (Mt. Nott). I am sure that if my hon. Friend the Member for Worcestershire, South (Sir G. Nabarro) were not incarcerated in the Committee which is considering the Iron and Steel Bill he, too, would be here. I regret the total

absence of the Liberal Party on this occasion, because Liberal Members represent rural areas which have exactly the type of problem to which I shall refer. I notice particularly the absence of the hon. Member for Cornwall, North (Mr. Pardoe).<br/>
The Shropshire County Review proposes that the borough of Oswestry should be merged with the Oswestry Rural District Council. I would not for one moment suggest that I have any conception of what should be a future desirable pattern of local government in Shropshire or in rural areas generally, because it would be gross impertinence for me to make such propositions in advance of the report of the Royal Commission.<br/>
However, a county review has been conducted in Shropshire which has decided that Oswestry Borough shall be merged with the adjacent rural district and shall become what is known as a rural borough. When the Leader of the House was in opposition, he was very contemptuous of the r&#x00F4;le and prospective future of the rural borough. Indeed, one might be forgiven for thinking that it was partly this doubt and scepticism which prodded him into establishing the Royal Commission.<br/>
This afternoon we are asked to give a Second Reading to a Bill which, among other things, by virtue of the content of the Shropshire County Review, will establish a rural borough in Oswestry. I wish to raise three points. First&#x2014;there is nothing unique about this&#x2014;this proposal has created a great deal of local hostility. Almost every hon. Member who has spoken has conceded that all measures of local government reform excite hostility, but the hostility between a developing industrial community and a surrounding rural community can have considerable implications if it is in the context of wider plans for industrialisation.<br/>
The second, and I think by far the most important, point is that, by assenting to the establishment of a rural borough in Oswestry, the Minister must imply that he sees no future for the continued independent existence of any urban district or borough with a population of below 12,000 or with a rateable value of just below &#x00A3;&#x00BD; million. This is a serious judgment to imply in advance of the recommendations, whatever they be, of the Royal Commission.<br/>
Since the conclusion of the County Review was made known, the West Midlands Review has been published and the regional economic planning boards and councils have been established. I am not a great enthusiast for those bodies. I am not a great enthusiast for some of their proposals, but that is neither here nor there. The point is that these bodies have been established and, much more to the point, the Government have given a firm commitment to the establishment of Dawley New Town in the eastern extremity of the County of Shropshire. This must have considerable consequences upon the balance of population and the balance of industrial prospects throughout the rest of the county.<br/>
There is a pretty good case to be made&#x2014;it is certainly made in the West Midlands Review&#x2014;that Shrewsbury itself will expand as an industrial base It already contains some well-known manufacturing concerns, such as branches of Rolls Royce and also Hall Engineering. If Shrewsbury and Dawley New Town develop as an industrial core running from east to west through the centre of Shropshire, there will be the chance of a population increase in some of the market towns, both to the north and to the south. In the south, the future of Bridgnorth is of intimate concern to my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow (Mr. More). In all these considerations, one is taking a considerable step if one assents to legislation which asserts that an urban area with a population of up to 12,000 has no independent future as an area of local government.<br/>
There is a good deal of evidence of Oswestry's success in attracting certain types of light industry, success gained without the advantages, if advantages they be, of various industrial development inducements. Oswestry does not lie in a development area but it is still, mercifully, successful in standing on its own feet and in attracting industry in its own way. But all this could be put at risk if that urban area were placed alongside a larger rural district which did not necessarily share the same views about the desirability of industrial development.<br/>
These are matters which rightly concern some of my constituents and they certainly concern me. I hope that I

shall be excused if, in putting it to the House, I say that this is genuinely not just another constituency speech. These are matters of principle, perhaps only modest in significance but of principle nevertheless. They are matters which have exercised some of the local government associations also. I have in my hand a statement issued by the Non-County Boroughs' Committee for England and Wales entitled, "County reviews of local government in relation to smaller towns", the first paragraph of which comments that there is
<q>an urgent need for stating the case for the smaller towns which arises from the apparent intention of the Minister of Housing and Local Government to proceed with the implementation of county reviews of Shropshire, Cornwall and Worcestershire".</q>
My fear is that there may be a stubborn determination to put Oswestry through the mill. This would be both arbitrary and unfair, and I suspect that it would also prove to be, in terms of ratepayers' and taxpayers' money, an expensive piece of obstinacy on the part of Whitehall. Perhaps it is still not too late for the Minister to relent, and I hope that he will today tell us that he has.</p>

<p>I welcome Clause 2 of the Bill. The Government's intentions in this matter will be widely welcomed by the people of London, including those who administer the education service in the inner London area, the teachers and, not least, the parents of children attending London schools.<br/>
The salient factor in the long argument we have had about London government and, particularly, London education, must be what the Herbert Commission concluded in paragraph 516 of its Report:
<q>We also have it very much in mind that the educational system of the London County Council has won a high reputation for itself not only in Greater London and the country as a whole but also in countries abroad.</q>
Since the Herbert Commission reported, most of us connected with London government, particularly in the Labour Party, have considered that the introduction of the London Government Bill in 1963 was the Conservatives' attempt to


break Labour's hold on London. Fortunately, the efforts which they put into it did not bear fruit when the elections for the Greater London Council came. But what is more interesting is that not only the Herbert Commission found that there was nothing wrong&#x2014;in fact, it praised it&#x2014;with education in London but the Conservative Government supported that view at the lime. The White Paper said that where schools and institutions had been provided without regard to borough boundaries, and where there had been free movement of pupils across these boundaries, this had been
<q>one of the strengths of London's educational system".</q>
At no time did the Conservative Party adduce any real arguments against the situation in London, and it never once argued against the educational merit of the London County Council's system.<br/>
I had the privilege of being a member of the London County Council during some of the, perhaps, stormiest years when the arguments were raging about the change-over and whether the whole of London's services ought to be interfered with. The hon. Member for Norfolk, Central (Mr. Ian Gilmour) spoke earlier of the apathy of the electorate in local government elections. When the London Government Bill was going through and the changes for London were proposed, we had meetings all over London, not meetings arranged by the Labour Party or by the Conservative Party but meetings of parents of children in ordinary schools and comprehensive schools asking the Government not to go forward with their changes for London's education. I only wish that as many people had felt as outraged about what would happen to the children's health and welfare services as they were about education.<br/>
The Government should now remove the uncertainty hanging over the future of education in London. If they wish to have reviews on the education structure, there are; plenty of places where they can start. I only wish that they would institute a review of the education services in such places as Surrey and Bournemouth. This is where there should be reviews, if there are to be reviews, but not in London, which has proved its

worth not only in terms of education but in terms of people's votes and continued faith in London government throughout the years since 1934.<br/>
The Conservative Party when in office never gave any good grounds for saying that London's education service was inefficient or inadequate. We in the Labour Party were not alone in our protests against the 1963 Bill. The London Teachers' Association, a body drawing its membership from all political parties and from none, resolved at its annual conference in February this year,
<q>That this Conference welcomes the announcement of the Secretary of State for Education and Science that he intends to introduce legislation to repeal the Education Review Clauses of the London Government Act and calls upon the Government to introduce such legislation at the earliest possible moment".</q>
Without doubt, as stated by the President of the London Teachers' Association, this has been having some effect on the recruitment of teachers for London education. It has also been having an effect on the forward planning of the I.L.E.A. in terms of obtaining sites for future school buildings and of knowing whose responsibility it is to be to rehouse families from those sites. I am certain that the people of London will welcome this Bill.</p>

<p>What is the hon. Gentleman's evidence for the assertion that the fact that the review was on the Statute Book has affected the recruitment of teachers? I have been told on good authority that, but for the quota, London would have too many teachers. In this respect, London is in a quite different position from a big city like Birmingham.</p>

<p>I will quote my authority. Mr. Roy Porter, President of the London Teachers' Association, wrote in <i>London Teacher</i> in July, 1965:
<q>We already have evidence that some teachers are leaving the London Service because of uncertainty about the future and this situation will get progressively worse as time goes on.</q>
Not only the teachers are affected. We have had one upheaval in London and the nearer we get to the review date, the more it creates uncertainty in people's minds. The I.L.E.A. must be given an opportunity to move forward without this hanging over its head. Many of us


fought bitterly against the London Government Act&#x2014;and that included some of my old colleagues on the I.L.E.A. But now we are saying, "We have a new authority and must make it work, not because we want to score a political point but for the sake of the children of London and their future."</p>

<p>I hope that the hon. Member for Graves-end (Mr. Murray) will forgive me if I do not follow him in to his arguments about the I.L.E.A. and the question of review of the organisation. I am unqualified to speak on that aspect of the Bill and want to restrict my remarks to issues arising from Clause 1. Before doing so I want to touch on the rather unorthodox suggestion made by my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, Central (Mr. Ian Gilmour).<br/>
I have seen reports of similar suggestions he has made elsewhere and I would ask him to consider local government in terms of its remarkable success in administration over a long period and in rapidly changing circumstances. There is a great deal to be said for a system of committee procedures, with the chairman being elected by the committee members who will serve under him agreeably.<br/>
This also applies to the position of the mayoralty, with mayors being elected to preside over councils by members of those councils. If mayors were to be imposed, as it were, as a result of an electoral decision, it might well do great damage to the system of local government as we know it today. It is one mat has served us so well. In my experience, those who serve in local government get the authority which their abilities deserve and one does not feel that people of ability in local government are restricted in any way under our present system.<br/>
My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Hexham (Mr. Rippon) referred to the remarks made by the Leader of the House at the A.M.C. conference last year in the context of his expressed intention at that time to maintain the Boundary Commission. I wonder whether my right hon. Friend would not agree that this is not the only occasion

on which the Leader of the House has had to change his mind on local government questions.<br/>
The other outstanding change was his remark about doing away with the rates. Subsequently, he has had to tread very warily. He has searched for an alternative system to that of rating which again has served local government well over many years. These are two of the lessons the Government have learned about local government and they would be wise to hesitate with many of their proposals for it.<br/>
Local Government is an extremely complicated and involved procedure. There is an infinite variety of places and circumstances throughout England and Wales and to generalise is unwise in any context. The hon. Member for Oldham, East (Mr. Mapp) referred to the great conurbations. I think it unfortunate that it should have been found necessary, but I am in the position of having to accept the necessity for a complete review of the reorganisation of local government.<br/>
We know that the Boundary Commission, during no less than seven years of plentiful work, covered about two-thirds of the country and had to contend, naturally, with the proper parochialism that one finds. My hon. Friend the Member for Oswestry (Mr. Biffen) has gone to some length to show how the issues with which he is concerned are raised in this type of reorganisation.<br/>
The practical proposals the Commission brought forward, and which both Governments to some extent made effective, have led to a substantial amount of new thinking in terms of local government administrative units and services. This has led, in turn, to a greater recognition on the part of all those serving in local government, whether elected or employed, to have a fresh look at the great problems with which local government is faced.<br/>
There is an indication of this in the many submissions to the Royal Commission from many local authorities and from organisations which have not in the past concerned themselves greatly with local government questions. This is a very hopeful aspect of the review that the Government have undertaken.<br/>
The task facing Sir John Maude and his colleagues is exciting and essential. But


it will be laborious. It is bound to be, with all the mass of evidence that his been submitted. It will be an enormous task to sort it all out. One wonders how the wheat will be sifted from the tremendous amount of chaff that is bound to lie in the submissions. I hope that the two-year period for the work will be found possible. I understand that the Royal Commission intends, if possible, to get its work completed in that time and I am sure that we all hope that it will.<br/>
There is a growing opinion throughout the whole of local government that what people wish to see is democratically elected regional or provincial administration. It is thought that many of the economic planning regions are unsuitable as a base for local government administration, and I believe that the essence of local government lies in elected representation. If those two facets can be acknowledged, we might see provincial authorities responsible for example, for trunk roads, fuel and power, fire, police and ambulance services&#x2014;and I would like to see hospitals reverting to the authority of local government&#x2014;for technical and further education, main drainage and water&#x2014;and we have often discussed the great importance of those last two to new towns and overspill; they are not local problems, but have much wider implications. National parks and rural conservancy and tourism, which might be an interesting feature for provincial administrations to look after, could also be included.<br/>
Surely, what we want is a lessening of the concentration of power in Westminster and the Ministries. I am sure that much of our planning appeal procedure is held up because there is no way in which to devolve it within the Ministries. Underneath the provincial administration, I think that it is generally recognised that there should be, most-purpose authorities, on the basis of a city region. Here, we come back to the point made by the hon. Member for Oldham, East, in that in the great conurbations it is impossible to link the urban area of the cities with any part of the rural countryside. But when there is an urban area in the countryside with country districts around, I am sure that there is much to be said for marrying town and city with the countryside, provided that there is an adequate community of interests to form local units of administration.<br/>
My concern is that of those who have spoken of the delay which may be involved, perhaps not in the Report, but in the implementation of the proposals which may issue from the Royal Commission. I quote from the <i>Local Government Chronicle</i> of 29th October, in which the Under-Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, the hon. Member for Stockton-on-Tees (Mr. William Rodgers), is quoted as saying, in an interview:
<q>The present regional machinery was an interim arrangement. What followed would be partly dependent on the non-central government structure that emerged. He estimated that it would be from seven to 10 years before any changes recommended by the Royal Commission could be carried out.</q>
If that is a reflection of Government opinion, we are in for a very long period of the uncertainty which has been created by the Bill.<br/>
I hope that we shall have an undertaking from the Government that they recognise the sense of urgency involved in this question and are prepared to bring to it a definite purpose in the interests of local government, from both an electoral and an administrative point of view. Two Boundary Commissions, as it happens, have been dissolved by Socialist Administrations, for quite different reasons, but now we have a Royal Commission. I welcome the fact that it has been set up, but I hope that we shall now be able to look to the Government for constructive determination in local government reform.</p>

<p>May I, first, apologise to the right hon. and learned Member for Hexham (Mr. Rippon) and to my right hon. Friend for not having been present at the beginning of the debate. I was engaged in a Select Committee upstairs.<br/>
The debate is somewhat unusual in as much as two rather diverse threads seem to be running through some of the speeches. The hon. Member for Northants, South (Mr. Arthur Jones) has been concentrating more on Clause 1 than on Clause 2, but I am convinced that these two Clauses can be read together in the context of education.<br/>
One of the things which has emerged from local government during the last 40 years is the need for viable areas


of local government, and this has often meant advocating the creation of larger units of government, for specific services, or as all-purpose authorities. I can remember writing more than 30 years ago, a paper on the necessity for setting up a county council of Merseyside.<br/>
I am sorry that my hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, East (Mr. Mapp) has just left the Chamber. Perhaps he expected that I would say that, for there is no question but that the creation of authorities such as a Merseyside county council or Manchester county council would impinge on the status of the surrounding areas and their economic viability. Perhaps it was for this reason as much as anything else that the Surrey Tories objected so strongly to being caught up in the creation of a Greater London Council, because by that they were robbed of rateable value and so impoverished. Perhaps Clauses 1 and 2 are not as diverse as might be thought.<br/>
In certain branches of education it is obvious that larger areas of administration are required. It is so obvious that it seems incredible to me that the Conservative Government were so bent on splitting up the London education service, obvious even on their own argument. By advocating the splitting of the education service, they were running counter to historical trends.<br/>
I ought to declare my own interests. I am a member of the London Teachers' Association, already mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Gravesend (Mr. Murray). As a teacher, I was formerly in the service of the London County Council and later the Inner London Education Authority and, of course, in the grand old days I was in the service of the Liverpool City Council, famous for many things other than education.<br/>
Over recent years, there has been constant pressure from the London Teachers' Association and parents and other educationists in London for a declaration by the Government of their determination to introduce the provisions outlined in Clause 2. There was constant opposition at the time of the Royal Commission and the introduction of the London Government Bill by the Conservative Government to the provision to split up London's

education services. Ultimately, the Government of the day bowed to the storm and set up the Inner London Education Authority.<br/>
I am told that the right hon. and learned Member for Hexham has announced to the House that the Conservative Party reserves the right to look again at the position of the Inner London Education Authority. I wonder why. Do the Opposition think that about the boroughs which were created by the 1963 Act? If the I.L.E.A. should be reviewed in 1970 and the Conservative Party feels that that should be the policy, why does it not include the boroughs?<br/>
The only educational authority to be reviewed under the London Government Act was the Inner London Education Authority. We have never been told why there should be one law for the rich, in this case the I.L.E.A., and another for the poor, in this case the outer London boroughs. There is no question that in educational matters the wealth of provision is in the Inner London Education Authority area and the poverty of provision is very often in the borough authorities outside.<br/>
If any areas were to be reviewed one would suppose them to be the areas which, educationally, appeared to be less viable as all-purpose educational authorities, rather than the Inner London Education Authority. What would happen if the Conservative view were to prevail is that the uncertainty, to which reference has already been made, might be renewed. I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Birmingham, Handsworth (Sir E. Boyle) who is, I understand, to wind up for the Opposition, is the last person ever to want to bring uncertainty into educational matters.<br/>
My hon. Friends have referred to the opinion of the President of the London Teachers' Association that this uncertainty in the past caused difficulty in recruiting teachers for the London service. The right hon. Gentleman begged to question this statement of opinion on the grounds that London has always been a magnet and that, if it was not for the quota, more teachers would come to London. There is no contradiction in these two arguments. London has always been a magnet, but it was the opinion


of the President of the L.T.A. that as a result of this uncertainty, the London service was less favourably regarded by some people outside of London than it had been previously.<br/>
London was and is a magnet because it is such an excellent educational authority. It always has been, not only because of its size and the wealth of opporturity offered to teachers and students, but because of the wide diversity of opportunities for education, administration and many other matters. There is no educational authority in the world possessing the same degree of wealth of opportunilty as the I.L.E.A.<br/>
If this review were to take place in 1970, if London education were to be split, it would create grave difficulties for London's education. The plan for the reorganisation of secondary education, announced by the I.L.E.A. recently, would go into the melting-pot. This plan provides for secondary reorganisation to be over a broad area and not on a borough basis. A review in 1970 and the splitting up of the service could wreck this planned reorganisation. Inheriting the traditions of the old L.C.C., the I.L.E.A. has set up many common services, such as advisory panels on new subjects, and on all aspects of education, as well as many other services, including library and television services.<br/>
There are also courses for teachers. All of this is only possible when one has an authority of such magnitude. There are other benefits to be gained from the present scheme and one is that the I.L.E.A. can divert teachers into areas of special difficulty. I speak as a teacher who taught in one of these areas for a long time, quite a long way from my home. It would be quite impossible to transfer teachers to deal with specific problems in this way if the education system were to be based on the boroughs.<br/>
Another provision made by the I.L.E.A. concerns special education. A borough cannot provide the diversity of special education which is provided by the I.L.E.A. and which has been built up over the years, regardless of borough boundaries. Residential schools are operated by the Authority in the country and there is a boarding school in East Anglia. There are about 23 per cent. of the secondary school population crossing

borough boundaries to go to school and an even greater figure in connection with further education.<br/>
The last educational institution in which I served in the Inner London area was the London College of Printing, a very large college, of a very specialist character. I would regard it more in the nature of a national college rather than a regional college, providing for thousands of students, some full and others part-time, and situated in the Borough of Lambeth, but having a catchment area from Brighton in the south to Hertford in the north, Reading in the west, and Southend in the east.<br/>
What borough could afford to maintain institutions of this sort, which are not to be counted in single figures in London? This is the heritage from the old L.C.C., which is being built up by the Inner London Education Authority. No borough could stand the financial strain of operating institutions such as this. I have been told of one borough, outside London, which has a very large technical college, accounting for the biggest item in the rate demand of that borough. This has made some parochially-minded councillors, attempting to cut the rates, to look first at the technical college and to ask what can be cut out there? This is the parochialism from which London has never suffered, and will not suffer if the Bill is brought into being.<br/>
We have had experience of the splitting up of other London local government services. Nursing and midwifery were split for three or four years but this scheme was abandoned after pressure from the doctors. My hon. Friend the Member for Gravesend has already mentioned child services. In my view, London has suffered since the children's service was split. We now have a situation in which welfare is the responsibility of the local borough and housing, in large measure, the responsibility of the G.L.C. This is absurd, because any London Member knows that so often a housing problem is a welfare problem, and, to tackle the housing problem satisfactorily, he has to take it first to the welfare officer. We are hamstrung because of the split responsibility. If education were to be split we would have many other similar difficulties.<br/>
I said earlier that this break-up was opposed by parents and teachers. We have, of course, a very large labour


majority in the area covered by the Inner London Education Authority. I do not believe that that is any accident. I believe that it is based largely upon Labour's record in education in London, and on the quality of service provided by the Authority. I have said before that I have fought every General Election since 1955 on successful comprehensive schools.<br/>
That has been an issue at every election I have worked on in London since I came here way back in 1950, and certainly, where we have fought the inner London elections on education, we have won them all&#x2014;at least, so far as I am concerned. There are only one or two of the more benighted boroughs where Labour's majority rule does not hold sway, but on the Inner London Education Authority Labour has a big majority.<br/>
This, I consider, reflects the confidence of most of the electors in the inner London area, most of whom are parents. It reflects their confidence in the education provided by the I.L.E.A. London education is recognised by the Royal Commission as embodying the highest standards. The case for splitting up London's education was certainly never made by the Royal Commission, and it was certainly never made by the last Conservative Government, when they introduced the London Government Bill. It has never been made by the Conservative Party at any election I have seen in London, and this Bill embodies what I think is a very reasonable proposition, that the Inner London Education Authority is a good authority and that it should be confirmed as such, for good and all.</p>

<p>I should like to apologise to the House and to my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Hexham (Mr. Rippon) for being unable to be present for the opening of the debate. I hope that the hon. Member for Woolwich, West (Mr. Handing) will forgive me if I do not follow him in his observations, for, without implying any disrespect to hon. Members who have participated in the debate, it has been a somewhat inconsequential one for the remarkable reason that all the areas affected by the Bill are affected in two different ways.<br/>
I think that I can claim that it affects my constituency perhaps more acutely than any other, and that is why I wish to say a few brief words. We had in the Ludlow division four small and ancient boroughs, names famous in Shropshire, in England and in history&#x2014;the Boroughs of Much Wenlock, Bishop's Castle, Bridgnorth and Ludlow. Those boroughs have had to go through what might be called the traumatic experience of a county review under the Local Government Act, 1958. As a member of the Salop County Council, I witnessed that rather agonising process&#x2014;and long-drawn-out it was&#x2014;at uncomfortably close quarters. We in Shropshire had the feeling that a job, which, in many respects, was painful to do, had been done and that we had achieved some measure of finality.<br/>
It would be too much to say that the conclusions of the county council had been completely accepted by the boroughs which I have mentioned, but I think that the local authorities' staffs, who, in particular, were affected, had probably resigned themselves to a new future in local government, although difficulties and unhappy individual cases have arisen. What must have been our feelings, and their feelings, when, suddenly, by the announcement that the Government, through the mouthpiece of the present Minister's predecessor, we find in Shropshire that far from having achieved any kind of finality everything apparently may once more be in the melting pot.<br/>
The present Government have apparently decided to take half a bite at one of the four principal cherries which have to be devoured. They introduced a Salop review order with the object of constituting an urban district council for what was then visualised as Dawley New Town. That review order passed this Chamber, but even that has now been thrown into doubt by the report which has been produced on the area of Wellington, Oakengates and Dawley. Therefore, even that small achievement is now once again a subject of doubt and discussion.<br/>
What we in Shropshire want to know is what faces us in the future. Not to put too fine a point upon it&#x2014;if it is, indeed, a Parliamentary phrase&#x2014;we in Shropshire feel that we are being


"proper messed up". Are we to expect that the Government will, in fact, now produce another Salop order to deal with the other areas which have not been dealt with by the previous order? Are we to have any guarantee that when the new Royal Commission reports, that we shall not once again be subjected to complete reorganisation?<br/>
I should like the Minister, who bears no personal responsibility for the mess which has been achieved in Shropshire, to give his personal attention to our problem, and try to give us, this evening, some kind of assurance which can at least give some prospect of certainty and assurance to all of those in my constituency who in their different ways have done their best to carry through the previous organisation, and whose only desire, indeed, is to get on with their proper job, which is that of proper local government in Shropshire.</p>

<p>I speak as a local government man who is now a Member of Parliament. I was 34 years in local government, and I have been a Member of Parliament for two years. It is said at times, with a degree of truth, that comparisons are supposed to be odious, but for my preference I come down on the side of local government. I have been a member and a chairman of local government committees during the past 34 years. Down through those years I have been a member of every local government committee: education, finance, fire brigade, watch, health, housing&#x2014;Uncle Tom Cobley and all. Without being pharasaical, I can say that I have had a unique experience.<br/>
Our local government, with all its faults and failings, is the envy of the world, and if one is disposed to be unfriendly or unkind to local government, it cannot be gainsaid that it has served our country well. In its long experience, local government in this country has sustained many shocks. Today, we are considering the Local Government (Termination of Reviews) Bill. Terminations appear to be the order of the day in Parliament. Indeed, the penchant for terminating things is becoming all too pronounced. I have been tempted to become a little heretical since becoming

a Member of Parliament. At times I have found myself wondering whether the Sword of Damocles would fall, and whether my experience in Parliament would be a lot more salutary than my experience in local government has ever been.<br/>
The Boundary Commission goes, and what is pertinent is: what takes its place? I was very closely in touch with the Commission, and I know that its work was monumental and went on for years. It showed great application to a very awkward task. The work of local authorities to produce the requisite evidence on which the Commission could be expected to make wise decisions was prodigious. Now, once again, everything is in the melting pot.<br/>
I gave evidence to the Boundary Commission on behalf of my own local authority in pursuance of our laudable ambitions to expand our boundaries and I was immensely impressed by the members' wisdom and knowledge, and their desire to make the right decisions. The question now to be asked is: will the remedies for many imagined defects in local government be more devastating than those alleged defects themselves?<br/>
What are the faults? I think that they are parochialism, little-mindedness and, perhaps, a lack of the dedication one could expect from men and women who have to work for their daily bread and who afterwards seek to serve their fellow men and women as members of local councils. When people work like that&#x2014;unwept, unhonoured and unsung&#x2014;there are bound to be defects and deficiencies, as has to a large extent been evident. But what is the alternative? Is it regionalisation? Is that to be the panacea of all ills?<br/>
In all sincerity, and without being supercritical or sceptical in any way, I want local government to succeed, because a great deal depends on it in the future. I am very anxious about its future, because I know that great good can accrue from it. Parliament has been lagging behind local government in its desire to get on with the work that is necessary. Would we have had our beautiful schools, our homes, our social services and all the things that go to make life bearable for people without the great co-operation of local government with


the Mother of Parliaments? It is true to say that many times local government has worked at a tremendous disadvantage. We have had to pursue our social aims when the purse-strings have been tightly drown. That has meant going to the moneylenders, to the Stock Exchange, and then asking our people to repay the loans at very high rates of interest. We may not had made the progress we have always wanted to make, but that can be explained and justified.<br/>
The shock of the recent decision was, to say the least, profound, and the question now being asked by official and by by councillor alike is: is anything worth while? The hopes and aspirations of many people in these communities have once again been dashed to the ground, but I say fervently and sincerely that even should we make an adverse decision in the future&#x2014;and a decision can be a nine-days' wonder&#x2014;people can still do a lot of good work. Whatever decision is worked out, however, let us hope that in 10 or 15 years' time we shall not once again be trying to undo the work that has been done in the meantime.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Woolwich, West (Mr. Hamling) became a little nostalgic about conditions on Merseyside years ago. The position was not resolved then, and a lot of water has since gone under the bridge&#x2014;</p>

<p>Another Daniel must come to judgment before the position is resolved on Merseyside, and many other parts of the country. I wonder at times how we shall ever get over our difficulties, and whether it is wise continually to be changing horses when crossing the stream.<br/>
The House should be in no doubt that the winding-up of the Boundary Commission was a bitter disappointment to all and sundry. Councillors, local government officers, chief constables, medical officers of health, were all genuinely disappointed by it because they saw in the Boundary Commission the way to a wider vista. It is unfortunate that the work has been ended, because it would not have meant the end of all ideas of larger areas of local government and control. It could have led the way towards regionalisation.<br/>
I am glad that I have not to explain to my people the facts of the tortuous minds of Ministers. I think that there will be a more beneficent outlook, and I will leave it there&#x2014;when I become heretical, I sometimes fall foul of my best friends. I am glad that the Minister asked, "Will you help?" I thought it a nice touch of humility. Of course I will help. It is necessary that those with experience of local government should help. Those now engaged day by day in local government can help.<br/>
It is imperative in the interests of the country that we should make changes, and I hope that the changes envisaged for the future will be successful and will enhance and enrich the lives of the people. I wish the Minister well. I am glad that he was not responsible for this decision.</p>

<p>I had better not proceed too far on that road.<br/>
This has been an interesting debate in one or two ways. The subjects in Clauses 1 and 2 no doubt are linked, but at times I thought that the debate had been rather like a recording of carols by the Elizabethan Singers, whom hon. Members may have heard&#x2014;one eventually realises that the tune and the accompaniment are connected, but it takes a little time. Further, I have never listened to a debate in which more hon. Members opposite have spoken and done a turn of work on the second bench above the Gangway.<br/>
I have two comments to make on Clause 1. First, I was very interested in the serious point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, Central (Mr. Ian Gilmour) when he suggested that local government was the sick man


of England and suggested that we needed to dramatise local government rather more. I have a lot of sympathy with him about this, bearing in mind the very great responsibilities of local education authorities nowadays. Even despite the rather frightening remarks of the Minister of State from time to time, they are still very considerable responsibilities under the Act. When considering the large resources of which they dispose, I am always bothered by the gap between the reality of the responsibility of local government and the esteem in which local government is generally held.<br/>
In a sense, my hon. Friend's reference to dramatising local government was surely not out of place, because one of the reasons why we do not take local government more seriously is that councillors so seldom appear on television, except occasionally to make stupid remarks about expenditure on the arts or the like. It is very seldom that we hear a serious contribution on television from a local councillor who has major responsibilities for a local government service.<br/>
In commenting on Clause 1 of the Bill, my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Hexham (Mr. Rippon) said that we will not get people to give up energy and time to work on commissions if they are to be treated in a cavalier fashion. I cannot help at times being struck by the gap between the work and attention that a commission gives to a subject and the outturn in terms of action taken.<br/>
That, of course, is not always true. To be frank, there have been moments when I felt that Lord Robbins has underrated the amount of his report that has been accepted both by successive Governments and by public opinion. At times, however, members of commissions must surely feel a little of the melancholy satisfaction of the Cambridge philosopher, Professor Broad, when, having finished his five-volume work on Mc-Taggart, said: "At least, I have the satisfaction of knowing more than anyone else on this one subject, save God if he exists or McTaggart if he still survives." Occasionally, that must be the melancholy satisfaction of a member of a commission. We should not make it a

habit to treat these commissions in too cavalier a fashion.<br/>
I come now to Clause 2 of the Bill. The hon. Member for Woolwich, West (Mr. Hamling) was not correct in suggesting that the decision of the previous Government to have a review in 1970 meant, in effect, a decision to split up the inner London service in 1970. At one or two points in his speech, the hon. Member used the phrase, "if the review were to take place and if London education were to be split", suggesting automatically that the one would follow the other. I contradict that straight away.</p>

<p>I am well aware that these were two successive events and that one might follow upon the other. I am not suggesting that it might happen, but it was the feeling that it might happen which lay behind the teachers' agitation.</p>

<p>I appreciate that and I shall, therefore, deal with the point.<br/>
The hon. Member also went, I thought, too far in talking about the previous Government bowing to the storm over inner London. There was never any doubt in the mind of the Ministry of Education and of successive Ministers about the undesirability of splitting up inner London education. Both Lord Eccles and I at one time or another put forward arguments on this subject. The hon. Member for Epping (Mr. Newens) quoted a paragraph of my speech on 11th December, 1962, showing how I pointed out that as one gets towards the centre of London, so the pattern of schools and technical colleges becomes less and less related to borough boundaries, and the transport system gets more closely integrated, so that parents in inner London take it for granted that their children can travel quite long distances to school.<br/>
I was glad that in that context the hon. Member for Epping talked about parental choice. I have myself quoted the figure which shows that a very high proportion&#x2014;85 per cent.&#x2014;of those in inner London were able last autumn to go to the school of their first choice. In view of the fact that hon. Members opposite have referred during the debate to comprehensive schools, I feel I should briefly reply. That figure suggests that in an authority the size of inner London it


is not impossible to have a growing number of comprehensive schools and a certain number of selective schools side by side and also to achieve a very high rate of parental choice. I certainly recognise the advantage in London of the considerably greater degree of parental choice that the larger authority brings about. The advantages within the I.L.E.A. area of boroughs being able to do things together, and of being able to use a number of common services, are also of great importance.<br/>
When I spoke on the Second Reading of the Bill in 1962, I was careful to stress that when the review took place the decision following the review would be taken strictly on educational grounds. I have looked through my speech again and I cannot discover one of the sentences which the hon. Member for Epping ascribed to me about the Government having the right to break up I.L.E.A. I did, however, say, and it seems to me to be the crux of the matter, that in 1970 it would be open to the Government to give whatever advice to Parliament they liked when they had considered where the balance of advantage lay from an educational point of view.</p>

<p>If I may correct my words, I meant that the right hon. and learned Member for Hexham (Mr. Rippon) said it in his speech today. I suggest that we check HANSARD to see what I actually said. The right hon. and learned Member said that the Opposition reserved the right to dissolve the I.L.E.A. after the review. That was the objection that I was making. I was certainly making no reference to any statement of that sort in the speech by the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Handsworth (Sir E. Boyle) on Second Reading of the London Government Bill.</p>

<p>My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Hexham supports me in emphasising that the point of his remark was that the decision should depend upon where the balance of educational advantage lay after the review had taken place.<br/>
Why did we want the review? In reply I should like to remind the House of what my right hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Powell) said in winding up the debate in

December, 1962, because he put the point precisely. He said that:
<q>It would be wrong &#x2026; that we should at this stage close our minds entirely to the possibility that we can find some effective way of bringing the boroughs, which will be administering all the other human and personal services, still more closely into contact with the administration of education."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 11th December, 1962; Vol. 669, c. 355.]</q>
In other words, while the final decision was to be taken on educational grounds, we felt that it was wrong in 1962 to close our minds entirely to the possibility of the boroughs becoming more directly associated with the education service.<br/>
There were three reasons for feeling as we did, and I should like to mention them. First, it is worth remembering that the decision to keep the London boroughs right out of education, so to speak, was a decision which many of them regretted, and to some extent this cut across party lines. That is to say, certainly there were some Labour-controlled authorities outside Inner London which regretted that they could not be in a larger scheme.</p>

<p>Did the right hon. Gentleman say outside the inner London area?</p>

<p>Yes. Equally, some boroughs in London, including some that were Labour-controlled regretted the notion that they should be excluded from any direct participation in the education service. In that connection, one had to remember the financial situation that under the 1963 Act I.L.E.A's demands had to be accepted by the Greater London Council and added to the precept on the London boroughs. The House should remember the very large sums of money involved.<br/>
Taking, for example, next year's budget figures for the I.L.E.A. area&#x2014;</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1966-11-23a.1472.2" hansard_membership_id="5450" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/15729" speakername="Mr. Hamling" colnum="1472" time="">
<p>&#x00A3;93 million.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1966-11-23a.1472.3" hansard_membership_id="1544" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/12702" speakername="Sir E. Boyle" colnum="1472" time="">
<p>The hon. Member will find that in 1966&#x2013;67 the figures are higher still. The total of the estimate for next year is &#x00A3;102 million. Even in real terms, it means that I.L.E.A.'s estimates for next year will be approximately 50 per cent. of the total expenditure on education in England and Wales for 1946&#x2013;47. Again, since it would be unreal to keep politics out of this, last year the


boroughs which were not controlled by the majority party in I.L.E.A. paid for over 50 per cent. of I.L.E.A.'s budget. In those circumstances, it was only natural that the boroughs felt strongly on the issue of being excluded from direct participation, and therefore it was right not to close our minds to the possibility of participation in some form.<br/>
But this was not the only argument in favour of the review. One point which particularly strikes me is that I.L.E.A. is the only <i>ad hoc</i> local education authority in the country. Its members are not directly elected like the members of other local education authorities.<br/>
I have always believed that there were many attractions in the idea of <i>ad hoc</i> L.E.A.'s. Before 1944, we had 316 education authorities in the country whose basic job was elementary education only. After the 1944 Act, we had 146 authorities, now increased to 166 and, over the twenty years since 1944, local administration has stretched out into further and higher education, and the whole service of education is beginning to loom very large in the local authority administrative structure. That is one side of the argument. On the other hand, if one takes education right out of general local government, it would be the last big service gone. What is left would be hardly worth creating new machinery for.<br/>
All those are important questions which are very relevant to the work of the present Royal Commission. With the whole of local government in a state of flux, and with London specifically excluded from the Royal Commission's terms of reference, surely the case for a review of I.L.E.A. is strengthened rather than weakened.<br/>
My own inclinations are on the side of a considerably smaller number of all-purpose authorties. I start with an inclination towards the sort of pattern proposed in the A.E.C's evidence to the Royal Commission which was published last week. I am speaking very much for myself on this matter, but, at a time when we are considering the whole pattern of local education administration, and when the issue of <i>ad hoc</i> local education authorities must come into question&#x2014;and when, as the hon. Member for Epping pointed out, there have been those who have

proposed an I.L.E.A. type solution for the outer boroughs&#x2014;the case for an inquiry into the workings of I.L.E.A. becomes strengthened.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1966-11-23a.1474.0" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. Handing" colnum="1474" time="">
<p>Will the right hon. Gentleman not agree that, in that case, the review should not be of I.L.E.A. but of the outer London boroughs?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1966-11-23a.1474.1" hansard_membership_id="1544" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/12702" speakername="Sir E. Boyle" colnum="1474" time="">
<p>The experience of I.L.E.A. is surely the unique experience here. After all, the outer London boroughs are not all that differently placed from many other smaller boroughs&#x2014;and not only the smaller ones because, as I pointed out in 1962, a good many of the outer London ring are considerably larger boroughs than a number of county boroughs in the country as a whole.<br/>
The third argument for the review is that in another respect, also, I.L.E.A. is in a peculiar position. The whole rationale of I.L.E.A. is that all its members should be interested in education. If one is a member of an ordinary county council or county borough, one has to specialise in one's local government responsibilities. But the logic of the 1962 Act was that all I.L.E.A. members should be interested in education. Yet one knows that a number of them, while they are compelled to serve because they are G.L.C. members, are primarily interested in other subjects. In practice I.L.E.A. has become increasingly yet another committee of the G.L.C. in a manner not envisaged when the London Government Act was passed.<br/>
These are some of the reasons why we believed that the review was right in 1962, and why we still think it should be retained. I would make the last point that I do not think that there are only two alternatives here; namely, either to scrap the review or to split up and Balkanise inner London education. I do not think that those are the only two possible alternatives.<br/>
Even if one holds the view that, on balance, as we have believed hitherto, the unified service in inner London should be kept, there are alternative methods of organising education in inner London. As the House will know, the membership of I.L.E.A. consists partly of all members of the G.L.C. elected from the inner area constituencies, partly of one member sent up from each inner


London borough, and partly of 16 additional members appointed on a party basis&#x2014;</p>

<p>No. I think that I am giving the correct analysis of the membership of I.L.E.A. itself&#x2014;the members of the G.L.C. elected from the inner area, then one member from each borough, and 16 members appointed on a party basis. If I am wrong, perhaps the Minister will correct me.</p>

<p>If I am wrong, I apologise. But I am not sure this is a point of great substance, since in any case the Education Committee is the important body. I understand that the meetings of I.L.E.A. are fairly short and formal.<br/>
My point is that the constitution of the body to administer education in inner London is not something which we should look upon as immutable. For example, it would be possible to increase the numbers sent up as educational specialists from the inner London boroughs. It would be possible to go even further, and have the whole of education run by some kind of joint committee of the inner boroughs. In other words, the point which I make is that, without fragmenting the education of inner London and whilst retaining the old L.C.C. boundaries, there are a number of patterns in which it would be possible to identify the boroughs more directly with the education service. We can discuss the matter at greater length and, if I have misinformed the House, I will take the opportunity of apologising when we reach the Committee stage and deal with Clause 2.<br/>
For these reasons we are not convinced that it is right to dispense with the review which we put into the London Government Act. While I feel as strongly

as ever that the case for maintaining the Inner London Education area intact in 1962 was an overwhelming one, and while I re-emphasise that the result of any review should be based entirely on educational grounds and no others, none the less, there is a strong case for having an inquiry into the workings of I.L.E.A. and considering what is the best pattern of educational administration for the area.<br/>
It is for those reasons that, when we get to the Committee stage, we shall vote against Clause 2.</p>

<p>I sympathise with the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Hands-worth (Sir E. Boyle) in as much as Clauses 1 and 2, while linked in a sense, nevertheless have a detached and separate purpose, as he has rightly said. It has been a little difficult to keep track of the debate as, quite properly, different hon. Members have made their divers contributions on the various aspects in which they are interested.<br/>
Before I come to Clause 2, which is my principal responsibility, I should like to take up some of the points which have been raised in connection with Clause 1, dealing with the dissolution of the local government commissions and the discontinuance of the county reviews.<br/>
It is obvious that one has no need to explain further the position in regard to the Local Government Commission for Wales, because it has finished its labours and, as my right hon. Friend said, its discharge through this Clause is a mere formality.<br/>
Clause 1 is a direct, and necessary, and I think desirable, consequence of the appointment of the Royal Commission on Local Government in England, a Commission which has been charged to undertake a completely comprehensive review of local government, with terms of reference wide enough to take account of the linked, and in my view inseparable, aspects of structure, function, and finance. I think that it must be clear to anyone who has studied the results of the labours of the Local Government Commissions, that the terms of reference have been too limited really to produce wholly satisfactory results in a field of such complexity,


where it is under pressure from rapidly changing circumstances in the modern world.<br/>
Clearly, once having appointed a Royal Commission for this purpose, it would be an unnecessary duplication to perpetuate the Local Government Commissions. Nevertheless, my right hon. Friend has made it clear that the recommendations made to date by those Commissions, and by the county reviews, will not be ignored, and I think that it was a little misleading for the right hon. and learned Member for Hexham (Mr. Rippon) to suggest that this decision represented a decision to do nothing.</p>

<p>I think that the right hon. Gentleman should already be aware of quite a number of cases where decisions have been reached by the Minister consequent on recommendations made by the Local Government Commissions. I shall not weary the House with a list of them, though I have it here, and I think that it would be permissible to give the right hon. and learned Gentleman the information which he desires and which I am sure will convince him that he was not correct in saying that this decision represents doing nothing.</p>

<p>My right hon. Friend has made it clear, likewise, that in so far as any decisions have not become operative where firm recommendations have been made, these will be considered on their merits, and will be the subject of Orders placed before the House. I think that it has to be borne in mind, before too much is made of the suggestion that the work of the Local Government Commissions has been wasted, that the results of that work will clearly be available, from within the more limited terms of reference under which they have laboured, to the Royal Commission in considering these wider issues under these wider terms of reference.<br/>
During the debate on this Clause I thought that I detected a divergence of view among hon. Gentlemen opposite. The right hon. and learned Member for

Hexham seemed to dismiss the concept of the Royal Commission and the discharge of the Local Government Commissions as the evasion of Ministerial responsibility. One could not be other than impressed with the right hon. and learned Gentleman's plea about the need for a quick decision, and indeed he represented his party as virtually ready to jump in with well thought out solutions to these problems.<br/>
I thought that his hon. Friend the Member for Northants, South (Mr. Arthur Jones) rather upset his plea in this regard when he begged the Government to be hesitant in their approaches to this problem, underlining the complexity of it, and telling us that it was of a varied character throughout the country, an argument which I should have thought justified a comprehensive review by the Royal Commission.</p>

<p>I made the comment in the context of the thinking aloud process in which the right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the House exercised himself in his capacity as Minister of Housing and Local Government. This is where the caution should have been.</p>

<p>I appreciated what the hon. Gentleman was getting at, but I think that he was quite right to underline the fact that, contrary to the view expressed by the right hon. and learned Member for Hexham, one cannot dash into local government and pretend&#x2014;and it is a pretence&#x2014;that one knows all the answers to this complex problem. I think that we have all to come to the conclusion, looking at the picture as a whole, that what is necessary is a comprehensive review of the character of the problem, which is now possible under the terms of reference of the Royal Commission.<br/>
The right hon. and learned Member for Hexham made some play of the speech of my right hon. Friend the Lord President of the Council, when he was Minister in charge of the responsible Department, when he addressed the conference of the A.M.C. in 1965. He quoted my right hon. Friend as saying that he had rejected the idea of discharging the Local Government Commissions. If my right hon. Friend did modify his decision, or his view, on this


matter as a result of considerable discussions with local authority associations and others, perhaps I might point out that he is not the first Minister, on either side, to change his mind. Indeed, this was demonstrated to be very much the case in relation to the subject on which I shall touch in a moment, and which falls under Clause 2. All Ministers, on both sides, changed their views on that subject when they were in office.<br/>
The hon. Member for Norfolk, Central (Mr. Ian Gilmour) welcomed the discharge of the Local Government Commissions. He did so very cheerfully, I thought, and made a number of interesting suggestions in connection with local government reform, many of which will, I am sure, come within the review of the Royal Commission, as they deservedly should. I was glad to hear the hon. Gentleman's reference to what I thought was a somewhat exaggerated view of local government as "sick" taken up by his hon. Friend the Member for Northants, South, and also by my hon. Friend the Member for Preston, South (Mr. Peter Mahon), and I join in paying tribute to those engaged in local government.<br/>
I do not pretend that local government does not have its problems. Of course it does. It has very serious problems, but I agree with what the right hon. and learned Member for Hexham said about the need perhaps to dramatise local government a little more. Those who are engaged in local government give their services voluntarily, as members of all political parties. They do so with a deep sense of public duty. Often they fail to realise that they are not making an impact on the general electorate, and to realise the importance of the job they are doing, and I join in the tributes which have been paid to them. Local government has been one of the most socially beneficial forces in this country, and we should not exaggerate its problems to the point of suggesting that it is sick to the degree which I thought the hon. Gentleman was implying.<br/>
We all realise that one of the major difficulties confronting local government today is the problem of the rapid change in the modern world, changes in population, developments in industry, and so on. The structure and finance of local government

have clearly not kept pace with these changes, and I suggest that it is not possible to find an adequate solution except by means of a comprehensive review.<br/>
One of the besetting difficulties in the past&#x2014;and it is a difficulty which has faced not only this Government, but the previous Conservative Administration&#x2014;is that of securing agreement between the local authority associations themselves. To carry the local authority associations with one, it is clearly necessary to do so by conviction. It is significant in this context that the decision to set up a Royal Commission has received a general welcome from the main local authority associations. I think that this is of the greatest significance. Many of the current difficulties to which reference has been made, and the local problems into which I am sure the House would not expect me to be drawn in detail this afternoon, are demonstrations of the need for a review of the kind which the Royal Commission will make possible.<br/>
The hon. Member for Poole (Mr. Murton)&#x2014;and I think that it may have found expression elsewhere&#x2014;took up the suggestion made by the former Minister that the Royal Commission might be expected to finish its labours within two years. I am asked whether I can reaffirm that kind of assurance. No Minister can dictate to a Royal Commission and say precisely by what time it should finish its labours and prepare its report. This was a firm declaration, hope and expectation on the part of the Minister of the day. The Commission has already got down to its task very energetically, and we have the utmost confidence in its chairman and members, who well recognise the urgency of the problems with which they will have to deal.<br/>
I now turn to Clause 2, which is designed to remove the uncertainty hanging over the London education service&#x2014;an uncertainty which has been hanging over it for the past six years. As the Secretary of State for Education and Science said when he made his announcement last November of the intention to introduce legislation to this effect,
<q>This uncertainty &#x2026; must be removed, and the Authority itself must be given confidence to embark on long-term plans without the threat of further upheaval."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 18th November, 1965; Vol. 720, c. 1347.]</q>


The right hon. and learned Member for Hexham suggests, without very great definition, that it was the activities of the I.L.E.A. which were responsible for the alleged gerrymandering by the Government with the elections next year. It ill becomes hon. Members opposite to talk about political gerrymandering when we recall the London Government Act, 1963. The hon. Member for Norfolk, Central is na&#x00EF;ve in the extreme if he imagines that he can persuade us that that Measure was entirely devoid of any consideration of party political advantage.<br/>
The right hon. and learned Gentleman says emphatically that his party reserves the right to review and dissolve the I.L.E.A. if again it should have such an opportunity. I am sure that those concerned with the administration of the service, and all those who have protested so vigorously against the threat hanging over the I.L.E.A. for six years, will take careful note of the significance of his remarks.</p>

<p>It is important that the hon. Gentleman should not misquote what I said. I said that we reserved the right to review the operation of the Inner London Education Authority, and either to dissolve it or to amend its composition or structure in a way that seemed necessary to us. As my right hon. Friend explained, those decisions would be taken on educational grounds. We have in mind a wide review, and it is wrong for the hon. Gentleman to give the impression that we have any intention to dissolve the I.L.E.A. We have given a pledge to review its activities.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1966-11-23a.1481.1" hansard_membership_id="11256" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/19951" speakername="Mr. Redhead" colnum="1481" time="">
<p>I am sure that the purport of what the right hon. and learned Gentleman has said in further explanation of his point of view will be evaluated in the light of experience by those concerned with the administration of the I.L.E.A.<br/>
The right hon. and learned Gentleman complains that the action to be taken in the Bill is virtually to freeze local government. I am entitled to point out that, on the contrary, the relevant Clause thaws the freeze of uncertainty imposed by the review provisions of the Act.<br/>
It is worth reminding the House of the origins of this period of uncertainty. They were to be found in the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Local Government in London&#x2014;the Herbert Report

&#x2014;when the Royal Commission recommended the division of functions respecting education between the Greater London Council and the 52 proposed new London boroughs. The recommendations were imprecise and left many important issues concerning the division of functions between the varying authorities to be settled by discussion and agreement, itself a process which would have been productive of a great deal of delay and uncertainty.<br/>
It is pertinent to recall that the Royal Commission did not challenge the efficiency or adequacy of the then existing service in the L.C.C. area, which it recognised had developed as a unit with conspicuous success. Indeed, in its Report it paid tribute, in words which were quoted by my hon. Friend the Member for Gravesend (Mr. Murray). It said:
<q>We also have it very much in mind that the educational system of the L.C.C. has won a high reputation for itself not only in Greater London and the country as a whole but also in countries abroad.</q>
I would have thought that that was an incontrovertible conclusion on the part of anyone who took a really objective view of the educational system in the L.C.C. area. I want to add my tribute to the magnificent job that this body has done throughout its existence, both in its present form and previously as the London County Council.<br/>
It is not surprising that the recommendations of the Royal Commission were described as a "leap in the dark" for which no valid reason was given in the Report. They aroused widespread apprehension which was not confined to the L.C.C. or to political parties, for 7,500 teachers within the London area responded immediately by sending a petition to the L.C.C. urging that authority to resist the recommendations of the Commission, while the London Group of Parent-Teacher Associations indicated that not only teachers, but also parents were concerned by passing a resolution
<q>That the London Group of Parent-Teacher Associations seeks the co-operation of the National Federation in its efforts to oppose the findings of the Royal Commission on Local Government in so far as it seeks to set up a radically different body as the education authority for London.</q>
There is no question that the point and purpose of the Royal Commission's recommendations were widely resisted by


all those who had a deep and passionate interest in education in London.<br/>
In November, 1961, the Government of the day published a White Paper rejecting the Royal Commission's recommendations in the form presented in the Report, proposing instead the establishment of borough education authorities, and a smaller number of larger boroughs for the whole of the Greater London area, except for an inner ring for which there should be a central area authority comprising a population of about 2 million.<br/>
That proposal&#x2014;it is interesting to note at this stage&#x2014;involved the cutting off of one-third or more of the existing L.C.C. education service. Bearing in mind the words of the right hon. Member for Handsworth this afternoon and his disavowal of any definite intention to split up the service, I am entitled to remind him that this alternative action, proposed by the Government of the day, to the recommendations of the Royal Commission was a measure of fragmentation of that service.<br/>
The alternative proposal did nothing to mollify those who opposed the original Royal Commission recommendations. The London Group of Parent-Teacher Associations mounted a campaign which it carried to Parliament, and it was not without significance that six teacher organisations in London banded together in united opposition to the Government's proposals as laid down in the White Paper. When six main teacher organisations band together in complete unity we can believe that they are concerned with a matter of some importance. Many other local manifestations were apparent at that time. Parents, teachers, managers, and governors throughout the London area protested vigorously about the then Government's proposals.<br/>
The reasons for this opposition, and the apprehensions that existed and were so widely expressed, are not far to seek. They will remain&#x2014;and this is why I mention them now&#x2014;in the minds of those concerned so long as uncertainty about the future persists. The L.C.C. service was built up as a unit and was planned for the area as a whole, with a degree of flexibility to which several hon. Members have referred, allowing for mobility across metropolitan borough boundaries

of teachers, specialists and pupils, to permit the exercise of a fair and reasonable degree of parental choice, whereas fragmentation would have brought its inevitable problems in special education, where the provision is obviously best made in the large area.<br/>
It would have left us in the difficulties to which my hon. Friend the Member for Epping (Mr. Newens) referred, that fragmentation of this character would have resulted in some areas being possessed of more provision than they required, while others were being denuded of it. This is true of playing fields, school meals, and technical education, to mention only a few.<br/>
Many of the centralised services of the I.L.E.A., built up as a result of the resources available to an authority of this size and character, could not possibly have been sustained by the multiplicity of boroughs which would have come into the picture even under the Government's recommendations and proposals of that time.<br/>
The upshot of all this was, of course, that the Government bowed partly to the opposition. They decided that the L.C.C. education service should be taken over as it stood and administered by a committee of the G.L.C. This was embraced ultimately in the London Government Act of 1963, which provided for the establishment of the present day I.L.E.A. But the Government's surrender to the opposition was only partial and the respite for the authority only temporary, for it was conditioned by the review Clauses, which we now seek to repeal.<br/>
When the announcement of this decision was made, the Education Committee of the G.L.C. recorded this view, which it is still appropriate to quote today:
<q>The Government's decision to transfer the education service as it stands to a committee of the Greater London Council is an implicit acceptance of the arguments consistently advanced by the Council that the service is one and indivisible and to that extent is to be welcomed. It is, however, a matter for regret that it appears from the wording of the Minister's statement, that the education service has not been given a permanent release from the threat overhanging it. As a result there is likely to be a period of uncertainty and anxiety during which the education service will suffer, with the possibility that at the end of or during the five year period the service might still be broken up. It is to be hoped, therefore, that the final word has not been said. If uncertainties about the future are not to impede the


progressive development of the London education service, its continued existence should be unequivocally confirmed.</q>
We on this side persistently opposed these review Clauses, as the record shows, at every stage&#x2014;both in this House and in another place.<br/>
The London Teachers' Association, having formed a liaison committee with their fellow associations, mounted a Parliamentary campaign of a vigorous character such as will be long remembered by those who were in the House at the time. Our opposition to the review Clauses, we made clear, was on the grounds that the review was unnecessary, that it perpetuated an undesirable degree of uncertainty, with the possibly deleterious effects which might follow.<br/>
That all these deleterious effects may not have followed and that apprehensions might perhaps have been a little greater than has proved to be justified in recent years is perhaps not unconnected with the fact that this Party made its opposition clear in this matter and its intentions clear for the future and, furthermore, that it won the General Elections of 1964 and 1966 and was, therefore, able to give a measure of encouragement to those who might otherwise still have felt that the threat was very severe.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Hands-worth gave his reasons for feeling that the review was a desirable thing to provide for and even canvassed alternative possibilities to either the review or a split-up. He is very beguiling in references of this character and I am prepared to accept his own good faith and an expression of his personal point of view. However, although I would be very happy in many respects to accept what the right hon. Gentleman's intentions are, the future does not necessarily lie with him exclusively. I would prefer

to have something much firmer in the way of removing the threat than the assurances blandly, but sincerely, given by the right hon. Gentleman.<br/>
For that reason, I look for the removal of these review Clauses. Nothing which has happened since has changed our view in the slightest, nor has it changed that of informed opinion. Following my right hon. Friend's announcement of 17th November, 1965, of the intention to introduce legislation of this kind, the London Teachers' Association passed the resolution quoted earlier by my hon. Friend the Member for Gravesend and today my right hon. Friend received a letter from the same organisation, which says:
<q>You will remember that my colleagues and I have discussed with you from time to time the possibility of deleting the Review Clauses from the London Government Act. I write now to inform you that the London Teachers' Association, representing the majority of teachers in the area of the Inner London Education authority, welcomes the London Government (Review Clauses) Bill and regards it as a just outcome of the struggle against the effort to break up the excellent educational service established and maintained by the London County Council for so many years.</q>
<q>We are very glad that you have at last been able to find Parliamentary time to take this amending Bill, and we hope that it is passed with the minimum of trouble".</q>
It is signed by the General Secretary of the Association.<br/>
I think that this makes it clear where those who are so vitally concerned with London's education stand on this matter. I invite the House to endorse that view by according the Bill a Second Reading.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.<br/>
The purpose of the Bill, which has come to this House from another place, is to enable the United Kingdom to ratify the Convention for the Settlement of Investment Disputes, a Convention which was negotiated and agreed under the auspices of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The background to the Convention is described in the report of the Executive Directors of the Bank, issued in Washington on 18th March, 1965, and published in this country as Command 2745 of August, 1965.<br/>
The Governors of the International Bank turned their attention to the desirability of sponsoring institutional facilities for the settlement of investment disputes between States and foreign investors in 1962, and, at their request, the Executive Directors of the Bank conducted a very full programme of consultation leading to the drawing up of the Convention, which is now included as the Schedule to the Bill.<br/>
Consultative meetings were held on a regional basis in Addis Ababa, Santiago in Chile, Geneva and Bangkok. Legal experts from no fewer than 86 countries took part, so no one can complain that the ground was not thoroughly prepared&#x2014;</p>

<p>&#x2014;which I am sure is a very comforting thought for the noble Lord and myself, neither of whom, I think, is very learned in the law.<br/>
The authorities of the Bank have made it clear that they consider that the proposed arrangements under their aegis will be a major step towards promoting an atmosphere of mutual confidence between States and foreign investors, thus stimulating a larger flow of private international capital into those countries which wish

to approve it. The United Kingdom played a prominent part in the negotiation of the Convention and was the second country to sign it. In all, about 50 countries have now signed, of which 22 have completed ratification. Provision was made that, after the 20th ratification, the Convention should come into force, so that has now been achieved.<br/>
The Convention provides for the establishment, under the auspices of the International Bank, of a Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes, to which disputes between States and nationals of other States arising out of investment may be submitted. For a dispute to be within the jurisdiction of the centre, it must satisfy two criteria. It must be a legal dispute raising directly out of an investment and it must be between a State and a national of another State.<br/>
The Centre will not itself engage in conciliation or arbitration activities. This will be the task of the conciliation negotiators and arbitral tribunals constituted in accordance with the provisions of the Convention. The organs of the Centre will be the Administrative Council, which will be composed of representatives of the contracting States and the Secretariat.<br/>
Recourse to the settlement procedures laid down in the Convention is voluntary in that it is subject to the consent of both parties, but Her Majesty's Government believe that the existence of this new Convention is a significant new step forward and that it offers an important additional safeguard for British investors overseas.<br/>
The settlement provisions of the Convention applying to disputes between States and foreign private investors&#x2014;including, of course, companies&#x2014;differ from the provisions of the International Court of Justice, before which only States may appear. An important international need is thus fulfilled by the Convention.<br/>
As a country with massive overseas investments, totalling not far short of &#x00A3;10,000 million, the United Kingdom has a particular interest in participating in drawing up the rules of procedure for conciliation and arbitration proceedings under the Convention. In order to participate in the drawing up of these rules, we must ratify the Convention as soon as possible and thus obtain membership


of the Administrative Council, which will perform this task.<br/>
There are three main aspects of the Convention which require legislation in the United Kingdom. First, we must provide for the enforcement in this country of arbitral awards made under the Convention. The Arbitration Act, 1950, cannot appropriately be applied to proceedings under the Convention. The procedure of the registration of awards has, therefore, been adopted. They will be registered in the High Court in England and Wales, in the High Court in Northern Ireland and in the Court of Session in Scotland. They will then have the same force and effect for the performance of execution as the judgments of these courts. The procedure is, in some respects analogous to that provided by the Foreign Judgments Reciprocal Enforcement Act, 1933.<br/>
This is the main requirement for legislation, but we must, of course, give legal effect in this country to the provisions of Articles 18 to 24 of the Convention&#x2014;set out in the Schedule to the Bill&#x2014;concerning the status, immunities and privileges of the Centre, of members of its Administrative Council and Secretariat and of persons taking part in conciliation or arbitration proceedings under the Convention. I should, perhaps, point out, since the House is always very much concerned with the matter of immunities and privileges, that no person is granted immunity from legal process extending beyond the exercise of his functions under the Convention, and no person is given any Customs privileges.<br/>
As I made clear, the Centre will be in Washington. The Administrative Council and Secretariat will also be established there. Proceedings Under the Convention will normally take place at the Centre and although there is provision for them to be held elsewhere, if necessary, there is no reason to expect that proceedings in this country will take place in other than the most exceptional cases. There is, therefore, no question of adding to the number of diplomatic privileged persons permanently resident in this country.<br/>
We must also make provision to enable the Treasury to meet any financial obligations in the United Kingdom arising out of Article 17 of the Convention. I

am happy to inform the House that it is our belief that the costs of the Centre will be relatively small. Fees will be charged for the use of its facilities and the International Bank has agreed, under the Convention, to provide premises and various services. The contingency liability of the United Kingdom is, therefore, only to contribute to any deficit which might remain after the charges and other receipts have been taken into account.<br/>
Clauses 1 and 2 deal with the enforcement of awards given under the Convention by the procedure of the registration of awards. An arbitral award may be registered in the High Court in so far as the pecuniary obligations under the award have not already been satisfied; and they are, naturally, subject to compliance with the rules of court. There is a provision for making rules for a stay of execution of an award in certain circumstances, in accordance with the Convention.<br/>
Clause 3 will enable the Lord Chancellor to make the relevant provisions of the Arbitration Act, 1950, and the Foreign Tribunals Evidence Act, 1856, apply for the securing of evidence for the purposes of conciliation or arbitration proceedings under the Convention. There is a special provision concerning Scotland, for which, under Clause 7, an alternative form of Clause 3 is provided.<br/>
Clause 4 gives legal effect, so far as this is necessary, to the provisions of the Convention concerning status, immunities and privileges. With one exception, the provisions of this Clause do not extend the immunities and privileges which may be accorded by Order in Council under the International Organisations (Immunities and Privileges) Act, 1950, in respect of an international organisation to which that Act applies. That Act provides for the grant of immunities and privileges for agents, counsel and advocates of suitors to the International Court. It does not, however, apply to persons&#x2014;including parties, agents, counsel, witnesses or experts&#x2014;in proceedings under the Convention and who are required to be accorded limited immunities and privileges under Article 22 of the Convention. It is therefore necessary under this Act to extend to those persons the limited privileges which are required.<br/>
I have already dealt with the financial position, which is referred to in Clause 5. Clause 6 is the normal extension of the Act to dependent territories, if required, and then, as I have said, Clause 7 makes reference to the application of the Act to Scotland and provides for the necessary substitutions to meet the legal traditions North of the Border. Similarly, Clause 8 extends its application to Northern Ireland and makes the necessary provisions for that.<br/>
The Schedule, which, in effect, contains the main substance of the matter, is the Convention itself. We are asking the House to accept the Convention, with the necessary provisions, in the main portion of the Bill, putting it into effect in this country.<br/>
This is a short and somewhat technical Measure, but we believe that it is a very useful piece of international machinery. It should do something to assist the flow of investment between the developed and developing countries. It is interesting to note that of the signatories who have already acceded to the Convention, a very large number are Commonwealth countries in Africa and Asia. I am glad to say that we have an opportunity tonight to make it clear that we in the United Kingdom support the Convention and are anxious to put it into effect at the earliest possible moment.</p>

<p>The hon. Lady, in her concluding remarks, said that the Bill is a rather technical one. The House is indebted to her for the careful explanation of the Bill, and also, although we appreciate that it is not open to amendment in the House, for her explanation of the main articles of the Convention appended to the Bill.<br/>
I think we all accept that it is desirable, both in the interests of investing countries such as ours and of recipient countries, often under-developed countries, that gradually there should be established an international system of protecting foreign investment. The sense of insecurity which exists in many parts of the world is one of the major impediments standing in the way of investing in under-developed countries. Any Bill which goes some way towards diminishing that sense of insecurity which investors must inevitably feel is worthy of support.<br/>
As the hon. Lady explained, this Bill deals with one aspect of setting up an international system. It deals with the need to set up international machinery for conciliation and arbitration. We certainly welcome the Bill, but I think the hon. Lady would be the first to recognise with me that it is no more than a fairly limited step forward in a field where a great deal of work has still to be done. In her introduction of the Bill, she said that as long ago as 1962 the Executive Directors of the World Bank were asked to prepare the draft Convention which we are discussing.<br/>
The period of time which has elapsed since then is an indication of how difficult it is to make progress in this field, but, although this is a fairly limited Bill, it is only right that we should look at it in the light of other advances which we realise are being planned. Attention is being given, not only to the setting up of an international system for conciliation and arbitration covered by this Bill, but of other aspects of an international system. The O.E.C.D. has before it a draft charter of an international-governmental guarantee scheme and has also prepared a draft convention on the protection of foreign property.<br/>
The Convention appended to this Bill, which sets up an international centre for the settlement of investment disputes, is an essential part of this process of establishing a more widespread system of international machinery which will help to create conditions of confidence, but its jurisdiction is very limited in scope. Its jurisdiction is confined to disputes of a legal nature, I think rightly, excluding disputes of a political nature, but also excluding economic and commercial disputes. Its jurisdiction is also confined to disputes between contracting States and the nationals of other contracting States. I understand that it would not be open to an individual in a dispute over a legal matter concerning investments with a company in another State to refer the matter to the arbitration tribunal.<br/>
The most important limitation which we must recognise is that disputes can be referred to the arbitration tribunal only if both parties to the dispute agree, if the investor who feels aggrieved or the contracting State which is the recipient of the investment both agree that the matter should be referred to the arbitration


tribunal. It is not possible for an aggrieved individual to refer his dispute unless the assent of the contracting State has already been obtained.<br/>
Although in many respects the powers given to the International Centre and the arbitration tribunal under the Convention are very limited, we welcome Article 25 in particular. That ensures that when the parties have referred their disputes to the arbitration tribunal it is not open to them unilaterally to withdraw from the discretion of the tribunal.<br/>
We also welcome the Bill because we believe it is in our country's interests that legislation of this kind should be passed. Any move towards setting up an international system to protect investments must be valuable to a country such as ours which depends overwhelmingly, or in very large degree, for its economic health on our overseas investments. The hon. Lady mentioned that our private long-term investments overseas amount to close on &#x00A3;10,000 million. She will correct me if I am wrong, but I think that no other country in the world has as high an investment overseas per head of the population. As a major investing country overseas, we have a special interest in setting up an international system for conciliation and arbitration.<br/>
It seems that the value of this legislation is not confined to investing countries such as ours. The greater beneficiaries will be the under-developed countries. Many of them are desperately in need of investment, but they are surrounded by conditions of insecurity which are enough to frighten off investors who, given conditions of greater security, would happily have invested in them.<br/>
In general terms, the Bill is welcome to us. However, I wish to ask the hon. Lady one or two questions with a view to obtaining some information. She rightly pointed out that the Convention has now been signed by a considerable number of countries and a considerable number have ratified it. When reading the list of signatures, one notices that European countries, Asiatic countries and, as she said, many countries in Africa have appended their signatures. It is noticeable that no Latin-American signatures are appended to the Convention. One would have thought that the

Latin-American countries would have benefited considerably from such machinery as is being established under the Convention. Would the hon. Lady explain why the Latin-American countries have not signed or ratified the Convention?<br/>
My next question concerns the nature of the law on which arbitration tribunals will base their decisions. I speak as a layman, but it seems that the kind of issues which will be taken to the tribunal will be issues where the international law is uncertain or where national laws conflict&#x2014;where the national law of the investor conflicts with the national law of the contracting State. If there is a dispute of this nature where the parties disagree as to which law should be applied, which law will be used by the arbitration tribunal in coming to its decision? If the hon. Lady could enlighten me on this, I shall much appreciate it.<br/>
Lastly, I turn to that part of the Convention which defines the status, immunities and privileges of the International Centre. This is contained in Articles 18 to 24. I accept that this International Centre will be established in Washington.<br/>
I am happy to accept her assurance that the number of persons in this country who under the Bill and Convention will be granted diplomatic immunity will be very limited. Presumably they will be confined solely to officials of the International Centre who visit this country on official business.<br/>
None the less, the privileges and immunities granted to the centre and to its officials are extensive. Article 20 reads:
<q>The Centre, its property and assets shall enjoy immunity from all legal process, except when the Centre waives this immunity.</q>
My query arises because the World Bank enjoys only limited legal immunity. From my reading of Articles 18 and 20, the Centre is given full legal immunity and personality. Under Article 18, the Centre can enter into contracts and initiate legal proceedings. Article 18 reads:
<q>The Centre shall have full international legal personality. The legal capacity of the Centre shall include the capacity
<ol>
<li>(<i>a</i>) to contract;</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) to acquire and dispose of movable and immovable property;</li>
<li>(<i>c</i>) to institute legal proceedings."</li>
</ol></q>


I am sure that there are good reasons why such extensive legal immunity should be given to the Centre, but as a layman I do not quite see why the Centre should have the power to enter into contracts with individuals and also institute legal proceedings, even against people in this country, whilst, on the other hand, an individual or State has not the right to institute legal proceedings against the Centre. I am sure that a lawyer would find a simple explanation, but it would be valuable if ordinary Members could be given some explanation of the apparently very extensive powers which the Centre is given.<br/>
I do not wish to delay the House, because the Bill has our support. It is a rather technical Bill and, I should have, thought, more suited to discussion by lawyers or financiers than by ordinary Members. None the less, in international terms the Bill is a step in the right direction. It establishes machinery for the international settlement of legal disputes involving investments and, as such, it will help to create a climate in which investment overseas can flourish and trade between developed and underdeveloped countries expand.<br/>
If the Convention achieves this, it will be a minor but worth-while advance towards bridging the gap between the richer countries and the poorer ones, a gap which we know all too well is steadily widening at present. The Convention has already been ratified by many other Parliaments and the International Centre is already being established in Washington. So we are happy to help the Bill forward on to the Statute Book as soon as possible.</p>

<p>I, too, am glad that we are to ratify the Convention, in which I have taken a certain amount of interest at the Council of Europe. The Convention has an even longer history than that mentioned by the hon. Lady the Minister of State, in that attempts have been made in many international organisations to get such a Convention. O.E.C.D. was mentioned by my noble Friend the Member for Hertford (Lord Balniel). The United Nations have tried. So has the Council of Europe.<br/>
At first sight, it might seem rather strange that an organisation such as the

World Bank should have succeeded where the efforts of other international organisations have foundered. It has been a long job. As the hon. Lady said, there has been consultation in such far away places as Bangkok, Santiago and Addis Ababa. Another interesting fact is that the legal representatives of no fewer than 61 countries have taken a part in the drafting of the Convention. So there is no fear of the Convention being imposed by the rich investing countries on the poorer countries.<br/>
The Convention has one or two interesting points. My noble Friend said that it is possible for a system of law which is foreign to both the disputants to be the law which is applied in their dispute. Another curious fact is that I think that this is the first occasion on which a national of a particular State can summon a State itself before a tribunal. I think that this is a new departure in international law.<br/>
As with all these Conventions where so many countries are involved, to get agreement there has had to be a considerable consensus and a glossing over of difficulties. It is a pity that there is no provision for compulsory arbitration. As a result, the Convention is undoubtedly weakened.<br/>
I want to call attention to one or two other weaknesses. Article 25(4) states:
<q>Any Contracting State may, at the time of ratification, acceptance or approval of this Convention or at any time thereafter, notify the Centre of the class or classes of disputes which it would or would not consider submitting to the jurisdiction of the Centre.</q>
Therefore, even after ratification, a State can still back out of the provisions of the Convention if it finds it inconvenient to apply them in a dispute with a private individual. This is a considerable weakness.<br/>
Another weakness is contained in Article 26, which states:
<q>A Contracting State may require the exhaustion of local administrative or judicial remedies as a condition of its consent to arbitration under this Convention.</q>
By this means a person with a legal grievance might be held up for years in the courts of the State where the investment took place&#x2014;we have seen something similar to this in many Latin American countries&#x2014;before he could go to arbitration; and he might then well


experience difficulties and have <i>res judicata</i> raised against him when he did.<br/>
Another weakness is that there is no definition in the Convention of what is an investment. I suppose we all know what "investment" is. A long-term loan would undoubtedly be investment. Is a short-term loan an investment; and, if so, how short must it be? It is a pity that in this respect also it was not possible to get any consensus on a possible definition of "investment".<br/>
I entirely agree that ratification of the Convention will improve the investment climate. The private investor will be more inclined to invest in a country which has ratified the Convention, and it will, therefore, be a good thing. It is a pity, as my noble Friend the Member for Hertford (Lord Balniel) said, that the Latin-American countries have not seen fit to ratify, and I have a sneaking suspicion that the association of the Centre with Washington may to some slight extent be a reason why the Latin American countries do not want to ratify the Convention. I wonder whether Washington is necessarily the best place for the Centre or whether it should be divided between, say, three regional sub-centres, so that there would be no feeling that it was something run by the United States.<br/>
As I said, I am glad that we are to ratify the Convention. We have quite a good record in ratifying conventions. I believe that we are one of the first of the so-called developed nations to do so, but there are still many conventions which we have not ratified. For people like my noble Friend and myself who take part in the work of organisations such as the Council of Europe and who spend a lot of time thinking about how we can improve international arrangements by harmonising laws, it is very annoying when a convention is drafted and we cannot then persuade our own country to ratify it. I hope, therefore, that the hon. Lady, while she is at the Foreign Office, will look at some of these conventions and protocols which have been agreed but not ratified.</p>

<p>With permission, I should like to reply to the debate.<br/>
We are extremely grateful to the noble Lord the Member for Hertford (Lord Balniel) and his hon. Friend the Member for Galloway (Mr. Brewis) for the welcome

which they have given to the Bill. We are all at one in wishing to further its purposes. Both hon. Members pointed out that this is not the only proposition which has been made at one time or another for international measures to safeguard investment or property in other countries. One thinks in this connection of the O.E.C.D. draft, which owed a good deal, I think, to a former Member of the House, Lord Shawcross. The very limitations of the Convention to which the hon. Gentleman drew attention are, I think, the reasons why it is possible to go ahead with a less ambitious Convention than the more ambitious, more complex and more wide-reaching ones which are covered in the O.E.C.D. draft. We should be thankful that, at least, we have an opportunity to put something into effect here, although it has, in certain respects, limited application.<br/>
The hon. Member for Galloway was quite right to point out that there are certain loopholes under, for example, Articles 25 and 26, but had those loopholes not been provided one might not have had the measure of international agreement which has been obtained. One has to take one's choice. The best can sometimes be the enemy of the good, and I suggest that we should be reasonably content with what has emerged from the wide consultations which preceded this Convention.<br/>
It is not quite true that the Convention makes legal history in providing, for the first time, that an individual may bring a State to judgment. Under the European Convention on Human Rights, for instance, it is open to an individual to bring a State to judgment. This, therefore, is an extension of a principle which has already been accepted in international jurisprudence.<br/>
The noble Lord asked about the nature of the law to be applied and the hon. Member for Galloway referred to the fact that law which was not the law of either country might be invoked in certain circumstances. I am advised that under Article 42 of the Convention a tribunal is required to apply the law agreed by the parties. Failing such agreement, the tribunal must apply the law of the State party to the dispute&#x2014;unless that law itself calls for the application of some other law&#x2014;as well as such rules of international law as may be applicable.


I hope that that makes the matter perfectly clear.<br/>
The noble Lord raised an interesting question about the extent of the privileges and suggested that the privileges of the proposed Centre would in some respect be wider than those enjoyed by the World Bank. I am advised that the Centre will have the same legal capacities and personality as the International Bank and the other organisations connected with it such as the International Monetary Fund, but those organisations associated with the Bank which carry out financial operations such as borrowing and investment of funds or the issuing or guaranteeing of securities&#x2014;in other words, which are in effect competing with or working alongside private financial institutions&#x2014;have to be in a position where actions could be brought against them, otherwise they would have an unfair advantage as compared with the private institutions. This does not apply to the Centre, which does not carry out operations of that kind. It is for that reason that the Centre has a wider immunity than the commercial institutions associated with the World Bank.<br/>
Both hon. Members opposite have raised the question of the absence of signatories from Latin-America, but the lists are still open. There is nothing to prevent any Latin-American country from signing or ratifying the Convention, and we hope very much that they will do so. It would perhaps be undesirable of us to comment on any reasons which might be affecting the Latin-American Governments in this matter. It is for them to take their own decision as to whether or not they accede to the Convention.<br/>
All I can say is that the Government hope very much that they will accede. In many ways, Latin-America is attractive

to overseas investment, and, indeed, one would suppose that it is in a position to desire such investment. I hope that those countries which have so far not felt it right to accede will reconsider their position and take part in this system of international jurisprudence.<br/>
The system has its limitations, and we recognise them, but I think we all agree that it is a step forward, one stage more at least in an international system of law extended to commerce and investment. I hope very much, therefore, that, with the United Kingdom as one of the major countries concerned and playing its full part, the Convention will soon come into full operation.</p>

<p>I beg to move Amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 12, after '(2)', to insert:
<q>'For a period of five years from the commencement of this Act'.</q>
Subsection (2), to which this is an Amendment, seeks to abolish the present freedom to register land which is outside a compulsory registration area and to limit such registration to cases in which the Chief Land Registrar specifies that there is some particular reason for the registration to be accepted. That suspension of voluntary registration except by permission of the Registrar is to be permanent. There is no limitation on the period during which the Clause is to apply and it will therefore apply until Parliament sees fit to repeal the provision. The Amendment seeks to make it temporary and to return after a period of five years to the present very valuable service which Her Majesty's Land Registry performs in accepting the voluntary registration of land.<br/>
Perhaps I should explain, for the purposes of the record if not to remind hon. Members, that the compulsory areas do not cover anything like the whole country. Almost all Greater London is registered land, as are the counties of Berkshire, Kent and Surrey, most of Sussex, with the coastal county boroughs of that county, in the Midlands, a large part of Warwickshire with Coventry and Oxford and Reading, 10 county boroughs and 11 county districts in Lancashire and, of course, the City of Manchester, three county boroughs in Cheshire, Huddersfield and, the latest addition, Durham. That may sound a fairly formidable list of compulsory registration areas, but it still leaves a great deal of the country not subject to compulsory registration.<br/>
Perhaps I should explain what I mean by compulsory registration. In the areas which I have mentioned as being areas of compulsory registration, every con-

veyance of the sale of freehold property, every lease for 40 years or more and every assignment of a lease which has 40 years or more to run, must be registered By that gradual process of registering the first of those transactions to occur after the date upon which an area is declared to be a compulsory registration area, all of the land in the area eventually receives a registered title and a land certificate behind which no purchaser or lessee need investigate, one document instead of at least 30 years of documents, as have to be investigated when the land is unregistered land.<br/>
Under the existing law, anyone anywhere in the country other than in a compulsory registration area can obtain the same benefits as those who are in a compulsory registration area by voluntarily submitting his documents of title to the Land Registry and asking that they be accepted as a registered title and that his land be registered and that a land certificate be issued to him in place of his other documents of title.<br/>
8.45 p.m.<br/>
There will be substantial advantages in such registration. Not the least is a reduction in the costs of future transactions with that property&#x2014;not, I admit, a very substantial reduction, but at least some saving for those dealing with the property. There should be and can be a saving in time in transactions with registered property, and those of us who practise know that there are a lot of improvements which could be made, but even as registration stands it is a very great benefit to the public.<br/>
One sees no other way of reducing the cost and time of conveyancing than to extend and improve registration of land. The popularity for registration was clearly shown by figures quoted by the hon. Gentleman the Member for Bolton, West (Mr. Oakes) on the Second Reading. He said, quoting figures given in a Written Answer to a Question put to the right hon. and learned Gentleman the Attorney-General:
<q>&#x2026; in 1955 in such areas&#x2014;</q>
that is, in areas of voluntary registration&#x2014;
<q>there were 3,202 applications for voluntary registration of title. In 1960 there were 9,050 and in 1965, the last year for which records are available, there were 16,879."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Second Reading Committee,</i> 27th July, 1966; c. 13.]</q>


Those figures show a popularity and phenomenal increase in the number of applications for voluntary registration and acceptances of those applications. By Clause 1(2) of the Bill those will be very substantially reduced. Even if the Chief Land Registrar accepts a number of applications in exceptional circumstances, there will still be a very considerable curtailment of this benefit which the public is receiving.<br/>
The hon. and learned Gentleman the Solicitor-General explained, in Committee, in what cases and under what circumstances the Chief Land Registrar intended to allow voluntary registration under the power given to him by Clause 1(2) of the Bill. He said:
<q>The Chief Land Registrar intends to allow voluntary registration of estates comprising at least 20 houses, flats, plots or maisonettes.</q>
That is a substantial concession and is the sort of case in which voluntary registration is of great benefit.<br/>
The Solicitor-General hedged this round with a lot of special considerations which must apply to such applications. Four special considerations were that before the Chief Land Registrar would accept any such application there must be planning permission, the applicant must intend to sell the freehold at once to individual purchasers, he must provide a layout plan, and he must give an undertaking that all of his transfers or leases of the properties would be in an approved standard form.<br/>
That was one type of case in which the Chief Land Registrar would accept an application. The second type of case&#x2014;and I quote now from column 18 of the Committee's sitting of 16th November&#x2014;was that the Chief Land Registrar
<q>&#x2026; proposes to accept applicants in respect of property the title deeds of which were destroyed by enemy action during the Second World War. Should any other national disaster occur he will accept applications in precisely the same way."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Standing Committee G,</i> 16th November, 1966; c. 17&#x2013;18.]</q>
So we know of only two occasions on which the Chief Land Registrar is likely to exercise his discretion under subsection (2) of Clause 1&#x2014;the case of the 20 plots or more, and the case of the lost title deeds by reason of some national disaster.<br/>
These do not take into account the sort of case in which voluntary registration has been so beneficial to the person who is dealing with land. I think particularly of what we know as the sick titles, where one finds a defect in the title. It may be a defect which has little practical importance but which may cause grave difficulty in dealing with the land in future. A submission of a sick title to the Land Registrar, the investigation of that title by the officials of the Land Registry, and issue of the land certificate, if they are satisfied that the defect is immaterial or it is proved not to be of great importance, is of great benefit in future.<br/>
The cases mentioned by the Solicitor-General do not cover local authority development. Indeed, many local authorities have urged upon hon. Members on this side of the House&#x2014;and, I am sure, upon the Government&#x2014;the need to obtain some assurance that the Chief Land Registrar will accept voluntary applications for registration from local authorities who are in the course of collecting a number of titles together in order to make an area of development.<br/>
The cases given by the Solicitor-General do not cover the very common type of application of the addition of an unregistered title to registered land where it would make a single property&#x2014;the registered dwelling-house, for example, where the owner buys a bit more added on to his garden, or perhaps a little bit to build a garage, or something of that sort, and he often finds he has bought unregistered land where the dwelling-house is registered land. It is convenient that all should be in the one title. This would be accepted in future by the Registrar; so Clause 1, subsection (2), is depriving the public of a service.<br/>
The reason given is that it is desired to proceed as rapidly as possible with compulsory registration of all built-up areas, and it is hoped that compulsory registration of built-up areas in the country will be achieved by 1973. It is said that this cannot be done if the staff of the Land Registrar is diverted to consider voluntary applications in areas which are not compulsory areas.<br/>
In 1964, the then Conservative Government announced this programme of extending compulsory registration to all built-up areas by 1973, and, at that time,


the then Government saw no reason to restrict any of the existing services by the Land Registrar&#x2014;certainly not to restrict the applications for voluntary registration. I think that I am right in saying that since that announcement in 1964, the programme has been going faster than scheduled. There is no lag in the sort of schedule laid out for compulsory registration of all built-up areas by 1973. Therefore, at this moment there can be no reason, from the past history of this programme, to restrict the services offered by the Land Registrar.<br/>
The only reason I can see is that the present Government's rather grandiose schemes, such as the Land Commission, and the very substantial increase in the number of professional men in the ordinary Government Department, will prevent recruitment to the Land Registry to enable the extension of its work. This absorption of the professional man&#x2014;particularly the man concerned with property, whether the lawyer, the valuer, or the surveyor&#x2014;in new Government appointments is a very serious development. There is a sort of brain drain from private practice and the established services of proved worth, such as the Land Registry, into new and, in many cases, not such beneficial service.<br/>
If the service of voluntary registration is to be suspended, I most sincerely and earnestly urge that it should be a temporary suspension; that the position should be investigated after a period of years&#x2014;and a generous period is five years&#x2014;to see whether the service can be fully restored. The provision of subsection (2) of Clause 1 should be limited to five years.</p>

<p>First, I express my appreciation&#x2014;and, I am sure, that of all hon. Members&#x2014;of the very clear and concise description of the system of land registration which the hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Graham Page) has given us. We all and particularly all those concerned with this matter professionally, welcome the intention to extend the compulsory registration system throughout the country as rapidly as possible.<br/>
I appreciate the views of the hon. Member for Crosby on the inhibition of individual applications for registration, but we must weigh in the balance what

is likely to be to the best advantage, and it is generally recognised that the Land Registry will have a blitz in this respect so as to effect compulsory registration as quickly as possible. That being so, I think that the work of the Land Registry would be likely to be hampered if individual applications had to be dealt with piecemeal.<br/>
I wonder to what extent undue hardship will be caused by the prohibition of individual applications? Are there any statistics available of the number of individual applications for registration that are outside the classes which the Chief Land Registrar is likely to approve in any event? I hope, in particular, that the Chief Land Registrar will not be too restrictive in his decision as to the classes of cases that will be dealt with; and that there will be close consultation with the professions, through the Law Society or other appropriate organisation, on the limitations on making applications.<br/>
The main task must be more predominantly in the interests of the public, and if, as the hon. Member said, this work is ahead of, or is likely to be ahead of schedule there might even be a danger in putting on a time limit. I am sure that the Chief Land Registrar and the Land Registry will not desire to inhibit individual applications when the need for doing so no longer exists. I am confident that if the work were progressing in such a way that it could be said that the end was in sight, the Chief Land Registrar would indicate to the Government that it was possible once again to relax the restriction. It is far better that we should give the green light to go ahead with compulsory registration rather than dealing with individual applications, particularly when, I think it unlikely that considerable hardship might be inflicted in any large number of cases.</p>

<p>I have listened with great interest to what the hon. Member for Walthamstow, East (Mr. W. O. J. Robinson) has just said. It was very constructive. I should, however, draw attention to the fact that it is somewhat frustrating to the profession, of which, I am sorry to say, I am not a member, that its members should find themselves inhibited and unable to deal with voluntary registration where it has previously been undertaken.<br/>
I said in Committee that this problem did not arise in the area which I had the honour to represent because most of the land had devolved from one family, who were great landowners, and they had the prescience to register voluntarily at the time when the land was sold. There are, however, other areas where that is not the case. My hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Graham Page) mentioned this to me before the debate began and I have had experience of it myself.<br/>
Solicitors have come to me in my constituency and said, "This is most extraordinary. The Conservative Government, in 1964, announced a programme. Now, the present Government are going back on it. They have produced all manner of excuses and reasons concerned with shortage of staff and difficulty with Ordnance Survey about why the programme cannot be put into effect."<br/>
The proposal put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Crosby in his Amendment would go some way towards trying to force open the door a little so that if the Government find that the restrictions which they are rather pessimistically imposing are onerous, they might relent; whereas the matter in which the Bill is drafted there is apparently no means of relenting.<br/>
I must also draw attention to the great problem which will be faced by local authorities, particularly in urban areas, where they have to acquire land for housing programmes and where they may in the course of events offer the land again for resale. They will have the frightful burden of deducting separate titles in many cases where the history of the land may well go back 30 years or more.<br/>
On 24th May, in another place, the Lord Chancellor set out the problem concerning voluntary registration from the viewpoint of dealing with local authorities who might ask for it. In listing the categories of voluntary registration, he said that 39 per cent. were single-owner-owner-occupied houses, for which he could not give any undertaking that the Chief Land Registrar would be able to accept voluntary registration. He went on to say, however, that 17&#x00BD; per cent. was building land for development and a further 16 per cent. was land acquired for investment and redevelopment. Going

down the scale, he said that 10 per cent. was single plots and 6 per cent. was land owned for commercial or industrial purposes.<br/>
The two principal figures which I have mentioned&#x2014;17&#x00BD; per cent. in respect of building land for development and 16 per cent. for land acquired for investment and redevelopment&#x2014;add up to a little over 33&#x2153; per cent. Had the Government been a little more flexible, there might have been cause for relaxation in this case. I hope that at a later stage it will be possible to draw attention again to some of the shortcomings which, we feel, have caused this rather distressing circumstance to arise.<br/>
Meanwhile, I commend the Amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Crosby and I hope that the House will support what I consider to be an eminently suitable arrangement.</p>

<p>Although the hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Graham Page) and I found much in common in the Second Reading Committee on the Bill, it was material in common relating to the exceptions that the Chief Land Registrar should grant irrespective of subsection (2) of Clause 1.<br/>
I am surprised that the hon. Member and his hon. Friends have put down this limitation of time to five years. The hon. Member well knows that the purpose of Clause 1(2) is not wilfully to deprive people in compulsory areas of the right to register their titles. The reason was given by my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General in Committee. It was because we wished to keep to the timetable of extending compulsory registration to all urban areas by 1973, and to rural areas as well by 1980. To continue voluntary registration in areas outside compulsory areas may well impede that progress considerably.<br/>
Hon. Gentlemen opposite voted for the Second Reading of the Bill, and this is its main Clause. I would remind them that, on their estimate of time taken over from their Government by our own, 1973 is the target year for urban areas. If the Amendment were accepted, the Bill would come to an end in 1971. In the middle of the very first phase of introducing compulsory registration, either another Bill would have to be passed by


the House, or the Chief Land Registrar once again would be faced with the problem of having his time impeded by applications coming from voluntary areas. That would only be in the first phase. After 1973, there is the second phase to 1980 which takes in the rural and less densely populated areas.<br/>
To bring in this time limit goes to the very root of the purpose of Clause 1(2); indeed, it goes to the root of the Act, which hon. Gentlemen opposite voted for on Second Reading. I am sure that my hon. and learned Friend will resist the Amendment, which would cause nothing but difficulty for the Chief Land Registrar and his staff in 1971.<br/>
The hon. Member for Crosby has raised before the difficulty which is caused, he says, by the Land Commission Bill. I am certain that he and his hon. Friends realise that one of the biggest problems is that, before we introduce compulsory registration of title to an area, there must be an up-to-date Ordnance Survey of the area. It is upon the Ordnance Survey that much of the work of the Land Registry depends. That is one of the principal difficulties of bringing in voluntary titles in areas where an up-to-date Ordnance Survey very often has not taken place, and that is what is taking up the time of the Land Registry.<br/>
I hope that my hon. and learned Friend will resist this somewhat surprising Amendment from the hon. Member for Crosby.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Graham Page) and the hon. Member for Poole (Mr. Murton) were pushing at an open door when they addressed the House on the advantages of voluntary registration to the individuals concerned. No one doubts it, and no one doubts that, in itself, voluntary registration is a beneficial process for all concerned.<br/>
As has been explained fully in the debate on Second Reading and in Committee two days ago, we are dealing here with priorities. As my hon. Friends the Member for Bolton, West (Mr. Oakes) and Walthamstow, East (Mr. W. O. J. Robinson) have both made very clear, and as has been stated again and again, the aim of this Bill is to make universal the system of compulsory registration, and that is an aim which commands the assent

of hon. Members of all political parties in the House.<br/>
What we aim to do is to extend compulsory registration of title to land to all built up areas in England and Wales by mid-1973, and to the remaining urban and rural areas by 1980. What is entirely clear to us, and what we must ask the House to accept, is that if that is to be accomplished, without putting a quite insupportable burden on the Land Registry and on the Ordnance Survey staff, it cannot be done unless there is some limitation on voluntary registrations. We have not cut out voluntary registrations. I described in some detail&#x2014;and the hon. Member for Crosby has repeated what I said&#x2014;the circumstances in which the Chief Land Registrar will be ready to accept applications for voluntary registration.</p>

<p>If the Amendment were accepted, it would mean that from 1971 or 1972 until 1980 the Land Registry and the Ordnance Survey would get no relief from voluntary applications. We would in effect be defeating the main purpose of the Bill, and therefore, in spite of the persuasive way in which the case has been presented by both hon. Gentlemen opposite, I must ask the House to resist the Amendment.</p>

<p>I beg to move Amendment No. 2, in line 12, to leave out 'and 8' and to insert '8 and 81'.<br/>
We have discussed the effect of subsection (2) of Clause 1, that it is to restrict the applications in connection with voluntary registrations, that is to say, application for registration in areas which are not compulsory registration areas. The short point of the Amendment is that it offers to the Solicitor-General another application which usually seems to me to be quite purposeless which might be restricted if he is obliged to restrict application for registration.<br/>
Section 81 of the Land Registration Act, 1925, makes provision for an application for removal of land from the register. This of course can only happen in an area which is not an area of compulsory registration. One cannot remove land from the register in such a case but where there is no compulsion on registration, when land has been registered it can, under Section 81 of the 1925 Act, be removed.<br/>
I cannot understand why anyone should want to remove a property from the register. Why should he take up the time of the registry in that way, when the staff can be much better employed on accepting applications for registration of property? I think that we can do without this Clause if we are really trying to economise on the time of the staff.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1966-11-23a.1511.0" hansard_membership_id="4529" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/14983" speakername="The Solicitor-General" colnum="1511" time="">
<p>I have rather more sympathy with this Amendment than I had with the last one, but I do not really think that it is necessary to the Bill. Section 81 of the 1925 Act is a rather peculiar provision, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman will agree, and I share his bewilderment that anyone should want, so to speak, to remove property from registration once it has been established. Indeed, applications under Section 81 are now becoming exceedingly rare, but this Section was introduced in 1925 when people were still suspicious of registration, and it was at that time that we had had to hedge compulsory registration about with various safeguards.<br/>
We had to get the consent of the county council. If it were called for, there had to be a public inquiry. Experience has shown those safeguards to be unnecessary, and by general consent we are getting rid of them in the Bill. Section 81 applications are almost unknown and they will come to an end completely when we have universal compulsory registration, but so long as we keep areas of voluntary registration we do not see any particular reason to remove this option if any one wants to exercise it.<br/>
Therefore, although I do not feel particularly strongly about the Amendment, on balance my advice to the House would be to reject it.</p>

<p>I beg to move Amendment No. 3, in page 1, line 14, to leave out from 'shall' to end of line 19 and to insert:
<q>'be accompanied by&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>(<i>a</i>) a draft land certificate or charge certificate (as the case may be) prepared by the solicitor, representing the applicant, in duplicate in the prescribed form and setting out the estate or interest of the applicant in the property which is the subject of the application and all matters relevant thereto which would be set out in a certificate issued under section 63 of the said Act; and</li>

<li>(<i>b</i>) a statutory declaration by the said solicitor in the prescribed form certifying that the said draft truly sets out the estate or interest of the applicant in the said property and all matters relevant as aforesaid;</li>
</ol>
and the registrar shall insert one of the duplicates of the said draft in an appropriate register without the obligation of examining it or investigating the title to the said property and one of the duplicates of the said draft marked with the date of receipt thereof and of the said statutory declaration in the registry and on and from date the land shall be registered land as defined in the said Act provided that at any time the registrar may issue a certificate under section 63 aforesaid in respect of the said land '.</q>
We have already fully discussed the purposes of subsection (2), namely, the restriction of voluntary applications for registration. The Amendment proposes not exactly an alternative but a supplement. If it were accepted the subsection would read: "Applications under sections 4 and 8 of the said Act (first registration of title) as respects land outside an area of compulsory registration shall be accompanied by"&#x2014;and then the Amendment sets out two documents which should accompany it, namely, a draft land certificate and a statutory declaration, and goes on to say what would be the effect of the lodgment of those documents with the Registry, namely, that they will have the same effect as a land certificate. They would cause the land to become registered land for a period until the land certificate was issued by the Land Registry under Section 63 of the Act.<br/>
The reason we have been given for the restriction of voluntary applications for registration is that there is insufficient staff to carry out both parts, namely, the extension of compulsory registration areas and the maintenance of the present system of voluntary registration. Therefore, the present system of voluntary registration has to some extent to be sacrificed. The Amendment proposes that a certificate given by a solicitor concerned in the transaction which it is sought to register shall temporarily take the place of a land certificate.<br/>
What happens now to an application for first registration is that the solicitor for the grantee&#x2014;whether the purchaser, the lessee or the mortgagee&#x2014;submits documents of title to the property and is obliged, in doing so, to disclose to the Land Registry a full and proper title,


so that he has a proper land certificate, and the Registry is satisfied that his client has such a title as that which he applies to be registered. At the Land Registry, those documents are examined by officials and, eventually, the certificate is issued, setting out the property, the name of the proprietor, the nature of his interest in the land and any charges, restrictive covenants, easements or any other encumbrances on the property.<br/>
That document becomes the one document of title, with all the advantages which flow from that. In the Amendment, the proposal is a "do-it-yourself" registration&#x2014;[<i>Laughter</i>.]&#x2014;not a "do-it-yourself" conveyancing, but the solicitor would prepare the certificate in the form in which the Land Registry would normally issue a certificate and would make a statutory declaration that his draft certificate correctly shows the title to the property which he is asking should be accepted as registered.<br/>
Having made a statutory declaration of this sort, he would, of course, be criminally liable for any untruth in it. It is not unusual, in the administration of the law, for reliance to be placed upon the integrity of the solicitor. After all, his full title is that he is "a solicitor of the Supreme Court of Justice" and he owes a duty to the State in the administration of law and certainly in any transactions, whether litigation or other transactions, as well as to his client.<br/>
If he acts wrongly, his clients are insured, to a great extent, by the indemnity fund maintained by the Law Society. At present, of course, when he submits his client's document of title and applies for a land certificate and for the land to be treated as registered, his application is checked with great care by the officials of the Land Registry, but one would expect that, if there were any great faults in applications, they would occasionally be reflected in the land certificate which is issued.<br/>
If the solicitor failed to disclose certain defects in the title, the land certificate might still be issued without showing those defects and showing a clean title. One would expect that, if that had been happening over the years, there would have been a fairly substantial claim on the indemnity fund held by the Land

Registry. The indemnity fund, I think, was instituted as long ago as 1897 under the Land Transfer Act, and pays compensation to any person whose title has to be rectified because of some error in the issue of the land certificate which causes damage to the proprietor of the land.<br/>
Claims against the Land Registry indemnity fund since 1897 total the small sum of &#x00A3;30,000. Under the present system, therefore, very little goes wrong. However, it could and would go wrong if the solicitor submitting the documents of title were to do so carelessly or if he were deliberately to fail to disclose matters; and it is on the integrity of the solicitor in submitting his documents of title that the Land Registry has been made to work so satisfactorily over the years.<br/>
The solicitors' profession has in the last two or three years been considering most seriously a form of log book conveyancing which would substitute a log book, rather like the log book for one's car, for the 30 years' documents of title which must now be produced. The Amendment would, as it were, marry those ideas with the Land Registry.<br/>
The land certificate is itself a form of log book to the property, but it has the endorsement by the Land Registry as having correct entries in it. If, to extend the benefits of registration to all built-up areas and if, by extending registration to those areas, it is necessary to contract the service of voluntary registration, I submit that something should be put in its place, and I therefore suggest this certification by the solicitor concerned in the transaction, but only so long as it is necessary ot restrict voluntary registration. As hon. Members will note, the Amendment provides that at any time the registrar can issue a proper land or charge certificate under Section 63, and not rely any further on the certificate from the solicitor.<br/>
I believe that, on the one hand, there would be a minimal risk to the public from such a form of temporary registration&#x2014;relying on the certificate of the solicitor&#x2014;while, on the other, we would have the great advantage of retaining the benefits of voluntary registration for a period of time, until the Land Registry has the staff to deal with them fully.</p>

<p>To introduce a horticultural matter into what is a very dry legal debate, I suggest that we are in the process of pruning the Land Registry so that it may rapidly blossom forth in future. The hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Graham Page), in the middle of this pruning operation, is attempting a grafting operation&#x2014;grafting on to the Land Registry tree a plant of a very dissimilar nature.<br/>
As the hon. Member for Crosby knows, the log book scheme is not entirely accepted by the profession or by the Law Society, although he and I may find considerable merit in a scheme for cheapening the process of conveyancing. However, to take that scheme and try to impose it in this type of Measure&#x2014;remembering that it would deal only with those areas of voluntary registration&#x2014;would give a bad start in life to what I believe is fundamentally a good scheme of conveyancing unregistered, as distinct from registered, land.</p>

<p>This Amendment also conflicts with the objects of the Bill. The hon. Member for Crosby referred to another register. That other register would have to be set up at the Land Registry to deal with part of the documents when a solicitor sent a draft certificate with the statutory declarations. This would mean even more work for the Land Registry instead of less.</p>

<p>I obviously have not explained sufficiently. There is no obligation to examine or investigate the title. What is meant by another register is merely slipping the certificate in some sort of folder and sending an acknowledgment for it.</p>

<p>I accept that, but later the Amendment says:
<q>from date</q>
I presume that means, "from that date"&#x2014;
<q>the land shall be registered land as defined in the said Act.</q>
We come up against a series of difficulties. If it is registered land, a State guarantee will have to be given to that title under the terms of the 1925 Land Registration Act.<br/>
Even if this Amendment were accepted, under the principal Act the Land Registry will still have to examine the title. We would have achieved nothing at all but have merely burdened the Registrar with a new form of conveyancing to which he is not used to and which the profession is not used to in a Bill designed to speed things up at the Registry. I hope, indeed I am sure, that my hon. and learned Friend will reject this Amendment.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1966-11-23a.1516.0" hansard_membership_id="11537" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/31495" speakername="Mr. W. O. J. Robinson" colnum="1516" time="">
<p>I was intrigued and very interested by what I am sure was intended to be a helpful suggestion made by the hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Graham Page). Those of us in the profession immediately recognised the similarity between this Amendment and what the hon. Member described as the log book scheme. I echo what my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, West (Mr. Oakes) said about the scheme being viewed with mixed feelings. This proposal would make confusion worse confounded.<br/>
One of the values of the land registration scheme is that there is a State guarantee of title. I accept that if the title were examined and a certificate issued by a solicitor that could be relied upon to an extent, but it would not be, and could not be, a State-guaranteed title. If the Amendment were accepted we would have three types of conveyancing, the registered land scheme as existing, unregistered conveyancing, and a mixture of both&#x2014;what one could describe as solicitor's registered land. This would not help in the major problem of leading to the complete registration which we all desire.<br/>
I am also interested in the mechanics of the arrangement. I understand that the solicitor would send to the Registry two copies of a draft land certificate, but at no time would it become anything but a draft. What sort of conveyancing would go on after the first transaction on a draft certificate? If we submit an application to the Land Registry, we get a land certificate which we present when there is a subsequent transaction, but in this case there would be two drafts, one in the file, as the hon. Member said, and one in the Registry. There would be no power to make the Registry return any document to any solicitor which he could produce.</p>

<p>I obviously have not made it clear. Duplicates would he provided, one of which would be placed in the register at the Land Registry and the other of which would be returned to the solicitor endorsed with an acknowledgement of receipt by the Land Registry.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1966-11-23a.1517.1" hansard_membership_id="11537" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/31495" speakername="Mr. Robinson" colnum="1517" time="">
<p>As I read it, the Amendment does not say that. It says:
<q>'the registrar shall insert one of the duplicates &#x2026; in an appropriate register &#x2026; and one of the duplicates of the said draft marked with the date of receipt thereof and of the said statutory declaration in the registry &#x2026; '</q>
It does not say that a copy is to be returned to the solicitor. According to the Amendment, both are to be retained in the Registry. The solicitor must have in his possession something which is authenticated by the Land Registry as having been accepted.<br/>
When this draft transfer is put in the Registry, what happens if the property is sold a month later? What sort of documents do we use? Do we use a conveyance in the unregistered way or do we use a transfer form? If we submit that transfer to the Land Registry, what does the Registry do? Does it examine the draft certificate? Does it convert it into an official ordinary land certificate as we know it? Or what does the Registry do? The confusion existing at Lincoln's Inn and other district registeries would have to be seen to be believed.<br/>
I have studied the Amendment. The hon. Member for Crosby has spoiled the case he argued. If the Amendment were accepted, we should omit from the Clause as at present drafted any right to submit an application to the Registrar for normal registration even in the special classes which are in the Clause. If the Amendment were accepted, it would not be possible for a solicitor in any event in a voluntary registration area to submit any application for registration. He could only adopt this mvsterious, and I think untidy, draft certificate.</p>

<p>May I make it quite clear to the hon. Gentleman. I regret that something has been missed out of the Amendment. I do not know whether it is because of my bad writing. The intention was that one of these duplicates should be returned to the solicitor who submits it so that he has a land certificate, in just the same way as he

would have a land certificate from the Registry.</p>

<p>I accept that, but I can only take the Amendment as it is printed. My point at the end was the rather different one that, if the Amendment were accepted, it would not then be possible for any application for the registration of land in a non-compulsory area to be accepted by the Registrar, because the words which at present permit of applications within the limited class would be omitted. If that is what the hon. Gentleman wants, so be it.</p>

<p>I never cease to admire the talent of my hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Graham Page), nor his great ingenuity in dealing with these problems. Those on the Government Front Bench should be grateful to my hon. Friend for attempting to get them out of a difficulty. I would neither presume nor dare to involve myself in technical arguments on the Amendment, because considerable heat of a friendly nature has already been generated, partly because there are words missing. It would not have made much difference to me if the words had been there, because of my lack of knowledge of the Clause from a professional point of view.<br/>
As a layman, possibly a simple one, may I point out that the system as proposed by my hon. Friend could be of great value if only it could be accepted by the Solicitor-General. As I understand it, the problem is in the Ordnance Survey. If that problem could be put on one side, I do not think that the same problem would exist in the office of the Chief Land Registrar. In another place the question of staff was raised. The Lord Chancellor admitted that there was the possibility that women could be recruited and used in the Chief Land Registrar's office.<br/>
If we put on one side the problems of the Ordance Survey, the shortage of skilled staff, the difficulty of drawing large-scale plans, and all the problems giving rise to the troubles we are now discussing and we concentrate on the Land Registrar and on getting him the staff he needs, I cannot see why this helpful Amendment should not commend itself to the Government. For what it is worth, I, as a pure&#x2014;I hope&#x2014;unprofessional Member, support it.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Poole (Mr. Murton) has put his finger on the spot. He speaks with great knowledge of the Ordance Survey. No doubt, it is under pressure, and this useful and imaginative proposal by my hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Graham Page) would avoid the difficulties of the Ordnance Survey.<br/>
In thinking of the difficulty for officials in the Land Registry, we should direct our minds to the consumer's needs. Speaking as a layman and as a possible, though very occasional, consumer, I think it necessary that one should be able to register a house if one wants to do so. If this gives trouble to solicitors and to the Land Registry, that is just too bad. They really ought to try to meet the convenience of the customer.<br/>
There is a real need for voluntary registration to continue. My hon. Friend has made a proposal which would allow it to continue right through the years until we have full compulsory registration. If the Solicitor-General is so worried about the 1970s, he need not trouble too much about that because he will not have responsibility then.</p>

<p>I am sorry that for the third time this evening, I must disappoint hon. Members opposite. I could not possibly advise the House to accept the Amendment. The reasons for rejecting it have been very forcibly put by my hon. Friends the Members for Bolton, West (Mr. Oakes) and for Walthamstow, East (Mr. W. O. J. Robinson), and I adopt their arguments.<br/>
The hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Graham Page) referred to log-book conveyancing. As he said, a proposal of this kind has been widely canvassed in the solicitor's profession. It is rather similar to a scheme propounded by the Law Society in June, 1965, which, I think, was called the Title Certificate Scheme, under which solicitors were to certify that the applicant had a title to the property subject to certain party rights as stated. That scheme was circulated for comment to all solicitors. I am informed that the profession appeared to be considerably divided on its merits, but, before the Law Society was in a position fully to assess the reaction of the whole profession, the Lord Chancellor

informed the president of the Law Society, in December 1965, that the Government had decided not to adopt any scheme of this kind because they were convinced that it would not meet their main objective of reducing the cost of house purchase.<br/>
The Law Society's scheme had considerable advantages over the scheme proposed in the Amendment because it required both solicitor for vendor and solicitor for purchaser to certify the title. Under the Amendment, on the other hand, it is only the solicitor for the applicant who is to certify. Moreover, realising that the scheme would depend upon the reliability of the certificate, the Law Society in its proposal envisaged a global insurance scheme to insure future owners against inaccurate certificates. It does not appear that any such insurance is contemplated in the Amendment.<br/>
9.45 p.m.<br/>
If the Amendment were adopted, it would have a similar effect to the two others discussed tonight. It would defeat one of the principal objectives of the Bill, which, for reasons explained at every stage of the Bill, is to restrict the right to register land in non-compulsory areas. I have already said that we have to consider our priorities in this matter.<br/>
In addition, the general effect would be to render nugatory most or all of the land registration system. Under that system, the Land Registry makes one final and authoritative examination of title in place of the constantly repeated and relatively expensive and sometimes inconclusive investigation of a large number of title deeds every time a transaction takes place. As a result of this examination, the Land Registry forms a simple register containing the name of the owner, short particulars in standard form of such mortgages, restrictive covenants, third party rights and other burdens which affect the land.<br/>
The land itself is identified by reference to a plan of scientific accuracy based on the ordnance map. During this process of examination by the Land Registry, many existing defects of title which, in unregistered conveyances, are the subject of tiresome recurrences are permanently cured. But the accuracy of the register is backed by an insurance fund of a nominal value of &#x00A3;100,000, so


that any person suffering loss owing to a mistake in the register is entitled to be indemnified.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1966-11-23a.1521.0" colnum="1521" time="">
<p>It follows that the Land Registry is, in effect, an insurer of deeds and, once title to land has been registered, any purchaser can at once safely accept the title and the risks which exist in unregistered titles being imperfect are removed. At present, owing to the defects which exist in unregistered titles, the Chief Land Registrar is obliged to make a wide variety of inquiries of the solicitors applying for first registration in about 25 per cent. of all applications. Even so, numerous technical defects of title are deliberately ignored by him.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1966-11-23a.1521.1" colnum="1521" time="">
<p>In addition, the identifying of the land is uncertain in many instances because some 12 per cent. of all plans of unregistered deeds are seriously defective. If these defects were not cured at the time of first registration, they would necessarily lead to disputes. The proposal in the Amendment completely ignores the question of what kind of draft certificate a solicitor would provide in those cases where he knew a title to be a defective one and makes no provision for identification of the land nor for the provision of a plan. Even if a plan is contemplated here, the experience of the Land Registry suggests that a significant percentage of plans will be inaccurate or misleading, for the simple reason that there are no mapping draftsmen in solicitors' offices.</p>

<p>This is a most peculiar argument. What on earth does the hon. and learned Gentleman think is done with ordinary deeds in solicitors' offices? Plans have to be prepared every day&#x2014;dozens of them&#x2014;in these offices and have to be relied on in future by people dealing with property.</p>

<p>Certainly, when one has a system of registration it is vital that one should accurately identify the land. That is something that is done in the Land Registry and which would not be done in any other way, at any rate in a very large number of cases. This is one of the objections to the Amendment.<br/>
The Amendment goes on to propose that a certificate should be inserted in an

appropriate register without the obligation of examining it or investigating the title to the property concerned. If land and charge certificates were issued without such investigation, previous experience shows that a large proportion of them would contain errors and would thus be valueless, leading to numerous claims upon the Land Registry Insurance Fund. The Registrar would then feel obliged to investigate all titles submitted to him, as hitherto, not only to safeguard the insurance fund but also to ensure that the owner received a land or charge certificate which accurately described his plan and the obligations to which he was subject.<br/>
I hope that I have said enough to show that this proposal, ingenious as it is, is open to great practical objections. It would lead to confusion in many cases and, like the other Amendments, would largely defeat the purpose of the Bill, and I therefore ask the House to reject it.</p>

<p>I do not think that we can let the Bill go without a short debate on Third Reading. We have had at any rate some interesting discussion in Committee and on Report, and although I regret that the Bill does not contain what we proposed at those stages it does contain one or two useful provisions.<br/>
Clause I makes a reasonable reform in land registry law. The procedure whereby one ensured the concurrence of the county council to registration in its area is now quite out of date. Originally, when the 1925 Act first came into operation, one had to educate and persuade local authorities and local law societies to accept registration in their areas. As the hon. Member for Bolton, West (Mr. Oakes) said, at present 15 counties and 28 county boroughs are queuing up for registration, so there is no need for any procedure to encourage local authorities or local law societies to want registration in their areas. Plenty of areas are crying out for it and Clause 1(1) is undoubtedly a useful tidying up and speeding up of land registration procedure.<br/>
Subsections (3) and (4) of Clause 1 relate to the indemnity fund. They, too, are useful tidying-up provisions which have not caused any great concern either to the Registry or to the public. The indemnity has not been called on to any great extent and it is most interesting that only such a small sum has been paid out of the indemnity fund over a period of nearly 70 years, only &#x00A3;30,000. I do not know that these changes will make any alteration in that, but they make the situation tidier.<br/>
It is to Clause 1(2) that we have objected throughout the stages of the Bill. However one argues it, this is undoubtedly a retrogressive step which takes away a service which the Land Registry is at present providing and which is very popular with those who have to deal with land. It will increase the cost of conveyancing in many cases where voluntary registration would have been, but cannot now be, used. I would have thought that the extension of compulsory registration could have proceeded according to the programme which was laid down by the Conservative Government in

1964 and that the Registry could also have continued to maintain its service of voluntary registration. To that extent we regret the inclusion of this provision, although the Bill contains other and beneficial measures.</p>

<p>I do not wish to delay the House unduly over this matter which has been thoroughly ventilated. I would ask the hon. and learned Gentleman to convey to his right hon.

Work previously done by hand could be done by machines. I cannot believe that the manpower does not exist for this work, even though there is rapid development of building. Much as we deplore this present curtailment of voluntary registration, if a recruitment programme was carried out the job could be done without all the difficulties about which we have heard.</p>

<p>I beg to move,
<q>That an humble Address be presented to Her Majesty, praying that the Development Areas Order 1966 (S.I., 1966. No. 1032, dated 12th August 1966, a copy of which was laid before this House on 17th August, be annulled.</q>
I want to make clear that the Prayer tonight has no sinister intent. It is certainly not my purpose, in a fit of pique, to ask for the removal of privileges accorded by this Order to the constituencies of many hon. and right hon. Gentlemen, including incidentally, a large part of the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr. Michael Shaw) and a part of the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Howden (Mr. Bryan). Both of my hon. Friends have joined me in putting this Prayer on the Order Paper.<br/>
I should explain that my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby was particularly anxious to take part in this debate and would certainly have done so had it not been for the arrogance of the Minister of Power in compelling Standing Committee D to sit night after night in an attempt to force through the Iron and Steel Bill. It is, therefore, impossible for my hon. Friend to be with us and to put the important interests of his constituents. My purpose is to complain, once again, of the exclusion of Bridlington from these privileges and to beg the right hon. Gentleman to withdraw this Order, and immediately replace it with another including the Bridlington area in its Schedule.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman will understand that under our procedure it is only by apparently attacking the more fortunate that I can attempt to win justice for Bridlington. During my last attempt to do this, on the Report stage of the Industrial Development Bill on 19th July, I said:
<q>The question that my constituents are justifiably asking is: why discriminate against Bridlington."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT. 19th July. 1966; Vol. 732, c. 538.]</q></p>

<p>I appreciate that. I was suggesting to the right hon. Gentleman powerful reasons, in my opinion, for withdrawing this Order and bringing forward another in its place including Bridlington, whose claim I urged on 19th July, and whose claim, I think, I would be in order in urging again tonight. I do not know whether you found any fault in my quoting from an earlier speech, Sir.</p>

<p>With all due respect, I am finding fault with the whole of the right hon. Gentleman's argument at the moment. We cannot, on an Order, discuss things that are not in the Order. The right hon.

<p>The point I have been trying to make, which, I think, is a perfectly good one, is that this Order should not be approved by the House because of certain deficiencies which it has. It includes some areas and not others. I hope that I will be in order in continuing my argument on that basis. I think that the Order is deficient because the places mentioned in the Schedule to the Order are not the right places that should be mentioned.</p>

<p>This is extraordinarily difficult. The right hon. Gentleman must know that I grieve to have to call him to order again and again, but we are praying against a Statutory Instrument. The right hon. Gentleman can object against a Statutory Instrument, but he cannot suggest amendments to it.</p>
</speech>

<p>I will not suggest any amendment, Sir. I will merely point out my reasons for thinking that this Statutory Instrument is the wrong instrument for the right hon. Gentleman to have introduced.<br/>
The boundary situation which has been created by the Order which we are now discussing is, I now realise, more illogical and apparently indefensible than it seemed at the time of the debate on the Industrial Development Bill.<br/>
In my opinion&#x2014;and I hope that I can manage to keep in order&#x2014;it might have made sense if the whole of the East Riding of Yorkshire, which is part of


the Yorkshire and Humberside region, had been excluded from the Northern development area, and if all the land north of the East Riding boundary, which is part of the Northern region, had been included in the Northern development area.<br/>
This, in fact, as the right hon. Gentleman would admit, is not the case under the Order which we are now discussing, because the whole of the Norton Rural District, which is part of the East Riding of Yorkshire and part of the Yorkshire and Humberside region, has been included in the Northern development area. At the same time, a few square miles on the very edge of the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby, who is so unfortunately prevented from being present with us, which comprises certain villages and is part of the Northern area, has been left out of the Schedule which we are now discussing.<br/>
The reason for this&#x2014;as no doubt the right hon. Gentleman will explain&#x2014;is that the boundaries of employment exchanges have been preferred as guides to the boundaries either of counties or of planning regions; but, as employment exchange boundaries have been chosen, there seems&#x2014;and here I must see that I tread carefully&#x2014;a very strong case for including in the Schedule, as it ought to be, certain employment exchanges which are not there. I myself cannot believe that it would be beyond the ingenuity of the right hon. Gentleman, or, in fact, would establish any awkward precedent to include the employment exchanges which I have in mind, as well as including a small area in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby which is at present excluded from the development area.<br/>
During our last discussion on this matter, the right hon. Gentleman the President of the Board of Trade made the hearts of my constituents beat a good deal faster, when he said, in c. 540:
<q>There is no subject on which I have meditated more during the past six months than Bridlington."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 19th July, 1966; Vol. 732, c. 540.]</q>
I ask the House to note the magnificent generosity of those words. It was not

exports or imports, or the problem of E.F.T.A., or entry into the Common Market, or tariffs, that was mainly exercising the mind of the right hon. Gentleman&#x2014;it was the problems of Bridlington. This made my constituents feel even more important than ever, and I greatly appreciate the solicitude of the right hon. Gentleman.<br/>
I entirely agree that Bridlington is an eminently suitable subject for meditation, and I hope that his long contemplation of the town did not end on 19th July because, apart from the effects of what might more properly be called the un-selective employment tax&#x2014;that seems a more suitable name for the Chancellor of the Exchequer's abomination last spring&#x2014;and apart from the removal of the investment grants, which has been bad for my constituents, I mentioned my fears of unemployment and my conviction that Bridlington would increasingly need industrial incentives if the significant progress of the last decade&#x2014;</p>

<p>No, but I was pointing out that the places that the right hon.

Gentleman to bear in mind. I hope, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that you will allow me to continue, as it is very relevant to whether this is the right Schedule to have produced with the Order. My humble opinion is that it is seriously lacking in certain respects.<br/>
The President of the Board of Trade was also kind enough to say on 19th July that if he was wrong and
<q>&#x2026; if the unemployment percentage does not continue to fall &#x2026; it is possible under the Bill to alter the boundaries further in the future.</q>
He went on to say:

<p>I am very grateful to my right hon. Friend the Member for Bridlington (Mr. Wood) for providing this opportunity to discuss such a very important subject, which is of great concern to very many of my hon. Friends in Scotland. I appreciate, Mr. Deputy Speaker, my right hon. Friend's difficulties in keeping within the rules of order, and perhaps I shall be in a slightly more advantageous position, because in the Schedule I read:
<q>The Scottish Development Area, consists of the employment exchange areas of Scotland, except those of Edinburgh, Leith and Portobello.</q>

<p>Order. Since the noble Lord has referred to me, I must point out that Edinburgh is in precisely the same position as Bridlington. It is true that Edinburgh is mentioned in the first paragraph of the Schedule, but only by way of reference to exclude it from the rest of Scotland. Edinburgh is just as much outside the scope of the Order as is Bridlington. Therefore, it would not be in order to refer to the merits of Edinburgh any more than it would be to refer to the merits of Bridlington.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1966-11-23a.1529.5" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Earl of Dalkeith" colnum="1529" time="">
<p>I take the point, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Perhaps, therefore,

I can talk about a little area around Edinburgh and the effect that the Order will have upon a vacuum within it. I should, of course, declare an interest, because I am connected with a company which has development interests in a small part of Edinburgh. I do not apologise for this, because it qualifies me, perhaps, to speak about the subject with some practical experience.<br/>
It is not in my nature ever to be aggressive unless I am provoked, but I come very near to being sorely provoked on this occasion. The Government's decision about the formulation of their development areas in Scotland is very strange. It is crazily illogical, monstrously unjust and disgracefully authoritarian. I would like to substantiate all those points. First it is crazily illogical because where is the logic to be found in a scheme whereby, in a huge area of 30,000 square miles stretching from John o'Groats practically to York, there is just one little vacuum or pocket in the middle of it which does not appear to be getting the same treatment?<br/>
I know the old old arguments, which I have heard over and over again, about how under a Tory Government we had much more limited development areas. That argument has been thrashed out again and again and we now have to accept the situation that we have this much more greatly extended development area. The fact that the amount of money which is being poured into this bigger area does not appear to be any greater than the amount previously concentrated in a smaller area is beside the point. This, however, has to be the basis of our argument.<br/>
It is on that basis that the extreme illogicality of the Government's decision is so glaringly apparent. It is all the more so when one considers the future of Scotland in relation to the Common Market and when one considers the parts in Scotland which will clearly be the most obvious springboards for our access not only to Common Market countries, but also to the E.F.T.A. countries.<br/>
There are certain parts of Scotland which come to the minds of all of us in this connection, but which the Order does not cover. No doubt, it was partly with this in view that the previous Tory administration embarked upon a massive


exercise in developing a well-known port on the east coast of Scotland. If this sort of development involving vast sums of the taxpayers' money is to be carried to a logical conclusion, I suggest strongly that everything should be done to try to attract private investment in all ancillary operations such as processing plants, factories and warehouses of various kinds.<br/>
The effect of the Order will be precisely the opposite. It will drive them away. These companies will set themselves up in a different area from that which some of us have in mind and in which we should like to see them develop. I am sure that if the right hon. Gentleman had chosen to listen to the various people whom he has consulted in Scotland, he would have realised that there are very sound arguments for making his development area that much more extensive than it is.<br/>
The logical type of development which we should all like to see, particularly in our capital city, is the sort of growth industry demanding high capital intensivity and low labour intensivity, and that brings me to my point about it being monstrously unjust, because the trouble which we shall get into is that there are certain parts of the country where development areas will be able to set up similar types of factories as rivals which will syphon off trained labour from areas which do not have the advantage of investment incentives in future.<br/>
Only last week, the Secretary of State for Scotland opened a new factory at Glenrothes, in Fife, which is only a few minutes across the Forth Road Bridge from an area where there are other factories whose position will be placed in jeopardy. They have a magnificent record in the face of overseas competition, and now they will be undermined by rival factories only a few miles away from them.<br/>
I wish to substantiate my other charge that the decision has been disgracefully authoritarian. Numerous meetings have taken place between the Minister and his officials and various representatives of areas of Scotland who thought that they ought to be included. There has been nothing but obstinate defiance on the

part of the Government to all the reasoning which has been put forward by people of all political complexions.<br/>
Why is it that the steamroller of the Government machine is flatly ignoring all the reasons which have been advanced? I think that the population of Scotland would like to know. No reasons of any consequence have been given at all. Speculation is rife, and I would suggest that it is in the Government's own interest to try and clear it up. Is it in order to act as a sop to some other parts of the country where exclusions have been made the order of the day? Is it the action of "Big Brother", who does not like to see the last remaining citadel of anti-Socialism and is trying to take it out on its inhabitants? I wonder what other activities we shall see from the Government in the way of victimising this last bastion of freedom.<br/>
Unless the Minister tells us the truth and, better still, reverses his decision, as a London-bound Minister he must recognise that there will be a surge of nationalistic rage at his ill-considered action about the forming of this Order. I must warn him that this is the sort of thing which tends to drive Scots into a kind of U.D.I. frame of mind&#x2014;[<i>Laughter</i>.] It is all very well for the Minister of State to laugh. We know that he comes from Norfolk&#x2014;</p>

<p>I, too, wish to address my remarks to paragraph 1 of the Order, which refers to Scotland.<br/>
Under the previous system, which this is to replace, the benefits of grants and loans were available in what were called development districts, which were much smaller areas, but they were the special areas&#x2014;I speak for Scotland in particular, but I am sure that it was the same in the rest of the United Kingdom&#x2014;where there was unemployment to a large degree, and where assistance of this kind was specially required. For example, the Highlands and Islands formed a development

district, and so did parts of the north-east of Scotland, which, unfortunately, had high percentages of unemployment from time to time.<br/>
Under this new system a very much larger part of the United Kingdom as a whole is to become development area. Indeed, it has been reported, though I have not done the geographical calculations myself, that no less than 55 per cent. of the area of the United Kingdom, more than half, is now to be development area, the technical term "area" having taken the place of the previous technical term "district". Therefore, the financial assistance which is to be available now will be spread more thinly over a much wider area. I believe that it was far more beneficial for Scotland when the benefits were concentrated in the areas where they were most needed.<br/>
May I say straight away that this is not a constituency point. I have mentioned the north-east of Scotland, but my constituency was not a development district, being an area which did not suffer high unemployment. It now falls within the new areas, so I say straight away that I am being entirely altruistic in my remarks. This is not a constituency point. I am concerned about Scotland as a whole, and particularly about areas like the Highlands and Islands defined as the seven crofting counties, and those areas in the northeast of Scotland where my constituency is, but which are not so fortunate as my constituency, and, therefore, need the special benefits. But now the Bill has been passed, and has become an Act, and the House has therefore, accepted the widening of the area into a huge development area under the new terminology.<br/>
The Order states that almost the whole of Scotland is to become a development area, but there is an incredible small gap in the middle. It is so inexplicable that it can only be some form of deliberate discrimination against the area concerned. I do not know whether you have examined a map showing the United Kingdom with the new development areas marked on it, Mr. Deputy Speaker, but in an area covering almost the whole of Scotland and the north-east and north-west of England there suddenly appears a small hole, or gap, in the middle.<br/>
Why are these areas set out in this extraordinary shape? Is it that Ministers have been studying the sculptures of Henry Moore and decided that a shape is not complete unless it has a hole in the middle? That is the only explanation I can give for this extraordinary shape in the middle of the development areas in the northern part of the United Kingdom. Perhaps Ministers have been influenced by the <i>avant garde</i> painting in the Harcourt Room? Perhaps they have decided that throwing paint at a map or a wall is one way of marking out development areas. I can think of no other explanation.<br/>
I am sure that the earlier system of concentrating financial assistance where it was really needed in the special areas was best, but if the new policy has to be accepted, making about 55 per cent. of the United Kingdom into development areas, I cannot understand why this gap should be left. As my noble Friend has said, no explanation has been given by the Government. I am sure that other Scottish Members will continue to press the Government to explain why they have described this extraordinary shape in the north of the United Kingdom. We appeal to the Minister of State, who has a constituency interest in this matter&#x2014;</p>

<p>I congratulate the Minister on what he achieved. All I can say is that I respect him personally as a candidate. He obviously did very well, because he defended something utterly illogical. When he was in opposition he made quite a reputation&#x2014;as I am sure many of my hon. Friends from Scottish constituencies will agree&#x2014;for presenting logical arguments which

at times, when there was a shortage, almost qualified him as a Law Officer. It was merely the lack of the necessary training and qualifications that prevented this.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman's arguments have always been very logical. That is why I appeal to him to try to influence his hon. Friends, despite his success in defending an illogical policy during the General Election. I appeal to him to stop thinking about what happened eight months ago and to start thinking about what will be necessary in the coming months, when the squeeze will bite even more deeply into Scotland and when the area covered by the gap in the map will feel the squeeze as much as any other area.</p>

<p>I do not know whether a Member representing a constituency in the north of England is permitted to participate in this debate, which so far has concentrated on affairs a little to the north of that area. I am provoked to join in the discussion by some of the remarks of the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell).<br/>
The hon. Gentleman said that, because of the Order, more than half the United Kingdom will be in a development area and that this might mean that the special help to those areas might be diffused too thinly. Half the United Kingdom may be within these areas, but by no means half the population will be. The population and employment factors are essential here. It is essential to remember that Merseyside, the north of England and at least the greater part of Scotland, in spite of having a relatively small proportion of the population, a disproportionately high percentage of unemployment.<br/>
The hon. Member also said that we should concentrate the special help which is always available under industrial development orders on those areas within the development areas which are particularly in need. We on this side have always taken the view that, in the north of England, pockets of heavy unemployment within the Northern region should not be isolated, because the nature of the integrated industrial and commercial blocks there made it


impossible to plan the economy effectively en that basis. Therefore, the idea of making the whole of the northern region a development area, which is what the Order will do was always the view which we took on this side of the House about how that area should be developed&#x2014;</p>

<p>I agree with the hon. Gentleman, but if the whole of Newcastle had been excluded from that area, it would have been exactly the opposite of that argument.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1966-11-23a.1537.1" hansard_membership_id="11352" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20055" speakername="Mr. Rhodes" colnum="1537" time="">
<p>But I see from the Order that the whole of Newcastle and Walker, which is in the centre of my constituency, is left in, so I am not complaining, but the industrial and economic circumstances in Newcastle and Walker, as the very centre of the Tyneside industrial development, may have justified its being left in, although its unemployment figures were not as high as those of other parts of the region. The parallel argument may not apply to Edinburgh, Leith and Portobello. I do not know, and would not venture an opinion on the matter, as hon. Members opposite will tell me that I do not know what I am talking about. But I do know what I am talking about in relation to Tyneside and particularly in relation to Walker.<br/>
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, North (Earl of Dalkeith) said that perhaps these areas had been left out because they are the last citadels and last bastions of anti-Socialism in Scotland. If he had read the Order, he would have noticed that, in the northern development area, are included areas which are the last bastions of anti-Socialism in the north of England&#x2014;Berwick-upon-Tweed, for example, and Hexham, Kendal, Keswick, Malton, Scarborough, Richmond, Thirsk and Windermere. I believe that all these places are represented by Conservative Members of Parliament.<br/>
It would, therefore, be illogical, if the hon. Member's point were followed, for this Government to have been so disgraceful as to leave out Edinburgh, Leith and Portobello if they failed also to leave out Berwick-upon-Tweed and Hexham. There may have been particular reasons in the northern region why these last bastions of anti-Socialism were included in the development area, while, for other

reasons, Edinburgh, Leith and Portobello were not included in Scotland.<br/>
I would like to hear my right hon. Friend's reason why these were left out; I am sure that it is a very good one.<br/>
I think it excellent that the areas in the northern region and the whole of Scotland which I have mentioned have been included in this development area. In that region we have had for many years twice the national average of unemployment. This persisted during the many years when hon. Members opposite were in office, but I am pleased to be able to repeat tonight that the relativity gap between our region and the rest of the country is rapidly closing. Unemployment is increasing all over the country, but it is worth bearing in mind that in the Northern Region while it is hovering around 40,000&#x2014;which is still too high&#x2014;it is less than half what it was during 1962 and 1963 when hon. Members opposite were in power.<br/>
I suggest that is because the region has been given priority as a complete and comprehensive development area with the lion's share of new factory space since this Government came into power. It is significant that the last time that the northern region and central Scotland had the lion's share of new factory space was precisely between 1945 and 1951 when, again, a Labour Government were in power. Right smack in the middle of this development area, I contested my constituency at the last election supporting the Government's policy of declaring that the whole region should be a development area. I say with all humility that my constituency had the fourth highest swing to the Government in the whole United Kingdom. So this policy was certainly popular.</p>

<p>Has the hon. Member ever worked out how long it takes for a factory to be in operation from the moment that it is on the drawing board? If he did so he would find that the great majority of factories in the North-East were started under Conservative Government.</p>

<p>I would be willing to give way to the noble Lord if he were to inform me about something taking place in Scotland, but I think it a little presumptuous of him to tell me about what is going on on Tyneside.<br/>
What I said is correct, that the lion's share of new factory space being allocated for the first time, where work has not yet begun, has been allocated by this Government to this area. It is higher than ever before and the last time that this happened was between 1945 and 1951. I do not know the position over new factory building in Scotland, but I can assure the hon. Member that this concerns not only new buildings being completed, but brand new factory space which my right hon. Friends have said should go to the region because they are interested in the region.<br/>
Some of the arguments suggesting why these areas were left out are completely illogical. They did not refer to the region to which I have referred.</p>

<p>I am sure, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that you will share my view that it is always distressing to see one who, although he is on the other side of the House, is a personal friend and who shares one's views on many subjects, in considerable difficulty and distress. I confess that my heart goes out to the Minister of State, Board of Trade, tonight. So desperate is he that he has had to call to his assistance no less a personage than the Minister of State, Scotland, who is looking even more lugubrious than we often think he does.<br/>
I was unhappy when in a certain city in Scotland some months ago I was asked to comment on whether it would be correct to parody a well-known song and to say "The Darling is a Charlie". I must not, I gather, refer to the exclusion of certain areas. All I would say in this connection is that the Minister of State, Board of Trade, must feel slightly disturbed in that behind him is sitting the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel) who, on 9th March 1966, gave certain specific assurances, more or less on behalf of the Board of Trade, that certain incentives would be given to a certain area. It must make it rather uncomfortable for the Minister of State to have to explain why those assurances have not been fulfilled.<br/>
I ask the Minister of State why he gives his incentives in the development area to

Musselburgh? Is it because Musselburgh happens to be in the constituency of the Minister of State, Scottish Office? That does not appear to be the reason. Why give them not only to Musselburgh but to Dalkeith, Ratho and Newbridge? The Secretary of State for Scotland gave as the reason for the exclusion of certain areas a persistently low level of unemployment and reduced population growth. Why does that bring in Musselburgh, Dalkeith, Ratho and Newbridge? What is there peculiar about the needs of Balerno, lying, as it does, just over the line? What is there, in this instance, different as between one side of the line and the other? Is the unemployment rate higher? The answer is that it is not. and well does the Minister of State know it.<br/>
Surely the main objective in doing what the Government are doing is to get greater efficiency in the export trade, which is vital to the economy, and therefore to do away with things like double handling. But, of course, by going back into the hinterland it is inevitable that double handling will have to take place and costs are therefore bound to rise. This is no way to get the necessary competition which is essential if we are to get into the markets of the world.</p>

<p>When it concerns Scotland, as does this review, it would be advantageous for Scottish Members to read it. I do not want to quote all the help that it will give to the hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) and his constituency and how much per head of the population it involves. The review says, under the heading of "Scotland Takes the Strain.":
<q>On balance, over the past two years the Scottish economy has made good progress. Output and exports have risen faster than in the United Kingdom as a whole, and more new industries have been attracted to Scotland.</q>
Do hon. Gentlemen who have tried to attack my hon. and right hon. Friends for attempting to bring succour and relief to Scotland wish to query this? I want to repudiate the attack that has been made upon them. I call to my aid the review of the Midland Bank. On the centre pages, under the heading "Scotland takes the Strain", it portrays the size of the problem which the Government have undertaken. It talks about the bad housing, the old industry passing away, and about having to start from scratch. These problems have been gone into. Then there is the tribute on the front page: "Scotland Takes the Strain," and she is riding triumphantly ahead under the present Government, and will not be held back by backwoodsmen from Tory areas who do not want industry.</p>

<p>What the hon. Gentleman has been saying about the last two years is what has been happening under the existing system of investment allowances. The new system has not yet come into action. What has been happening so far is the result of the four and five years of the past system, not the new system.</p>

<p>That is the point. All of us know, if we are sincere, that these deep-seated problems have to be cured, and we cannot cure them in the space


of two years. Many things have to be accomplished, including the change-over of heavy industries into light industries. I would have thought that in an order that is securing for Scotland the whole of its area being a development area, which will secure new investment grants, that hon. Members opposite would have supported it and not have repudiated it in the way they have done tonight.</p>

<p>When the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Bridlington (Mr. Wood) began this debate, I do not think that he or I expected it to develop as it has done. I would like to congratulate the right hon. Gentleman on his perseverance in pursuing, in rather more difficult circumstances than usual, the point he has made so frequently about the way the development areas have been drawn under the new Industrial Development Act. I should also like to congratulate him on the moderation with which he pursues this deep constituency problem. I can assure him that the contemplation of my right hon. Friend the President of the Board of Trade on this matter did not come to an end in July. In fact, we have given considerable thought to the issue which he has raised, and we shall continue to give thought to it.<br/>
I hope I can keep in order by drawing attention to a district that is in the Schedule&#x2014;namely, Scarborough. The reason why Scarborough is in and a place not far away has been left out is that in Scarborough, unlike the other place which I have not mentioned, the population has been declining. Industrial development has been practically nil for the last six or seven years. Only seven industrial development certificates have been approved in the last six years in Scarborough, and, as far as we can discover, these have produced only about 230 new jobs. The situation in Scarborough under the new criteria that are laid down is not just a matter of unemployment, but also concerns the course of employment, whether or not it is rising rapidly, migration, population trends, regional problems, and so on. Because of this situation, we are quite right, in our view, in putting Scarborough in.<br/>
One can argue, as the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) has argued in relation to certain areas in Scotland, that certain parts of a district around Scarborough come into the development area and certain parts are left out. Without a map I could not follow exactly which places the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West, was referring to, but the principle involved is the same. Some parts have come in or have been left out because, after a great deal of consideration, we thought it right to draw our boundary lines round the employment exchange areas. We said during the passage of the Bill that that was to be the present arrangement; that we thought that it was the best way of drawing the boundaries, but that if experience showed that we were wrong we could change this method, the Board of Trade having discretion to alter boundaries by bringing Orders before this House for that purpose.<br/>
The value to be attached to this debate lies in the fact that there is not one member of the Opposition on the Front Bench opposite to support the Prayer, and I will certainly treat the right hon. Gentleman with a great deal more courtesy than his own Front Bench seems to have shown. Hoping still to keep within the rules of order, I will try to say why we have drawn the Schedule in this way.<br/>
We have taken into consideration other facts besides unemployment. We have tried to look at industrial development not only for the purpose of dealing with unemployment but in order to get a far better distribution of industry than we have hitherto had. We have, therefore, so designated the development areas as to bring within our wider policies of regional development industrial development on a better national scale.<br/>
We have given careful consideration to the choice of areas. These were reviewed during the passage of the Bill. We have listened to representations, and if, for example, we had given to Bridlington the concession that has been asked for, we would have had to give the same sort of concession to a large number of other seaside resorts which are outside the development areas but where equally strong representations have been made and where the situation is similar to that in Bridlington in terms of


unemployment, population trend, and so on.<br/>
The answer to the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North (Earl of Dalkeith), who said that we were treating the matter in an authoritarian manner because we have not, so to speak, given way to the representations made to us by Edinburgh, is that we have had put to us stronger cases than the case presented by Edinburgh. If we had given way to all those representations, the whole plan of industrial development laid down in the Act would have been completely vitiated&#x2014;</p>

<p>If the hon. Member will only allow me to develop my speech, I will deal with that matter. I did not interrupt him.<br/>
We are asked why there is a hole, so to speak, in the Scottish development area, but there is another place that is not included, and that is the capital of Wales. These two capital cities are very attractive. They are magnets. They attract employment on a very big scale. We have left both of them out for the very good reason that if we were to attract more and more employment into either or both places, we would not give a fair chance to other parts of Scotland and Wales where industrial development is far more urgent and is needed on a much greater scale.<br/>
It has been suggested that a Minister who is home-based in London does not know a great deal about what goes on in Scotland. I have paid two visits recently to development areas in Scotland where industrial development is needed as a result of coal mine closures and all the other problems which have to be dealt with. I did not find anybody outside the capital city who objected to what we have done about Edinburgh. In fact, many representatives of local authorities and industrialists thought we had done the right thing, because they wanted to attract industry to their own areas where there was unemployment and where there was a rundown of old-fashioned industries such as coal mining. I do not think, apart from the special constituency cases put

forward by the representatives on one side of the political set-up of the city of Edinburgh, that many people in Scotland dissent from that point of view at all, except for the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell). If the hon. Member would logically examine his arguments, I think he would agree that it is better that we should concentrate our efforts on the places in Scotland which really need these efforts rather than bring in a magnet we do not want to be used, certainly at the present time.</p>

<p>I am sorry, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I think you will agree that I was rather led astray, but I am certainly in a little difficulty now in trying to reply to the right hon. Gentleman. However, I think the point I have made will explain why we drew the boundary line where we did.<br/>
As for the rest of the development areas, we have had very little criticism except on an issue&#x2014;I do not know whether this is in order or not&#x2014;which certainly has got to be looked at in the future, and that is the problem first of all of certain seaside places which have an entirely different employment problem to deal with than the general run of industrial areas where unemployment still persists.<br/>
In seaside resorts one has a very high proportion of older people, many of whom have retired there at below the


normal retiring age, who are still available for work and therefore sign on at the employment exchange and are counted as unemployed if they do not get a job. One has also the difficult problem of seasonal unemployment, which means that the industrialist one is trying to attract to an area of this kind in order to provide industrial development may wonder whether he will get the type of work people he wants all the year round or whether they will be attracted to other jobs during the summer season.<br/>
These are problems which apply not just to one seaside resort, but all the way round the coast. I am sure that we have to consider this problem and think very carefully of the types of industry which would be best suited to go into areas of this kind.<br/>
Later on, when we have got the unemployment problem generally throughout the country under control by getting this better spread of industry, we shall have to come back to one or two of the issues which were raised during the passage of the Bill, particularly the very interesting discussion that we had in Committee about what we then called the "grey" areas, where there is no noticeable unemployment, but where there is no expansion, where industry is standing still, and where the social life of the towns is stagnating&#x2014;I think that is the right word. These grey areas have to be dealt with not merely in terms of finding employment and industrial development, but in terms of social regeneration as well.<br/>
The immediate problem&#x2014;and this is the problem with which we are trying to deal by bringing forward the Schedule for the development areas in the way that we have--- is still that of unemployment, the under-development of industry, and of getting the right kind of industrial development in the right places.</p>

<p>I am sure that this is germane to the general problem, but I am not sure that it is germane to the Order which we are discussing.<br/>
I think that I have said enough to show that we have these matters under review. We have to work to priorities. First, we must deal with the problem of unemployment where it appears. Secondly, we have to deal with the places which are stagnating, and particularly the peculiar employment problems of seaside resorts, but these are matters which can come along after we have made a great deal more progress in dealing with the problems of unemployment, but I take into consideration all the representations which the right hon.

<p>I am grateful for the opportunity of raising in the House a matter which has left the inhabitants of the village of Astley Abbotts with a great sense of grievance and injustice.<br/>
This village is a scattered one of about 300 inhabitants. Like other such villages, it had a village school which, as happens in these times, was recently closed by the local education authority. The school had been provided by a private family. It has trustees and has a trust deed. The trust deed provides that, in the event of the closing of the school, it shall be sold and the proceeds devoted to the benefit of the village.<br/>
Such provisions are not always put into practice, but in fact after a lengthy period of negotiations a scheme was agreed between the trustees, the Ministry of Education, the Hereford diocesan council, the education council, the parish council, the parochial church council, and such of the descendants of the original donor as it had been possible to trace.<br/>
The scheme provided for the investment of the proceeds of the sale of the school and for the application of the income for the provision of facilities for the religious, educational, social, moral and physical well being of the young people resident in that parish. All that remained was to sell the school.<br/>
That is one side of the story. The other side concerns the local council, namely, the Bridgnorth Rural District Council. This council had been attempting for about four years to solve the problem of housing a large family for which it had responsibility and for whom it required a site and housing accommodation outside the immediate confines or a village. The council had experienced many frustrations, having made attempts with a number of sites, all of which had failed to secure planning permission.<br/>
The matter appeared to become urgent in July 1965, when the family in question was burnt out by fire from its existing accommodation. The school of which I have spoken was outside the confines of Astley Abbotts village, and the council took the view that if it could be adapted and converted into living accommodation it might solve the problem of housing this family. The council therefore approached the trustees of the school. It asked, in July, 1965, that the district valuer should inspect and report. The reply by the trustees' agents was that they had no permission from the Ministry of Education for such an inspection to be made.<br/>
The council was concerned that the school premises should be made habitable before the winter. Accordingly, in August it made a further approach. The trustees were informed by the clerk that the council had given authority for compulsory acquisition but would be willing to negotiate for private sale. The council was informed in reply, on behalf of the trustees, that the Minister of Education had asked for a valuation and report by an independent valuer; that he had required the valuer to make a recommendation as to the method of sale; that the valuer had definitly advised a sale by public auction: that the trustees were awaiting the Minister's instructions, and that in the meantime they could not advise the trustees to negotiate a private sale to the council or anyone

else without the Minister's authority. Fourteen days later the council served a compulsory purchase notice.<br/>
The trustees, not unnaturally, protested at this proceeding. The situation became known in the village and much criticism was expressed. The council scheme was criticised on the ground that the proposed conversion could not possibly be economic. It has also been asserted that the scheme was opposed because the villagers objected to a scheme for housing this family, but I am informed that this was never a principal cause of criticism. What was criticised was the proposal to spend public money on housing in the village a family from outside when no money had been spent on providing houses in the village for the inhabitants themselves. But the main object of criticism throughout was the compulsory purchase.<br/>
In October, 1965, a parish meeting was held. More than 70 people attended. This is a remarkable number for a Shropshire village meeting&#x2014;certainly more than a Member of Parliament would hope to draw for a political meeting. Since this may appear to be undue self-criticism, I should point out that within the last month a political meeting in a much larger village in my constituency, addressed by a Minister of the Crown, drew an audience of less than 25 people.<br/>
The result of the meeting was a unanimous resolution that an objection should be lodged by the trustees. The trustees accordingly lodged an objection with the Minister. I am informed that about six months elapsed before any action was taken by the Minister, and I invite the Minister specifically to explain this delay. One inevitable result was to render nugatory the main purpose of the compulsory purchase order, namely, to get the school premises into habitable condition before the winter of 1965.<br/>
A public inquiry was eventually held by one of the Minister's inspectors on 21st June, 1966, and the inspector made a detailed report of the contents, of which the Minister will be aware. The inspector treated the issue of the compulsory purchase order as the principal ground of objection. He recorded his opinion that, despite the lack of merit in this principal ground of objection, the council had failed to substantiate its case for the


compulsory acquisition of the property. He considered its proposals to be generally unsatisfactory and uneconomic.<br/>
On 13th October, a letter was sent by the Ministry. It stated that the Minister accepted the inspector's view that there was little merit in the principal ground of objection concerning compensation, but declared his view that the council had proved its need to acquire the property, and stated that he had, therefore, decided to confirm the order. In so doing, of course, he overruled his inspector.<br/>
What is the position now in this sorry story? The position must surely be that two winters have now been lost. The trustees are still willing, as they have throughout been, to sell the property at public auction. But the Minister, first, by his inaction held up any solution of the problem, and, finally, by his action in confirming the compulsory purchase order, he has decided it in a way that must give the greatest possible dissatisfaction both to the trustees and to the local inhabitants.<br/>
The important thing in a case of this kind is surely not only that justice should be done but also that justice should be seen to be done. Nobody in Astley Abbotts will be persuaded that the district valuer's valuation will be as much as the price that could have been secured by public auction in 1965. Thanks to the Government's economic policy and to its effect on land values, there is now no prospect that either the district valuer's valuation or a public auction held now could result in as large a price as would have been realised by public auction in 1965. In fact, we now face the position, thanks to the Ministry, that full justice never can be done, and it will for ever be seen that justice has not been done.<br/>
We shall probably shortly be hearing from the Minister the stock reply that there is no injustice in a compulsory purchase order since the district valuer's duty is to value at a public auction price. But if it is true&#x2014;certainly no one in Astley Abbotts would agree with it&#x2014;that the compulsory value is the same as the auction value, it must be equally true that the auction value is the same as the compulsory value. Why not, then, have the public auction?<br/>
The inspector found that on this issue the objectors' case was "devoid of merit". This finding alone should have alerted the Minister. While the inspector was clearly entitled to decide in favour of the compulsory purchase, his funding that the contrary argument was "devoid of merit" was contradicted by every circumstance of the case, both by the fact that public auction had been recommended by the Ministry of Education's own valuers and by the consideration of public feeling so cogently expressed by the inspector himself in paragraphs 28&#x2013;34 of his report.<br/>
What has happened will always be regarded by local opinion as a wrong&#x2014;a wrong of arbitrary decision, arrived at for mistaken reasons, to achieve an object which now can never be completely achieved. Surely now a second winter must already have been lost. The unfortunate family on whose behalf this quarrel began cannot, one would think, benefit from the scheme before the spring. There could have been no objection to a public auction except for the few weeks' delay involved, and that delay would surely have been a consideration of little relevance in the case. What is and will always be relevant is the local feelings and the principle at stake.<br/>
The Minister's action on his inspector's report is hard to comprehend. He overruled his inspector on the technical and economic question which the inspector had investigated in detail on the spot, but declined to over-rule him on the matter of principle which was crystal-clear from a reading of the report. There may be nothing which the Minister can do now to redeem the errors perpetrated in this case. I can only hope that this Astley Abbotts case will be remembered by him as an example of how not to deal with cases of this kind.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Member for Ludlow (Mr. More) for raising this case, because it is an unusual one and because he has given me the opportunity to make it clear that neither my right hon. Friend nor I have any doubts about the sincerity of purpose of the Bridgnorth Rural


District Council, which made the compulsory purchase order, or of the objectors who opposed it.<br/>
The council, in common with every housing authority, has a duty imposed upon it by Section 91 of the Housing Act, 1957, to provide housing accommodation to meet the needs of its district. Under Section 92 of the same Act it may provide that accommodation by erecting houses, converting any buildings into houses, acquiring houses, or by altering, enlarging or improving any houses or buildings.<br/>
These powers should be read in conjunction with those in Section 96, which set out the purposes for which housing authorities may buy land and the buildings upon it. They may, for example, acquire houses or buildings which may be made suitable as houses, together with any lands occupied with the houses or buildings. To complete the picture, I must explain that a housing authority may, under Section 97 of the Act of 1957, acquire by agreement, or it may be authorised to purchase compulsorily by the Minister.<br/>
This then is the context in which the Bridgnorth Rural District Council acted, and, if the case is an unusual one, the purposes it had in mind, the powers it used and the procedures it followed are those generally available to housing authorities and are, indeed, the day-to-day tools that enable them to do their job.<br/>
I turn now to the case itself&#x2014;the case of the Bridgnorth Rural (Astley Abbotts) Compulsory Purchase Order (No. 3), 1965. It is a pleasing feature that nobody disputes that the council was faced with a particular housing need which it alone seemed to be in a position to satisfy. There were in the district six families who, in the council's opinion, would best benefit from a gradual introduction to the full standards of local authority accommodation. The needs of one family were particularly urgent.<br/>
Another part of the council's case that is generally accepted is that over a period of years it had tried to no avail to purchase vacant properties capable of renovation that could be made suitable for one or more of these famalies. But where the premises were suitable negotiations had broken down when the council's purpose became clear.<br/>
The council turned its attention to the former school and school house on a site of rather more than one third of an acre at Astley Abbotts. The land had originally been given to the Parish of Astley Abbotts by Sir Henry Tyrwhitt in January, 1873, but in July, 1962, the school was closed by the Shropshire Education Committee. The school house and the school accordingly fell vacant and were vacant when, nearly three years later in 1965&#x2014;I give no undue emphasis to the period&#x2014;the council sought to negotiate their acquisition. These negotiations, which extended over three months, proved unsuccessful. Accordingly, on 30th July, 1965, the council made an order for the compulsory acquisition of the property.<br/>
The owners were the churchwardens of the parish, as the surviving trustees. They were anxious to dispose of the property and would have been quite ready to sell it to the council, provided the sale was by public auction and, of course, provided that the council was the highest bidder. The trustees did, I believe, seek the necessary approval of the Department of Education and Science to this course, but their application was submitted early in August 1965 after the council had made a compulsory purchase order.<br/>
In September 1965, the Department of Education and Science informed the trustees that the Secretary of State would be willing to authorise a sale by public auction, if that was a course in which the council was agreeable to co-operate. In a nutshell, therefore, the question was whether the council would decide not to proceed with its compulsory purchase order and be prepared to bid at a public auction or whether it would go ahead and seek confirmation of the order by the Minister: the decision was for the council to take. The council went ahead with the order.<br/>
As I understand, the trustees' view was that they stood to get a better price at a public auction. This was the essence of the case they developed at the public inquiry into the order, held by one of the Minister's inspectors. The hon. Member asked a fair question, why was there delay? He must understand that there is tremendous pressure on my Department when compulsory purchase orders are made, because we have only a certain number of inspectors. I am sorry that it


took so long, but that was the best we could do. The parish council objection was in fact based on the amount of compensation it thought it would receive, but questions of compensation are quite outside the scope of the Minister's jurisdiction when coming to a decision upon a compulsory purchase order. It is not surprising, therefore, that the inspector in his report referred to the lack of merit in the principal ground of objection to the order.<br/>
The basis of compensation payable and the procedure to be followed are laid down by Statute. In the case of the Astley Abbotts, compulsory purchase order compensation is payable at full market value; no account may be taken on account of the acquisition being compulsory; and the value is to be taken essentially to be the amount which the land if sold in the open market by a willing seller might be expected to realise. Appeal against the amount of compensation offered lies not to the Minister but to the Lands Tribunal.<br/>
The owner trustees might well prefer the quick realisation of market value by means of a public auction but they should not, I submit, quarrel with the basis laid down for the compensation.<br/>
The owners also protested at the inquiry at the length of time, which the hon. Member mentioned, that had elapsed since the making of the compulsory purchase order. The inquiry was held on 21st June this year, and accordingly it was implied that the council's wish to rehouse the family in greatest need before the winter had been frustrated by the making of the order. Much of this argument could have been resolved if the trustees had consulted the council. I make little of the possibility that the property could have been sold to the council by agreement at any time. Rather I regret the fact that it was not possible to hold the inquiry until nearly 11 months after the order was made, but there were good reasons for the apparent delay.<br/>
As I said at the outset, this was an unusual case and necessarily a number of technical questions relating to ownership and interests in the property had to be cleared up before an inquiry could be held. But a point of more substance was that planning permission for the

change of use of the school, as opposed to the school house, was not available before the middle of March 1966. This is a fact of some relevance also to the trustees who must, I should have thought, have welcomed this approval.<br/>
I turn in more detail to the public inquiry and to the inspector's report. The owners were supported in their objections by the parish council and other local bodies. Some 250 parishioners had also signed a petition opposing the compulsory purchase order.<br/>
Apart from those matters that I have already mentioned, there were two main and related points at issue. These were the suitability of the premises for their intended housing use and the economics of the conversion of the existing buildings. The inspector found that the property was physically capable of conversion and that main water and electricity services were available within a reasonable distance. The site is isolated from any existing community and, on that account, would appear suitable for the purposes that the council had in mind. The hon. Member knows all about that.<br/>
Yet the Inspector recommended that the order be not confirmed despite, as I have already remarked, lack of merit in the principal ground of objection. He came to this view because he considered the council's proposals to be generally unsatisfactory and uneconomic.<br/>
The Minister naturally gave the inspector's report and his recommendations the most serious consideration, but he did not share the inspector's view that the council had failed to substantiate its case for acquisition. Its housing need is not disputed, nor did the owners object to the proposed use of the property.<br/>
It is accepted that the works which the council will need to undertake will prove expensive and that the buildings may have only a limited life. But the Housing Acts do not say that a local authority should make a profit or break even on every scheme they undertake. Indeed, the chances of profit or of avoiding a loss are usually least where the social need is greatest. Whether social needs outweigh straight economics in any particular circumstances is a question of judgment. The council came to the conclusion in this case that the expenses that it was likely to incur were justified


by the housing need it sought to satisfy. The Minister, in confirming the compulsory purchase order on 13th October, has upheld that view. Now that he has issued his decision he has no further authority to intervene.<br/>
Nevertheless, I can hope&#x2014;and I am sure that the hon. Member will join me in

this&#x2014;that the necessary work will now go ahead to provide accommodation as quickly as possible, at least for the family with the most urgent need.</p>
