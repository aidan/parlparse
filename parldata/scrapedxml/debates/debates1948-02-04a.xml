In Kenya a general Land and Agricultural Bank was established in 1931. Tanganyika has recently passed legislation to set up a similar Bank. The Government of Uganda are considering doing so, but in Zanzibar and Nyasaland it is not considered that the demand exists as yet.<br/>
In West Africa there are no Land Banks or Building Societies in Nigeria, the Gold Coast and Gambia.<br/>

<p>With the creation of the East African Central Assembly, it will no longer be necessary for four official members of the Kenya Legislature to sit in the Kenya Council. At the same time, the official Arab member will give way to a nominated unofficial Arab member and the number of African representatives will be increased from two to four. The Council will then be composed of 15 official and 22 unofficial members, made up of 11 elected Europeans, five elected Indians, two nominated Arabs and four nominated Africans. As an interim measure, the African members are to be selected by the Governor from a panel of names submitted by the African local government bodies, but I hope that in the reasonably near future it may be possible to establish a system of actual election by those bodies.</p>

<p>As has already been announced, it is the intention of His Majesty's Government to terminate their Mandate in Palestine, and with it their civil administration of that country, on 15th May next, and to complete the evacuation of their Forces from Palestine by 1st August next. The progress of the withdrawal of British Forces, stores and equipment from Palestine is proceeding according to these plans, and is making

good progress. The Government deplore the outbreaks of violence occurring in Palestine, with the casualties they entail, both to the civil population and to personnel of the British Forces and civil administration. During the Debate on 12th December, 1947, it was stated that His Majesty's Government would keep in mind the possibility of withdrawing at earlier dates than those stated above. The matter has accordingly been kept under review, and has recently been reexamined. But, having regard to all the factors, and to all that has to he done, and to the very great care with which the original plan was worked out, His Majesty's Government must adhere to the dates originally announced, i.e., 15th May for the termination of the Mandate, and 1st August for the completion of the evacuation of British Forces.</p>

<p>The Auster aircraft recently sold to the Aviron Palestine Aviation Company were not only demilitarised before disposal, but were all in an unserviceable condition. Their sale by open tender was consequently not inconsistent with the policy of denying warlike material to both Arabs and Jews in Palestine. Since, however, it is possible to adapt civil aircraft for military use, steps have now been taken to ensure that no British planes will pass into Arab or Jewish hands in Palestine so long as there is danger of civil war in that country.<br/>
Disposal is at present proceeding of large quantities of surplus military supplies in Palestine which are of a non-warlike nature and which have a civilian use; it is not proposed to discontinue the sales of these stores. Every possible precaution is being taken to ensure that surplus warlike material does not pass into the hands of Jews or Arabs in that country.<br/>
There is at present an embargo on the entry into Palestine, both by sea and over the land frontiers, of all warlike material. The Government of Palestine will enforce this embargo to the best of their ability until the Mandate comes to an end on 15th May.<br/>
It is also the policy of His Majesty's Government to refuse permission for the export of military material from Great Britain to any part of the Middle East, except under existing contracts which have been undertaken as a result of our Treaty obligations to certain Arab Governments. His Majesty's Government have no reason to suppose that the material supplied by them under such contracts will be used in Palestine.</p>

In the Navy, this supplementary ration is allowed to new entries. It may also be specially issued to personnel engaged in man&#x0153;uvres or other forms of hard training, or on heavy works services.</p>

<p>While I thank my right hon. Friend for his endeavour to ease the sense of unfairness created by his former statement, may I ask if he could inform the House whether these changes will now involve indenting for rations on the basis of special trades, instead of on the basis of units as a whole, whether this will not give rise to considerable administrative difficulty, and whether his present statement may not cause some invidious distinction between the different amounts of rations?</p>

<p>None, Sir.

<p>The right hon. Gentleman will, I trust, agree with me in the general principle, that Members should have the freest possible right to put Questions on the Paper without prejudice to the undoubted right of Ministers to refuse to answer them if they consider the public interest is involved and if they are supported by the general feeling of the House? That is the only principle that I am wishing to assert. Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that, at the present time, whole blocks of very important topics, in which enormous numbers of people are interested and concerned, are ruled out because it is thought that Ministers do not wish to have those Questions answered, and because it is alleged that Ministers have no particular power over the nationalised industries in question, whereas, in the case of a good many of the industries that have been nationalised, specific powers have been retained by the Government both in regard to the securing of information from the industries and in regard to control over them? Will he bear this in mind, that there is no question at all of denying the ultimate right of a Minister to refuse to answer Questions provided he can carry with him the support of the House of Commons, but that there is grave objection to whole

classes of Questions being excluded even from being placed upon the Order Paper as a result of some Ministerial utterance? On the question of the Debate upon this subject, we gladly receive the right hon. Gentleman's assurance that conversations may take place with a view to fixing a date; but I must submit to him that this matter is not a party matter, that the Questions come from all parts of the House, that it concerns the Procedure of the House of Commons, and that, therefore, we consider most strongly that it rests with the Leader of the House to offer reasonable opportunity for this discussion in the Government's time.</p>

<p>On a point of Order. I wonder if I may seek your guidance, Mr. Speaker, on a particular point that arises from what the right hon. Member for Woodford (Mr. Churchill) has said? As I understand it, there is no dispute at all that a Minister is entitled to refuse, for reasons that seem to him good and sufficient, to answer a Question. The point at issue, if I understand the right hon. Gentleman correctly, is whether or not the Table has a right to refuse a Question or a series of Questions. Is it proper that a Question should be addressed to my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House about what is assumed to be, or is said to be, a mistake on the part of the Table? Is it correct that the question should be raised in that way?</p>

<p>I can explain to the hon. Member exactly what happens. It may help to clear up the situation. I am responsible, first of all, for seeing that the Question is in Order. A Question is not in Order if it does not involve Ministerial responsibility. That is the first proposition. Very well: a Question comes to the Table; the Table thinks that it does not involve Ministerial responsibility; then, possibly, the matter is put to me&#x2014;but more usually, I think, I am by-passed to save trouble. Anyhow, it does sometimes happen that a Question comes to me, and I have to give a Ruling. The Question, we will say, is about the transport industry or another of the nationalised industries. It comes to me, and the question I have to answer is, whether this is a matter of internal administration within the industry, or whether there is Ministerial responsibility. I am not prepared to answer questions about railways, about civil aviation, about telegraphs,


about everything else that is nationalised. The only thing I can do is to go to the Minister, or telephone him, and ask him what his opinion is, and whether this is a matter for which he has responsibility. [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."] That is the only possible course. Can I know all about these industries, and say whether every Question about them is in Order or not&#x2014;that it is a matter affecting a Minister's responsibility or not? I am bound by the Rules of the House to see that only Questions that are in Order are put down on the Order Paper. Therefore, if a Minister says that it is not his responsibility, then the Table does not allow the Question. I hope that makes the situation plain.</p>

<p>With very great respect, I am a little taken aback by the extent of the Ruling which you have given on this matter, Mr. Speaker. For a great many years, Sir, I submit to you, there has grown up the custom that the Table&#x2014;and we have the greatest respect for the manner in which the Clerks at the Table discharge their duties&#x2014;have only refused, say, questions of a particular class affecting individuals, and reflecting sometimes upon them. This has grown up by custom of the House. But now, suddenly, a vast mass of topics&#x2014;whole series of topics on vitally important business affecting millions of people&#x2014;has come under this bar.<br/>
Are we to understand that the Minister of a Department concerned will be the final judge of whether a Member is to put a Question on the Order Paper, irrespective of the Minister's right to say he does not wish to answer the Question? Is he to be the final judge even of whether a Member is to be allowed to put a Question on the Paper&#x2014;if a Minister says it is one he does not want to be asked? May I respectfully submit to you, Sir, that this is no new issue? In the case of the British Broadcasting Corporation in the war the Minister of Information frequently refused&#x2014;and very properly refused&#x2014;to answer Questions. But that did not prevent&#x2014;unless there was war danger&#x2014;Questions from being asked. May I also submit to you, Sir, that the mere placing on the Paper of a Question is a certain discharge by a Member of his duties to his constituents, and is also a certain ventilation of a topic, and, therefore, that there is a great difference between the right to ask Questions and the obligation

of a Minister to give a precise answer? I would most respectfully submit to you these matters, on which, I hope, your statement may be somewhat amplified.</p>

<p>I had hoped that I had made what is the present situation quite plain. As I understand we are to have a Debate on the matter I thought it might help the House to make that explanation.

Gentleman reminded us, in the case of the British Broadcasting Corporation, when the Table refused Question after Question which Members put down on the administration of the Corporation.</p>

<p>Perhaps I might refer to the original supplementary question put by the right hon. Gentleman. I wish to say that the Government do not presume to make any decision as to which Questions Mr. Speaker or the Table will accept. It would be quite improper on our part so to do. However, the Table and Mr. Speaker are sometimes in difficulties on a point of fact to know whether a Minister can or cannot take action. That is the only point upon which the Government might come in. That really is the point in dispute&#x2014;as to whether there is Ministerial responsibility or not.<br/>
I am bound to say, I am a little surprised at the right hon. Gentleman taking this line, because in the war the Minister of Information was absolutely responsible for everything the British Broadcasting Corporation did&#x2014;everything&#x2014;and, as hon. Members may remember, the then Minister of Information, now the right hon. Member for Bournemouth (Mr. Bracken), used to stand at this Box and flatly refuse to answer Question after Question&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "They were on the Paper?"] Yes, they were on the Paper; and to my amazement he got away with it. At the moment, the right hon. Gentleman is advancing, and his cheerful followers are blandly accepting, the argument that any hon. Member who wishes to put any Question has a right to have it on the Order Paper. I have been a Private Member of this House before, and I have had no end of struggles with the Table as to what they will accept and what they will not<ob/> and I am afraid it will go on.</p>

<p>Was that not because he was supported by the majority of the House of Commons? Is that not the right foundation on which Ministers can rely for the endorsement of their discretionary powers as to whether or not they should answer a Question? If Parliament, by a majority, supports them, and if it is the general feeling, no one wishes to run counter to the wishes, decisions and feelings&#x2014;[<i>Interruption.</i>] Just listen. No one wishes to run counter to the wishes, decisions and the majority of the House in these matters. But with regard to putting a Question on the Paper, surely the presumption should be that any Question may be put on the Paper unless barred by those long customs of good taste and non-assailment of individuals, which have been accepted by the House for generations. The presumption is that anybody may put a Question on the Paper. Does the right hon. Gentleman not realise that we are not objecting at all to the power of the Government, supported by the House of Commons, to refuse to answer Questions? What we are criticising is the institution of an arbitrary and mechanical bar to the placing of those Questions on the Paper.</p>

May I put it to you, that it is very often a question of law, and depends on the statute applicable to the particular industry?

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1948-02-04a.1821.1" hansard_membership_id="729" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/11956" speakername="The Prime Minister (Mr. Attlee)" colnum="1821" time="">
<p>I will, with your permission, Mr. Speaker, make a statement on personal incomes, costs and prices. I am sorry it is a rather long statement.<br/>
The nation's economic welfare depends largely upon our ability to make and sell the exports necessary to buy the imports we need to feed our people and keep our industry going. Our costs of production are of vital importance and they depend to a considerable extent on the amount which industry has to pay in profits, salaries and wages. These in turn in the form of individual incomes affect the total volume of money available in relation to the quantity of goods.<br/>
As regards costs of production, it was pointed out in the "Statement on the Economic Considerations affecting relations between Employers and Workers" (Cmd. 7018) issued in January, 1947, with the endorsement of the National Joint Advisory Council, that
<q>if costs of production and in consequence prices rise in relation to world prices, it may make it impossible for us to pay our way in the world and buy all the imports we need.</q>
We shall all suffer as a result and it is therefore the duty of everyone to play his or her part in averting the danger.<br/>
The Government have taken many steps already to prevent the development of a dangerous inflationary situation. High direct taxation on personal incomes and on distributed profits has curtailed the amount of profits available for spending and has thus helped to check the danger of inflation from personal incomes derived from investments, rents and profits. The same restraining influence has been applied to lower earned incomes by the introduction of P.A.Y.E. tax and by the increase of indirect taxation. This influence has to some extent been countered by the continuance of Exchequer subsidies for certain commodities, notably the principal foodstuffs, though it must be noted that the subsidies have helped to keep down the cost of living and so the demand for increased wages. But if personal incomes are allowed to rise continuously none of these measures against inflation can be effective.<br/>
The danger of inflation is ever present and will be accentuated by the drive to

achieve a balance of payments, which will reduce the total volume of goods available on the home market. Moreover, experience has shown that, when it comes to a race between rising prices and personal incomes, prices will always win in the long run, so that conditions become progressively worse for the holders of all personal incomes but particularly for wage earners.<br/>
It is essential, therefore, that there should be no further general increase in the level of personal incomes without at least a corresponding increase in the volume of production. Unless we are prepared to check any such tendency we shall find ourselves unable to fulfil our export task owing to the rise in costs, which will also be reflected in rising prices on the home market.<br/>
The last hundred years have seen the growth of certain traditional or customary relationships between personal incomes&#x2014;including wages and salaries&#x2014;in different occupations. These have no necessary relevance to modern conditions. The relation which different personal incomes bear to one another must no longer be determined by this historical development of the past, but by the urgent needs of the present. In the changed world of today and with our present economic difficulties these old relationships of income must, where necessary, be adapted to conform to the national interest. Relative income levels must be such as to encourage the movement of labour to those industries where it is most needed, and should not, as in some cases they still do, tempt it in a contrary direction.<br/>
The Government accordingly feel bound to set out the following general considerations as a guide to all those whose deliberations and actions contribute to the settlement of the amount of personal incomes, from whatever source.<br/>
It is not desirable for the Government to interfere directly with the income of individuals otherwise than by taxation. To go further would mean that the Government would be forced itself to assess and regulate all personal incomes according to some scale which would have to be determined. This would be an incursion by the Government into what has hitherto been regarded as a field of free contract between individuals and organisations.<br/>
In the view of the Government it is essential that there should be the strictest adherence to the terms of collective agreements. One of the main advantages of a system of collective bargaining is that it tends to ensure that wage and salary movements take place in an orderly manner and with due regard to the general as distinct from the individual interest. Departure from the agreed conditions by individual employers, whether public authorities or private concerns, will inevitably constitute a grave danger to the stability of the system of collective bargaining, and may well lead to competitive bargaining, and this to general but unjustifiable increases in wages and salaries and to serious inflation. The value of the system of collective bargaining and the justification for its maintenance at the present time rest upon the assumption that the terms of collective agreements will be observed loyally by all employers and workers, and the Government cannot stress too highly the importance which they attach to this principle.<br/>
In present conditions, and until more goods and services are available for the home market, there is no justification for any general increase of individual money incomes. Such an increase will merely raise costs of production, without making more goods available, and so can only have an inflationary effect. Unless accompanied by a substantial increase in production, it would drive up prices and charges, adversely affect pensioners, children and other recipients of social services benefits, increase the money cost of our exports and so reduce their saleability, and by black market pressure make it almost impossible to operate the controls necessary in view of the continuing scarcity of supplies and man-power.<br/>
It does not follow that it would be right to stabilise all incomes as they stand today. There may well be cases in which increases in wages or salaries would be justified from a national point of view, for example where it is essential in the national interest to man up a particular undermanned industry and it is clear that only an increase in wages will attract the necessary labour. It does, however, follow that each claim for an increase in wages or salaries must

be considered on its national merits and not on the basis of maintaining a former relativity between different occupations and industries.<br/>
It will be observed from these principles that there is no justification at the present time for any rise in incomes from profits, rent, or other like sources and that rises in wages or salaries should only be asked for and agreed upon in the exceptional cases mentioned above. On the other hand, if at some future time there should be a marked rise in the cost of living the level of those personal incomes which as a result became inadequate would need reconsideration.<br/>
In order to avoid the undesirable necessity for any interference with the existing methods of free negotiation and contract the Government must press upon all those engaged in negotiations or decisions which might result in an increase in wages or other personal incomes to keep these principles firmly before them, and not to depart from them. The Government will themselves observe these principles in any negotiations in which they are directly concerned.<br/>
In these circumstances the Government have decided and wish it to be clearly understood that, if, notwithstanding these considerations, remuneration is increased in any class of employment, whether an private industry or under a public authority, there can be no presumption, whatever may have been the practice in the past, that the resulting costs will be taken into account in settling controlled prices, charges or margins or other financial matters requiring Government action. Each case will have to be considered on its merits in relation to the principles enunciated above.<br/>
To sum up, if general increases in profits, salaries or wages take place without more goods being made available, no one can obtain any real benefit except the black market operator; the rest of the community has to endure the dislocation and hardship which inevitably accompanies inflation. The alternatives now before us are therefore either a general agreement by the people to act together upon sound and public spirited lines or a serious and prolonged set-back in our economic reconstruction accompanied by a persistent low standard of living.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman's statement has covered a very wide field. May I ask if the statement implies any new departure in Government policy? In other words, is any action contemplated in relation to the statement, or is it just a formal restatement of previous Ministerial announcements?</p>

<p>There is a very clear indication in the penultimate paragraph in regard to the question of increases being put on wages, salaries and costs. The Government are not prepared to say that they are all going to be met straightaway from Government sources.

<p>The object of the Amendment is to ensure that there shall be a body to consider the interests, tastes and wishes of Scotland in relation to the film industry of that country. With all the seriousness at my command, I tell the Committee that Scottish opinion and the Scottish film industry are deeply disturbed about this matter, and although, naturally, the community is more important than the industry, in this case both are at one. In view of our experience, I am convinced that unless we have an independent body of men and women fully qualified, not only in regard to the film industry but in regard to culture, taste and education from the Scottish point of view, we shall never get a satisfactory solution of the film problem.<br/>
I feel so sincerely about this matter that I say the Bill cannot work at all in Scot-

land unless we have a body of this kind, whatever it is called, properly to represent the tastes, wishes and interests of Scotland. I need not remind the Committee how we have suffered from what are called Scots films. I warn hon. Members that there is another terrible one, called "The Swordsman," coming from Hollywood, and dealing with the Highlands of Scotland. It will put into the shade anything that has gone before. The hero is called Larry. I understand that hitherto he has taken no part in Scottish life and affairs in the film industry and has been concerned more with thuggery and the wild West, which happy things he is now going to bring into the peaceful atmosphere of Scotland. That is indicative of the dangers that exist unless films are properly examined before they are put out to the public. I do not want to use the word "censored" because that is a horrible word.<br/>
Oversight by an English committee or council is not satisfactory. I say that in no disparaging way. That committee should not be the arbiter of what Scotland shall or shall not take. Unless we have an independent body, such as I am proposing, to decide what is to be the quota for Scotland, and of what it shall consist, it will be an English body which will decide what the Scottish film industry has to take. The appeal will be only to that English committee. It is not a sufficient answer to say that there may be a good Scotsman on the committee who will see that everything is all right. The weight of opinion would be English, according to the English outlook and English taste, high and excellent as those are. They might not be, and they frequently are not, suitable to Scottish taste. It would be unjust that a film man in Scotland should have to take the risk of being run in, as we might call it, before the President of the Board of Trade by the English Council, who have decided what he should and should not take, simply because he could not sell his quota to the people of Scotland. There is a great chance of serious injustice to the Scottish film industry in this part of the Bill. It is very important that that should be avoided and that Scottish taste, opinions and culture should be properly safeguarded by a separate body of the kind I have described.</p>

<p>I feel hesitant about supporting the Amendment


and I think there are other hon. Members who will agree with me in my hesitation. My hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Perth (Colonel Gomme-Duncan) has put very admirably the Scottish patriotic point of view, but the difficulties in the way of adopting his proposal are enormous. I did not have an opportunity of seeing the Amendment before, owing to my slackness this morning. I would like to give my views upon it, as they occur to me now.<br/>
The first point is that films are not produced to appeal to particular audiences in a particular part of the country, small or big. They are produced to appeal to a large audience. A film might be produced here which is suitable for Scotland but not suitable elsewhere, and <i>vice versa.</i> The second point is that if a committee is to be set up for Scotland, it is only fair that there should be similar committees for Wales and Northern Ireland. As one who is proud to have the blood of Northern Ireland bubbling in his veins, I say that Northern Ireland has as much claim to be consulted, if her people do not like the English taste, as have the people of Scotland. I should have thought that English taste through the ages had been fairly good.<br/>
Furthermore, would my hon. and gallant Friend apply his rather peculiar argument in other directions? Is Scotland to have performances only of plays or films produced in Scotland, which the somewhat anomalous body which he proposes has said are suitable for Scotland? I admit that pictures are produced in studios showing everybody in Scotland wearing a kilt, whereas everybody knows that the kilt only appeals nowadays to a few extreme patriots, and to the type of Scotsmen whom I might call the Mac-Smiths who desire to be more Scottish than the Scots. I have no doubt that they would be regarded in some parts of the world as representative of Scotland.<br/>
In a more serious vein, I appeal to the Committee to remember that it is very important that British films should have a universal appeal. There would be no objection to some form of advisory committee. I gathered from the speech of my hon. and gallant Friend&#x2014;I was somewhat concerned at some portions of it&#x2014;that he thought the proposed committee should have a power of censorship. I may be quite wrong.</p>

<p>That is a rather more involved way of saying that the Council should decide what films should be shown, which in another way is censorship. I do not think it is desirable that in a matter of this kind this nascent industry, which is making great efforts towards ensuring a universal appeal, should be called upon to adopt this slightly parochial position. The Government cannot possibly agree to this Amendment, unless they set up a similar council for Wales and Northern Ireland. I suggest, however, that they should give an assurance that Scottish interests will be represented on the Films Council.</p>

<p>I would ask my noble Friend whether I come under the heading of a patriot or a "MacSmith," because I wear a kilt?

<p>I would not like to answer the personal point which my hon. and gallant Friend has put to me, except to say that I am sure he is a patriot, and that I was not referring to him when I talked of "MacSmiths." I, too, have Scottish blood in my veins. As to my hon. and gallant Friend's second point, I happen to be sympathetic to the views he holds, in common with other Members representing Scottish constituencies, about a greater amount of devolution to Scotland. That, however, is a bigger question which I cannot discuss now, as I am sure, Sir Robert, that you would Rule me out of Order.</p>

<p>I could not agree more with the noble Lord the Member for Horsham (Earl Winterton) when he expressed his admiration for the enormous developments and improvements in British films during the last decade. What the British film industry has accomplished during that period is little short of a miracle of organising and productive genius. I agree with the hon. and gallant Member for Perth (Colonel Gomme-Duncan) that there have been,


and may still be, some very deplorable Scottish films&#x2014;and I make no reference at all to one which I had some part in producing&#x2014;but I think he will agree that this growing British industry has produced some excellent Scottish films. I am thinking of "The Silver Darlings," and "I Know Where I'm Going." They show that even the British film industry, which is much too centralised in the South of England, can, nevertheless, on occasions, do justice to Scotland's story and scenery.<br/>
The noble Lord rather missed the point, however, if he will forgive me for putting it that way, because this is not a question of Scottish patriotism or Scottish national feeling that we are being ousted by England in any way. I ask the noble Lord to think of the position of the small independent exhibitior in one of the wards of a large city like Glasgow. The managing director owns only one cinema; he is hemmed around not solely with great circuits, but all circuits, big and little, and he has to find his quota of British films under this Bill. If he fails, he has to go before the Cinematograph Films Council and offer such explanation as he can. The Council, if they find that he has been wanting in judgment, may inflict upon him very heavy penalties. It would be beyond a United Kingdom Council to consider that case properly on its merits.</p>

<p>I will come to that in a moment. Whether or not Members representing Northern Ireland or Wales have taken sufficient interest in the Bill to put down Amendments, or whether they think that the right course for Northern Ireland and Wales is now being adopted in the Bill, should not deter Scottish Members from doing what they think is right in the interests of Scotland. We must reiterate, until at last even the House of Commons begins to believe it thoroughly, that Scotland is a nation, not a parish, not a region, not a section of Great Britain. It is a nation, with national rights and national traditions. When I rose last night, on a modest point of Order, to elicit some information from the Minister as to what

he might do about Scotland, I received no reply&#x2014;which not infrequently happens when a Member raises a question about Scotland. There were, in many quarters of the Committee, slightly derisive titters and laughter at a Scottish Member of Parliament having the temerity to raise a Scottish question on the Floor of the Committee. We do not want to be put into that position, because most of us are not ultra-nationalist in that way. All we want to ensure is that Scotland's case is considered on its merits.<br/>
I should be happy if the Minister would accept the suggestion put forward by the noble Lord, that there should be adequate representation of Scottish exhibitors' interests on the Cinematograph Films Council. That would go a long way to meet all the difficulties I have in mind, but at the same time I should not like the Minister to dismiss without thought, the idea that there might be some kind of entertainment organisation for Scotland, as well as additional representation. The need to increase the exhibitors' representation on the Council has been acknowledged, and part of that increase ought to be Scottish representation. The Minister should not dismiss lightly the idea that there is a case, and that there should be some kind of Scottish body acting under its own authority.</p>

<p>I listened with great attention to what my noble Friend the Member for Horsham (Earl Winterton) said a few minutes ago, but I was not entirely convinced. I feel that there is a case for a separate committee or council to look after Scotland. This is a matter which has caused a good deal of concern among exhibitors in Scotland, and on which hon. Members representing Scottish constituencies have received a number of communications. The exhibitors feel, and, I think, with good reason, that a United Kingdom Films Council will inevitably be composed of a majority of people living south of the Border, who cannot, in the nature of things, be fully conversant with Scottish tastes and opinion. As I do not go to the cinema a great deal, I cannot speak from much personal experience; but I am advised that relatively few British films enjoy a good run in Scotland. The reason advanced is that, however good they may be&#x2014;and some are excellent&#x2014;they have an English


background, accent, and acting which does not appeal to a large section of the Scottish people. It may be our fault, but, nevertheless, that is the fact.</p>

<p>No, a Scottish background. I feel it would be helpful to the President of the Board of Trade and to the film industry if they had a body which spoke authoritatively for Scottish opinion in this matter. There should not be any objection to this course, because it has been customary when dealing with legislation of different kinds to provide separate boards or councils for Scotland, for example, the Scottish Milk Marketing Board, the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board and numerous advisory committees. There is, therefore, no departure from precedent in having a Cinematograph Films Council for Scotland, and as was signified last night, since it is the intention of the President of the Board of Trade to look at this whole Clause again with regard to representation, I hope he will take this matter of a Scottish Council into close consideration, and will decide that it is desirable to have a separate council or committee for Scotland.</p>

<p>I rise to support the proposal that there should be a separate Films Council for Scotland because throughout the Second Reading Debate and also throughout the Committee stage, the necessity for this has repeatedly been shown. As has been said already by my hon. Friend the Member for Ruthergl<ob/>n (Mr. McAllister) and others, there is the point of view of exhibitors. The small independent exhibitor, in any case, fears his position under this Bill, because of the fact that the Bill dispenses with the renters' quota. In the case of Scotland, he fears it even more, because the Films Council, which will advise as to the fixing of the quota and will also advise as to whether there are good reasons why an exhibitor cannot meet his quota will in the main be an English Board.<br/>
During the Second Reading Debate on the Bill, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade said he would be pleased to consider the appointment of a Scottish representative on that Council.

One representative out of a membership of 19 is quite inadequate, and is really an insult to Scotland. We want a council of our own. The fears of the exhibitors are intensified by virtue of the fact that, as an hon. Member said yesterday in the Debate, as a result of this Bill the Films Council will be given teeth. That being so, an even greater necessity for more adequate safeguards for the Scottish exhibitors arises.<br/>
There is a second reason, which was raised during the Second Reading Debate by the hon. and gallant Member for Perth (Colonel Gomme-Duncan), and that is the question whether all British films are necessarily suitable for Scottish audiences. We cannot see that position being safeguarded except by the setting up of a Scottish Films Council. There is a third aspect of this question&#x2014;that we shall be able we hope in the course of time to build up our own film industry. I notice that in the Schedule dealing with the functions of the Films Council&#x2014;if I might refer to those functions because they are relevant to what I am saying&#x2014;the first is
<q>to keep under review the progress of the cinematograph film industry in Great Britain, with particular reference to the development of that branch of the said industry which is engaged in the making of films, and to report thereon to the Board of Trade at such times as the Council thinks fit.</q>
One cannot expect to get much consideration for Scotland in this respect from a British Films Council on which there will be one Scottish representative out of a membership of 19. Therefore, from that point of view we need a Scottish Films Council.<br/>
4.45 p.m.<br/>
During the Debate on the Second Reading the Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade said this&#x2014;and I think it is rather significant:
<q>The matter of Scottish taste may be left to the film producers who will no doubt have an eye on the Scottish market, though what its value is compared with the English market I do not know."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 21st January, 1948; Vol. 446, c. 334.]</q>
It is quite obvious that the film producer who is producing films will have his eye mainly on the 40 million people of England and not on the 3 or 4 million people in Scotland. Scotland has no more desire to be Anglicised than it has to be Americanised. For those reasons I would plead with my right hon. Friend the President


of the Board of Trade seriously to consider the proposal to set up a Scottish Films Council. So far as I have been able to find out there has been no argument against this proposal. In other aspects of our economic and social life we have separate committees for Scotland because of what are admitted to be different conditions, a different culture, a different outlook and, as my hon. Friend the Member for West Fife (Mr. Gallacher) said yesterday, a different sense of humour. Because of that I trust that when my right hon. Friend is considering this matter he will find it possible to set up a separate council for Scotland.</p>

<p>It is easy to overdo this business of patriotism which I always try to avoid. The noble Lord the Member for Horsham (Earl Winterton) missed the point in this case, when he ascribed all this to Scottish nationalist feeling which, in fact, is simply nonsense. This Amendment is based on the fears of the past. Those whose livelihood depends on the showing of films in Scotland know&#x2014;it is not a question of opinion but one of fact&#x2014;that certain British films are flops in Scotland. They may be successful in England and other parts of the world, but they are not in Scotland. Scotland has a culture of its own. Again that is a fact and not a question of opinion.<br/>
I cannot see how anyone can argue that any other committee or council other than a Scottish one is fit to decide what films out of those available at any time should be shown by Scottish exhibitors to earn their livelihood and also to Scottish people to enjoy themselves. The noble Lord the Member for Horsham said that British films were intended to have a universal appeal. Of course, they are so intended, but it does not work out that way. If a British film has not a universal appeal it would be very much better in the interests of the public if that fact were accepted by the Government&#x2014;</p>

<p>The noble Lord is not quite correct, and I am sure he would not want to do me an injustice. It is a fact that British films have made a greater overall appeal in foreign countries than they have ever made before and that is what I meant when I referred to a universal appeal. That does not mean that they should not appeal to the people

of Scotland any more than they appeal to people in other parts of the world.</p>

<p>I follow the noble Lord, and I am obliged to him, but I still think it is not fair, and it will not get one anywhere to assume that this universal appeal of British films will necessarily include Scotland.

<p>I feel that our Scottish friends will not get the recognition through this Amendment which they expect. First, they are suggesting that there shall be established what might be called a sub-committee of the Films Council on which they will have exclusive representation. This Committee will presumably have to report to the major body, which is itself an advisory committee to the Board of Trade. Let us analyse what they wish the Committee to do. The Amendment says that it is
<q>&#x2014;to be called the Cinematograph Films Advisory Committee (Scotland), to which all matters affecting films to be shown in Scotland shall stand referred.</q></p>

<p>All matters affecting films in Britain are not referred to the major body. That is not its job. We are not establishing a great censorship, but a Council which is to advise the Government how best we can guarantee that British films which we believe are worthy of a showing on our screens have opportunities of getting there.<br/>
It seems to me that our Scottish friends have misunderstood entirely the functions of the Films Council. It is not intended to do a task of that kind. If this were to be a precedent, then I should be very much against it so far as its application to England was concerned. We have quite sufficient censorship now, without adding


to it. If every film that is to be shown in Scotland is to be referred to a special Scottish film committee that committee will have its time occupied from morning to night every day of the year. It will have a very onerous task. Then, having seen all the films, how are they to prevent them from being shown in the cinemas of Scotland? They will have no power to do it. They will be able to make recommendations to the Films Council, but the Films Council itself cannot make proposals to the Board of Trade that certain films shall not be shown in England, let alone in Scotland.</p>

<p>I think some hon. Members have misunderstood the purpose of this Amendment. The Council does not analyse the nature of a film and whether the dialogue in the film is suitable for Scottish and other audiences or not.

I am sure that if the Amendment were accepted it would be entirely unworkable.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Greenwich (Mr. Reeves) who has taken exception to this Amendment has given rather a caricature, perhaps unintentionally, of our attitude as Scottish Memlast thing I would wish to do would be to turn this innocent Debate into anything like a Debate on Scottish nationalism in general. As my noble Friend the right hon. Member for Horsham (Earl Winter-ton) said, that would be quite out of Order at this stage. In the 17 years in which I have had the honour of being a Member of this House I have seen similar Amendments put down to many other Bills of major importance in order that Scottish interests should be more adequately safeguarded than would seem to be the case when the Bills came before the House. Never once, in my experience, were we successful in having any of those proposals incorporated in any Bills. That is why am not hopeful that the Parliamentary Secretary will be in a position to grant our modest request this afternoon.<br/>
I do stress&#x2014;and here I am perhaps in slight disagreement with my hon. Friends who represent Scottish constituencies&#x2014;that there are difficulties in the way, as my noble Friend the right hon. Member for Horsham has pointed out. I join with him in hoping that the Parliamentary Secretary will pay due heed to what has been said, and will do all in his power, as he has been pressed to do, to see that as full attention as possible is paid to the kind of films which are desirable from the point of view of their exhibition in Scotland. I did not know, until I heard my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for West Edinburgh (Lieut.-Commander Hutchison) that so many films had been shown with considerable success and a large public following south of the Border, which had not met with the same reception, or had not been patronised by the same large audiences when they were shown north of the Tweed. I did not know that and I am sorry to hear it, and it is an additional reason why the Parliamentary Secretary, if he is not disposed to accept this Amendment <i>in toto,</i> should pay due respect to what my noble Friend has urged.<br/>
After my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for West Edinburgh had made that observation I asked him if he could tell me of any particular films which had not met with approval n Scotland, judged by the audiences they have had. He assured me that "Henry V" was one. I am a lover of Shakespeare, and I had no idea there were so Many of my fellow countrymen and women who did not enjoy to the full the works of that eminent dramatist, even when they were shown on the films. But there it is; there are these difficulties. You, Sir Robert, as a Scotsman, will be the first to appreciate what we feel about this matter.<br/>
Although I have partly supported what my noble Friend has said, I should be glad if the Parliamentary Secretary could see his way to incorporate the Amendment in the Bill. There are, however, reasons in the way which I fully appreciate. I hope he will pay due heed to the points which have been made, and appreciate the fact that many audiences in Scotland do not always appreciate films which are shown successfully in London and South Britain, and that he will do his best to do something in the future to see that these audiences are catered for in a better way than they have been catered for in the past.</p>

<p>I will deal with that point as we go along. When I am able to reassure the hon. and gallant Gentleman and the other Scottish representatives who have spoken, it may be that they will reconsider the question of pressing this Amendment. With regard to the suggestion that the British films are no less foreign than the films of other countries to the people of Scotland, the information at our disposal suggests that that is not the case. The time occupied on Scottish screens by British films varies very minutely from the time occupied on English screens by British films. It may be said that that is because there is no alternative, but nothing has been said which will make it possible for Scottish exhibition time to be taken up by Scottish films. Recently there was an attempt to set up a film production unit in Scotland, and it will be within the knowledge of hon. Members that it had a rather unfortunate ending.<br/>
I agree that there is something to be said for the Scottish exhibitor in regard to the question of the quota defaulter, particularly the type of Scottish film

exhibitor referred to by one hon. Member. Such an exhibitor may be in a very strong competitive situation. He may be an independent producer, surrounded by large circuits. It may be felt by Scottish people to be unfair to a Scottish exhibitor if he has to make his explanation to a British Film Council which is exclusively English, or dominated by an English element. It is not true, as was suggested by the hon. and gallant Member for West Edinburgh (Lieut.-Commander Hutchison), that the exhibitor can have penalties imposed on him by the Films Council.</p>

<p>I am afraid I have the wrong Member. I am now informed it was the hon. Member for North Edinburgh (Mr. Willis). The Films Council cannot impose any penalties upon the quota defaulter. The Council can hear his case and make recommendations to the Board of Trade. The Board of Trade itself cannot impose any penalties. The exhibitor must be proceeded against in the court and, in the case of a Scottish exhibitor, the case must be heard in a Scottish court. I feel sure that will be regarded as a certain safeguard by the representatives of Scottish constituencies.<br/>
I agree with the right hon. Member for Horsham (Earl Winterton) that the implied suggestion that the purpose of the Scottish Council should be to have some sort of supervision over the type of films to be shown in Scottish cinemas, is an extremely dangerous one. I would never assent for one moment to a Government sponsored body concerning itself in the picking and choosing of films, or books, or any other expression of opinion or culture. I think that is extremely dangerous, and I am glad that some hon. Members who have spoken dissociated themselves from that point of view.</p>

<p>My right hon. Friend said last night that he would consider the


whole Clause, and would put down a composite Amendment. I should like to go further, and say that we will consider especially the position of Scotland in relation to the Films Council. I shall indicate to the Committee some of the things which might be reconsidered. The Committee should understand that I am not now proposing that these things should be done. I am merely suggesting the kind of things which might be considered as a subject of a composite Amendment. For example, we might put in the Bill that one of the exhibitors' representatives must be a Scottish representative. It would not be the case, as has been suggested, that Scotland will get one representative out of 19 on the Council. It would certainly be one representative as against 19 <i>in toto,</i> but actually it would he one exhibitor representative out of five exhibitor representatives. There are representatives of producers on the Council, and there is no producer in Scotland. Therefore, if there is one Scottish exhibitor represented Scotland is getting representation of one in five. The Board of Trade might undertake, also, that one of the seven independent members must be a Scottish representative.<br/>
We might go further in these considerations. One of the most important duties of the Films Council is that of reviEwing quota defaults. It may be considered worth while, from the Scottish point of view, to ask the new Films Council to arrange that any Scottish default should be reviewed by a sub-committee of the Council before the full Council reviewed it, and reported to the Board of Trade. The composition of this committee could include the Scottish exhibitor, and provision could be made for the addition of another Scottish exhibitor by giving the Council general power to co-opt additional members to serve on any Council committee. I do not think that the full Council ought to be deprived of its final jurisdiction. I do not suggest that the sub-committee should report direct to the Board of Trade. I think its report should go to the parent body.<br/>
That is the kind of thing which may be considered to be the subject of a composite Amendment. I assure hon. Members who represent Scottish constituencies, that both the President of the Board of Trade and I are anxious to do all we can to enable Scottish people to express themselves, and to enjoy to the utmost extent

that type of cultural entertainment&#x2014;if I may use that term&#x2014;which they really want. I recognise, of course, that there is a difference in taste. There is bound to be a difference of taste between members of different nations, and I quite understand the desire of the Scottish people to have that amount of say in their own affairs, and that they should have the opportunity of enjoying the things to which they respond, as nationals of Scotland. Having given that assurance, I hope that hon. Members will not press this Amendment because, I think that, in doing so, they would make it rather more than less difficult for us to come to some accommodation on the specific subject of the Bill.</p>

<p>In view of the rather general line the Parliamentary Secretary has taken I hope, Sir Robert, you will allow me to go beyond the rigid terms of the Amendment. I think that would be following the lines adopted by the Parliamentary Secretary. When moving this Amendment my hon. and gallant Friend referred chiefly to the actual control, or "vetting," of the type of film that was shown. That touches only one side of the matter. As the Parliamentary Secretary has rightly said, an exhibitor may find himself in an impossible position if he has to show something which is unpalatable. We are concerned&#x2014;and I speak as a full-blooded Scot&#x2014;with the question of the representation of the form of life of the Scottish people. One reason why certain English films are unpalatable in Scotland is because, in them, Scotsmen are represented as living in a way completely impossible for any good Scot. That is the sort of thing we wish to stop.</p>

<p>This question of misrepresentation of the way in which people

<p>I will keep my remarks strictly within the rules in this matter. May it not be possible to give power, such as is suggested by my hon. and gallant Friend, to some officially recognised body which could apply its stamp of approval to any film representing Scottish life, so that it could be stated that that film had been passed by a Scottish council? It may or may not be the same body as that suggested by my hon. and gallant Friend&#x2014;</p>

<p>We might find all sorts of divisions, but in Scotland we are an extraordinarily commonsense type of people. For a long time there has been growing, hour by hour, day by day, an urge for better Scottish representation in all Parliamentary procedure. Scotland is unanimous on that issue. Surely, therefore, one can find some sort of representative body of four, five or six people who could agree whether or not a film repre-

sented life in Scotland today. Will the Parliamentary Secretary give some sort of undertaking that something of this nature will be considered when the whole of the Clause is being reconsidered by the President? A great deal of damage has already been done to Scotland. It is all very well to say that a great deal of tartan has been sold in the States, but does the tartan that has been sold mean anything? My hon. and gallant Friend talked about tartan that has been sold to be made up into skirts. But let us attach some name to that tartan. Let it be sold by all means, but let the people who buy it take an interest in the tartan and what it means in Scotland. Let us get the thing across. Do not let us see a film of some Highland clan clad in entirely the wrong clothes, in the wrong way, and doing the wrong things. Will the Parliamentary Secretary give some undertaking that his right hon. Friend will consider a body such as I have suggested?</p>

<p>I want to avoid the misunderstanding under which the hon. and gallant Member for Perth (Colonel Gomme-Duncan) seemed to labour. There are two points which I wish to make. It would he a mistake to think that Scottish cinema exhibitors as such, or as represented on the Films Council, have not an opportunity of expressing their Scottish point of view. There are between 350 and 400 cinemas in Scotland, and the exhibitors are all members of a national organisation&#x2014;the Cinematograph Exhibitors Association of Great Britain. That association is responsible for maintaining its representatives on the Films Council. If there are not a sufficient number of nominees representing Scotland, or if the nominees proposed happen not to be Scotsmen, it is proper and sound that the Scottish exhibitors should make their presence felt within their own organisation. They should ensure that their divisional interests, whether economic, social or national, are adequately and sufficiently reflected in their own organisation. If they do not, there will be complications. There is no direct reference in the Amendment to the representation on this Council of workers in the entertainment industry in Scotland. If there are to be representatives of the employers in Scotland, we shall require representation for the workers in the same way.</p>

<p>I do not think that we ought to set too much store upon the actual figures mentioned in the Amendment. There are three things. There is the Council which would be in the same proportion as the one proposed for Great Britain and would include workers' representatives. Then there is the Committee of the Council which is the next best thing we can hope for; and finally there are the two or three extra members suggested by the hon. Member for West Fife (Mr. Gallacher). There is certainly no question of leaving out workers' representatives.</p>

<p>Thank you. There are adequate channels through which the Scottish exhibitors can work in order to put the point of view expressed by many hon. Members. However, there are practical difficulties in this matter. I am a lover of Scotland and the Scottish people. No one would be more pleased than I, if we could have the correct type of film depicting Scottish life in its fullness, its gracefulness and its ancient traditions. We shall "come a cropper," to use a colloquialism, if we think that this Bill will encourage Scottish film production as such in the way which some hon. Members want. There is nothing to prevent Scottish industrialists or financiers, even in these days of austerity, from reflecting in their more practical ways the views that have been expressed in this Debate. Why has not any Scottish financier or industrialist hacked the production of Scottish pictures? Why have they not got together the best script writers, advisers on Scottish history, art directors and so on, to prepare a film which will meet the severest criticism of the people of Scotland? I do not know of one such case. On the contrary, the one picture which I am told will meet with 100 per cent. satisfaction&#x2014;</p>

<p>I have read the Amendment with considerable care and I have listened to almost every word of this discussion. I ask the hon. Member for West Nottingham (M<ob/>. O'Brien) to excuse me if I do not follow him in his argument. I come back to what was said by the noble Lord the Member for Horsham (Earl Winterton). I do not think that he was quite fair. Perhaps he did not mean to be unfair, but I do not think that he fully appreciated the speech of the hon. and gallant Member for Perth (Colonel Gomme-Duncan) who spoke so excellently on this Amendment. The noble Lord admitted that his blood was boiling. He admitted that he had Northern Irish and Scotti<ob/>h blood in him; but he did not say which part was boiling. He took the view that the intention behind this Amendment was to have some form of censorship. I do not think that censorship, or even selection, will result from this Amendment. It says:
<q>there shall be a Committee of the Council &#x2026; to which all matters affecting films to be shown in Scotland shall stand referred.</q>
That may be a purely Scottish term, but as I understand it, it does not say what will happen to Scottish matters when they have been referred to the committee. Probably the committee would be able to give advice, but there is nothing to say that they have any executive power. The idea that there should be a representative collection of Scots to put the Scottish


point of view is simple and sound. That seems to be the idea. There seems to be no suggestion of censorship or selection. I understand that it would be a purely advisory body. In the same way, we might have an advisory committee to represent any other section of the community.<br/>
We have heard a great deal about Scotland in the last hour. I am not sure whether what is wanted is not an advisory committee to put fully the position of England. It appears to me that England may not come off very well in this matter. Apparently, under paragraph (<i>a</i>) there are to be five individuals, under paragraph (<i>b</i>), there are to be four, and then under the proposed paragraph (<i>c</i>), the Scottish one, there are to be 14. If all the representatives were sitting together, it would mean that the English would be hopelessly swamped by the Scots. I rather suspect that that is the real intention. I have a very strong suspicion that the Scots would like to get an overwhelming majority; but that will not happen, because I do not think that the Amendment will be passed.<br/>
It is absolutely essential if we are to build up a prosperous film industry in this country that there should be a wide representation of interests in order to depict the real life of the people whether Scottish, Welsh or English.</p>

He said that he would consider the whole question of representation and put in a new Clause on Report stage. Various points of view have been expressed. Many hon.

<p>Thank you very much, Sir Robert, but I understand that there was a promise to look at the matter in a composite manner. We have now had a Debate which has emphasised very strongly the Scottish point of view, and I hope that, since the Scottish point of view has had, as it deserves, a very good run and has been put very fully&#x2014;and I do not think there has been any real argument against it&#x2014;the same fullness and fairness should be extended to other people who may have a case for consideration.</p>

<p>This matter is much more important than the Parliamentary Secretary and many other hon. Members who have spoken seem to imagine. The Parliamentary Secretary said that there was a small production unit in Scotland, and he added, "We know what had happened to it." The hon. Member for West Nottingham (Mr. O'Brien) also asked why some Scottish financier did not come forward. That was the trouble; they could not get finance. Well, why does not some Scottish financier come forward? Because they have their eyes on London and there is no indication anywhere of a Scottish film industry. Arthur J. did not put his money into a non-existent industry. There was an industry built up at the centre, and it went through certain stages of corruption and graft and was almost destroyed. Then Mr. Rank came in to rebuild it. There has never been any encouragement of any kind given to the development of this business in Scotland. The Films Council would not give us film production in Scotland, but it would be the beginning of the recognition of the fact that Scotland has a definite contribution to make to this industry, and if it did not bring in Scottish financiers, it might possibly bring in the Chancellor of the Exchequer. He has the power to direct finance.<br/>
This is very important, because when the Parliamentary Secretary says that they had a film production unit in Scot-


land and then asks what has happened to it, he might also say that we had a motor car industry there, and ask what has happened to that. We had an aeroplane factory in Scotland, and what has happened to it? Now that we are discussing a Films Bill, surely this Committee will give it such a constitution that a Films Council will be able to spread the idea abroad that Scotland can make a great contribution to the development of this industry. I would say this&#x2014;and I commend it to the attention of Mr. Rank&#x2014;that if a film is understood and appreciated in Scotland, it will be understood and appreciated in every English-speaking country in the world. If a film is not understood and appreciated in Scotland, it will not be appreciated and understood in any English-speaking country in the world, including England.</p>

<p>It is not a great film, but it was produced in such a way that it would make an appeal to Scotland, and it has made an appeal to every country in the world. Take one of our foremost productions, from the point of view of scenic effects, technical perfection and an admirable cast&#x2014;"Henry V." It made no appeal in Scotland, in general, although in some parts it got through, and the same thing applies in England and America. Yet it was one of the greatest films produced in this country. So I say to the Minister and to the film industry that it is of the very greatest importance that Scotland should be brought into this film business and into the whole field of the film industry in a big way.<br/>
Mention has been made of the opportunities that there are in Scotland. Consider its traditions. There are no traditions anywhere like the Scottish traditions, from the film production point of view, though I do not know what they are going to do with Bonnie Prince Charlie. They certainly will not tell the truth about

him or his forbears; they will avoid that. In Scotland, there is a tremendous tradition. Look at the great area of the Clyde and what could be done with it. There is nowhere where we can get such fine traditions, and such grand humour. I was asked last night by one of the Press men what I meant when I said that in Scotland we could not appreciate some of the English humour, and I said that Scotland likes humour that is humorous, clean, healthy and charming. Take the case of a Scotsman who is known the world over&#x2014;</p>

<p>An hon. Member on this side&#x2014;he was a Sassenach, but I do not remember his constituency&#x2014;said that the Amendment provided that all matters should be referred to a Scottish Films Council, but he suggested that that meant the Council would deal with matters which it would be impossible for it to handle. When we talk about all matters being referred to a Films Council, it is all matters dealt with in this Bill, and not matters outside the Bill. One of the matters dealt with in this Bill is that a Films Council shall interest itself in film production. We want a Scottish Films Council and, if we get it, I hope it will take into account the splendid traditions of West Fife as well as those of the Clyde, and that they will concern themselves with opportunities for developing the film industry. I want to


impress upon the Minister the necessity of doing something like this at the present time. With a Films Council having only two representatives from Scotland, Sir Alexander King and Willie Quinn, there is very little that we can do, because, as the hon. Member for West Nottingham (Mr. O'Brien) knows, when Sir Alexander King speaks, the other members, badly educated, gaze at one another in amazement&#x2014;they do not know what he is saying.</p>

<p>The fact remains that these two representatives from Scotland can play very little part in the Films Council, because the business is in the hands of people who represent big film interests down here in London. I appeal to the Minister to recognise that Scotland, with its fine traditions and fine culture, can make an extraordinarily big contribution to the development of the film industry, which is what this Bill is intended for; and so I ask him to give us a Films Council for Scotland, which will be the beginning of the attraction of all kinds of support for the development of this industry in Scotland.</p>

<p>As I understand this discussion, there is a request made to this Committee for the appointment of a committee of the Cinematograph Films Advisory Council to deal with all matters affecting Scotland. The first Amendment deals with the constitution, and the other two add particular items to the proposition set out in the first. I suggest to the Minister that with the representation which at present exists upon the Films Council, Scotland does not get, and cannot get, its proper representation from the point of view of the films that ought to be shown in Scotland. There are certain things that happened in Scotland of which the Minister ought to be aware.<br/>
We have the big circuits, with headquarters in London, owning cinemas in Scotland, and consequently what is done in England, as in Wales, is done in their cinemas in Scotland. We have also to bear in mind that there is a very large number of small independent exhibitors, not merely in Scotland, but also in England and Wales, but they are not attended to in the manner in which the large

circuits are being attended to, through this advice of the Films Council. Only the other week, I was shown by the manager of an independent cinema in a working-class area in Glasgow, how this question of British films works out. This cinema runs a double programme, with one feature film for the first three days of the week and another for the rest of the week. On the Monday night the drawings were up to the average, but on the second and third nights they fell by 50 per cent., and the reason was given to me by the manager, who said that he had had to show a British picture in order to make up his quota. If that is going to happen to a number of small independent exhibitors up and down the country&#x2014;I am not actually referring to Scotland at the moment&#x2014;then it is no wonder that there is some antagonism to the exhibition of quota pictures. The remaining three nights in the week were up to the average standard, because a good picture&#x2014;not a quota picture&#x2014;had been shown on those nights</p>

<p>I hope my hon. Friend is not suggesting that at the present time British quota pictures are, of necessity, bad pictures, because that is far from being the truth. The whole object of the Bill is to improve still further the position of British quota pictures, and, incidentally, it is designed to assist precisely those people about whom my hon. Friend is talking&#x2014;the small independent exhibitors. In fact, it places a greater obligation on the large circuits than on the small independent exhibitors.</p>

<p>It is no use the Minister shaking his head. A lot of people shake their heads when they see some of the British films exhibited to make up the quota. It is surely necessary that some of the independent exhibitors should be represented on the Films Council in order to see that, when a quota is established, the films come up to a certain<ob/> standard. I am not objecting to the quota, and neither did the manager of this cinema. He only insisted on having films shown


in his cinema which would attract the Scottish people; he objected to films being forced on him. That is the point one has to bear in mind, and it is there, I contend, that the Films Council has failed. Consequently, I hope that when the Minister is considering this matter he will also consider Scotland's interest in films and its desire to have good films. If he does so, he will bring on to the Films Council some at least of the representation suggested in the three Amendments we are now discussing.</p>

<p>I wish to stress, as has been done in all parts of the Committee, the importance of Scotland having adequate representation on the Films Council. I propose to speak from the educational point of view, because, in the Amendment, it will be seen that it is specifically stated that certain powers should be given to the Secretary of State for Scotland&#x2014;who, I am glad to say, has just arrived&#x2014;to appoint five members representing Scottish culture and Scottish education. I am quite sure that the right hon. Gentleman would be able to nominate five members to this Council who would perform a very useful function in improving the cinema industry in Scotland.<br/>
A good deal of interest has been displayed by Scottish Members in this Amendment. One of the reasons is that the people in Scotland go to the cinema a good deal because they get shelter there. Housing conditions in Scotland are very bad, and people in the mining villages and towns go to the cinema simply because many of them have no opportunity of going anywhere else. It is either the pub or the cinema. I would prefer to see them going to the cinema than to the pub, and I would like to see this habit, which has been acquired in this way, being made use of for educational purposes.<br/>
I represent a constituency which has suffered a good deal from the film industry. My immortal constituent, Robert Burns, has been portrayed in a film which was produced by an hon. Member of this House, who is present at the moment. There is a danger from Scottish amateur producers in the film industry. I believe, for example, that if this film about Robert Burns had been submitted for advice to a council composed of Scots who really understood Burns, it would have been

a better p<ob/>oduction. But we are tired of too much Burns on the films in Scotland, and I want to make an appeal for educational films.</p>

<p>I should not have thought it was quite proper for an hon. Member to raise in this Committee the question of a film with which I was associated, but of which I was certainly not the producer, without giving me some notice that he intended to do so. May I say for the benefit of the hon. Gentleman, who, I know, tries hard, although he was not born in Scotland, to represent his immortal constituent, that the film was submitted to the President of the Burns Federation, and to a very distinguished former President, who was also at one time a Member of this House, Mr. John S. Clark, than whom there is no greater authority on Burns, and the script and outline of the production met with their entire approval.</p>

<p>I am sorry if I have done the hon. Gentleman an injustice. All I will say is that if there had been a Gallup poll of Scottish Members in this House, I think they would have endorsed my opinion.<br/>
To return to the Films Council, I think it will encourage the showing of educational films in Scottish cinemas. I saw another film produced by Scotsmen after the one about Burns, to which I have just referred, which was in marked contrast to it. It was a film produced under the auspices of Sir John Boyd-Orr. He appeared in that film, which was called "The World is Rich." I believe that if this Council were set up, we should get more educational films of this nature. It would mean that we should get films showing the real life of Scotland, and not the superficial romanticism which so often passes in its place.<br/>
The hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Orr-Ewing) complained that the world was not being shown on the films the real life of Scotland. I should like the Films Council to go into the mining villages, and to portray the life of a mining community&#x2014;to go into the rotten old mining streets where 12 and 13 people are living in one room. If they did that, it would so educate hon. Members opposite that they would be prepared to cross over to this side.</p>

<p>There were no visible signs of that in the legislation they produced. If I were put on to the Films Council, I could make certain suggestions which would result in a very realistic film of life in Scotland, which would act, in an educational way, in getting the social conditions altered and ameliorated. If we could get this Films Council going, it would be able to produce films which could be shown abroad, and would result in the improvement in the economic situation of this country. I believe it would help the President of the Board of Trade&#x2014;who I see is now present&#x2014;in his export drive. I believe that we are all&#x2014;Welsh, English and Scottish Members&#x2014;united, irrespective of class, party, or creed, in urging upon the Government to modify this Bill accordingly.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That the Clause be now read a Second time."<br/>
Part V of the Act of 1938 deals with the conditions of workers in the making of films. I seek to have this Clause added for reasons which I will try to explain very briefly. In yesterday's discussion on this Bill, a great deal was said about the need for improving, strengthening and encouraging facilities for producers of specialised films. I have put down this new Clause in the interest of a very special kind of specialised film&#x2014;the making of films particularly suitable for showing to children and child audiences.<br/>
6.0 p.m.<br/>
About 12 months ago, I ventured to raise a discussion on the Adjournment about children's cinema clubs. We had a very interesting Debate, and a great deal of interest has been shown in the country in the experiment of running children's cinema clubs. There is a great deal of criticism of these clubs with which I do not agree. I believe they are potentially very valuable. But those who are interested in them, and particularly those


who are organising and sponsoring them, are constantly faced with the difficulty that there is a great lack of suitable films for showing to child audiences. That fact is acknowledged, and efforts are being made to produce films suitable for that purpose. One of the great difficulties which arise for those who are seeking to make suitable films for children, is that it is almost impossible, under the present law, to employ children as child actors in the making of films in this country. Some of the more suitable and successful recent children's films that we have had have been made abroad for that reason. The film "Bush Christmas" was made in Australia and another was made in Canada. I think it is agreed on all sides of the Committee that these films have a very potent influence upon children; there are about half a million children attending these cinema clubs regularly every Saturday morning.<br/>
It is of the utmost importance to produce suitable films having the highest possible entertainment value for exhibition to these children, and if successful films are to be made for the entertainment of children, it is important that children, with whom the child audiences can identify themselves, should be the central characters of the story. It is essential that the films should be such that the children can comprehend what is taking place and, instead of just passively receiving what is presented before them, can actively participate in what is being done to them on the screen. Therefore, it is important that children's films should be available in which children themselves are taking part.<br/>
As has been stated on several occasions in our Debates, this is a Bill to encourage the production of British films, and I submit that it is important that these films which are to be shown to children should present the British way of life. If we present family life, with children taking their place, it should be the British family way of life which is set before them. We should not necessarily be forced to have foreign films setting before our children a foreign way of life. Of course, I do not mean that films made in the Dominions, which do employ children, are necessarily bad, but I think

it is better that we should be able in our films to show the English&#x2014;and I might add in self-defence&#x2014;the Scottish and Welsh way of life to the children. British films that are made may go overseas and, again, they ought to be such as show something of British family life.<br/>
No one on this side of the Committee wants to go back on existing legislation and to make it easier to remove the control upon the employment of children, or to make easier their commercial exploitation. There is the Children and Young. Persons Act, 1933, and the Education Act, 1944&#x2014;</p>

<p>It is clear from what the hon. Member has said that this new Clause is outside the scope of the Bill.

<p>Further to that point of Order, Major Milner, may I submit, in regard to your Ruling, that this proposed new Clause is not in Order, that we have under consideration questions relating to the production of cinematograph films? One of the material matters in connection with the production of cinematograph films is whether there should be any change in the present law, which imposes very considerable restriction on the occasional employment of children in making cinematograph films. May I suggest that if it is desired, in the interests of the cinematograph industry, to make an amendment with regard to the present state of the law with reference to employing children from time to time in the production of British films, that comes within the scope of a Bill which is designed to lay down conditions.</p>

<p>As I have said, I have referred to the Cinematograph Films Act, 1938, and there is no mention there of the employment of child actors or similar matters.

<p>On a point of Order. I would point out that the words are "otherwise to amend." With the greatest respect and some diffidence, because it may look like a reflection on the Chair, if your Ruling, Major Milner, holds good, it would have held good with regard to many Amendments we have discussed, because a number of Amendments have not been concerned with matters dealt with in the original Bill. I draw this to your attention because it is an important point of procedure; is it the rule of the Chair that a new Clause which has the effect of amending the original Act, is not to constitute an Amendment unless there is reference to it in the original Act?</p>

<p>May I ask your guidance, Major Milner, on this aspect of the matter, for the benefit of the Committee? This proposed new Clause has been on the Order Paper for a considerable time and the hon. Member has made a substantial and very eloquent speech in support of it. I understood you to say that, having heard the speech, you do not think the new Clause is in order. I submit that the question whether or not the new Clause is in Order is a matter which cannot be affected by the arguments put forward.</p>

<p>The point is that it is within the power of the Chair to call upon any hon. Member to explain the provisions in his new Clause and thereupon to form a judgment upon it. I took the precaution of interviEwing the hon. Member and suggesting my doubts to him, and after hearing him, these doubts have crystallised my belief that the new Clause is out of Order.</p>

<p>This Amendment requires some explanation. The purpose of the first part of it is to bring the renting and exhibiting, in addition to the making, of films into the scope of Section 34 of the principal Act. The second part of the Amendment deals with the Fair Wages Resolution which was passed by this House on 14th October, 1946, and which requires the contractor to comply with the general conditions of the Resolution in respect of all persons employed by him in the way of the execution of the contract in every factory, workshop or place used by him in the execution of the contract. The Act of 1938 requires such compliance only in respect of such
<q>persons employed by him in connection with that business.</q>
The purpose of the Amendment is to bring the Section into line with more recent requirements of the House of Commons. The third part of the Amendment is required for another reason. Employers in the film industry are now largely organised, and this part of the Amendment provides for agreement not only between employers and workers' organisations, but also between employers' organisations and workers' organisations. The fourth part is simply for the purpose of bringing the former legislation into line with more recent legislation.</p>

<p>The purpose of my Amendment to the proposed Amendment is also to bring the Section into harmony with the Fair Wages Resolution. At present the phrase in the Subsection of the Section is:
<q>shall have regard to any determination that may be brought to its notice.</q>
In a recent arbitration case the arbitrator appointed by the Minister of Labour


ruled&#x2014;I think quite rightly&#x2014;that this phrase means exactly what it says, namely, that regard to this determination shall be had, and no more: in other words, that there is no obligation upon the arbitrator to see that the decisions taken in joint industrial councils or conciliation boards or other similar bodies are, in fact, furthered. I suggest that if this phrase "shall have regard to" is amended in the sense I propose the ambiguity will be removed.</p>

<p>It is entirely for the Chair to settle these things, and these are rather complicated matters, but I must claim my right to speak on the original Amendment. I want only an assurance from the Minister, which I am sure he will be ready to give, that this matter has been very carefully discussed with both sides of the industry.</p>

<p>I should be very glad to give the noble Lord the assurance. The facts are as he suggests. As to the Amendment to my proposed Amendment, what my hon. Friend the Member for Eton and Slough (Mr. Levy) is proposing is an Amendment to Section 34 (2) of the 1938 Act. It is that particular Subsection which, through a like Amendment on the Order Paper, I propose later to ask the Committee totally to repeal. Of course, if we were to secure that repeal, then my hon. Friend's Amendment to this Amendment would not be necessary or applicable. If the later Amendment is accepted, this Subsection will no longer be necessary because we feel&#x2014;I do, and my right hon. Friend the Minister of Labour whom I have consulted about this agrees&#x2014;that paragraph r (<i>a</i> and <i>b</i>) of the Fair Wages Resolution of 14th October, 1946, provides such guidance as might be required by any industrial court in settling disputes referred to it under the Act. I may say that the repeal which we are proposing in the later Amendment has been asked for by the Association of Cin&#x00E9; Technicians, who are affected by the case my hon. Friend has in mind; and they are completely in agreement that this is the best way of dealing with this matter&#x2014;that is, by the later Amendment we have on the Order Paper. I hope, therefore, that my hon. Friend will be prepared to withdraw his Amendment to my proposed Amendment. If that does not satisfy him, I should be ready to deploy

arguments against his own arguments, but I hope that he will consider our later Amendment adequate.</p>

<p>This does raise rather a problem, because we do not quite know whether the Subsection is to be repealed or not. There may be a substantial difference about that. There are certain misgivings&#x2014;I have certain misgivings, too&#x2014;about the wholesale repeal. I should like my misgivings to be allayed before I personally assent to the repeal. I wonder if I could get from my right hon. Friend a kind of conditional undertaking, that in the event of the repeal he anticipates not being made, he will be prepared to accept my Amendment?</p>

<p>I had not envisaged that possibility, I must say, and it is rather difficult to know what our line would be in those circumstances; but certainly, if the Committee do not agree to the total repeal&#x2014;and I agree with my hon. Friend that it is a debatable matter, on which hon. Members may have very different views&#x2014;then I should certainly be prepared to take my hon. Friend's Amendment into consideration, to decide whether we should put down a Government Amendment at the Report stage in either the words of his own Amendment or in some other words.

This is the Amendment to which reference was made in the Debate we have just had on an Amendment to an Amendment of mine. Section 34 (2) of the principal Act is now no longer necessary as it is considered that paragraph 1 (<i>a</i> and <i>b</i>) of the Fair Wages Resolution of 14th October, 1946, provides such guidance as an industrial court might require in settling disputes referred to it under the Act.

<p>My right hon. Friend has astounded me by mentioning that one of the trade unions in the industry has actually suggested the deletion of this Subsection. Thereupon, he has, evidently, acted upon the suggestion of the cin&#x00E9; technicians. I do not think the Minister deliberately intended to catch us on the wrong foot, but he has certainly caught two or three of us in the Committee on the wrong foot, because we did not know, until he mentioned it, the particular reason why he wishes to repeal this Subsection. Many of the sections of organised labour do not share his view, nor the view of my right hon. Friend the Minister of

Labour, that the Fair Wages Resolution thoroughly stitches up what is proposed by the repeal of this Subsection. I should have imagined&#x2014;I mean this in a friendly way&#x2014;that before my right hon. Friend took cognisance of the desires of one trade union in the industry which trade union happens to be one of the smallest, he would have taken into consultation the two or three larger unions more involved in this matter than the organisation to which he has referred. I do not know what we can do about it now. If the repeal is agreed to, we may find five-sixths of the organised workers in the industry as a whole being put into a prejudiced position. However, if he is satisfied&#x2014;and I am prepared to take his assurance&#x2014;that this is necessary and practicable I should feel more reassured, and the people I am indirectly representing, so far as this matter is concerned, will also feel more reassured.</p>

<p>The noble Lord is quite right in that. I am extremely sorry if there has been some slip up in the consultations with the trade unions concerned in this matter. I should make it clear at once to my hon. Friend that our reason for acting in this manner was not because one of the unions asked us so to do, but because of the advice of the Minister of Labour, who has been considering this matter in relation to a number of industries since the acceptance of the Fair Wages Resolution of October, 1946. One of the unions concerned&#x2014;and I realise it is only one&#x2014;asked for this repeal. However, I would not wish to have represented


to the Committee that this was an agreed measure had I known that by, perhaps, some unfortunate accident, due to the fact that two Ministries were concerned, my hon.

<p>I wondered if it would now be in Order to indicate why I submitted that those words should be left out. I put down the Amendment because I was under the impression that there had been some discussions with the Board of Trade about it. I was hopeful that if the Amendment had been selected the Minister might have been sympathetic. I can put the point quite shortly, and I hope the Minister might be prepared to consider the matter between now and Report stage.<br/>
The effect of that Amendment would be to introduce an alteration in Section 12 of the Act as amended, and it can be best appreciated by considering the Second Schedule at page 19. As the law stands, both renters and exhibitors are required to keep certain records, and to make certain returns. The Bill, in its

present form, provides that certain additional information shall be kept by both renters and exhibitors. The object of my Amendment was to suggest to the Minister that it would be quite sufficient for his purposes if the additional obligation which he desires is placed upon renters, and that it would be unnecessary to extend its scope so as to require the exhibitors also to keep this additional information. It would impose upon them a considerable amount of clerical work which would be duplicating information available elsewhere. I hope the Minister will consider the matter between now and Report stage with a view to removing this additional obligation from the records of information which have to be kept by exhibitors.</p>

<p>Two points are raised here. First, whether exhibitors should or should not be required to maintain these records; and, secondly&#x2014;though my hon.

The question where they should be kept was one of the subjects on which discussion took place, and whether they are required to be kept at individual theatres. On the main point, whether it is necessary to require exhibitors to maintain these records, I am afraid I must tell the Committee that it is essential to require that. I agree there is an apparent duplication if renters have to keep records, and exhibitors have to keep records of presumably the same payments for presumably the same film. If no records of rentals were kept, there would be no evidence in the exhibitor's records on which he could be convicted of knowingly making false returns. These returns are required for assessing which of the two features in the same programme represents the first feature, because there was a test applied in the relevant Clause of the Bill, based on the amount of daily rentals. If we did not have these records, we should not be able to convict an exhibitor&#x2014;although I hope it will not be necessary&#x2014;of knowingly making false returns.<br/>
On the other hand, it is certainly not essential that exhibitors should be required to keep these records at each individual theatre. I know that in many of the larger circuits particularly this would be a very heavy burden, because most of the records are usually kept centrally. The important thing is that records should be kept and produced on demand


to an authorised officer of the Board of Trade. Subject to that, in my view the exhibitor ought to be at liberty to keep these records of returns where he likes. I quite agree that the present wording of the Bill would not allow exhibitors to keep the records wherever they consider most convenient, but requires them to keep the records at each individual theatre. I would be prepared to meet my hon. Friend to this extent, that on Report I will put down a form of words to make clear that records can be kept in a central place and not necessarily at each individual theatre. But we must insist on records being kept somewhere.</p>

<p>As the Committee will have appreciated, the Second Schedule is intended to be a mere reprint, or reproduction of the 1938 Act, with the Amendments which the Committee have already made to that Act by the present Bill. It would obviously be a waste of time to call any of the Amendments on the Order Paper. With the agreement of the Committee, I would therefore propose to instruct the Public Bill Office to make the appropriate Amendments in the Second Schedule, in conformity with the decisions to which the Committee have already come in this Bill. The only question before the Committee in those circumstances is, "That this be the Second Schedule to the Bill." That enables the Committee to decide whether, In their view, it is for the public convenience&#x2014;and I imagine they will think it is&#x2014;to have the Schedule, as amended, reprinted as the Second Schedule to the Bill.</p>

<p>I rise, Major Milner, not in the least by way of hesitation, doubt or criticism, but because I am not sure that I have fully appreciated the point. I think I have, and I have no doubt you are right. However, since an important point of procedure might be involved, may I inquire whether this is the first occasion upon which exactly this line has been taken, or whether it is something to which we are

accustomed, and about which I ought really to know? I think the latter is probably the case.</p>

<p>This seems to me to be the right course to take, but, if I may say so, I am grateful for the intervention of the senior Burgess for Cambridge University (Mr. Pickthorn) because&#x2014;and here I must tread rather delicately&#x2014;I think it very desirable to establish that this can be done only with the approval of the Committee, and not on any Ruling of the Chair. Might I, with great respect, ask that the Question be put in the form, "Is it with the approval of the Committee," or some similar form of words, in order to make it quite clear? I think that is the position. This does raise rather an important point.</p>

<p>I am obliged to the noble Lord. I thought I had, in fact, asked that this should be done with the approval of the Committee. The point is perfectly simple, and it might be as well to have it on record. The Second Schedule is a mere reprint of the 1938 Act as amended by the decisions of the Committee on this Bill. The reprinting of the Act as amended is a convenient practice for which I think the hon. Member for Twickenham (Mr. Keeling) was responsible some years ago. Obviously, it is convenient to have a reprint of the amended Act as a Schedule or an appendix to the Bill which makes the Amendments. It is a matter for the Committee whether or not they agree to the course I suggest. I would submit it is a sensible course to adopt, because were any of the Amendments proposed to the Committee they would either be Amendments in conformity with decisions already arrived at, in which event they can be put in formally by the Clerks of the Public Bill Office, or they would be out of Order, as being in conflict with decisions already arrived at by the Committee. The common sense course appears to be to instruct the Public Bill Office to make the appropriate Amendments, and merely to put to the Committee the Question, "That this be the Second Schedule to the Bill," in order that the Committee may say whether they approve the procedure of reprinting the Schedule with the necessary Amendments.</p>
