	<p pid="a.244.1/1">You are absolutely correct, Mr. Speaker; he has often expressed his vehement displeasure to me, as have his colleagues. Let me remind the hon. Gentleman, who has properly taken a close and expert interest in education policy, that this reform comes after a long period of consultation, after independent advice, and after huge support within the education profession and among many communities right across Northern Ireland. Let me also remind him of a survey in the <i> Belfast Telegraph</i> this morning, which shows that many grammar schools in Northern Ireland</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/2" class="indent">&quot;have accepted pupils with C2 and D grades&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/3">for the next academic year. It says that the statistics</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/4" class="indent">&quot;raise serious questions about the need for a long-running campaign to preserve academic selection in Northern Ireland.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/5">The hon. Gentleman himself is quoted as saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/6" class="indent">&quot;The grammar school lobby needs to sort this out if we want to have a strong case for keeping academic selection.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/7">In other words, falling school rolls are forcing this change anyway. We want to ensure that everybody gets new skills.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/8">On the hon. Gentleman's point about blackmail, he asked me to put this decision into the Assembly, and that is precisely what I have done. If he wants to restore devolved self-government by <phrase class="date" code="">24 November</phrase>, he and his colleagues can help to shape the new admissions policy.</p>

	<p pid="a.245.0/1">Because quite simply, it does not. On double standards, I shall quote what the Leader of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1932" name="David Cameron">the Opposition, the right hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron)</phrase>, told sixth-formers in Basildon on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-09">9 January 2006</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.245.0/2" class="indent">&quot;I want to say absolutely clearly, the Conservative party that I am leading does not want to go back to the 11-plus, does not want to go back to the grammar school system.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.245.0/3">If the hon. Gentleman is consistent with his leader's policies, and if those policies are being developed and spread consistently across the UK, he should support the order. By the way, grammar school excellence will be preserved under the new policy; grammar schools are becoming increasingly more open in their selection, for the reasons described by the <i> Belfast Telegraph</i> this morning.</p>

That has been proved to be totally and absolutely false: whether they are old guns or new guns does not come in to it; they are guns. We heard that those had all been done away with.

If that is not achieved, the salaries and allowances will end, as well as the financial assistance to political parties, which totals some &pound;600,000. I do not want to do that.

	<p pid="a.269.0/1">I thank the Solicitor-General for his statement and his courtesies yesterday. I impute no criticism to him for the way that events have turned out. There was a robust set of questions and exchanges involving the Attorney-General yesterday in the House Lords, and I want to refer to some of them.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.0/2">I have a particular interest in this case as I am the MP for the constituency that was most affected by the Jubilee line extension. I join <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1394" name="Dominic Grieve">the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve)</phrase> in congratulating Mr. Wooler and his team; they clearly did a good job, and it was right of the Attorney-General to commission that inspection by the new body set up just for that purpose.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.0/3">The 11 recommendations raise many issues, but I hope that the Solicitor-General will agree that there abide three central issues, and I should add that much of what I say will reflect concerns expressed by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield. There is the conspiracy to defraud issue; the issue that the failures were of the prosecution, not of the defence; and the issue that the principle of jury trial was not at fault. To paraphrase a much more famous selection from the three, the greatest of these principles is that the principle of jury trial was not at fault.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.0/4">The first and third issues relate to the fact that the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General have, as it were, set themselves in opposition to the logic of the recommendations. I therefore join in encouraging Law Officers to retain their intention to get rid of the conspiracy to defraud charge at the earliest opportunity. More generally, when the Law Commission makes such recommendations, it should give both Houses the chance to debate them on the basis of a considered proposal put before us. Had it done so, we could have anticipated such issues and possibly prevented this serious and very expensive mistake.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.0/5">On the second issue, I wonder whether the Solicitor-General can give an answer that the Attorney-General was unable to give yesterday. The latter has accepted the proposed setting up of a fraud prosecution division, which, in effect, would reinstate under another name the arrangement that applied until a few years ago. How far has that proposal got? Has it been set up, and is it in place? If so, how many cases are now being looked after by these specialists within the London Crown Prosecution Service? It is clear that the Attorney-General has accepted that we need a structure that not only contains specialists, but has senior management control over all such cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.0/6">Thirdly, the Solicitor-General quoted the phrase used by the Attorney-General, who said that</p>
	<p pid="a.269.0/7" class="indent">&quot;the case illustrates a good deal about the challenges of presenting long and complex cases in front of a jury.&quot;&mdash;[<i> Official Report, House of Lords,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-27">27 June 2006</phrase>; Vol. 683, c. 1099.]</p>
	<p pid="a.269.0/8">Indeed it does, and the conclusion was that juries can cope. In the light of that, can the Solicitor-General confirm expressly that not until the Fraud Bill&mdash;this issue has been debated during consideration of that Bill&mdash;has been enacted and tested for some years, and not until the fraud review has had some years in which to be digested, will we have any suggestion from the Government that we need to look again at changes to the principle that juries deal with fraud cases? Having passed a significant Act through Parliament that deals with these issues, it would be nonsense then suddenly to say, &quot;We need to change the law.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.269.0/9">Finally, Recommendation 5 sets out some very practical suggestions on how jurors should be dealt with&mdash;more respectfully and carefully, and simply more considerately&mdash;particularly in longer cases. May I have an assurance that those lessons will be learned, and that judges and courts will in future make it clear that jurors&mdash;who clearly can do the job&mdash;are respected for the job that they are willing to do, want to do and can do competently? They must be treated as a very important part of our democratic and constitutional system&mdash;a system that we Liberal Democrats believe should be the principle for dealing with all serious cases in this country.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-06-28a.281.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1377" speakername="Nick Herbert" colnum="281"  time="013:36:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060628/debtext/60628-0691.htm#06062866001590">
	<p pid="a.281.2/1">I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation of the purpose of the codes. This order concerns the most serious matters that the House could discuss: the prevention of terrorism and the extent to which the deprivation of liberty, sanctioned by the state, is justified to ensure that aim. We all agree about the need to counter the very serious threat of terrorism facing this country, and we all agree that ensuring the safety of the public must be the first duty of any Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/2">I agree with the Minister that there is no need to rehearse the debate about whether detaining terrorist suspects without charge for 90 days was justified. The Government lost the argument and lost the vote, but in the furore caused by that proposal, it is often overlooked that Parliament agreed to a significant extension of the period of time for which terrorist suspects can be detained without charge. In fact, we agreed to double the period from 14 to 28 days.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/3">Let me remind the House why these new codes of practice are being discussed. It was the official Opposition who called for <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1394" name="Dominic Grieve">them. In Committee, my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve)</phrase> called for</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/4" class="indent">&quot;a completely separate set of PACE codes to cover terrorist cases in which detention is to last more than seven days&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/5">pointing out that the current codes were</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/6" class="indent">&quot;not designed to deal with people under long-term detention.&quot;&mdash;[<i> Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-02">2 November 2005</phrase>; Vol. 438, c. 901.]</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/7">The then Home Secretary, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1745" name="Charles Clarke">the right hon. Member for Norwich, South (Mr. Clarke)</phrase> replied that he understood the points being made and was</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/8" class="indent">&quot;ready to come back to the House with a solution that will deal with this in an effective way. We recognise that the concerns raised by Opposition Front Benchers are genuine...I am prepared to give an assurance that we will consider the issues that have been raised.&quot;&mdash;[<i> Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-02">2 November 2006</phrase>; Vol. 438, c. 919.]</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/9">A week later, on Report, the Home Secretary said:</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/10" class="indent">&quot;We welcome that suggestion... we can see grounds for having a separate code&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/11">and agreed with what my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield had argued, saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/12" class="indent">&quot;Such a code would be laid before Parliament and be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure...I can give a firm guarantee that the appropriate codes and their equivalents will be brought forward.&quot;&mdash;[<i> Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-09">9 November 2005</phrase>; Vol. 439, c. 329.]</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/13">The then Home Secretary gave a &quot;firm guarantee&quot; back in November. The Government had almost five months between then and the Terrorism Bill receiving Royal Assent on <phrase class="date" code="">30 March</phrase> to prepare a consultation paper on the draft code. Why was that consultation paper not published immediately after the Bill received Royal Assent? It took until May before the Home Office got round to consulting on the code at all. The code is certainly important, which is why we suggested its revision, but it has not been controversial. The need for it was agreed on all sides. As the Minister said, the Home Office received 26 responses to its consultation paper and they were described as generally &quot;positive&quot;. So why the delay?</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/14">After <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1700" name="Theresa May">my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May)</phrase> raised the matter on <phrase class="date" code="">8 June</phrase>, the Prime Minister claimed:</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/15" class="indent">&quot;The reason that we are unable to introduce it&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/16">the 28-day provision&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/17" class="indent">&quot;quickly is that the Conservatives insisted on a longer consultation period, which prevented us from doing that.&quot;&mdash;[<i> Official Report, </i><phrase class="date" code="2006-06-14">14 June 2006</phrase>; Vol. 447, c. 763.]</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/18">How could he possibly claim that? We did not insist on a longer consultation period. We said that a new code of practice would be needed. Are the Government now saying that they would have preferred to introduce 28-day detention without the safeguard of a code?</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/19">The delay has been unnecessary and is the result of the now all too familiar Home Office incompetence. Consequently, one year after the atrocities on <phrase class="date" code="">7 July</phrase> and almost eight months after the Home Secretary's &quot;guarantee&quot;, the provisions on the extension of detention without trial will still not be in force. The Prime Minister claimed that powers to detain terrorist suspects for longer were</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/20" class="indent">&quot;responsible, right and necessary to protect this country's security.&quot;&mdash;[<i> Official Report, </i><phrase class="date" code="2005-11-09">9 November 2005</phrase>; Vol. 439, c. 299.]</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/21">In that case, was not it responsible, right and necessary to introduce the code without delay so that the new powers could be implemented?</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/22">The Prime Minister first revealed that the Government were considering a longer period to detain suspects without charge at his infamous press conference on <phrase class="date" code="">5 August</phrase> last year. From that point, it should have been obvious to the Government that safeguards would be necessary to ensure the proper treatment of people detained for unprecedented periods of time. Why did not work on those safeguards begin then? Why were they not included when the draft Terrorism Bill was published in September?</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/23">The Government cannot claim that somehow we caused the delay by opposing the provision to detain suspects for 90 days. First, we supported 28 days. Secondly, whatever the extended length of detention beyond the current 14 days, it should have been clear that a new code was needed to ensure proper safeguards.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-06-28a.283.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1377" speakername="Nick Herbert" colnum="283"  time="013:36:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060628/debtext/60628-0691.htm#06062866001592">
	<p pid="a.283.1/1">I respect my right hon. and learned Friend's point of view on the matter. He has clearly and consistently made known his objections to any extension beyond 14 days. Nevertheless, it was the official Opposition's position that we would support 28 days, and we did that.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/2">Let us consider the practical consequences of delay. The suspects who were detained after the police raids in Forrest Gate earlier this month have now been released. There appears to be no evidence linking them to terrorist acts that would justify their detention. However, what if that had not been the case? What if police intelligence, which, in the words of the Assistant Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis,</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/3" class="indent">&quot;raised serious concerns for public safety&quot; ,</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/4">had been correct? What if the police had needed to hold the suspects for longer than 14 days to gather evidence and perhaps prevent another atrocity? They would not have been able to. <i> [Interruption.] </i>If the Home Secretary disagrees, he should intervene. Surely the police could not have detained the suspects for longer than 14 days. It is self-evident, because the order has not commenced.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/5">The House agreed the necessity for a longer period of detention in November. Eight months later, the measure remains unavailable to the police. The delay, according to the Prime Minister's argument, has put national security at risk. That is consistent with the Government's record on law and order&mdash;long on grandstanding gestures to capture headlines, short on the practical measures of ordinary competence that are necessary to ensure public safety.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/6">The Home Secretary has conceded that</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/7" class="indent">&quot;from time to time&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/8">the Home Office</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/9" class="indent">&quot;is dysfunctional in the sense that it does not work&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/10">Rather than blaming officials, when will the Government accept that Ministers have responsibility for their Departments, and are responsible for the delay?</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/11">I have two specific questions about the operation of the new code H. It provides for the transfer to a designated prison</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/12" class="indent">&quot;as soon as is practicable&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/13">of suspects for whom a warrant has been issued authorising detention for more than 14 days, unless the detainee requests to remain in a police station, or it would otherwise hinder or delay the investigation. The Minister explained that Lord Carlile, the Government's adviser, strongly recommended the provision. Why 14 days, which appears to be an arbitrary limit? Half the respondents to the consultation were in favour of the ability to transfer prisoners to a prison, but half were against.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/14">Justice stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/15" class="indent">&quot;Although we recognise that police detention facilities are not suited for prolonged detention, imprisoning persons who have not been charged with a criminal offence seems to us to blur a fundamental distinction between pre-charge detention and detention on remand. In practical terms, we are also concerned that it could lead to interference with a suspect's right to access legal advice&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/16">Will the Minister confirm whether that is the case? How will the proper legal requirements for the conduct of interviews and so on be ensured in prison? Will prisoners have to be transferred back to properly equipped police cells for interviews?</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/17">Secondly, the code provides that detainees may receive visits from friends, family or others, at the custody officer's discretion. To what extent will that provision be subject to supervision or review? Should such visits be left to the discretion of a single custody officer? What appeal procedure will be available if the custody officer decides not to allow the visits?</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/18">The Minister will appreciate that the detention of suspects for such periods will inevitably be controversial. We need only look back a few weeks to the detention of the suspects in Forest Gate to realise that that is the case. Granting visits to suspects will therefore be important, and there should be proper accountability and supervision.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/19">I hope that the Minister can answer our constructive questions and that the House will support the code so that the powers, which the House has agreed are needed to counter terrorism, can be brought into force without further delay.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-06-28a.285.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1641" speakername="Lynne Featherstone" colnum="285"  time="013:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060628/debtext/60628-0692.htm#06062866001593">
	<p pid="a.285.0/1">Liberal Democrats strongly opposed the extension of detention without charge from 14 days to 90 days. We voted against the measure on Second Reading principally because we regarded the proposal as a breach of the ancient and fundamental right of habeas corpus, and the right to know the basis on which one is held and to challenge it in the courts.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.0/2">The terrorism that threatens the safety of our citizens at this time in history has meant an uneasy rebalancing of the scales. The Government's desire for 90-day detention was not supported by any case that was made sufficiently satisfactorily to gain the votes of a majority of hon. Members, and the provision fell. The 28-day detention period is the limit to which Liberal Democrats felt able to go without abdicating our commitment to civil liberties, which we in the United Kingdom value so deeply. It represents a doubling of existing police powers&mdash;it is quite an extension.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.0/3">Although I shall restrict myself narrowly, in the way in which the Minister desires us to do, I must stress that we voiced concerns about the original proposal. The longer that a person is held in custody, the greater the likelihood that a court will eventually realise that any evidence was obtained under duress. Code H is therefore important because whatever evidence is obtained must be valuable and valid in order to be presented in a court.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.0/4">I agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1377" name="Nick Herbert">the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert)</phrase> that, for something that was so urgent and pressing, the extraordinary delay in its implementation beggars belief. The Government explain it by citing work and consultation on the code of practice but I understand that the work did not even commence until a month after Royal Assent.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.0/5">We have previously agreed that a separate code of practice should be produced for those detained after arrest under section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000. Given that that has been done, we are minded to support the Government. However, I should like the Minister to expand on some aspects of the code.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.0/6">Will there be extra training for those who supervise the detention or will they simply receive normal prison training? What supervision will there be of what happens to detainees during their sojourn before charge? To whom will relatives complain or present their problems? How will we know about such matters? Will those detained under the 28-day rule come under the inspection regime of the prison or will there be a special inspection for them?</p>
	<p pid="a.285.0/7">It is crucial that individuals held for 28 days be treated in such a way that their detention does not inflame the sensitivities of the communities from which they are likely&mdash;at least at present&mdash;to come. While it may be necessary&mdash;and we have now agreed to it&mdash;to remove liberty before charge for 28 days to gather evidence, it is crucial that the conduct of that detention should not exacerbate the present tinderbox situation. We have all seen the events in Forest Gate. I support the police going in to investigate, but it is crucial that their behaviour does not further damage community relations.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.0/8">On the issue of the detention of those younger than usual, I refer to the recent arrest and detention of two 16-year-olds. The Minister indicates that it was only one, but the principle is the same, whether it is one, two or 10. Will he say how younger people will be supported during the period of detention? Will they be flanked by adults to support them while providing evidence?</p>
	<p pid="a.285.0/9">If the Minister can give satisfactory answers to those questions, the Liberal Democrats will support the motion, and if and when detention for 28 days without charge comes into practice, I hope that it is used appropriately and professionally.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-06-28a.286.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1821" speakername="Douglas Hogg" colnum="286"  time="013:52:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060628/debtext/60628-0692.htm#06062866001594">
	<p pid="a.286.0/1">Much of the ground has been covered in the substantive debates on the Terrorism Act 2006, so I shall be brief. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1377" name="Nick Herbert">My hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert)</phrase> said that he hoped that the code would be passed by the House, but I take a different view, not because of the contents of the code, but because the passage of the code is a condition present to the extension of the time period for detention from 14 days to 28 days. If one takes the view, as I do, that we should not extend the period of detention, one inevitably has to oppose the code, even if it is an improvement on the current position.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.0/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1394" name="Dominic Grieve">My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve)</phrase> was right to secure an undertaking from the Government that a code would be published and brought to the Floor of the House. He should be commended for that, but the essential point is whether we want to extend the period of detention. If the answer is no, the House should not pass the code. It is not necessary, desirable, just or proportionate to increase the period of detention from 14 days to 28 days. It also increases the risk of injustice. Anyone who practises in the criminal courts, as I do regularly, knows very well that the period of detention is a time of great stress for the detained person. If the period is an extended one, those detained are capable of wrongly incriminating themselves. We are embarking on a course of action that is likely to have that effect, and it is primarily for that reason that I opposed the extension of the detention period when we debated it last year.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.0/3">I have also expressed, on many occasions, my dissatisfaction with the process. Statutory instruments and codes are not amendable, but they can have a heavy impact on the rights of citizens. This code is an important document. It has been the subject of consultation, and one is grateful for that, but the House cannot amend it. We must either approve it whole or reject it. Matters of this kind should be amendable, which could be achieved by putting them into the schedule of the Bill. I regard this as a very unsatisfactory process. Matters of this kind should be dealt with under primary legislation, and when they are detailed and complex they should be included in schedules, so that they are amendable.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.0/4">I am aware&mdash;we have just heard so from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1641" name="Lynne Featherstone">the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Lynne Featherstone)</phrase>&mdash;that there will be no support for voting to oppose the order. I therefore do not propose to divide the House, but I do protest against what we are doing and against the extension of the detention period. To anybody who says that the Conservative party signed up to 28 days, I admit that that is true, as my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs said in terms. But we did so because a 28-day period was a darn sight better than 90 or 60 days. It was the best deal that we could make. That is not an assertion of principle, but of pragmatic fact, and&mdash;speaking for myself&mdash;I am thoroughly against an extension of the detention period to 28 days.</p>

	<p pid="a.287.0/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1821" name="Douglas Hogg">My heart sank when my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg)</phrase> said that he did not propose to divide the House on this matter. I support the arguments that he advanced, especially on the relationship of statutory instruments to primary legislation and the fact that they are not available at the time of consideration of the original legislation. In fact, the Modernisation Committee is considering the process of legislation and may make recommendations on that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.0/2">I shall concentrate on the issue of civil liberties, paragraphs 7.2 and 7.3 in the guidance notes, and on the statement made by the Minister of State that</p>
	<p pid="a.287.0/3" class="indent">&quot;In my view the provisions of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (Code of Practice C and Code of Practice H) Order 2006 are compatible with the Convention rights.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.287.0/4">I asked him about that and, like most Ministers nowadays, he gaily asserted that it is a matter of routine. My objections, like those of my right hon. and learned Friend, revolve around the most basic concepts of what Britain stands for and our civil liberties. It is unconscionable that a person should be held without charge for 28 days. Fourteen days is an awfully long time, but we are talking about six weeks in the life of an individual. If the provisions are misused, careers will be wrecked, families may be broken up and great financial burdens will be imposed.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.0/5">It is cynically suggested that we should accept such provisions because they will eventually be shipwrecked in the House of Lords by a judgment declaring their incompatibility. However, the statutory instrument gives us an opportunity to reflect on the provision's incompatibility with the European convention on human rights and the possibility that the Law Lords will rule in that way. That is the judgment of many well regarded lawyers. I suggest that it is cynical to fail to address head-on the relationship between the case law and the status of the European Court of Justice, because that is what the Government are doing. They are playing with the themes. They have brought us to the point where British citizens may be held for up to 28 days without knowing what they are charged with. That is contrary to the traditions of our common law and our history of liberty, and it is very difficult for people in those circumstances to mount a defence.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.0/6">I am opposed to the code of practice&mdash;both emotionally and because of who I am and whom I represent&mdash;because I believe that the Government's declaration of compatibility is fraudulent.</p>

	<p pid="a.288.2/1">With the leave of the House, I shall try and deal with some of the points raised in this appropriately narrow debate. I do not want to attack or challenge <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1370" name="Richard Shepherd">the hon. Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd)</phrase> or <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1821" name="Douglas Hogg">the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg)</phrase>. They have merely been consistent in wanting to kick against a trend that they think they have detected. They believe that important matters are increasingly dealt with through statutory instruments, codes of practice and so on rather than in primary legislation. I do not agree with that, but I accept the broad parliamentary point.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.2/2">I also accept the consequence of consistency&mdash;that those who oppose the original proposition in a Bill are being entirely consistent when they oppose it when it crops up in a statutory instrument or code of practice that flows from the Bill. I do not underestimate the integrity of the hon. Member for Aldridge-Brownhills or of the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham. What they say is entirely fair and reasonable. I do not agree with them, about either the parliamentary or the substantive point, but I admire them for their consistency.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.2/3">In passing, even in my short time in the House I heard those views expressed extremely eloquently many times by the late right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst. The position is perfectly acceptable, it is just that I do not agree with it. However, I appreciate that it is right and proper to express those views in the narrow confines of this debate&mdash;which was spoiled only when <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1954" name="Greg Knight">the right hon. Member for East Yorkshire (Mr. Knight)</phrase> came clodhopping in with his attempt to make it far broader than had been intended.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.2/4">I turn now to some of the specific questions that were raised. It is of course envisaged that, if the police need to interview detainees after they have been transferred to prison, arrangements will be made for them to be moved back to the appropriate police station. That is entirely in keeping with the needs of an investigation, and there is no restriction of access to legal advice when a detainee is in prison. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1377" name="Nick Herbert">The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert)</phrase> asked about that, and I hope that my response has reassured him.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.2/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1641" name="Lynne Featherstone">The hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Lynne Featherstone)</phrase> asked about terrorist detainees in prison. As with all prisoners, they will come under the regime of Her Majesty's inspector of prisons. Importantly, Lord Carlile, the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, has said that he will take a close interest in all aspects of the proposed extended detention. I welcome that, given that his original brief was to oversee all aspects of the legislation.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-06-28a.289.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1618" speakername="Tony McNulty" colnum="289"  time="014:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060628/debtext/60628-0692.htm#06062866001601">
	<p pid="a.289.1/1">That is an entirely reasonable point, although it may not be germane to the integrity of the code of practice. However, it may be worth pursuing, and I accept that custodial records and the evidentiary base available when a person is detained in a police station will be markedly different from what happens in a prison. I shall therefore explore the implications and get back to the hon. Gentleman on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.1/2">I turn now to the question of the 14-day period before transfer to prison. The initial period of detention is often the time when the police need immediate and direct access to the person detained, and the present period of 14 days in police detention has been shown to work adequately. Even Lord Carlile was more concerned about what happens after the 14-day period, during the extended period up to the 28-day limit, as it is clear that police cells are not built to cope with a doubling of the detention period.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.1/3">Our experience is that the problems are not as marked with detention periods of up to 14 days as may be the case with the longer period. Although I recognise Lord Carlile's point, I do not think that the 14-day cut-off point is arbitrary, as it is based on experience. We recognise that the exceptional nature of the extension introduced by the 2006 Act requires an extra safeguard, and that is why we regard the 14-day cut-off as an appropriate time for transfer.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.1/4">I mean no disrespect to the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs, but it is not really appropriate to go on about how long it has taken to bring the code before the House. Royal Assent was secured for the 2006 Act only on <phrase class="date" code="">30 March</phrase> this year. By any standard, given the necessity of detailed assessment of the points raised in the consultation process and the urgency of the matter at hand, the Government have been rather speedy in getting the code before the House. It is very easy to ask why it could not have been written and subject to consultation before the Bill was secured, but that would have been rather presumptuous&mdash;after all, the Bill could have been changed markedly as a result of the deliberations in this House and the other place.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.1/5">I have heard people reminisce wistfully about the debates that we had on the Bill, which could never have been called non-contentious. It could never have been claimed that the Government would be able to secure their business come what may&mdash;and that indeed turned out not to be the case&mdash;so it was never going to be possible to have written the code of practice and subjected it to consultation long before the Bill even came before the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.1/6">The Government lost the odd vote on the Bill, which was highly contentious. It was therefore right and proper for us to wait until it secured full assent. I do not recall exactly how the votes went, but we could have been left with a pre-charge detention period lasting 14 days, 28 days&mdash;or no days at all. Any result different from what was obtained would have made a difference to the code of practice, or put in doubt whether we needed one at all.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.1/7">I want to say, in the nicest possible way, that the remarks made by the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs were unbecoming. I shall not go anywhere near describing the most unbecoming rant made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1700" name="Theresa May">the right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May)</phrase>, who purports to be the shadow Leader of the House. Given the investigations that were going on at the time, I am sure that she will agree, on reflection, that it would have been better if she had not said what she did say.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.1/8">In passing, it might also have been nice if the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs had, when talking about the incident at Forest Gate, said clearly and on the record that he fully supported the police in their actions in carrying out the raid. We cannot second-guess what the police seek to do before or after an event, particularly afterwards when we have the benefit of hindsight. I accept that it is perfectly in order to comment on Forest Gate, but it might have been useful if the hon. Gentleman had prefaced what he said with remarks endorsing what the police did.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.1/9">None the less, for all the cheapish comments&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.293.3/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move, That this House disagrees with the Lords in the said amendment.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.3/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">The Government's approach throughout the passage of this Bill has been to seek consensus wherever possible. Indeed, in several areas we have achieved it. For example, in response to issues raised in this House and in another place, we have made amendments to the co-ordinated online record of electors, to the new duties on electoral registration officers, to the position of service voters with the support of my colleagues at the Ministry of Defence, and to anonymous registration and other things.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.3/3">We have even achieved consensus on measures to address postal voting security. The Bill was introduced with provisions for the piloting of personal identifiers. Those clauses have been replaced by a national system of postal voting identifiers.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.3/4">Providing that the Bill receives Royal Assent soon, to which I will return later, these tough new security measures will be in place by the elections in 2007. The only remaining area on which we disagree is that of individual registration.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.3/5">We have set out our reasons for opposing individual registration, at this point, on a number of occasions, and I believe that right hon. and hon. Members are by now fully aware of them. Today, therefore, I shall focus instead on addressing Members' concerns about the measures we are taking outside individual registration. In previous debates, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1632" name="Oliver Heald">the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald)</phrase> who speaks for the official Opposition on this matter, has expressed his view that individual registration will address two issues: the security of electoral registers and potential fraud in polling stations.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.3/6">On the first point, we should not ignore the significant changes that the Bill already puts in place to make electoral registers more secure. Under the Bill, electoral registration officers will be able to remove ineligible people from the register right up to five days before polling day and, for the first time, people will be able to make public objections to entries on the register that they believe to be inaccurate or fraudulent. An ERO will consider every objection, and can call for evidence and remove people who prove to be wrongly registered. That opportunity, too, will be available up to five days before the close of poll.</p>

	<p pid="a.296.1/1">The right hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. I think we should allow for a variety of elections to take place so that we can have a fairly comprehensive view of the reaction to all the measures. I would not like to put a specific time on that, but I would like examples from a number of elections so that we can make a proper evaluation of the effect of the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.1/2">I shall return to my remarks on timing. We hope to implement the postal vote identifier at the next elections in 2007. That includes elections in England and Wales, and indeed in Scotland. About 12 to 15 per cent. of people now vote by post, so we are talking about a major administrative challenge and it will take some time and a great deal of effort to get it right. We want to give the administrators and the electoral returning officers the best possible opportunity to get it right and therefore we are working to a strict deadline.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.1/3">If Parliament is serious about addressing postal voting issues by the next elections, the Bill needs to be passed soon, without any further delays. Neither the personal identifier scheme, nor the Bill's other important measures&mdash;such as the increased powers to secure a complete register and all the amendments on loans to political parties, which achieve transparency in party funding and which the whole House wants to see in order to regain the confidence of the electorate&mdash;will be in place until, at the very earliest, the elections in 2008 if the Bill is not passed by this House and in the other place in the very near future.</p>

	<p pid="a.304.0/1">I apologise to the House for the fact that I was unable to be here at the beginning of the debate; unfortunately I was caught in a meeting, but that in no way diminishes my belief in the importance of this debate and the issue that we are deciding on this afternoon.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/2">It is worth emphasising continually that everyone in the House accepts that, in principle and in a perfect world, it would be better to move to individual registration. I suspect that it would be better if we could have all sorts of other identifiers to ensure that everyone who voted in an election was the person who was meant to be voting. Unfortunately, we do not live in an ideal world, so we must balance contending pressures. On the one hand, we must ensure that electoral fraud does not take place, but on the other hand, we must facilitate the registration of the maximum number of people so that they can take part in elections. That is the essence of our debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/3">May I say at the outset that I am concerned about fraud and the cases that have been heard in court? However, at every election, whether for local, regional or national Government&mdash;I am sure that all hon. Members have had the same experience&mdash;many people come to my headquarters to say, &quot;I've just discovered that I'm not on the register, and I can't take part in the election.&quot; We have made it easier in the past few years for people to register almost up to election day, but if I counted up all the people in that position, they would vastly outnumber the total cases of fraud brought to court. I do not wish to minimise legitimate concerns about fraud, but we must look at the overall context, because we would be concerned if people could not exercise their democratic right to vote in elections.</p>

Does he not accept that the evidence from Northern Ireland suggests that the names that were removed were largely those of people who should not have been on the register, or who had died? Consequently, was not the drop in registration a positive, not a negative?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-06-28a.317.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1503" speakername="Mark Field" colnum="317"  time="015:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060628/debtext/60628-0695.htm#06062866002181">
	<p pid="a.317.0/1">There is no disputing the fact that proceedings on the Bill have been a long haul. As the Minister pointed out, it received its First Reading in this House as long ago as <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-25">25 November 2004</phrase>. What a difference 19 months makes! After one election, two Conservative party leaders and three Home Secretaries, we have finally reached the finishing tape.</p>
	<p pid="a.317.0/2">Let me say at the outset that significant progress has been made, and it would be churlish of us to oppose the Government today. Nevertheless, we remain concerned, despite the sterling work done in another place, that the underlying principles behind the Government's thinking will prove detrimental to the fundamental principles of the national lottery. We intend to remain vigilant to ensure that worries about vastly increased Government control over the distribution of lottery funds are kept at bay. I will say more about that when we come to the next group of amendments.</p>
	<p pid="a.317.0/3">In our view, the national lottery was set up by a Conservative Government more than a decade ago with the specific purpose of improving the daily quality of life for all people in Britain by reserving funds for activities that might otherwise be neglected in the everyday distribution of taxation receipts. By contrast, the creation of the Big Lottery Fund&mdash;the centrepiece of the Bill&mdash;represents a step, if perhaps a small one, away from the exclusive focus on the four original good causes: arts, heritage, sports and charity.</p>
	<p pid="a.317.0/4">I am however happy to recognise that the Government have taken on board many of the specific concerns that we expressed in what the Minister has diplomatically described as &quot;lively&quot; discussions on Report and Third Reading on <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-19">19 January</phrase>. I also welcome the Government's acceptance of the two important matters of principle in another place. We are pleased that the lottery distributors have now agreed that they will report back annually on how they are adhering to the additionality principle.</p>
	<p pid="a.317.0/5">On Third Reading in the Lords, the noble Lord Davies, on behalf of the Government, tabled a specific amendment to establish the agreement of the distributors to enshrine in the Bill the duties of those distributors. We entirely agree with the Government that decisions on what to fund should remain strictly for lottery distributors, but we still believe that it would have been helpful had a stricter definition of additionality been placed in the Bill. However, we recognise that a detailed report on the upholding of the distinction between lottery funding and Government funding represents a workable solution and one that we will obviously look at in the years ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.317.0/6">We recognise that the noble Lord has given us an assurance that if Parliament has reason to take issue with reports from distributors, there will be opportunities to debate that. Similarly, we appreciate the fact that lottery funding being additional to Government funding does not mean that it should necessarily be complementary to such Government expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="a.317.0/7">May I at this point place on record my thanks to my colleagues in another place, Viscount Astor, Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville and Lord Luke, for all their sterling efforts?</p>
	<p pid="a.317.0/8">The other main issue on which we crossed swords with the Government was the control of the Big Lottery Fund. As the Minister will recall, the Government were narrowly defeated in the Lords on Report when we sought to remove the Secretary of State's powers to prescribe by affirmative resolution types of expenditure for the Big Lottery Fund. While taking at face value the assurance from the Government that those powers are needed only to establish a broad theme rather than specific spending intentions, we recognise that the new amendment tabled here today effectively accepts the spirit of that amendment from the official Opposition and the Liberal Democrats in another place.</p>
	<p pid="a.317.0/9">In that context, I thank the Minister for his assurances that his amendment tabled to clause 14 puts the Big Lottery Fund in the same position as other lottery distributors with regard to policy directions, but in doing so, we recognise that the Big Lottery Fund will need to take account of, rather than simply comply with, financial directions in the same way as other lottery distributors.</p>
	<p pid="a.317.0/10">We also recognise that, on Third Reading in the Lords, there were several new and uncontentious amendments tabled by the Government to which we will come later, when I shall also say a few words about the ongoing independence of the Big Lottery Fund. It is important that there be independence from Government intervention&mdash;or, indeed, any political intervention&mdash;in relation to the distribution of lottery funds. It is a great worry that we are moving down a path that will become more apparent as we debate the new lottery operator. It is all the more important that, effectively, we have three very independent organisations, with Parliament overseeing the lottery operator and the distribution of lottery funds. An intermingling of responsibilities would be dangerous, and this is something that we will debate in the months and years ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.317.0/11">With those comments and with my thanks for the Minister's words, I hope that we can move ahead on the Government's proposals today.</p>

	<p pid="a.319.0/1">I, too, am delighted that we are coming to the end of this rather long process; the passage of the National Lottery Bill through both Houses. Like the Minister I congratulate the Bill team on their stamina and I pass on my congratulations to the leader of that team on her marriage. I hope very much that she is having an enjoyable honeymoon.</p>
	<p pid="a.319.0/2">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1503" name="Mark Field">the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field)</phrase> pointed out, the Bill started its passage back on <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-24">24 November 2004</phrase>. It was interrupted because of the general election and Second Reading took place on the Floor of the House on <phrase class="date" code="">14 June</phrase> last year. During that debate, I was able to acknowledge the fantastic work done in each and every one of our communities as a result of the distribution of money raised by the lottery. I also expressed my view that the Liberal Democrats had got it wrong when, at the time of the setting up of the national lottery under the Conservative Government, we opposed it. I still think that we were wrong to have done so, as the lottery has done sterling work.</p>
	<p pid="a.319.0/3">During the Bill's passage since <phrase class="date" code="">14 June</phrase> last year, I believe that significant improvements have been made, as others have already said. The briefing from the National Council for Voluntary Organisations states:</p>
	<p pid="a.319.0/4" class="indent">&quot;We believe that the Bill has been significantly improved as a result of the amendments and debates around upholding the additionality principle, maintaining the independence of lottery distributors and ensuring that the National Lottery provides sustainable funding streams to the voluntary and community sector.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.319.0/5">I agree with much of that, but I also agree with the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster that, in respect of additionality, that is rather over-egging the pudding. I continue to be concerned that we have not achieved as much as we would like in respect of enshrining a definition of additionality in the Bill&mdash;the Prime Minister said that that would be a good idea&mdash;in order to provide a benchmark against which to judge the decisions of the various lottery distributors.</p>
	<p pid="a.319.0/6">The Minister is right to be concerned, as he hinted he was, about aspects of health spending. He said that it would not be right for lottery money to be spent on aspects of health that were being funded by the Government, but as the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster pointed out, under that definition, whatever aspects of health the Government choose to spend money on at any one time will be sacrosanct and the lottery can come in and fill the gap.</p>
	<p pid="a.319.0/7">It is interesting to read what it says on the Department of Health's website. Under the heading, &quot;Why can't Lottery money be spent on the National Health Service?&quot;&mdash;an interesting question&mdash;the website states:</p>
	<p pid="a.319.0/8" class="indent">&quot;The Government does not believe it would be right to use Lottery money to substitute for NHS services that are paid for through taxation. It is committed to the principle that Lottery funds should be used to support only initiatives that are additional to health services provided through Government expenditure.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.319.0/9">But it then continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.319.0/10" class="indent">&quot;Lottery money for projects which support preventative health care and health promotion is available, through the Big Lottery Fund.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.319.0/11">However, those are aspects on which NHS money is currently spent, so there is already confusion on the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.319.0/12">Although the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster seems to be smiling at me and nodding in agreement with everything I say, we should perhaps remember that the Conservative party has not been absolutely straight on this issue. It is worth reflecting that, before the last general election, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1932" name="David Cameron">the right hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron)</phrase>&mdash;now the Conservative party leader&mdash;announced on the &quot;Today&quot; programme his plans for a national school leaver programme. The presenter asked him how it would be funded and he replied, on <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-04">4 January</phrase> last year:</p>
	<p pid="a.319.0/13" class="indent">&quot;Well we want to look at that, there is the National Lottery, there are all sorts of programmes we can access.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.319.0/14">He was clearly interested in getting his mitts on lottery money, as confirmed in the Conservative manifesto, which announced that the party's Club2School sports scheme was to be funded by &pound;750 million of lottery money. The Conservative party has not been quite as clean on this issue as it might have been.</p>
	<p pid="a.319.0/15">The key issue relates to the Big Lottery Fund, which is a combination of the Community Fund and the New Opportunities Fund. My party was opposed to the establishment of the New Opportunities Fund because it was going to distribute on a basis entirely determined by the Government, thus totally eroding the principle of additionality. As I have said, the New Opportunities Fund is to form part of the Big Lottery Fund and we therefore continue to have concerns about its running. We all know that the Big Lottery Fund has existed for more than a year&mdash;indeed, I have a Big Lottery Fund T-shirt and mug&mdash;yet we continue to debate the measure that is meant to establish it. However, it already exists and we must accept that.</p>
	<p pid="a.319.0/16">It was crucial to ensure that the Big Lottery Fund is subject to no greater opportunities for Government interference than any other lottery distributors. Under the original Government proposals, that would not have been the case. The Big Lottery Fund would have had to comply with a string of directions from the Secretary of State. Both Opposition parties wanted to ensure that it had to comply only to the same extent as other lottery distributors.</p>
	<p pid="a.319.0/17">I am therefore delighted that, after pressure in the House and in another place, the Government have acceded to our request. The amendments would ensure that the Secretary of State had the same ability to instruct the Big Lottery Fund and the other lottery distributors. It is therefore right that the wording of the amendments mirrors that of section 26(1) of the National Lottery etc. Act 1993. We are delighted to support the amendments because they would effect what we wanted to achieve from the outset.</p>

	<p pid="a.330.0/1">As the Minister pointed out, Lords amendments Nos. 3 and 4 require the Secretary of State to consult other persons as she thinks appropriate in the extreme circumstance that she decides to exercise the balance relocation power in clause 8, which is a common-sense safeguard. Similarly, the Government proposal in Lords amendment 5 to make it clear that the powers in clause 11 cannot be used by lottery distributors simply to promote their own lottery games makes sense, especially if there is to be more effective competition in the lottery in the next decade. We welcome those minor amendments, and we will not press them to a vote this afternoon.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.0/2">As we are debating national lottery issues, I wish to put two of the Opposition's longer-term concerns on the record. Like the Secretary of State, I am a London Member of Parliament. Our capital city has every reason to be proud of securing the Olympic games for 2012, but I agree with a number of concerns expressed by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1841" name="Mark Fisher">the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mark Fisher)</phrase>. Serious questions remain about the means of funding the Olympic games. Given the track record of all recent Olympiads, with the exception of the two held in the United States&mdash;Los Angeles in 1984 and Atlanta 12 years later&mdash;there is a significant likelihood of a substantial cost overrun. One need only look at the experience of the hapless council tax payers of Montreal who, 30 years on, are still paying the price of their Olympic games, to understand that risk. Even the much admired Sydney Olympics six years ago cost almost three times as much as the initial budget. As the Minister will be aware, the current arrangements place the burden of any cost entirely in the hands of London council tax payers. Realistically, for political as well as economic reasons, that is unlikely to come to pass. There is little doubt that a cost overrun will partly be met by the national lottery&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.331.3/1">Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for your comments. I understand what you are saying, but I simply wanted to say that there is a strange paradox. We have discussed the tick-box culture and the hypothecation of the national lottery, so it is important that the Government accept the Lords amendments and the independence of the operation of the Big Lottery Fund. Distributors should be free from political interference; otherwise I fear that many initiatives would be open to hypothecation.</p>
	<p pid="a.331.3/2">As the Minister is aware, the bidding process for the third franchise, which now involves a 10-year term rather than a seven-year term, is already under way. The decision will have been made by this time next year, with the new lottery term beginning in February 2009. I hope that in the next six months we can debate in Government time the broader national lottery issues that I have tried to touch on in this brief contribution.</p>
	<p pid="a.331.3/3">As I have said, the Opposition have no objections to this group of amendments. I suspect that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1391" name="Don Foster">the hon.

	<p pid="a.334.6/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move, That the House agrees with the Lords in the said amendment.</p>
	<p pid="a.334.6/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">This is a Government amendment made on Third Reading in the other place, which will require local authorities to have regard to information about the views of young children when carrying out their duties under clause 3 relating to early childhood services. The issue of listening to children has been raised and debated at each stage of the Bill in both Houses. We all agreed that it was an important subject. The Government have a longstanding commitment to providing more opportunities for children and young people to become involved in the planning and delivery of services that affect them. The core principles of the involvement and participation of children and young people were first set out in &quot;Learning to Listen&quot;, which we published in November 2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.334.6/3">Our commitment to listening to children and encouraging their participation has been a consistent theme throughout the implementation of the &quot;Every Child Matters&quot; programme. As I said in Committee:</p>
	<p pid="a.334.6/4" class="indent">&quot;We agree that early childhood services will be effective only if they engage not only parents, but children who use them.&quot;&mdash;[<i> Official Report, Standing Committee D,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-08">8 December 2005</phrase>; c. 83.]</p>
	<p pid="a.334.6/5">As has been made clear during debates in both Houses, we are committed to ensuring that the voices of even our youngest children, who are the subject of the Bill, are heard, and that their views are taken into account in the planning and delivery of the services dealt with under clause 3. We have listened to the arguments put forward and found many areas of agreement.</p>
	<p pid="a.334.6/6">As Members know, it was always our intention that statutory guidance should carry forward and build on the precedent already set by the current children's centre practice guidance, which sets out clearly ways to explore what young children really think. Making provision in the Bill ensures that this issue will not be ignored in the future. Fuller explanation and details, as well as examples of good practice, will be included in the statutory guidance that we issue under this clause, and that will have wider application across all childhood services, not just children's centres.</p>
	<p pid="a.334.6/7">We know how easy it is for adults to make faulty assumptions about the experiences that are important to young children. Throughout the debates, however, there has also been a wide recognition that very young children are much less likely to be able to understand and have views about the implications of strategic planning decisions: for example, how Jobcentre Plus or NHS services can most effectively be integrated into childhood services. Earlier amendments that were debated did not fully take account of the impracticality of compelling local authorities to involve young children in every aspect of the clause 3 duties. We need a proportionate approach that gives local authorities the flexibility that will enable them to perform such a duty in the way that is best suited to local circumstances and the specific issues in view at any particular moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.334.6/8">The amendment will require local authorities to have regard to information about the views of young children when it is relevant to the performance of their duties under clause 3. Those duties encompass all aspects of the design, delivery and development of early-childhood services. As a result, the voices of young children will be heard in the way in which local authorities plan and deliver services for them. It is, however, important that the wording enables local authorities to take account of local conditions and the nature of the specific issue in question at any given time, and, in particular, to take full advantage of the good work done by their partners in the voluntary sector, while avoiding the practical difficulties and inappropriate aspects of participation by very young children in decision-making at a strategic level.</p>
	<p pid="a.334.6/9">I believe that the amendment strikes the right balance. It guarantees young children an appropriate voice, while avoiding the risk that local authorities will be compelled to try to engage young children in matters on which meaningful consultation with them is simply not possible. I am pleased that we arrived at a formulation allowing us to include the duty to listen to young children in the Bill in a way that is appropriate, and gives local authorities flexibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.334.6/10">I hope Members will agree that the amendment reflects the importance that Parliament&mdash;and, certainly, the Government&mdash;ascribe to this issue. I believe that it confirms our requirements and expectations of local authorities, building on the good work that the voluntary sector is already undertaking.</p>

	<p pid="a.337.0/1">The Minister will not be surprised to hear that I greatly welcome the amendment. We discussed at length the issue involved. It was an important issue for Liberal Democrat Members, because we think that we are moving towards listening to children and young people&mdash;although the approach taken is gradual, despite the Government's having introduced some good innovative ideas and techniques in other spheres.</p>
	<p pid="a.337.0/2">The issue the amendment raises is whether the Bill should state that very young children should be listened to. I think that that is very important, because it is part of a whole cultural shift. We want our young people to participate. We want to engage with them. We want this to be a two-way process. In areas such as this&mdash;the provision of a service for very young children&mdash;why should there not be means to ascertain the views of those children?</p>
	<p pid="a.337.0/3">Excellent work has been done by a number of charities. We have talked about the National Children's Bureau scheme, &quot;Listening as a way of life&quot;, and the excellent outcomes that it produced. However, the difficulty that we had in Committee was whether young children should be put in a position where they might be expected to comment on overall strategy; that seemed to be the impediment that prevented us from getting a sensible amendment.</p>
	<p pid="a.337.0/4">I am therefore extremely pleased that the issue continued to be discussed&mdash;although I think that my noble Friend Baroness Walmsley must have been more persuasive than me. Nevertheless, I welcome this measure, and particularly the fact that Lord Adonis took it very seriously and came up with wording that will take us forward. I look forward to seeing reports on, and monitoring of, some of the outcomes from this measure.</p>

	<p pid="a.340.5/1">This is a group of minor but important amendments that the Government proposed in the other place to deal with drafting errors in relation to this Bill, and the commencement order on Adoption and Children Act 2002. The purpose of amendment No. 15 is to reinstate, as local authority social services functions, certain functions relating to the keeping of adoption records. The amendment corrects an unintended consequence of a commencement order for the Adoption and Children Act 2002, which in effect removed these functions from the list of social services functions in schedule 1 to the Local Authority Social Services Act 1970.</p>
	<p pid="a.340.5/2">Local authorities' functions in respect of these records remain in place, but they are no longer social services functions within the meaning of the 1970 Act. This has a knock-on effect; potentially, for example, on the powers of the Commission for Social Care Inspection to inspect local authorities' discharge of their functions under the 1983 regulations. Amendment No. 15 secures the position as it was before the commencement of the 2002 Act at the end of December 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.340.5/3">The amendment furthermore reinstates a reference to the Adoption Act 1976 in schedule 1 to the 1970 Act so that surviving functions under the 1976 Act are social services functions. Amendments Nos. 13 and 14 make consequential amendments to clauses 109 and 110 to bring amendment No. 15 into effect from the date of Royal Assent.</p>
	<p pid="a.340.5/4">Amendments Nos. 10, 11 and 12 correct the drafting in clause 73 to make it absolutely clear that the provisions in clause 73(5) and 73(7) regarding the registration or de-registration of provision refer to the recipient of a notice from Her Majesty's Chief Inspector.</p>
	<p pid="a.340.5/5">Amendment No. 16 relates to the second part of schedule 2, which amends the Education Act 1996 and corrects the wording that refers to a nursery that is in &quot;England or Wales&quot; rather than in &quot;England and Wales&quot;. Amendments Nos. 17, 18 and 19 correct the drafting in schedule 3, which lists repeals to previous Acts and should reflect schedule 2 amendments that remove the wording from other Acts. The three repeals listed were accidentally left out of schedule 3, so the amendments simply correct the drafting.</p>
	<p pid="a.340.5/6">I hope that Members will agree that these are small but important amendments that need to be made. I recommend that the House agrees with the Lords in the said amendments.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-06-28a.348.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1940" speakername="Peter Luff" colnum="348"  time="017:25:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060628/debtext/60628-0698.htm#06062866002227">
	<p pid="a.348.0/1">I am grateful for that point, with which I agree. I am about to offer the Government a case for the defence, because there are issues that the House needs to address, too. In the particular case of the home computing initiative, I think that there was a deliberate attempt to withhold information, but other answers have a more innocent explanation so far as the Government are concerned, and we must look to ourselves for a significant share of the blame, some of which we all must share.</p>
	<p pid="a.348.0/2">Four years ago, the Procedure Committee conducted a survey of Members' views on questions and received 167 responses. Broadly, it concluded that the system was generally thought to be pretty effective, but that the speed of answers was not sufficient and there was a problem with the quality of many answers. I submit that those problems have got considerably worse in the four years since then.</p>
	<p pid="a.348.0/3">The Select Committee on Public Administration has also been monitoring ministerial answers and their quality for several years, but I see no evidence that that important work is having the effect that it ought to have.</p>
	<p pid="a.348.0/4">Let us put our own House in order, however, before we tell the Government what to do. Members of Parliament are tabling too many questions&mdash;far too many questions. This has no doubt led to many Ministers feeling, quite fairly and legitimately, swamped and unable to deal with the deluge in sufficient detail and with sufficient speed. It also leads, I suspect, to the setting up of centralised answering units in Departments, which are an extremely unwelcome development.</p>
	<p pid="a.348.0/5">The use of the questions procedure has grown significantly. Perhaps some historical perspective will help. In the Session of 1847 there were 129 questions&mdash;an average of about one a day. I think that they were all oral questions, as the principle of written questions had not then been established. I have a lengthy exposition at my disposal on the development of the number of questions asked, but I shall cut straight to the more relevant, recent dates. The Table Office has helpfully provided me with figures for the questions tabled in each financial year since the millennium. The House, of course, operates its Sessions over a different year, but these figures are for the financial years because that is the basis on which the House of Commons Commission works, and they are useful.</p>
	<p pid="a.348.0/6">There were an average of 302 questions each day in 2000-01; there were 460 in 2001-02; there were 463 in 2002-03; there were 472 in 2003-04; there were 456 in 2004-05; and there were 596 in 2005-06. Those figures include orals, which account for between 20 and 30 a day. There is a different procedure for orals&mdash;the shuffle, in which only those that come out on top are printed&mdash;and orals are a constant, and a small proportion of the total. The figures give a measure of growth&mdash;from 300 to 600 over that period.</p>
	<p pid="a.348.0/7">Those figures are described in the House of Commons Commission annual report as</p>
	<p pid="a.348.0/8" class="indent">&quot;dealt with by the Table Office each day&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.348.0/9">They represent questions that appear on the Order Paper, so refer to orderly questions. For questions offered to be tabled, including those that are &quot;carded&quot;&mdash;the procedure by which a question challenged at the Table Office will bring the Member a card asking him or her to go to discuss it with the Clerks&mdash;the figure for 2005-06 was 656 per day. The overall trend is sharply up. At the end of that year, the Table Office was receiving 33 per cent. more questions every day than it had just 12 months previously.</p>
	<p pid="a.348.0/10">I have not done my research in detail, and I shall not name and shame anyone this evening, but it seems that the increase is caused by a relatively small number of Members. For example, on <phrase class="date" code="">15 June</phrase> last year, of the 367 ordinary written questions that appeared in the blue pages of the Order Paper&mdash;not including 73 named-day questions and 25 orals&mdash;some four Members accounted for 174, or 47 per cent. of the total. It is not always the same four Members, of course, but I understand that there is a pretty strong pattern identifying 20 or so Members who make a significantly greater use than the rest of us of written questions.</p>
	<p pid="a.348.0/11">What are the reasons for that increase in question numbers? First, it has become too easy to ask a question. The Procedure Committee found that there was overwhelming support for electronic tabling of questions: something like 74 per cent. of those who responded were in favour, with 24 per cent. against. I say, however, that popularity is not always a good guide to propriety. Although questions may be received only if a Member signs up for e-tabling and uses the dedicated system, when a question comes to the Table Office by that route there is no way of determining whether there really is a Member at the other end. Strictly speaking, of course, a Member will use the system personally and not give his log-in details or his password to anyone else. But we live in the real world, and we know what really happens.</p>
	<p pid="a.348.0/12">The use of e-tabling has increased sharply. At present, 310 Members are signed up for the system. In May, 176 Members tabled one or more questions by that method and the top tabler tabled 197 e-questions. Over the whole year 2005-06, the percentage of all questions e-tabled was 29.6, but the proportion is increasing, and hit 40 per cent. for the first time in February 2006. E-tabling has made things too easy.</p>
	<p pid="a.348.0/13">I shall be even more controversial by saying that another reason for the increase in questions is pure and simple laziness. There has been a significant change in the character of parliamentary questions. More than ever, they are used for acquiring large chunks of statistical information or general knowledge, not to inquire into aspects of Government policy, which I consider to be their prime purpose. One might think that a Library, a website or a reference book would have provided the Member with an answer more easily and much more cheaply.</p>
	<p pid="a.348.0/14">Some Members do not first check whether the information is already in the public domain; Departments provide a great deal of information online; I have reservations about their use of websites&mdash;but that is the subject of another debate. Members do not need to ask parliamentary questions to find the information but, without betraying any confidences, I can tell the House that I have heard Members engage in exchanges, often robust, with Table Office staff about their right to ask questions, after they have been called in because their question was carded. I have also seen Members happily throw away significant numbers of carded questions without a second's thought. Obviously their commitment to those questions varies&mdash;probably in inverse proportion to their authorship. A question drafted by a Member has more emotional capital invested in it than one drafted, and tabled, by a researcher.</p>
	<p pid="a.348.0/15">When I asked how many carded questions drew a Member into the Table Office to discuss them, I was really surprised by the reply. Detailed records are not kept so the figure is only a guess, but the order of magnitude is right: the Table Office estimates that only about 30 per cent. of questions carded as not being in order and needing to be discussed are actually followed up by the Members who tabled them. The other 70 per cent. just lapse and go into the wastepaper basket. Not much commitment there, Mr. Deputy Speaker.</p>
	<p pid="a.348.0/16">I shall make an enemy with my third accusation. Why are we so obsessed with volume? It is a matter of keeping up with the Joneses, and the danger of performance indicators. I put much of the obsession down to a desire on the part of some MPs to provide tangible evidence that they have been working. Some MPs table long lists of questions in an attempt to appear active, just as some Members table and sign large numbers of early-day motions to pretend the same thing. We all know that early-day motions are usually parliamentary graffiti, and many written questions are not much better these days. Researchers are often drafted into helping with the task of giving the appearance of usefulness. The questions are then submitted, with no scrutiny at all from the Member, on pre-signed forms, and dropped into the box outside the Table Office or tabled electronically.</p>
	<p pid="a.348.0/17">Chief among the villains is a well-meaning website, <a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com">www.theyworkforyou.com</a>, which provides numerical rankings of MPs' parliamentary activity, referred to as &quot;performance data&quot;. For example, to choose a Member at random, the website includes <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1932" name="David Cameron">the revelation that my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron)</phrase> has received answers to 35 written questions in the last year&mdash;323rd out of 644 MPs. It also states that he has attended 36 per cent. of votes in Parliament, coming 628th out of 644 MPs. Those are hardly high scores, although I suspect that they are much higher than those of one or two members of the Cabinet&mdash;I name no names&mdash;but they are certainly not an accurate reflection of the work done by the Leader of Her Majesty's official Opposition. Those activities are not the best use of his time.</p>
	<p pid="a.348.0/18">More obscurely, the website lists such bizarre things as how often my right hon. Friend</p>
	<p pid="a.348.0/19" class="indent">&quot;has used a three-word alliterative phrase (e.g. 'she sells seashells')&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.348.0/20">He has used such a phrase 208 times in debates in the last year, placing him 119th out of 644 MPs.</p>
	<p pid="a.348.0/21">Such websites do, to some extent, help people to engage with politics, but it is entirely misleading to imply that an MP's performance can be judged simply in terms of the numbers of questions asked, votes participated in or even alliterations uttered. Numbers are a very crude indicator of effectiveness. One good question is better than 100 bad ones. Indeed, often one short question&mdash;particularly in oral questions&mdash;is better. The single word &quot;Why?&quot; can often floor a Minister much more effectively than anything else. However, we are now in an arms race in which what can be measured will always count for more than intelligent analysis of what has been achieved. That is very worrying.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-06-28a.353.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1588" speakername="Mark Harper" colnum="353"  time="017:57:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060628/debtext/60628-0699.htm#06062866002230">
	<p pid="a.353.0/1">I pay tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1940" name="Peter Luff">my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff)</phrase> for securing this timely and thoughtful debate. I want to dwell on one or two of the issues that he did not raise. He was quite right that there have been several problems with late answers.</p>
	<p pid="a.353.0/2">My hon. Friend did not mention questions that are tabled for answer on a named day. I receive an increasing number of holding answers to such questions. If one has asked a detailed and complex question that cannot be answered fully in a short time, it is perfectly reasonable to receive a holding answer, as long as a full answer arrives in a reasonably short time. However, I am disturbed that questions that require simple statements of fact or Government policy that ought to be easily available&mdash;not the sort of things that are available on a website, but information that it should be pretty straightforward for a Minister to give&mdash;still receive a holding answer. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1735" name="Keith Simpson">My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson)</phrase> tabled such a question to ask the Government to lay out their strategic objectives in the middle east. Given that we have close on 10,000 troops there, it should have been reasonably possible for the Foreign Office to lay its hands on a comprehensive answer, but he instead received a holding answer, which seemed inappropriate. Perhaps the situation arose because of the points about volume that my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire made. The answers to those sorts of questions need to be approved by a Minister, and if there is a significant number of questions it is simply not possible for even the basic ones to be answered within the deadline. The quantity is definitely affecting the quality.</p>
	<p pid="a.353.0/3">My hon. Friend also made the point that with the advent of the Freedom of Information Act 2000, we have to be very careful about how we use parliamentary questions to make sure that Ministers look to the answers to parliamentary questions as the pre-eminent method of transmitting information to Members, as Mr. Speaker has on a number of occasions made clear that they should. We should not be able to get that information more quickly or more comprehensively by another route. We know that newspapers make lots of freedom of information requests. Indeed, at some point it may be worth having an Adjournment debate on how that legislation is working. I suspect that some of the things that my hon. Friend said about parliamentary questions probably apply to freedom of information requests. We need to make sure that Parliament, not the Freedom of Information Act, is the central method of holding the Executive to account.</p>
	<p pid="a.353.0/4">I agree with my hon. Friend to some extent about being careful about the costs that we incur, although looking at it from an accountant's point of view, I am always very nervous about the quoted cost of answering questions. Unless there is an increase in the number of staff&mdash;with Departments rushing out and hiring staff specifically to answer questions&mdash;most of that cost is a matter of allocating overheads.</p>
	<p pid="a.353.0/5">I would argue that if civil servants are busy answering questions, they are probably not inventing costly Government policies. One could argue that tabling lots of questions and tying up the Government in that way is saving taxpayers' money rather than incurring a cost. If we look simply at the accounting side of the matter, there is resource involved in answering questions, even if it is just time. The biggest cost is probably not a financial cost; if we put Departments under pressure to answer a volume of questions that are not worth answering, we take away valuable time that Ministers and civil servants ought to be using for thinking about policy and about implementing policy. Perhaps, rather than focusing purely on the cash cost, we should consider the reduction in the quality of government that we are getting.</p>
	<p pid="a.353.0/6">The potential solutions laid out my hon. Friend are very valuable. After some thought, I think that his e-tabling solution is worthy of consideration. Coming from an IT background, I am always reluctant to get rid of a technological solution, but forcing Members to table questions in person may be advantageous, as Table Office staff are able to look at the questions. We could perhaps allow e-tabling during recesses. As a new Member I have found no problem visiting the Table Office to table my questions.</p>
	<p pid="a.353.0/7">To expand on a point that my hon. Friend made in passing, I have found the quality of the Table Office staff to be very high. They often improve the question, and it is useful for a Member to discuss with them exactly the point that one is trying to get to and the information that one is trying to get. They, with their great experience, are often able to suggest ways of drafting a question so that one is more likely to get the information that one is after. Members who solely use e-tabling or have questions deposited in the box, and do not interact with Table Office staff, are missing out on a valuable resource available to them. Perhaps if they used that resource, and questions improved, it would make it more difficult for Ministers to give poor answers, as some of those loopholes left in the questions would be closed.</p>
	<p pid="a.353.0/8">My hon. Friend's suggestion of forcing Members to sign immediately after the question, or some solution to force Members into personal interaction, is incredibly valuable. I was very surprised by the information that he gave about the small number of carded questions which are followed up. I know that when I table questions, I actually want the answer, whether for constituency reasons or for Front-Bench responsibilities. If I receive a card from the Table Office, I make it my business to present myself there fairly sharply to clear up the problem with the question, discuss it with the staff and ensure that it is tabled. Frequently, if questions are not answered, I have to table questions chasing them up. Usually, when I table questions, the answer matters, either to a constituent or as part of the formulation of Government policy and the process of holding the Executive to account. That is our responsibility. I agree with what my hon. Friend said about TheyWorkForYou.com and the way in which its measurement of the effectiveness of a Member of Parliament in a performance league table puts Members under incredible pressure. If they do not undertake a volume of work, their performance is criticised&mdash;that applies more to new Members than experienced colleagues, who are more relaxed because they have more experience in the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.353.0/9">That league table, however, is indicative of a wider problem. Many of our constituents are professionals who work in public services. They say that many professional people&mdash;and I hope that Members of Parliament consider themselves professional people&mdash;whether they work in the public or private sector believe that they operate in a target culture, in which management attempt to categorise all their work with easily measurable performance indicators. Government bear wider responsibility, as they try to measure public servants' performance in professional, complicated jobs with simple performance indicators, so we can hardly complain when others judge us with similarly ill-thought-through measures that do not fully comprehend a Member of Parliament's role. In a wider sense, therefore, we only have ourselves to blame.</p>
	<p pid="a.353.0/10">Finally, I endorse my hon. Friend's support of the Procedure Committee's recommendations about the way in which we hold the Executive to account in the recess, particularly the summer recess. We have a constant battle explaining to the press and our constituents that we do not have long summer holiday. The House may not be sitting, but we still have many things to attend to. We receive letters from constituents and we attend engagements in our constituencies. We can use the time for thinking, researching policy or doing things that we do not have time to do when we are under heavy day-to-day pressure. However, we are supposed to hold the Government to account in the recess. We could introduce a pilot measure, at least to allow questions to be tabled in September. I accept that there would be logistical problems for the Table Office if we permitted questions to be tabled throughout the recess. Table Office staff work incredible long hours when the House is sitting, and they are entitled to a holiday. It would be sensible not to allow questions to be tabled in August, but the opportunity to do so would be welcome in September. As the House is not sitting, we may have to use a measure such as e-tabling, given that it is physically problematic for Members whose constituencies are far from London to come to the House. However, it is certainly worth a trial with certain constraints to see how the proposal works and to reinforce for Members of Parliament the message of quality versus quantity.</p>
	<p pid="a.353.0/11">My hon. Friend has done the House a valuable service by holding this debate, and I look forward to the response from the Deputy Leader of the House.</p>
