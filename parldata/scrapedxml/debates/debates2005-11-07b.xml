	<p pid="b.2.2/1">What I can tell the right hon. Gentleman is that the Government will certainly not accept an arbitrary quota on migration, which was proposed by his party at the general election, and which, I believe, would be highly damaging to the British economy. We will not be going down that path, if that was the thrust of his question. The net contribution to our economy made by migrants should be celebrated, and it is high time that he and his party stopped playing politics with the issue and began to welcome the genuine contribution that economic migrants make to our country.</p>

	<p pid="b.5.0/1">The police performance assessments published by the Home Office and Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary on <phrase class="date" code="">27 October</phrase> show that in 2004&ndash;05 the West Mercia police force achieved a very positive assessment of its performance across the range of its core policing activity. All delivery grades are either good or excellent, and most direction grades have improved.</p>

	<p pid="b.5.1/1">I am sure the Minister agrees that we should congratulate Paul West, the chief constable, on the fact that his force not only achieved those grades but was the top-performing force in the country, on the Minister's own criteria. How does he reconcile that outstanding performance with his Department's arbitrary decision, made during the current &quot;Closing the Gap&quot; consultation, that there should be a minimum force size of 4,000 officers? West Mercia has just proved that, with only 2,400 officers, it can deliver the best performance for the best value in the country.</p>

	<p pid="b.5.2/1">I am happy to join the hon. Gentleman in praising Paul West and all his officers and staff for their tremendous achievements. They have cut crime in their area by 13 per cent. Burglary, for example, is down by 22 per cent. However, there is no contradiction between giving that praise clearly in the House and elsewhere and accepting the advice of Her Majesty's inspectorate that, in order that we can deal with terrorism and serious organised crime, and ensure that neighbourhood policing is not taken away from local communities, we need to have strategic forces of the size that it suggests: 4,000 officers and 6,000 staff. Those are not arbitrary figures. Her Majesty's inspectorate judges that those are the numbers that we need.</p>

	<p pid="b.5.4/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that important point. I confirm that, in the past year in West Mercia, robbery went down by 19 per cent., so it is a safer place to live in. Again, the police deserve praise for that. In relation to the change that is being suggested by the inspectorate and the need to ensure that we have robust strategic police forces, there is no blueprint. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Home Department has no blueprint for the forces that will emerge. He wants to hear from local opinion. Hon. Members on both sides of the House will be able to contribute to that consultation.</p>

	<p pid="b.9.5/1">There is no doubt that wider international, as well as EU, co-operation is essential in dealing with terrorism. But will the Home Secretary accept that the Prime Minister's somewhat petulant statement this morning on the 90-day detention proposal undermines the Home Secretary's authority and his rather more rational approach to counter-terrorism law, and damages his ability to advance EU co-operation on counter-terrorism?</p>

Gentleman will be aware that under serious organised crime legislation, not just those but all offences will be given arrestable effect, and that will be happening shortly. The hon. Gentleman is right that we need effective procedures to help reduce repeat victimisation. If we look at the impact of what we have already done&mdash;much more dynamic than anything done for a very long time&mdash;we can see that repeat victimisation is being reduced and that women are being made safer. The present proposal, which will be brought into effect in due course, is adding to what is already an effective programme of action to protect women and men against domestic violence.</p>

Lady has carried her Front-Bench responsibilities for a long time and I know that she visits prisons and takes a deep interest in these issues, so how she can retain such a wholly negative assessment of the current position baffles me, because she knows that many staff are working hard to turn people's lives around. The number of people employed to work with drug misusers has increased from 6,000 to 10,000 as a result of the massive investment that the Government have made, not just for offenders in prison but for offenders in the community; 55,000 offenders in prison were on a maintenance or detoxification programme last year and 40 per cent. of all prisoners are on voluntary drug testing. I do not think that her question reveals the full picture, which is more positive than she reports.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-11-07b.21.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1976" speakername="Adam Ingram" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Ministry of Defence"  colnum="21"  time="015:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051107/debtext/51107-06.htm#51107-06_spmin3">
	<p pid="b.21.2/1">I want to make it clear from the outset that the armed forces operate to the very highest standards. All personnel are aware of the necessity to operate within the law. It remains MOD policy to initiate a service police investigation into every instance where the action of British service personnel may have led directly to the death or injury of Iraqi civilians. The Government back our troops fully. I, together with the chiefs of staff, am very proud of the role that British armed forces play in the world. They do an exceptional job in very difficult circumstances and operate to the very highest standards.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.2/2">The trial of the seven members and former members of the 3rd Battalion the Parachute Regiment concluded on <phrase class="date" code="">3 November</phrase> in Colchester, after the Judge Advocate General directed the board to find all seven defendants not guilty. The trial related to an incident in Iraq which occurred at the roadside in Maysan province in southern Iraq on <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-11">11 May 2003</phrase>, following which Mr. Nadhem Abdullah, an Iraqi citizen, died. The seven individuals were jointly charged with murder and violent disorder.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.2/3">I am limited as to what I can say about the Judge Advocate General's decision, as this is a matter for my noble and learned Friend the Attorney-General. However, it may be helpful if I place the trial in its operational context.The end of the trial has raised the question of why the soldiers faced those serious charges. Soldiers understand that they are required to operate within the law and their rules of engagement and can be held to account for their actions. All soldiers in Iraq and elsewhere receive a briefing on that. They also receive training in the law of armed conflict as part of their annual training. Soldiers are not above the law.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.2/4">Whenever an incident occurs or an allegation is made, a Royal Military Police&mdash;RMP&mdash;investigation is launched by the commanding officer. The conduct and scope of such investigations is determined independently of the chain of command. The RMP special investigation branch&mdash;SIB&mdash;is a fully professional investigative agency, which conforms to UK Home Office standards, where appropriate, and follows civilian police investigative procedures. Investigations are carried out thoroughly, professionally and in accordance with the rules of evidence, UK best practice and the Association of Chief Police Officers standards, but operational circumstances or cultural differences may limit the forensic and investigative opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.2/5">In this case, the Royal Military Police was operating in a hostile and volatile environment, which clearly impacted on some aspects of its investigation, both in terms of its scope and its timing. The decision to prosecute was taken by the Army prosecuting authority based upon the evidence gathered by the RMP. The APA acts as prosecutor in all courts martial and has a similar role to that of the Crown Prosecution Service in civilian courts. The APA is statutorily independent of the Army chain of command, which has no influence over its case management or decision-making process. The decision to prosecute is based upon its assessment of the evidence and of the realistic prospects of a conviction.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.2/6">Everyone is presumed innocent unless and until they are found guilty. The four servicemen and three ex-servicemen were provided with every assistance to enable them to put their case: a unit defending officer was provided for each of them and acted as their link with their defence team; they were each defended by a QC, funded by the Army criminal legal aid authority; and they were all afforded full welfare provision throughout the period up to and including the trial&mdash;and this continues.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.2/7">The Judge Advocate General made it clear that he had no criticism of the Army prosecuting authority in bringing the case to trial. This court martial demonstrates the Army's commitment to transparency and accountability. It was held in open court, where it was open to full public scrutiny, and to the same standards of justice and independence that are present in the civilian justice system. All the parties and authorities involved, military and civilian, acted properly and in good faith.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.2/8">The British Army is not complacent. Following all operational commitments, a process of continuous and determined professional review is undertaken. The comments of the Judge Advocate General are being considered and a comprehensive review of the 3 Para trial is under way. In addition, the Army announced a review following the trial earlier this year of members of 1 Royal Regiment of Fusiliers. The review is being conducted on behalf of the Chief of the General Staff by a senior experienced officer and is looking at issues arising from concluded courts martial relating to deliberate acts of abuse. It will seek to learn lessons and look at wider issues emerging from trials and other reports, in order to safeguard and improve the Army's operational effectiveness. Any findings can be published only after all the courts martial have concluded, so publication is therefore likely to be some time in the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.2/9">This case has shown our determination to ensure that justice is done irrespective of the difficulties. We are very sensitive to the ordeal that these soldiers have been through&mdash;they have acted with dignity throughout and I hope that they will now be given respect and privacy to enable them to continue with their lives. More than 80,000 servicemen and women have served in Iraq&mdash;only a very small number of them have been accused of ill treatment of Iraqi civilians, and a number of those have already been cleared of any wrongdoing, as in this case. Our troops in Iraq continue to perform outstandingly, but they are not above the law.</p>

	<p pid="b.22.0/1">I thank the Minister for that reply. I understand that this is not an easy subject for him and that many of its aspects do not fall directly within his area of responsibility, but he is the Minister with responsibility for the armed forces, and he is responsible for their morale. He, like me, pays frequent and heartfelt tribute to our armed forces&mdash;he has done so again today, and I join him in doing so. Indeed, it is for that reason that I have put down this question because, as he knows, the prosecution of those seven soldiers had a serious effect on morale, and the collapse of the prosecutions has created even greater uncertainty and doubts in the mind of our armed forces.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.0/2">Of course, where a crime has been committed and the evidence substantiates it, it must be prosecuted, but that was clearly not the case here. In his decision to stop the cases, the Judge Advocate General described the investigation of the case as &quot;inadequate&quot; and much of the evidence as &quot;inherently weak or vague&quot;. He referred to witnesses having</p>
	<p pid="b.22.0/3" class="indent">&quot;colluded to exaggerate and lie&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="b.22.0/4">and he referred to witnesses seeking &quot;blood money&quot;. The bringing of this case therefore raises some serious questions. Who decided that these prosecutions should proceed? Was the Attorney-General involved in that decision? Was a political overview sought and was one given? Who was paying for the witnesses and who decided what they should be paid and for what?</p>
	<p pid="b.22.0/5">We need urgent answers to those questions. They also form part of a wider concern about the serious damage to morale arising from doubtless well-intentioned but ultimately unsubstantiated prosecutions such as these and that against Trooper Williams, which also collapsed earlier this year. We must never forget that our forces are operating in a highly dangerous and hostile environment where confidence is essential and where nearly 100 of our soldiers have lost their lives. They cannot operate effectively with the spectre of the lawyer metaphorically looking over their shoulder.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.0/6">Does the Minister agree that such prosecutions are highly damaging to recruitment and retention, both of which are under severe pressure? Does he also agree that they highlight a failure of his Department's duty of care towards service personnel? In that regard, can he throw some light on a report in yesterday's edition of <i>The Observer</i> that the Secretary of State will this week unveil a so-called action plan to offer support and counselling to those facing such prosecutions? Will he undertake to initiate a full review of how such prosecutions are undertaken?</p>
	<p pid="b.22.0/7">Does the Minister agree that such prosecutions undermine the whole concept of mission command upon which the British Army operates? Does he share my sympathy for the view expressed in another place by Lord Boyce, the most recently retired Chief of the Defence Staff? He said that</p>
	<p pid="b.22.0/8" class="indent">&quot;The Armed Forces are under legal siege&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-14">14 July 2005</phrase>; Vol. 673, c. 1236.]</p>
	<p pid="b.22.0/9">He went on to say that they are being pushed in a direction where necessary operational military orders could be deemed improper or legally unsound. The battlefield is not a court of law and actions often have to be taken spontaneously. Is it not vital that in the proper pursuit of justice we must never compromise the ability of our armed forces to fight and to win?</p>

	<p pid="b.28.6/1">Let me calm it down a wee bit. The hon. Gentleman says that he has military experience, but I think I am right in saying that he has never had any ministerial experience. I conclude from his comments that had he been a Minister on this occasion, he would have interfered in the due process of law. That is not the standard that applies in this country, and I do not think Conservative Front Benchers are saying the same, although some of them have been through it.&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> The Attorney-General will answer for himself. His is the highest opinion that can be sought.</p>
	<p pid="b.28.6/2">The Army Prosecuting Authority is dealing with some heavyweight issues, which has excited <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1699" name="Nicholas Winterton">the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Sir Nicholas Winterton)</phrase>. It is right that it should have done so, but he has been led to the wrong conclusions. I think it appropriate for that independent authority to take the case to the Attorney-General, who is a ministerial superintendent of the APA. Independence is involved in that process. If the hon. Gentleman is saying that it is not involved, he will have to prove his case. The system has stood the test of time. It is still valid today, and I think that it will stand the test of time in the future.</p>

Clearly, as with any other criminal action, if that is indeed what it was, such an investigation could be subject to retrospective review. At any point, if new evidence arises, it is right that it is examined.</p>

	<p pid="b.32.6/1">I suggest that the right hon. Gentleman spend more time reading the Bill than the Sunday papers, because the Bill is designed to ensure that that does not happen. I am surprised to get such a lesson from the right hon. Gentleman, who, as the great believer in the market, should be arguing that a property-based taxation system should reflect the market value of properties. If he does not take that position, we can have an interesting debate on the role of markets in public life.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.6/2">We believe that the changes that I have set out represent not only a big challenge but a massive opportunity for local government and we believe that opportunity is most likely to be grasped if local government is able to focus on service delivery supported by financial stability. This is the context for the changes we are debating today.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.6/3">The Opposition gave <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1765" name="Jim Fitzpatrick">the Under-Secretary, my hon. Friend the Member for Poplar and Canning Town (Jim Fitzpatrick)</phrase>, the chance to set out our arguments and explain the Lyons inquiry in our recent debate on <phrase class="date" code="">19 October</phrase>. The Government appointed Sir Michael Lyons in July 2004 to carry out an independent inquiry into local government funding. He has made good progress with that remit and, over the summer, discussed with Ministers his view that robust recommendations on possible reforms to local government funding could not be made in isolation from proper consideration and understanding of the changing role of local government.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.6/4">It is in that context, and for that reason, that my right hon. Friends the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Deputy Prime Minister extended the terms of reference of Sir Michael's inquiry to consider and review the changing role of local government and to review how the Government's agenda for devolution and decentralisation could improve services, and, in the light of this, to consider how to manage pressures on local services. That was in addition to his existing remit to make proposals on the funding of local government.</p>

Gentleman's question, but if he said that while Sir Michael Lyons was willing to countenance up to a year's delay in revaluation but did not propose the postponement that we are proposing today, he is absolutely right; I do not seek to hide our decision behind the recommendation of Sir Michael Lyons.</p>
	<p pid="b.33.1/2">As I said when I announced our decision on <phrase class="date" code="">20 September</phrase>, we need a clear and complete picture of what we want local government to do before we tackle how it will be funded. In short, we must settle function before funding. As I also said on <phrase class="date" code="">20 September</phrase>, later this autumn Sir Michael will set out his preliminary thinking, drawing out the relationship of local government function to finance.

	<p pid="b.35.3/1">I think that the hon. Gentleman may be referring to the statement of <phrase class="date" code="">20 September</phrase>, which was repeated before the House on <phrase class="date" code="">10 October</phrase>. If he read on, he would see that we expect the Government to come forward with their views during the completion of the comprehensive spending review in the summer of 2007. As I said, that was made clear on <phrase class="date" code="">20 September</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.3/2">Although this is a short Bill, it may help the House if I explain its effects. First, it removes the requirement laid down by the Local Government Finance Act 1992 for the compilation of new lists on <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2007</phrase>. Clause 1(3) amends section 22B of the 1992 Act by removing the duty on the listing agency&mdash;in practice, that means the Valuation Office Agency&mdash;to compile a new valuation list to billing authorities in England on <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2007</phrase> and a draft of that list to be completed by <phrase class="date" code="">1 September</phrase> next year. We have already informed the House that the VOA has stopped work on the revaluation of domestic properties in England to prevent nugatory expenditure&mdash;and the provision formalises that position.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.3/3">Secondly, subsection (4) removes the requirement for subsequent revaluations on the 10th anniversary of the previous one, unless an earlier date has been specified by order. Until the Government have received and considered Sir Michael Lyons' final report, we cannot take a view on how frequently revaluation should occur and we therefore think it right that we should not be statutorily committed to revaluing on a rigid, predetermined cycle.</p>

	<p pid="b.36.0/1">I hear my hon. Friend's argument for postponement&mdash;I do not agree with it&mdash;but I do not understand the argument for deleting the provision for a 10-yearly cycle for revaluation. That was the subject of Government consultation in 1999&ndash;2000 and was the subject of a White Paper, which set out a commitment to a 10-year revaluation. As far as I know, Sir Michael Lyons has not been asked to comment on whether that revaluation cycle should change. I simply do not understand the Minister's logic for cancelling a provision for regulation revaluations.</p>

	<p pid="b.36.2/1">He is, indeed, my very good friend and he speaks with a great deal of authority on these matters. He will know more than anyone else that at the time of the 2002 Bill there was a great deal of discussion about the requisite period. As it happens, and ironically in the current context, the Conservative spokesman in the other place wanted to reduce from 10 to five years, the&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1711" name="Caroline Spelman">The hon. Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman)</phrase> is shouting from a sedentary position. We are all disappointed that she is not speaking today and that she has left the task to others; she may be winding up the debate, but I do not know.</p>
	<p pid="b.36.2/2">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1602" name="Nick Raynsford">my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford)</phrase> knows, there was considerable discussion about the period and we think that it is right to keep the flexibility created by the clause.</p>
	<p pid="b.36.2/3">Finally, the Bill replaces those two provisions for revaluation, for at least 10-yearly intervals, with a power for the Secretary of State to specify the date on which a new valuation list must be compiled. Such orders will be subject to the House's affirmative resolution procedure. That was also the case in respect of the Local Government Finance Act 1992, which created the council tax in the first place. For the sake of completeness, clause 2 simply provides for the short title of the Bill and for its extent.</p>
	<p pid="b.36.2/4">I can bring the House up to date with progress at the Valuation Office Agency, which was responsible for carrying out the revaluation. Immediately following the announcement, the VOA took steps to reduce ongoing expenditure and to reshape the agency to fit the new situation. Some 420 staff employed as casuals or on fixed term contracts will have left the agency by the <phrase class="date" code="">18 November</phrase>. A voluntary early departure scheme has been announced, with some 600 staff expected to depart between March and June 2006. Coupled with natural wastage, the total reduction is expected to amount to some 1,250 staff.</p>
	<p pid="b.36.2/5">As we set out on <phrase class="date" code="">20 September</phrase>, there will be significant short-term savings for the Government from not proceeding with revaluation. However, the Government have been explicit that &pound;45 million of the &pound;60 million spent so far is a prudent investment in modern and efficient working practices. The VOA will ensure that the country has an up-to-date, electronic property database, available as a source of accurate data.</p>

	<p pid="b.37.2/1">In respect of the first question, the hon. Gentleman had an exchange with my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich on <phrase class="date" code="">19 October</phrase> in which they agreed that it was important to continue with the procedure under which if people move and it is apparent that the property has had a significant change in value, it is reflected in the banding. For that and other reasons, it is sensible to have an up-to-date and efficiently working system.</p>
	<p pid="b.37.2/2">In respect of the precise costs, I have made it clear to the hon. Gentleman that some 1,250 jobs will be lost as a result of the changes.

	<p pid="b.37.4/1">The right hon. Gentleman will know, as a former Secretary of State, that the omniscience of the ODPM stretches in many directions, but not in the direction of predicting court cases.</p>
	<p pid="b.37.4/2">I wish to take a moment now to explain how the Bill will not in any way affect the approach being taken in the devolved Administrations, contrary to the assertions of some Opposition Members. In our debate on <phrase class="date" code="">19 October</phrase>, much was said about Wales, but executive local government functions in Wales are, rightly, devolved. We have consulted the National Assembly of Wales on the subject matter of the Bill and it has indicated that it is content that it has no effect on provisions relating to Wales.</p>
	<p pid="b.37.4/3">The position in Northern Ireland is very different from that in England, not least because local government has continued to be funded through a domestic rating system instead of the council tax. The House will recall that Northern Ireland did not have the benefit of the poll tax. The Northern Ireland Executive commissioned a review of rating policy in 2000 and that has now led to the publishing of a draft Order in Council, which is currently subject to a consultation process.</p>

	<p pid="b.38.3/1">I hope that the House will agree that I have been generous in taking interventions and I now wish to proceed. I look forward to hearing hon. Members' contributions later.</p>
	<p pid="b.38.3/2">For the sake of completeness, I should also remind the House of the position in Scotland. The Scottish Executive commissioned its own independent review of local government finance in 2004. The review committee consulted on options earlier this year and will publish its report in the summer.</p>
	<p pid="b.38.3/3">In debate with my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1449" name="Eric Pickles">the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles)</phrase> said:</p>
	<p pid="b.38.3/4" class="indent">&quot;We recognise the need periodically to revalue properties for the purpose of council tax . . . We support the revaluation being made on a regular and predictable basis.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-07">7 January 2003</phrase>; Vol. 397, c. 64&ndash;5.]</p>
	<p pid="b.38.3/5">No one should accuse the hon. Gentleman of changing his mind too quickly, because two years later, he said:</p>
	<p pid="b.38.3/6" class="indent">&quot;Any council tax system inevitably requires some form of revaluation.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-02">2 February 2005</phrase>; Vol. 430, c. 929.]</p>
	<p pid="b.38.3/7">A sensible man.</p>
	<p pid="b.38.3/8">The hon. Gentleman's boss, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1711" name="Caroline Spelman">the hon. Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman)</phrase>, said that</p>
	<p pid="b.38.3/9" class="indent">&quot;a property-based tax must take account of changes in the value of the property.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-02">2 March 2005</phrase>; Vol. 431, c. 983.]</p>
	<p pid="b.38.3/10">Her boss, the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;for another few days at least&mdash;said on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-20">20 February 2005</phrase>: &quot;You have to revalue.&quot; So the Opposition support the principle of revaluation; nothing could be clearer. But in April they decided to argue for postponement. Fair enough.</p>
	<p pid="b.38.3/11">The Leader of Opposition was clear: on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-20">20 April</phrase>, he told &quot;Sky News&quot; that his new policy was a postponement of revaluation, not a cancellation. For the avoidance of doubt, he added &quot;for the first Parliament&quot;, when he was questioned about the delay. So I confidently expected the Opposition to support the Bill. After all, they want to be a mature Opposition. They have been told by their young pretender to remember that actions speak louder than words. They have vowed not to oppose measures simply for the sake of opposition.</p>
	<p pid="b.38.3/12">What could be simpler than voting for a Bill to postpone revaluation? They might even have claimed that we had stolen their policy.But I had overestimated the people who go by the title of Her Majesty's official Opposition. They still take the title literally: they oppose everything. They are addicted to opposition and repulsed by common sense. No wonder that John Stuart Mill called them the stupid party&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="b.41.5/1">No, I am not in favour of the revaluation, and I cannot imagine, given all the fuss, why the hon. Gentleman could possibly have been deluded into believing that I would. I apologise to him for reading out those pieces, but I wanted to bring home to the right hon. Gentleman that no one thinks that his method makes any sense. Those who wanted a revaluation think that the Minister is not doing a good job and so do those who did not want one. He has managed to unite the nation in believing that he has made a bad decision.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.5/2">We are not persuaded of the need for revaluation. The purpose of a revaluation is to correct grossly disproportionate movements of the housing market compared with the last revaluation, but house prices are currently converging relative to the last revaluation. As we argued when the council tax was introduced in 1992, a system of bandings means that there is no need for regular or frequent revaluations. The only reason why Labour wants to revalue and re-band the council tax is to tax the uplift in property values that has taken place since the early 1990s.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.5/3">We oppose the plans for higher taxes on hard-working families and pensioners. The revaluation has already taken place in Wales, so we will move amendments in Committee to continue the transitional relief and thus stop further tax hikes next year, after the relief is phased out.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.5/4">As the Minister has said, the Bill essentially does three things. It removes the requirement for a new valuation by <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2007</phrase>&mdash;we agree with that. It will take away the 10-year rule for revaluation, on which we agree with the right hon. Gentleman. Finally, it will empower the Secretary of State to determine when a revaluation should take place, with which we do not agree. As Labour Members will testify, the Library has produced an excellent brief that details the problems that have occurred because of revaluation in the past and all the problems due to the postponement of revaluation, especially. Given the nature of the council tax and the bandings, we think that the most sensible thing would be for a decision to be taken on the Floor of the House&mdash;by way of primary legislation&mdash;each time revaluation needs to takes place. That is important because such a decision should be taken not at the whim of the Secretary of State, but by Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="b.43.4/1">My hon. Friend comes to these matters with considerable knowledge and I entirely agree with his point about the balance of funding. If I am allowed to make a little progress, I shall come precisely to that point.</p>
	<p pid="b.43.4/2">It is worth reminding the House that in 1998 the Command Paper, &quot;Modern Government: In Touch with the People&quot;, examined the popularity of the council tax and in clear and unambiguous words endorsed the tax by saying:</p>
	<p pid="b.43.4/3" class="indent">&quot;The council tax is working well as a local tax. It has been widely accepted and is generally very well understood&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.43.4/4">Yet, after seven short years, there is a very different public perception of the tax. That is best summed up by Sir Michael Lyons in his letter to stakeholders on <phrase class="date" code="">20 September</phrase>, which stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.43.4/5" class="indent">&quot;Council Tax has suffered from problems relating to its rate of increase and perceived unfairness&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.43.4/6">That is understandable when the Government cap councils that have increased council tax by a few pence a week and ignore others that have introduced increases many times that size. It is understandable when pensioners are being thrown into prison. It is understandable when a third of the increase in the basic state pension has been taken up in higher council tax for a typical pensioner.</p>

	<p pid="b.48.0/1">I regret to say that I cannot support the Second Reading of the Bill. Having said that, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1449" name="Eric Pickles">the speech by the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles)</phrase> was extraordinary. Before he got carried away in his flights of floral fantasy, he said that he agreed with the postponement of the revaluation and with the removal of the obligation to carry out revaluation on a regular 10-yearly cycle. I would have wholeheartedly agreed with him on both counts, but he does not appear to want my support.</p>
	<p pid="b.48.0/2">Everyone who has considered this issue starts from the simple proposition that if we have a system of local government taxation based on local property values, those values must be revisited periodically. No one has argued credibly that the current values based on 1991 levels should remain the basis of council tax for evermore.</p>

	<p pid="b.51.0/1">I am interested in the direction that this conversation is taking. Is my right hon. Friend aware that the Minister recently said that property-based taxes were introduced at a time when services&mdash;such as water, electricity and sewerage services&mdash;were based on property, while services today, including education and social services, are based on people? Do the Minister's comments suggest that the reason for the delayed revaluation might be that, in the minds of Ministers, there might not be any need for a property tax in future?</p>

	<p pid="b.51.3/1">I would like to make some progress. I have just given way, and I do not want to take up too much more time. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will bear with me.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.3/2">What are the consequences of the Bill? We know that the basis of the council tax&mdash;the 1991 values&mdash;will become increasingly remote from reality as we get further away from the current valuation date. Having to calculate notional 1991 values for every new property built is nonsense. As I mentioned in our previous debate on the subject, some areas of my constituency were entirely void industrial wastelands 15 years ago, and anything built there would have had no value at all, so, now, it is slightly odd to create notional 1991 values for properties built as a result of that area's regeneration. That pattern is replicated all over the country. In addition, as the former Minister responsible for local government, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1820" name="David Curry">the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry)</phrase> rightly highlighted, there are already provisions for revaluation of some properties where those properties change hands and there has been a material change in value. The anomalies will therefore get worse.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.3/3">The overwhelming majority of properties, of course, have increased significantly in value since 1991&mdash;by some 216 per cent. on average, according to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. That is part of the problem. Many people who are not familiar with the arcane nature of the council tax process can easily be frightened into believing that because their property's value has increased dramatically over the past 14 years, they will be clobbered by revaluation. That is fuelled by unscrupulous Opposition scaremongering, of which we saw a great deal in the run-up to the general election, and of which we have heard a great deal more today. That does not help to foster a serious and rational debate about the proper system of finance for local government.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.3/4">As the Government have made repeatedly clear from 2001 onwards, however, the purpose of revaluation is not to increase the council tax yield but simply to bring values up to date, so that the tax is based on modern values rather than values that are increasingly remote from reality. Were the bands to be increased in line with house price inflation since 1991, most households would find themselves in the same band as before, with no increased liability for council tax. I have seen no recent Government estimates for the numbers of households whose banding would either increase or decrease under a revaluation. My right hon. Friend the Minister of Communities and Local Government has assured me that no new Government estimates have been prepared for Ministers since the election. The only official figures are those prepared previously&mdash;before the April 2005 valuation date. I am a little surprised that new estimates have not been prepared to inform Ministers' decision to postpone the revaluation, but in the absence of up-to-date official figures, we can only go on the evidence produced by well-informed commentators such as the RICS and the Halifax building society. Both indicate that the majority of households would have remained in the same band as a result of revaluation, and also suggest that more households would have gained than would have lost.</p>

	<p pid="b.53.4/1">I merely said that, in the absence of official figures, evidence from the RICS and the Halifax implied if a revaluation were conducted with no increase in yield&mdash;if house-price values were simply uprated in line with average house-price inflation since 1991&mdash;the overall impact would be neutral, but the number of households that would gain would be larger than the number of losers. As the figures show, that is because there would be rather more gainers in the lower house-price bands, and a disproportionate number of losers in the higher bands.</p>
	<p pid="b.53.4/2">That brings me to my final point. If those figures are valid, it appears that the Bill will be regressive. It will result in more households on lower incomes paying more than they should because of a failure to revalue, while those in higher income bands and occupying more highly priced properties, who would possibly have paid more because the value of their properties has risen, will be spared. I cannot support a measure which seems to me to have no logic and no principle behind it, and which will have a regressive impact. It saddens me to say this, but I will not be able to support the Government tonight.</p>

	<p pid="b.57.1/1">No, I am about to finish.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.1/2">It is rather like asking a vegetarian whether they would prefer steak or bacon. The Bill should be withdrawn and replaced with something sensible that tackles the system of local government finance. The Government will not do that, but we will, when we win in 2009. So while we wait for the power to introduce something different, we see no point in having a revaluation. It would be a costly waste of money; as we have heard, &pound;60 million has been wasted on it already. It would be a total waste of time, given that we intend, when we are in government, to scrap the tax anyway and replace it with local income tax.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.1/3">I shall not go though all of the arguments again, because we have heard how much better a local income tax would be. We have heard also that we would localise business rates and make sure that local government has a proper system of finance. Even if hon. Members disagree with me about local income tax, they should agree that this whole revaluation fiasco is merely an excuse to defer once again the crucial question of a decent financial settlement for local government. Transforming local finance is key to transforming public services. We should not waste our energy fighting over revaluation just because it is an easy political game. We should invest our energies in solving the real problems: that the council tax is unfair, and that local government is held to ransom by the current funding system.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.1/4">Every minute that we fritter away on revaluation is a minute that we do not spend trying to solve those underlying problems. So I think that I had better shut up and sit down.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-11-07b.59.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1780" speakername="David Borrow" colnum="59"  time="017:35:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051107/debtext/51107-18.htm#51107-18_spnew6">
	<p pid="b.59.0/1">I come back to the experience of regular revaluations for business rates. When revaluations took place in the 1990s, some parts of the country experienced booms in property rents and certain classes of property had large increases in comparison with others. Provided that we have regular revaluations and some sort of transitional relief in place, we have a way of coping with the problem. We do not want to find ourselves in a position where we cannot have a revaluation because the change is so massive.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.0/2">I remember looking into property values in central Liverpool in the early 1980s. At that time, rates were based on rental values of the early 1970s and many business properties in the area were attracting more in rates than in rent. At the same time, there were tenants in central London paying 10 or 20 times as much in rent as they were in rates. That reflected the change in the economy during the period. It was also reflected in changes in domestic property values, albeit to a lesser extent.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.0/3">Another important problem with putting off property revaluations is that they have an impact on Government grants. The longer we delay revaluations, the longer it will be before Government grants reflect economic differences between one area and another. Liverpool got hammered in the 1980s with cuts in services and real financial problems. Had there been regular revaluations throughout the 1970s and 1980s, I suspect that Liverpool city council's budget position would have been much stronger in the 1980s because the revaluations would have reflected the recession in the city and would have fed through into the amount of Government grant awarded. We never did the revaluations, so that never happened.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.0/4">I shall vote in the same Lobby as the Minister tonight, though I was tempted by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1449" name="Eric Pickles">the appeal of the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles)</phrase> to vote in his Lobby&mdash;until he spoke. I hope that when the Minister sums up, he will provide some reassurance that we are not talking about a long delay.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.0/5">I want to restate a point that I made in an earlier intervention&mdash;that the reason for having a revaluation in 2007, as against a business rate revaluation in 2005, was to even out the work load of the Valuation Office Agency, the valuation tribunals and all those involved in the valuation of rating and council tax. The danger is that we could end up with a revaluation of council tax not in 2011 but in 2013&mdash;20 years after the first council tax valuation. It is important that the revaluation of council tax ties in with the reform of local government finance because of the revaluation's impact on the amount of Government grant. Those two aspects need to be tied together under a new regime, rather than introduced separately. The timing is crucial.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.0/6">I want to comment on the views of Her Majesty's Opposition. On the one hand, they complain that domestic property prices have rocketed, with huge increases all over the place, so that a revaluation will mean some people paying a huge amount more. On the other hand, they say that there has been hardly any difference, so we do not need a revaluation. Both those arguments cannot be right. I have served on Standing Committees in which Conservative Front-Bench spokesmen have said that there should be regular revaluations. There is plenty of documentation in the Library about the occasions on which Tory Front Benchers have argued in favour of having regular revaluations. Indeed, the Front Benchers currently accept the need for them, albeit as long into the future as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.0/7">The danger is that, if we continue to put off council tax revaluation, whoever is in power in five or 10 years' time will be tempted to do a Michael Heseltine and we shall end up with council tax being unsustainable, so that it has to be ditched completely and something else dreamed up in its place. Let us do it properly. I want some assurances from the Minister that the postponement will be a short and sensible one, not one born of political expediency.</p>

	<p pid="b.60.0/1">This is a grubby little Bill that reflects a very English mess. If we build new houses&mdash;and the Deputy Prime Minister wishes to build very many new houses&mdash;we will all have to pretend that they were built in 1991 for the purpose of valuation and a fictional value will be associated with them. Let us suppose that I buy one of those houses and put on a conservatory and a granny annexe&mdash;although they are unlikely to be big enough to allow the latter addition&mdash;and, a couple of years later, I sell it. It will be revalued for council tax purposes and will probably go up a band. Let us suppose that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1602" name="Nick Raynsford">the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford)</phrase> lived next door and had decided to spend the rest of his life in his house, so he had added a conservatory, a granny annexe and an extremely well appointed garden shed. He would pay less council tax, even though he had a much more valuable asset.</p>
	<p pid="b.60.0/2">There are between 1.6 and 1.8 million house sales a year in Britain, or some 34,000 a week. Even allowing for sales of properties to which no substantive change has been made, a relatively high proportion of houses have been revalued&mdash;some more than once, depending on property turnover in the area&mdash;and that creates anomalies. Across the country, people ask, &quot;Why on earth is he paying the same as I am? He has a much bigger house.&quot; My colleagues talk about the battles and the discontent that a revaluation would bring, but we should remember how much seething discontent can be caused by failing to have a revaluation and the continuation of the anomalies.</p>
	<p pid="b.60.0/3">I know that you do not wish us to trespass beyond Offa's Dyke, Madam Deputy Speaker, but the situation in Wales is interesting. There was a revaluation in Wales because the Welsh authorities decided that they wanted to get more revenue out of the system. It was not revenue neutral, because they set out to make it into a tax-raising venture, which was very successful. However, one consequence of the present situation is that the council tax will come under increasing strain. Local government finance has a wonderful capacity to start as a dot on the horizon no bigger than a man's fist and grow to emerge as a subject of colossal emotive and totemic power. We have hit just such a rough patch in the last couple of years.</p>
	<p pid="b.60.0/4">The Minister will say&mdash;I remember saying it myself and the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich also said it&mdash;that council tax yield is not the same as average council tax. Of course it is not, because more houses are built and houses are revalued, but it does provide a good rough indication of likely council tax increases. We are now destined to spend the next five or six years going through the same sequence of minatory arguments, including threats of capping and blaming the local authority. The silliest argument of all pretends that the amount of money a council raises has nothing to do with the nature of the property in its area, as though somehow there was a curious moral perversity in the fact that Westminster manages to raise more money than Burnley on the basis of its council tax stock.</p>
	<p pid="b.60.0/5">More and more pressure will be felt because public expenditure is coming under strain and chickens are coming home to roost&mdash;as I forecast last year. There are reasons for a postponement for one year, and Sir Michael Lyons accepted that that was reasonable. For example, the changes in education funding and the introduction of three-year budgets make it reasonable to pause to see how all the bits will fit together. However, Ministers have suggested that we wait until there is no turbulence in house prices. What a wonderful notion. After all, the Chancellor of the Exchequer set up the Barker review to discuss why we had permanent turbulence in house prices. The link to structures is one of the most grotesque non sequiturs that I have come across, even from this Government. Ironically, we may have been living through a period when price disparities were closing to some extent. Select parts of my constituency are approaching the levels of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1824" name="David Heath">the south, but as the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath)</phrase> would say, the variation regionally, and even locally, can be very significant indeed.</p>

	<p pid="b.61.1/1">From my reading of the Sunday papers I understand that the Cotswolds are no longer what they used to be, because all sorts of fashionable people who own large properties in London, which are no doubt at the top of the band, have gone there and opened up little bistros. One perfectly reasonable answer for a person who is asset-rich but cash-poor, which is the situation of that lady, would be to allow her to roll up her council tax into the final estate. There is nothing inherently unreasonable about that notion, and it is worth examining.</p>

	<p pid="b.62.1/1">If we have a property-based tax, a remorseless logic follows from it, which is that properties must reflect market value, albeit with some delay. The hon. Lady went into review of review of review. I thought that there was a Liberal Democrat review of their local government finance policy, but it appears to have passed her by. The Liberal Democrats did comprehensively badly in the south-east of England and a significant explanation for that may be the amount that bills would have hit home for property owners in the region.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/2">It is cloud-cuckoo land to think that we will have a period of no turbulence. Of course, there is a period of minimum political turbulence coming up&mdash;roughly in 2007, funnily enough, just when the revaluation was timed to hit. A Government who usually have an unfailing eye for timing appear to have missed that. The real problem is that the Government have discovered that there will be losers. They do not like losers; we cannot have losers under a Labour Government. Everybody has to be a winner all the time at the coconut shy. However, it is possible to deal with that, as I shall say in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/3">We are heading for conflict and much barren argument. Inevitably, old age pensioners, the canon or deacon of somewhere or other or belligerent elderly ladies will turn up at our surgeries&mdash;we wish that our agent could spot them in advance&mdash;all determined to set the world to rights. I wonder how much it will cost the taxpayer by the time they have gone through that long process, but they will manage to avoid paying fifty seven pounds, four shillings and threepence ha'penny, or whatever the amount happens to be.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/4">There is a way through, however. It is not rocket science, although I hate to use such well-worn expressions; I do not do rocket science as anyone familiar with my difficulties in handling the video will know. The first solution would be to link revaluation and re-banding. They go together; they are the salt and pepper of the process. Secondly, it would be perfectly possible to limit changes to a single band. In my part of the world, which might be described as regionally depressed, there are none the less areas that might be described by the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich as hot spots&mdash;Harrogate is one of them. We could stop that; the process does not have to be too sophisticated. There could simply be a shift of one band.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/5">I would add an upper band. Madonna has a predilection for large houses in London and large country estates. I find it charming that someone should wish to adopt the English way of life so comprehensively and expensively, but I see no reason why she should not pay an extra bob or two at the top of the band in London for that privilege. We could also add a lower band, to catch the trailer parks or areas in industrial east Lancashire that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1780" name="David Borrow">the hon. Member for South Ribble (Mr. Borrow)</phrase> will know about, where there is a long history of deprivation and empty property. It is possible to manage all those things.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/6">The sensible thing is to drop all <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1449" name="Eric Pickles">the fancy stuff. My hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles)</phrase> was busy detailing all the sophisticated knobs and whistles that might be attached to the process. We should forget all that. The original valuation was simple, and we should keep the current one as simple as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/7">I want to return business rates to local government, with the proper safeguards. We only need to read the snappy little document put out by the ODPM to realise that when council tax was introduced in 1993&ndash;94 business rates represented 28 per cent. of local government revenue and council tax 21 per cent. However, the estimates for the current year are that the figures will be 21 per cent. for business rates and 25 per cent. for council tax. The position has been inverted. Business has had an easy ride over the past decade compared to council tax. It is possible to set up safeguards that would reassure business about abusive increases. Furthermore, we might just as well recognise the reality of education expenditure and take the education block back into central Government. That would pretty well solve the problem. We would have gone an enormously long way towards creating a sustainable council tax and we would have returned to local government a much wider range of local resources over which it had control.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/8">The history of local government funding is dismal. It is a long tale of prevarication and delay. I once described the search for a sustainable local government funding system as like the search for the north-west passage. The problem was that, first, it did not exist and, secondly, there was a terrible danger of getting stuck in the pack ice. The Government are stuck in the pack ice. If they are not careful, council tax protests, difficulty in funding public expenditure and the annual demand for some sort of bung to make things easier will cause the structure of the vessel to be crushed by the pack ice. The Government will find themselves in a wholly justified mess, which I shall rue from the point of view of my constituents but applaud in seeing the Government get their just deserts.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/9">The worst thing is that it will be 2011 at the earliest before anything like a proper package can be introduced. There will be a long interregnum. There may be light at the end of the tunnel, but the light is entirely at the discretion of the Minister and it is a hell of a long tunnel. The light is faint and flickering and as the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich says, the Government have taken away a proposal for action and replaced it with a void. They have removed the prospect for any long-term action.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/10">I am afraid that that is all of a piece with the Government's actions. We have backed away from a referendum on the European constitution. We have backed away from a sensible outcome for public sector pensions. We have backed away on local government funding. I just hope that the Government back away from their proposals on terrorism, the one thing that they should back away from, but we see that the Prime Minister intends to remain obdurate.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/11">The Bill is silly. It will not get anybody out of a mess. The Government have exchanged what might have been a brief spurt of indignation for the certainty of five years of increasingly violent guerrilla warfare, which they cannot win and that will continue to gnaw away at them. It needs only one little old lady to chain herself to the proverbial railings, to turn up before the magistrates, and the Government will be right back in the syndrome. The issue is totemic. The Government cannot win because they have deliberately chosen not even to try.</p>

	<p pid="b.65.2/1">Thank you for that guidance, Madam Deputy Speaker. I shall try, with your guidance in mind, to answer the question by relating it to the revaluation and the Lyons review of local government functions and finance. The reason for the delay is that, if we want to comply with those principles&mdash;I share some of my hon. Friend's fears&mdash;the council tax, which was set up in response to the crisis of a Conservative Government, simply will not bear the weight of democracy.</p>
	<p pid="b.65.2/2">We should also remember in considering the revaluation that, although our constituents get very excited about the council tax going up&mdash;I understand why and there is some unfairness in the system&mdash;I suspect that the Labour party's communications and propaganda do not make enough of the fact that we are still paying 2.5 percentage points of our VAT more than we were paying before 1993 to pay for the mess of the poll tax previously. I use that figure to illustrate the difficulties in using council tax, with its imperfections, as a basic tax to sustain local democracy. People in the streets are not angry that we are paying 17.5 per cent. VAT, rather than 15 per cent., but they are genuinely concerned about council tax because it increases year on year and a bill drops through the door. When Lyons looks at that, people's perceptions must be taken into account.</p>

	<p pid="b.70.2/1">I welcome this opportunity to speak about council tax, because the issue is causing immense concern in my constituency. I speak for many Basingstoke families and pensioners who face staggering increases in council tax as a result of the actions of this Government. Those families and pensioners would face almost untenable costs if the Government implemented their intention to revalue, so I support scrapping revaluation in its entirety.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.2/2">We are told that the proposal is revenue-neutral, but the actions towards householders in many other aspects of our lives suggest that the cynicism expressed from Opposition Members may be justified. If I may, I shall look at this issue from a slightly different angle&mdash;from that of our constituents. A house is a home where we raise our families and live our lives. If we are fortunate enough to own our own home, our families are offered a certain level of security. This Government are using our homes as another way to punish hard-working families for doing the best for their children and to punish pensioners in their retirement.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.2/3">House-price inflation does not deliver an additional income to householders. It does not put an additional pressure on local services, and as we have heard today the relative level of house prices has not changed regionally for a decade. Under this Government, house-price inflation has been seen as an opportunity for an additional back-door tax on pensioners and hard-working families. Council tax revaluation is just the latest in a long line of such measures.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.2/4">The Government are happy to recognise an increase in property values when it comes to council tax, but not when it comes to inheritance tax. They have continually failed to raise inheritance tax thresholds to reflect house price increases, and in the process have added about a &pound;1 billion tax take to the Chancellor's coffers. Under Labour, stamp duty has tripled in my constituency, with the stamp duty bill for an average detached house being almost &pound;4,000. In Basingstoke, stamp duty is slapped on even the average flat that would be within reach of a first-time buyer. One in three children aged 10 today will be able to own their own home in the future. Contrast that with the last Conservative Government, who helped 2 million people get on the housing ladder under right to buy. The Government have declared war on our home owners of the present and the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.2/5">Delaying revaluation will leave the sword of Damocles hanging over the heads of pensioners and families who have already been penalised enough for doing the right thing, working hard to provide a safe and secure environment for themselves and their families. The Government have tried to paint a different picture and claim that revaluation will be revenue neutral, but that assertion has been blown out of the water by what has happened in Wales, as we have heard today.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-11-07b.73.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1828" speakername="Alan Whitehead" colnum="73"  time="018:38:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051107/debtext/51107-22.htm#51107-22_spnew5">
	<p pid="b.73.0/1">We have a rather bizarre debate. On the one hand, the Government are introducing a Bill to postpone revaluation, while stating that they want revaluation to take place. I hope that revaluation is postponed, rather than cancelled or kicked into the far-distant long grass, because it is an important part of continuing with a property-based tax. The Government are changing the 2003 Act in order to retain revaluation. The Opposition, on the other hand, have tabled a reasoned amendment opposing Second Reading, which would simply cause the revaluation to go ahead.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.0/2">If Conservative Members vote for the Opposition amendment tonight, they will vote for revaluation. There is no point in their shaking their heads: if Labour Members decide to go home rather than voting in the Chamber tonight and the Conservatives by some mischance win the vote, the relevant section of the Local Government Finance Act 1992, as amended by the Local Government Act 2003, will stay in place and revaluation will go ahead. Furthermore, no one can stop revaluation going ahead in those circumstances, because the provision is on the statute book.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.0/3">Conservative Members must be careful. My party does not do this kind of thing, but if a &quot;Focus&quot; leaflet were produced stating, &quot;Local Conservatives vote for revaluation&quot;, it would be perfectly fair. &quot;Focus&quot; leaflets are not always fair, but the example I have described would be. Conservative Members, who are looking rather glum, would be well advised to get their own statement out explaining the true reason why they voted for a revaluation that they do not want.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.0/4">The Conservative party does not want revaluation&mdash;not now, not ever&mdash;and it has boxed itself in by stating that it will cancel it. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1449" name="Eric Pickles">The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles)</phrase> made an extremely strange comment to the effect that he does not mean &quot;not ever&quot;, but, because property prices have converged, there is not a circumstance under which revaluation is necessary. If property prices were to deconverge, the Conservative party would presumably review its policy, but let us take its position on cancelling council tax revaluation as being fairly firm.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.0/5">In its local government manifesto in spring 2004, the Conservative party said that it will not introduce any new or higher bandings, so it is boxed in on revaluation and the present bandings. It has said that banding would be the only way in which local government could raise money under a Conservative Government, because it will block taxes other than council tax from entering the local government arena. It also made it clear in its local government manifesto 2004 that it is against local income tax and any other form of transfer tax, so it favours one unchanged, unrebanded tax based on 1992 property values, which is a strange policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.0/6">One of the problems with the Conservative policy of not rebanding is that, as other hon. Members have said, a council tax base that is not revalued will drift further and further away from actual property values over a period of time. The Conservative Opposition want to enter government with a tax that progressively bears less and less relation to the actual value of property. If one were cynical&mdash;as I have said, that is not my position&mdash;one would say that that policy would serve some people rather well, because, assuming that house prices continue to inflate, as taxes drift further and further away from real property values, so a larger and larger number of people will be in a band in which no one pays any more council tax, regardless of increases in property values. Perhaps the thinking is driven by the political party that people in those bands tend to support.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.0/7">As a method of securing a flat tax that is unrelated to real value&mdash;we have heard about flat taxes in recent European elections&mdash;the Conservative proposition may be interesting, but in reality the situation is more complicated than that. Over a period of time, high property prices will mean not only that the highest band fails to differentiate between properties in certain parts of the country, but that different sets of flat taxes apply in different parts of the country, because property values will continue to rise at different rates.</p>

	<p pid="b.76.3/1">The hon. Gentleman made some interesting and thoughtful remarks about maintaining the position of council tax as a prime tax for local government&mdash;there are many reasons why that should be so&mdash;without some of the toxic side effects that continue to be associated with it. However, his views contrast significantly with the official position of his Front Benchers, which is to do nothing whatsoever and keep council tax exactly as it is.</p>
	<p pid="b.76.3/2">Interestingly, the Liberal Democrats propose to vote with the Government. I am delighted about that, but they are doing so from an entirely different perspective. In a debate that took place a little while ago, I suggested that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1445" name="Sarah Teather">the policy set out by the hon. Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather)</phrase> could be compared to Chairman Mao's great leap forward. In 1918, Lenin said that he supported the then Labour leader, Arthur Henderson, like a rope supports a hanging man. It seems that the Liberal Democrats plan to support the Government tonight because they do not want a revaluation in 2007, or ever. They want something entirely different&mdash;a local income tax.</p>
	<p pid="b.76.3/3">We do not want a long discussion about local income tax, because that is not what we are here for. However, it is widely recognised that it would be impossible for 434 billing authorities to attempt to collect a local income tax that is levied at a different rate from the national rate of income tax. Some people would be resident within the geographical area from which the tax is being levied, some would not be resident, and some would be sometimes resident and sometimes not.</p>

	<p pid="b.78.1/1">The hon. Gentleman makes an important point, but if he examines those subsections carefully, he will find that, unlike his belief, they are not closely connected.</p>
	<p pid="b.78.1/2">I was about to concur largely with the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon about making council tax work. That is an important element that we need to consider when we examine revaluation.</p>
	<p pid="b.78.1/3">Much of the debate has been about bands, including whether we need new bands at the top or at the bottom, whether we should retain existing bands and whether revaluation, which would reband properties, leads to higher council tax. Hon. Members have commented on the fact that, unlike in Wales, rebanding in England could be revenue neutral, if one provided for circumstances in which that could be achieved.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-11-07b.78.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1828" speakername="Alan Whitehead" colnum="78"  time="018:38:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051107/debtext/51107-24.htm#51107-24_spnew5">
	<p pid="b.78.5/1">As the hon. Lady knows, the business rate revaluation has been based on its being followed by dampening mechanisms to take account of the differences in the way in which the rate works in various parts of the country. When there is a transition in value between various parts of the country, the dampening mechanism works to a better or lesser extent in different places to equalise as far as possible the effect of the revaluation over a period of time. However, if a dampening mechanism is introduced, it cannot necessarily ensure that there is no difference in yield because it works differently in different parts of the country, depending on the change that has occurred in the revaluation. A revaluation with a dampening mechanism cannot give a revenue-neutral, guaranteed yield in the way that the Government suggested could be done for council tax revaluation. I am sure that the hon. Lady has been greatly enlightened by what I have just said.</p>
	<p pid="b.78.5/2">When we consider bands and whether we need new ones, I want to ask whether we need them at all. The previous Conservative Government introduced bands in the Local Government Finance Act 1992. They were prepared in something of a hurry, on the erroneous understanding that they would ultimately get rid of revaluation. I believe that a system of points would be a fairer and better method of valuing properties than the current bands system. We would not then have the worry about moving between bands.</p>
	<p pid="b.78.5/3">Points would be given on the basis of a specific valuation. As we have heard, the Institute of Revenues Rating and Valuation has said that, if revaluation were to proceed, it would provide an individual valuation for each property. It would thus be relatively straightforward to move from individual valuation to a series of points rather than placing properties in a band. The total number of points that a local authority had would form the basis on which council tax could be levied. That would provide considerable certainty about the amount of money available for the local authority to levy council tax as part of its budget-making activity.</p>
	<p pid="b.78.5/4">Such a system would also mean, if combined with a change in the way in which councils set their council tax, that there would be no gearing effect. If, for example, one were to introduce a marginally variable core grant at the beginning of the process, set the council tax on the basis of points rather than bands, then compensate at the end of the process, one would simply not have the gearing effect. The way in which the settlement was brought about would effectively remove much of the concern about that effect.</p>
	<p pid="b.78.5/5">The right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon and the hon. Member for Brent, East both mentioned proposals to localise the business rate. It has been suggested that that should happen because it would introduce a greater degree of autonomy to councils in terms of the decisions that they make about their finances. If there were no gearing effect, however, that would be of less significance. However, the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon rightly pointed out that, since the business rate was introduced, with the intention that it should not be levied at above the rate of retail price inflation, the percentage of funding into the local government stream that the business rate has provided has gone down from about 27 per cent. to 22 per cent. If we had historically pitched the level of the business rate against increases in earnings rather than in prices, it would have been possible more or less to have kept up that proportion over a period of time. If we prospectively pitched the business rate against earnings rather than prices, it would re-equalise that proportion over time, so that it would continue to operate on a level basis, rather than falling continuously against the total proportion of moneys raised for local government and against the amount raised by council tax. That would resolve another problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.78.5/6">There are a number of measures in the Lyons review&mdash;or associated with it&mdash;that the Government could consider in the context of revaluation, over and above whether we revalue or not, which would bring back a council tax whose operation was significantly refreshed. That is the potential prize that lies ahead of us, assuming that we consider that council tax should continue to be the main device whereby local tax is raised. If, as a result of this process, we achieve a council tax that reflects more marginally on people's concerns about the tax bill landing on the carpet, that relates more fairly in terms of its effects on the rise of property prices and to the actual amount that people pay, and that is in line with the way in which the business rate works, we will have done a good job, so far as temporarily suspending the revaluation is concerned. If the tax comes back refreshed in that way, the question of revaluation will play a part in the process but it will not form most of the process. That would be a positive outcome from a decision that people in some quarters are calling a U-turn, and it could result in something good for future local government.</p>

	<p pid="b.80.0/1">It is a great pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1828" name="Alan Whitehead">the hon. Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead)</phrase>. I agreed with many of the points that he made at the beginning of his speech. Sadly, I did not agree with what he said about local income tax, but it seems that we shall have to take up that debate on another occasion.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.0/2">Two aspects of this debate are quite bizarre, one of which the hon. Gentleman mentioned. That was the fact that it seems very difficult for hon. Members to stick to the point of the debate. One reason for that is easily explained: it is difficult to separate valuation from the rest of local government finance. Some reference to those other matters is necessary in order to understand the decision that we face tonight.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.0/3">The other point is fascinating, and relates to the internal debate on the two sides of the House. It became increasingly difficult to tell whether a speaker was speaking from the Conservative side of the debate or from the Government side. A serious point lies behind that difficulty as well. There are inherent difficulties with the council tax, and both sides are finding it difficult to come to terms with that. It is the most regressive major tax in the Government's taxation armoury. Indeed, it causes the whole taxation system to be regressive: the top 20 per cent. pay less tax overall than the bottom 20 per cent. of the income distribution. We all have constituents who face extraordinary council tax bills. I have one who has to pay 10 per cent. of his income in council tax, which is an extraordinary figure. This leads to the conclusion that we have reached, which is that the whole council tax system ought to be abolished and replaced by a different system.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.0/4">My own position on the Bill is simple, and the hon. Member for Southampton, Test got close to identifying it. For me, revaluation is a pointless and expensive exercise that should be scrapped. It is pointless because the council tax is inherently unfair and should be replaced by a better tax, namely local income tax. It is expensive because it has already cost about &pound;60 million and is likely to cost another &pound;100 million, if not more. Those resources would be much better spent on almost any other aspect of local government expenditure. The Bill means that the Government will be in a position to call off this wasteful and pointless exercise, and I therefore support it in principle. I would, however, like to see some changes made to it in Committee, and I shall mention at least one of them later.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.0/5">First, however, I want to challenge the Conservatives' position on the Bill, which is puzzling. Their amendment says that the House should decline to give the Bill a Second Reading because it does not cancel the council tax revaluation. However, as the hon. Member for Southampton, Test said, we all know that the Government will use the power that the Bill will grant to call off the 2007 revaluation. The current law is clear: there is an obligation to hold a revaluation in 2007 under the terms of the Local Government Act 2003. If the Bill were to be defeated tonight, therefore, that would remain the law and the 2007 revaluation would continue.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.0/6">The Conservatives' position is puzzling in another way. I differ from the hon. Member for Southampton, Test, at this point, because the Second Reading debate of the Bill that became the Local Government Finance Act 1992 shows that it was always thought that revaluation would be necessary at some point under the council tax system. That Second Reading debate makes fascinating reading, and I recommend it to all hon. Members, especially for the remarks by Labour Members who were in favour of something called &quot;fair rates&quot;&mdash;a concept that seems to have disappeared completely&mdash;and for <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1810" name="David Blunkett">the views of the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett)</phrase> and the then Member for Dagenham, who held fascinating views on the invasion of privacy that would result from the introduction of the council tax valuation system.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.0/7">Nevertheless, little was said in the 1991 debate about the revaluation issue, except in so far as Conservative Members said that the need for revaluation was a serious problem in the old rating system and would also be a problem in the fair rates system. That problem would not be eliminated under the council tax, however, but simply reduced. The then Secretary of State for Scotland, Mr. Ian Lang, in the debate on <phrase class="date" code="1991-11-12">Tuesday 12 November 1991</phrase>&mdash;a Second Reading debate that was held over two days, which I have yet to see in the House in my time, although perhaps it is not necessary for this Bill&mdash;stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.80.0/8" class="indent">&quot;The banding system irons out much of the effect of relative changes in property values within an area which, under the rating system, brought regular pressure for revaluation. The need for general revaluations is therefore much reduced. If, however, such a revaluation were required, say, 20 years hence, the same house in band D would probably remain a band D house, provided that its relative position within the range of property values had not changed so much as to take it outwith the new parameters for that band.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report,</i> <phrase class="date" code="1991-11-12">12 November 1991</phrase>; Vol. 198, c. 918.]</p>
	<p pid="b.80.0/9">Council tax does not therefore eliminate the need for revaluation, but merely reduces it.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.0/10">The then Conservative Government expected to have a revaluation in around 2011, only four years later than that provided for in the 2003 Bill. The puzzle in the Conservative position is that if clause 1 of the Bill that we are considering tonight had been included in the 1992 Act, no one would have turned a hair. It would have been perfectly compatible with the policy of the then Government. We have heard tonight that Conservative policy now is that there must be primary legislation every time a revaluation is suggested. No one said that in 1991. It strikes me as somewhat over the top to require primary legislation for what would in effect be a one-clause Bill, as opposed to a positive resolution of the House under the current arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.0/11">Let me turn to the one aspect of the Bill that requires further attention. Hon. Members have referred to the difficulty that politicians have in bringing to fruition revaluations of property-based or near-property-based tax. The technical reasons for introducing such revaluations have been well explained, especially by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1780" name="David Borrow">the hon. Member for South Ribble (Mr. Borrow)</phrase>. They are related to divergence in property values. The relevant divergence is at the individual property level, not at the district or regional level. Those technical advantages of revaluation, however, are always outweighed by the political cost. Ministers of whatever party find it impossible to revalue without paying a very high political price.</p>

	<p pid="b.82.0/1">As an ex-leader of Cambridge city council, my hon. Friend will be aware that the political cost of the council tax has been substantial over time. Part of that has been caused by the continuation of the Conservative Government's policy of increasing council tax by more than inflation. At standard spending, in 1993&ndash;94 council tax was &pound;492.66, and in 2002&ndash;03 it increased to &pound;769.16. It then changed to the assumed national council tax, putatively &pound;1,000.83, which has increased to &pound;1,101.96. That is a 71.9 per cent. increase in the council tax, while inflation has been 34 per cent.&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="b.85.0/1">I shall try to be brief.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.0/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1828" name="Alan Whitehead">The hon. Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead)</phrase> made some excellent points, which were relevant to our own stance. Our stance is that we do not want to proceed with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1389" name="Maria Miller">the revaluation, but my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke (Mrs. Miller)</phrase> produced a twist on that. Our election manifesto focused largely on pensioners and old people. Conservative Members feel that re-banding, particularly for pensioners, is an extremely blunt instrument.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.0/3">Many pensioners are asset-rich. They have sat in their houses for 20, 25 or 30 years and, often unbeknown to them, the asset value has increased. Unfortunately, however, those pensioners are also cash-poor. They are stuck in a difficult position. I fear that the re-banding will force many of them to move from the homes in which they have lived throughout their lives. We need to deal with that structural conundrum, which is why I oppose any re-banding at any time.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.0/4">Let me deal with what was said by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1508" name="Kali Mountford">the hon. Member for Colne Valley (Kali Mountford)</phrase> by quoting from a press release sent on <phrase class="date" code="">20 December</phrase> by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. It announced that the Government intended to suspend the council tax revaluation and extend the scope of Sir Michael Lyons' inquiry, and stated</p>
	<p pid="b.85.0/5" class="indent">&quot;The additional work which Sir Michael will undertake will add value to the Government's own current work on a strategic view of the role and functions of local government, under its local vision programme.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.85.0/6">I am sure that many Opposition Members cannot but agree that council tax increases since 1997 of up to 94 per cent. in my constituency are more an example of double-vision than local vision.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.0/7">I go back to my original point. I was lucky enough to be approached by the IsItFair campaign. Last Wednesday, I had an opportunity to present to the House the campaign's petition. The concern of that campaign and the Braintree Pensioners Action Group is not simply that the current system is unfair because of the way it affects pensioners in particular, but that they face a double whammy: re-banding would hurt many pensioners tremendously and ultimately force many of them to move home.</p>

	<p pid="b.87.2/1">I am deeply grateful for your guidance, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I will try to answer the hon. Gentleman's point in a moment in a way that I feel is relevant to the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.2/2">I warn hon. Members that, when re-banding was introduced in Wales, we were told that it would be fiscally neutral, just as hon. Members in this Chamber are being told that the re-banding exercise in England will be fiscally neutral. When Governments find that their estimates are not quite what they expected them to be, it is easy for them to manipulate local government funding to raise revenue directly for themselves. If hon. Members' experience is anything like the experience of those of us who live in Wales, they may find that their surgeries are full of people complaining about council tax rises of 130 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.2/3">If we abandon revaluation for good, how will we overcome the problems that will result? To take <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1769" name="Mark Hendrick">the point made by the hon. Member for Preston (Mr. Hendrick)</phrase>, I think that there is a strong case for looking at the inflation that is occurring within local authorities. Local authority inflation is not at the same headline level as the inflation figures generally. He talks about 33 per cent. extra going into local authorities. I do not dispute that, but what has been the percentage increase in costs for local authorities? For example, a Government initiative such as the teachers work load agreement in Wales&mdash;there is an equivalent one in England&mdash;is not properly funded. The National Union of Teachers talked about a shortfall of &pound;30 million or so in that alone. If the costs rise above the level that is given to local authorities, they will have to make up the shortfall by putting up council taxes.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.2/4">Therefore, the first thing that we need to do is to set up an inquiry into how expensive it is to run a local authority, to take evidence from local government leaders and to ask them about the extra increases and burdens that they have and to what extent they are being funded by Government. There is a responsibility on Government not to announce any headline-grabbing initiatives unless they are prepared to fund them properly.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.2/5">The second thing that all of us need to do, whether in Wales or England, is to look at the way in which the formula for local government funding operates. That again is easy to manipulate. In fact, it has been manipulated in a manner that I believe is completely unfair to the southern counties of England and to the rural areas of Wales.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.2/6">When assessing deprivation, it is easy to look at the number of people on benefits, which is what the formula does. The formula should take into account average household incomes, because that is a much clearer way of defining deprivation than simply looking at the number of people of benefit. We all know of people working in agriculture, tourism or the service sector for the minimum wage. They are not taking home much money and their incomes are no better than they would be on benefit, but they are not counted as being deprived for the purposes of the formula.</p>

	<p pid="b.89.0/1">This has been an interesting debate. Having heard Madam Deputy Speaker's clear and helpful guidance earlier, I intend to keep my remarks short and not stray too much into Welsh territory.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.0/2">I wish to respond directly to some of the comments of Labour Members, but, first, I should point out that the Welsh experience is relevant. The decision to postpone council tax revaluation in England was described by a Minister as a huge, vaulting, 180&deg; U-turn, and that full-on U-turn is embodied in the Bill. I accept that one of the motivations for that U-turn might be to have a much wider ranging inquiry led by Sir Michael Lyons.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.0/3">I believe also that the Government are conscious of the political difficulties that could be caused and, with one eye on the experience in Wales, they will know of the resentment and anger that was caused by a botched council tax revaluation. The Government clearly want to avoid such political difficulties.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.0/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1602" name="Nick Raynsford">The right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford)</phrase>, unfortunately, is not in his place but I enjoyed his speech. I learned a lot, although I did not agree with everything he said. He referred to the Welsh experience of revaluation and explained why he will not be voting alongside his colleagues this evening. He made a strong defence of the principle of revaluation and gave assurances that the English and Welsh contexts were different.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.0/5">The right hon. Gentleman tried to make the point that, in Wales, the purpose of revaluation was almost to raise money, but that flies very much in the face of explicit assurances given at the time by Labour Ministers in the Welsh Assembly&mdash;the right hon. Gentleman's colleagues&mdash;who promised that it would be revenue-neutral and was not aimed at increasing the overall yield.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.0/6">Likewise, the right hon. Gentleman referred to the number of winners and losers in the revaluation process and his figures were correct. The proportion of losers in Wales was 33 per cent. of households, with 8 per cent. being winners. Again, contrary to what he seemed to be suggesting, that is at odds with the assurances given by Labour Assembly Ministers at the time, who promised that there would be as many winners as losers. They talked about roughly 50 per cent. of households staying within the same band, with 25 per cent. of bills going up and 25 per cent. going down. I caution hon. Members who hear assurances that revaluation can be revenue neutral; the experience in Wales suggests that perhaps it will not be.</p>

	<p pid="b.90.3/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors pointed out that had re-banding in Wales been undertaken in accordance with house price inflation, there would have been a much fairer outcome.</p>
	<p pid="b.90.3/2">The right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich spoke about public acceptance of council tax and reiterated his faith in the high level of public acceptance of it. The acceptance of council tax in Wales has taken a serious knock as a result of the revaluation and Members on both sides should be aware that if such a revaluation went ahead in England, along anything like the lines of Wales, public confidence in council tax will be damaged.</p>

	<p pid="b.92.2/1">Does my hon. Friend not agree that neither revaluation nor the proposed Lyons inquiry does anything to address the question of the simplification of local government finance? That is an important issue when one considers that local government finance is often thought broadly analogous to the Schleswig-Holstein question, to which, it was said, only three people ever knew the answer. One of them went mad, the second died and the third forgot what the answer was.</p>

	<p pid="b.92.4/1">I had the privilege of leading Leicester city council for some 17 years. It has been said that that is longer than a life sentence, and at times it certainly felt like it. But in that capacity my city and I survived the rating system, the savage revenue and capital cuts of the early 1980s, and the rate capping and attendant confrontations that took place in what was a pretty painful period. We also survived the poll tax and the disastrous disruption and confrontation that it caused in our city, as it did elsewhere. We are now surviving the council tax and the attendant capping.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.4/2">So it is with mixed feelings that I speak on this Bill, because I do not know that many of my constituents are likely to benefit from a revaluation, were one to take place. I realise that there are many different predictions about the possible outcome of such a revaluation, but it seems that my constituents and others in Leicester have suffered from the fact that house prices have risen less significantly there than elsewhere. So there is perhaps some benefit in revaluation, but set against that is the obvious pain that would be caused to those whose revaluation moved in a less favourable direction.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.4/3">Far outweighing any of those considerations is the enormous benefit that is to be gained from a thorough review of the functions and the funding method of local government. I am enormously heartened by what the Minister said in introducing this debate about the Government's commitment to devolution and decentralisation in respect of local government. The Lyons review provides a unique opportunity to look at local government root and branch, and to consider not just its funding but ways of ensuring that its future is healthier than the preceding decades have been.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.4/4">On balance, I very much favour the deferment of any revaluation, and I look forward to a radical reform of the finance and functions of local government.</p>

	<p pid="b.108.1/1">I certainly agree that we can learn from what has happened with business rates, and the House needs to discuss business rates as part of this overall package. We could also learn from what happened in Scotland. The Opposition's amendment tonight decries the fact that the revaluation applies only to England. In Scotland, revaluations have taken place fairly frequently: in 1961, 1966, 1971, 1978 and 1985. They did not take place after 1985, because the poll tax was then introduced, initially in Scotland, without great success either there or in England and Wales. So, yes, we should defer the revaluation in England, but we should certainly not cancel it.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.1/2">I disagree with the Opposition's amendment. They dislike the Bill because it applies only to England, but I think that it is absolutely right that we should defer the revaluation in England. Scotland and Wales have their own Parliament and National Assembly respectively, and they should be able to do this at a different pace. In Wales, part of the problem was that the revaluation was carried out following a 129 per cent. increase in house prices since the previous one, which brings us back to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test about house prices putting pressure on us, in terms of the public debate on this issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.1/3">This debate is being held at the same time as Sir Michael Lyons' review. Being a west midlander like me, you, Madam Deputy Speaker, might almost remember Mike Lyons when he was in short trousers. His first major job, as I am sure all right hon. and hon. Members know, was chief executive of Wolverhampton metropolitan borough council, as it was then called. Of course, it is now Wolverhampton city council. Sir Michael Lyons&mdash;as I must now learn to call him&mdash;is a man with a great track record. I can quite understand why a deferral of the revaluation would be important while the Government are having that investigation carried out, and why such a deferral&mdash;as set out in the Bill, and as decried by the Opposition&mdash;would be a good thing. I am sure that Sir Michael's review will be very thorough, and very illuminating for us.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.1/4">We need a public debate on this issue. My hon. Friend the Member for Colne Valley spoke eloquently about the need for public information. There are an awful lot of people, including some in this Chamber, who do not understand the concept of a measure being revenue neutral. A re-banding exercise can be a problem, but if it is set against a series of revenue neutral measures&mdash;which is what I hope would happen in England, although it did not happen in Wales&mdash;it can even out the discrepancies that have built up due to differential house price rises. Prices in some areas will go up more than others. For example, prices in Stourbridge might go up more than those in Wolverhampton, causing things to get out of kilter. A revenue neutral revaluation would therefore be absolutely right. However, it takes a while to explain the concept of revenue neutrality to people, many of whom, because of many years of underinvestment in education by the Conservatives, are fairly innumerate. We need to have that kind of public debate.</p>

	<p pid="b.109.6/1">And if I were to stray too far into what the Lyons inquiry ought to do, Madam Deputy Speaker, you would say that I was going too wide of the point. As ever, my hon. Friend makes a valid point, as he did in his lengthy and interesting contribution to the debate earlier. He is much more numerically adept than I am. We might have to encounter gearing as a problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.6/2">Under the Bill, revaluation would be deferred but not done away with. While I want a deferral, I do not want it to be deferred into the mists of time. A revaluation will address the question of differential house price rises. When house prices rise in different adjacent parts of a constituency, city or rural area, those who have seen an above-average increase in the value of their houses pay lower council tax than they would if a revaluation had taken place. Correspondingly, those whose houses have risen in value by less than the average, assuming a revenue-neutral system, would pay more council tax than they should. That happens to some extent in the current system, but the longer a deferral continues, the more pronounced that unfair trend becomes. Of course, it favours those who have done best out of rising house prices in the booming economy under this Labour Government. The discrepancies and unfairness therefore get worse the longer a revaluation is deferred. Consequently, as I said to my hon. Friend the Minister, while I support a deferral of the revaluation pending the outcome of the Lyons inquiry, I do not want it deferred too long.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.6/3">I think that council tax is a good tax. There are problems with it, and I am glad that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1780" name="David Borrow">the review is going on. My hon. Friend the Member for South Ribble (Mr. Borrow)</phrase>, in an intervention on my hon. Friend the Member for Colne Valley, said that there is no perfect tax. Arguably, death duties are a perfect tax, because one pays them only when one is dead. Council tax is quite useful because it is on a house that one cannot move&mdash;I do not know the collection rate in your area, Madam Deputy Speaker, but in mine it is about 97 per cent., so it is important to bear that in mind in terms of revaluation. We need to consider what revenues might be brought in, but we also need a sound system that by and large works well, even though there are difficulties.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.6/4">I want to stress again the need for better information to accompany the deferred valuation, as mentioned by my hon. Friends the Members for Colne Valley and for South Ribble, so that people can understand the system as fully as possible and that we can have a properly informed debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.6/5">The Liberal Democrats went into the last general election saying that they would replace council tax with a local income tax. That is an entirely honourable and understandable position, although they may now have resiled from it, but we need to debate it properly if we are to consider revaluation in the context of an alternative to council tax.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.6/6">The amendment says that</p>
	<p pid="b.109.6/7" class="indent">&quot;removal of the need for revaluation of domestic properties offers taxpayers no protection against the imposition of new higher council tax bands.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.109.6/8">That shows that the Opposition have a different view of what a revenue-neutral revaluation might constitute. It suggests that the six Members who tabled the amendment do not understand the system that we have, let alone what it might be turned into. No doubt the Opposition Member who winds up the debate will explain that I have misunderstood, and that those who tabled the amendment understand the mathematics and simply take a different political view, but the wording suggests otherwise, which is deeply worrying.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.6/9">I am sure that the Liberal Democrats do understand how the system works and take a different view&mdash;if they have a view at the moment. I would not talk about that now even if I were allowed to. It seems, however, that Her Majesty's loyal Opposition do not understand the system that we have, but have nevertheless tabled an amendment suggesting that we decline to give a Second Reading to a Bill deferring revaluation because of all the nasty things that they think would happen in the event of such revaluation. Let us leave aside the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for South Ribble, who echoed my hon. Friend the Minister in saying that the Opposition did not appear to realise that if the Bill were not give a Second Reading, revaluation would go ahead. The Opposition seem to be telling us that the Government have got it all wrong, but it is they who have got it all wrong, because they do not understand the present system.</p>

The speech will bear some rereading, as it contained some interesting comments aimed at Ministers. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1780" name="David Borrow">The hon. Member for South Ribble (Mr. Borrow)</phrase> demonstrated his experience with the Valuation Office Agency, and made some interesting points, particularly about the cycle of revaluation between council tax and the unified business rate. I think that many people took his speech on board.</p>
	<p pid="b.111.0/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1820" name="David Curry">My right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry)</phrase> made a typically thoughtful and independent-minded speech. Much of it was not party policy, so I will not go into the details, but he made a good point about the balance of funding between council tax and the unified business rate. No doubt the Lyons review will have to take account of that.</p>
	<p pid="b.111.0/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1704" name="Graham Stringer">The hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer)</phrase> showed his experience of local government, as a former leader of Manchester city council. He said that the council tax had been born out of the difficulties of the poll tax in earlier years. I have some sympathy with his view. It is rather like blaming Napoleon for the introduction of income tax: taxes are normally introduced as a result of crises rather than serene weather and careful thought.</p>
	<p pid="b.111.0/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1718" name="Paul Beresford">My hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford)</phrase>, a former Minister and someone who knows a great deal about these matters, spoke of his concerns and of how he thought council tax ought to be varied. His speech, too, was not party policy, so I shall pass on to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1644" name="Celia Barlow">the hon. Member for Hove (Ms Barlow)</phrase>, who made a characteristically good speech and dealt extremely well with a Liberal Democrat intervention about local income tax.</p>
	<p pid="b.111.0/6"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1389" name="Maria Miller">My hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke (Mrs. Miller)</phrase> was an eloquent defender of her constituents. She spoke of the increase in council tax in her area, and of all the pressures that must be borne by a growth area with additional housing such as Basingstoke and other parts of Hampshire.</p>
	<p pid="b.111.0/7"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1828" name="Alan Whitehead">The hon. Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead)</phrase> again showed his experience of local government. He took us from Merton to Wakefield&mdash;it was a long, long, long journey, but eventually we got <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1473" name="David Howarth">there. The hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth)</phrase> again showed his local government experience and provided a history lesson about the 1992 Act that introduced council tax.</p>
	<p pid="b.111.0/8"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1573" name="David Burrowes">My hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes)</phrase> made the valuable point that, if the value of one's house is high, that does not necessarily mean that one is able to pay, and made a plea on behalf of his constituents that ability to pay should be taken into account. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1443" name="Brooks Newmark">My hon. Friend the Member for Braintree (Mr. Newmark)</phrase> made a similar point, echoing the concerns of his constituents in Essex.</p>
	<p pid="b.111.0/9">The debate got even better because 100 per cent. of the Welsh Conservative party contributed to it, which is unusual, bearing in mind that this is an English Bill, but it shows the salience of the council tax issue for our neighbours in Wales, who have just been through a revaluation. There is no doubt that the Government considered some of the outcomes of the revaluation in Wales before they determined what to do.</p>
	<p pid="b.111.0/10"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1719" name="David Davies">My hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth (David T.C. Davies)</phrase> talked about the concerns about revaluation and the hefty rises in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1768" name="Stephen Crabb">his constituency. My hon. Friend the Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire (Mr. Crabb)</phrase> said that assurances were given to the Welsh Assembly that the process would be revenue neutral and it was not. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1506" name="David Jones">My hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, West (Mr. Jones)</phrase> echoed the concerns about the revaluation in Wales. He talked about the rising anger and the 9 per cent. uplift in the yield post revaluation.</p>
	<p pid="b.111.0/11"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1675" name="Peter Soulsby">The hon. Member for Leicester, South (Sir Peter Soulsby)</phrase> again showed his experience as a leader of Leicester city council and talked eloquently and concisely about his concerns. He did not want the revaluation to be put off for too long, but talked a great deal about function and funding and supported the Government's review and the Lyons review.</p>
	<p pid="b.111.0/12"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1637" name="Tom Levitt">The hon. Member for High Peak (Tom Levitt)</phrase> came in and did a reasonable job of keeping <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1508" name="Kali Mountford">the debate going. The hon. Member for Colne Valley (Kali Mountford)</phrase> did extremely well to speak for well over 30 minutes and, on the whole, to keep in order. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1937" name="Rob Marris">The hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris)</phrase> showed the benefits of the Library brief, taking us into the history of revaluation. He made the salient point that revaluation, whether under the rates system or the council tax system, has always meant Governments of all political colours facing difficult choices and they do not always make the right one. I am sure that, as he made an eloquent speech and made some good points, he will soon get a well-deserved promotion to the Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.111.0/13">The debate is of the Government's own making. Revaluation was not part of the 1992 Act, but the Government decided in July 2001 to revalue council tax on <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2007</phrase>. That was in the Local Government Act 2003, for which many Labour Members voted. Conservative Members voted for a reasoned amendment. I had the pleasure of serving on the Committee that considered the Bill. The fact that the Government have changed their minds and are accusing all sorts of people on the Opposition Benches of changing their minds has a lot to do with the fact that they decided to go down that political avenue and have now thought better of it.</p>
	<p pid="b.111.0/14">We heard a lot about kicking issues into touch and about panic attacks. It is probably sensible for the Minister to put off revaluation because the salience of the council tax issue is high and increasing. The Welsh experience is a useful one. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors estimates that, if we had the same uplift following the English revaluation as occurred in Wales, that would mean &pound;2 billion extra in council tax, and that council tax for 7 million out of 21 million council tax payers would go up. Those are big figures, which have no doubt concerned the Government and were one of the reasons why they decided to kick the issue into touch.</p>
	<p pid="b.111.0/15">Revaluation itself is a costly exercise. In 2004, the cost was estimated at &pound;108 million and, in 2005, at &pound;178 million. We got so far as to spend nearly &pound;60 million, of which &pound;45 million, we heard, was spent on software. I am not sure that we received an answer about the value of the software if the revaluation is put off, and I hope that the Minister will reassure us on that.</p>
	<p pid="b.111.0/16">We heard that the Valuation Office Agency has taken on nearly 1,400 staff to deal with revaluation, many of whom will be on short-term contracts. We have not heard very much about the cost of those appointments. The Government said that there would be savings and, of course, there will be savings, but there will be further costs to come from shortening the contracts of 1,400 staff.</p>
	<p pid="b.111.0/17">The hon. Member for South Ribble said that, within the cycle, it would be possible to use those staff and others to undertake a revaluation of council tax and then to get back to the cycle for the revaluation of the uniform business rate. However, the whole thing is now out of synch.</p>

	<p pid="b.115.0/1">What a letting of the cat out of the bag we have witnessed this evening! With all due respect to Her Majesty and her relationship with her Loyal Opposition, I would ask for my money back. The once-great Conservative party has been reduced to something of a pickle. The amendment before us in the name of the right hon. and learned Gentleman the Leader of the Opposition is worth quoting:</p>
	<p pid="b.115.0/2" class="indent">&quot;That this House declines to give a Second Reading to the Council Tax (New Valuation Lists for England) Bill because the Bill merely delays rather than cancels the council tax revaluation&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.115.0/3">That is a consistent position&mdash;since <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-07">7 April</phrase>. Of course, were the amendment accepted, revaluation would be reintroduced with effect from <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.115.0/4">Although this point has been made several times today, let me emphasise that the Conservatives' strategy since their U-turn in the spring has been to scaremonger. That campaign has been based&mdash;another Conservative Member also let the cat out of the bag in this respect&mdash;on exploiting the fear of many, especially pensioners and the low paid, that because the value of their house has increased, it follows that a banding increase will take place. Nothing could be further from the truth.</p>

	<p pid="b.120.2/1">My hon. Friend made that point in the debate. Of course, the answer depends on what happens to house prices. If he is asking whether the Government's policy is to support a property tax on the basis of valuation, the answer is, of course, yes&mdash;unlike the Conservative party's policy of supporting property tax without a revaluation, which seems wholly untenable.</p>
	<p pid="b.120.2/2">Hon. Members have argued in the debate that there is no need for revaluation. They argue that relative house price movements across the country during the past 10 years are such that the revaluation is unnecessary. They would cancel revaluation, rather than postponing it. However, during the debate of <phrase class="date" code="">19 October</phrase>, when <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1891" name="Angela Watkinson">the hon. Member for Upminster (Angela Watkinson)</phrase> was challenged by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1809" name="Clive Betts">my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts)</phrase> to say whether the Conservatives would ever revalue, the response was &quot;we never say never&quot;. We look forward to receiving the Opposition's support for the Bill when it returns to the House after its consideration in Committee because it provides exactly the kind of flexibility that their policy appears to call for.</p>
	<p pid="b.120.2/3">Finally, I should remind the House that in the past eight years, the Government have provided a 33 per cent. real-terms increase in Government grant, which compares with a 7 per cent. real-terms reduction in the last four years of the previous Government. Last year was the eighth successive year in which the Government provided local government overall with an increase in total Government grant that was above inflation, and it was the third year in which we were able to guarantee increases for all local authorities at least in line with inflation. One would have thought that the Conservative party would be interested in balancing the books, not scaring the pensioners of this country.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-11-07b.132.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1714" speakername="Ashok Kumar" colnum="132"  time="022:38:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051107/debtext/51107-39.htm#51107-39_spnew5">
	<p pid="b.132.2/1">First, may I put on record my great thanks to the Speaker for granting me this debate?</p>
	<p pid="b.132.2/2">I want to bring to the attention of the House the work of Middlesbrough borough council, its elected mayor, Ray Mallon, and the Safer Middlesbrough partnership to cut crime and make the town a safer place. First, I want to praise the efforts of the men and women of Cleveland police, and the force's chief constable, Sean Price, who has made a great contribution to ensuring that the council's plans have succeeded and provided great leadership.</p>
	<p pid="b.132.2/3">The success of the initiative would not, of course, have occurred without the Government, who have provided resources, financial support and strong commitment from the top. They have given a strong commitment to tackling crime and law and order problems, and have assisted the local authority and the partnership to deliver results.</p>
	<p pid="b.132.2/4">I naturally want to say a little about the respect agenda which the Prime Minister has led from the front. Middlesbrough, like every urban area, has experienced problems of crime and the rise of the yob culture, but it has actively developed a strategy of policies on the ground rooted in a firm determination to take back the streets and estate from the yobs and petty criminals.</p>
	<p pid="b.132.2/5">I must declare an interest. I am a very good friend of the mayor, Ray Mallon, and I respect and admire the leadership that he has given our town. Since his election, he has become a national figure. Many Government and Opposition Front Benchers visit his office regularly. It has also been visited by Lord Falconer, the Lord Chancellor, by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and Wales, by the Minister of Communities and Local Government and, of course, by the Leader of Her Majesty's Opposition. Both candidates for the Conservative party leadership have visited Ray Mallon and sought his counsel, and the great and the good of the Labour party establishment also visit and seek his support. He commands a great deal of respect at national level, and he too leads from the front.</p>
	<p pid="b.132.2/6">When Ray Mallon ran for office, he made it clear that tackling crime and disorder was one of his top priorities. He has delivered on that pledge, and the success of his approach is reflected in the fact that on the tough urban beat of Middlesbrough, crime has fallen by 20 per cent. since he became mayor. His first act, which he performed only months after taking office, was to launch an initiative called &quot;Raising Hope&quot;. Raising hopes and expectations of an effective crackdown on crime, bad manners and loutish behaviour was and is the key priority for everyone in the town.</p>
	<p pid="b.132.2/7">I know that directly from my constituency postbag, and also from the comments of people whom I meet in the streets, in their workplaces and at a series of coffee mornings that I hold throughout my constituency. For them, knowing that action is being taken to tackle crime and antisocial behaviour is the key to the hope of a better quality of life. &quot;Raising Hope&quot; is truly a partnership approach, based on Ray Mallon's appreciation of the realities of policing in areas where the louts have established a dominant foothold. It is an intelligence-led approach, and the police share data and information on a daily basis. They work with other control agencies, notably the council and its street-warden service but also local businesses, retailers, pubs and clubs and schools. Their approach links the panda car with the CCTV operator, the school head fighting truancy with the mobile truant patrols in the town centre, and the street warden with the local shop. Above all, it links all those agencies in a relationship with the people and communities of the town.</p>
	<p pid="b.132.2/8">Mayor Mallon's philosophy is holistic. To him, a clean, safe environment is one in which crime and antisocial behaviour are driven to the margins. To him, a confident community is one that knows it can report vandals and petty criminals to the authorities, who will listen to their concerns and take action against those who are reported. He also recognises that inequalities and divisions in local society, between rich and poor, young and old and black and white, create an environment in which crime and intolerance can flourish. He argues for the need to rebuild a 19th century industrial town as a new city fit for the 21st century, a city with new businesses, new jobs, new forms of leisure and consumption and clean, swift, efficient transport rising from the foundations of the old. Although all those priorities are ends in themselves, they all play a key role in crime eradication and in making Middlesbrough a truly safe community.</p>
	<p pid="b.132.2/9">Ray Mallon has used the legislation provided by successive Government Acts and initiatives to structure his approach. Crucial legislation for him was the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 from the Home Office and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's Local Government Act 2003. Combining the crime-fighting powers conferred on councils and elected mayors by that legislation, he was able to weave together an all-embracing culture in the council and, crucially, outside it.</p>
	<p pid="b.132.2/10">Ray Mallon has told me of his frustration with those agencies that publish glossy mission statements and strategy documents and then retire from activity. Those agencies are convinced that, by merely drawing up those documents, they have fulfilled their obligations to their stakeholders and clients. He has told me that he feels that that is one key reason why there is so much cynicism among the general public over the effectiveness of crime-busting measures.</p>
	<p pid="b.132.2/11">In order to sell his mission to the people of Middlesbrough, Ray Mallon embarked on a comprehensive road show engaging in debate and discussion with people across the town. I have been present with him at many of those events and he in turn has been prepared to assist me when I have held similar &quot;meet the people&quot; sessions in the part of Middlesbrough that lies in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="b.132.2/12">Ray Mallon takes a personal interest in listening to the people on the front line of local government. Too many councillors, he argues, relate only to chief executives, policy officers and departmental heads. He listens to people in local government such as street wardens, road sweepers, toilet attendants, lollipop ladies and home carers, who seldom, if ever, get to meet their councillors face to face to give their views on the service that they provide and how it could be improved. Mayor Mallon regularly drops in at depots and offices to hear what those employees say and he believes that it has paid dividends.</p>
	<p pid="b.132.2/13">Mayor Mallon also recognises that many of the problems facing local communities suffering from crime and antisocial behaviour come from the activities of local young people. He and his cabinet, most notably Councillor Barry Coppinger, the council's lead member for community security, see diversionary activity as the key to peeling youngsters off the road to crime.</p>
	<p pid="b.132.2/14">The local drug scene is an example. The headlines talk of crack and heroin. Sadly, crack and heroin abuse does exist in our community. Indeed, much of that abuse contributes to the basic motivation of most of the muggings and burglaries that take place across Middlesbrough. A crack or heroin addict needs constantly to replenish his or her &quot;high&quot; and usually it is someone else's money, handbag or cash till that becomes the target. That is why the crackdown on hard drugs is central for both Cleveland police and the council's community wardens.</p>
	<p pid="b.132.2/15">However, far more common than hard drugs is the use of so-called &quot;recreational drugs&quot; for Saturday night fever&mdash;mainly ecstasy and other amphetamines. The council's drug strategy reflects that division. The strategy and council staff back Cleveland police 100 per cent. in their &quot;get a dealer a day&quot; campaign and in their work of identifying, targeting and then raiding crack and heroin dens, but they also run education programmes across schools, youth clubs and colleges, alerting youngsters to the dangers posed by the abuse of recreational drugs and to what that abuse can lead to.</p>
	<p pid="b.132.2/16">Youth activity and empowerment is central to the council. A small sum spent on a youth centre in an informal setting on an estate, or a minor shift of moneys from the mainstream education budget to a special diversionary scheme run at a street level can bring great rewards. It can pay valuable dividends for the future and can be achieved easily and effortlessly if the will is there.</p>
	<p pid="b.132.2/17">The alternative, of course, is to do nothing. That may safeguard the sanctity of a local council's or school's budget in the short term, but will cost society heavily in the years to come. It can cost heavily as antisocial behaviour or teenage deviancy becomes the modus operandi of sub-criminal and criminal behaviour in early adulthood. That is why the need to ensure the success of the respect agenda is so vital.</p>
	<p pid="b.132.2/18">We have to remember that we all pay a price for allowing criminality to flourish unchecked. There is the human price wreaked on the powerless and vulnerable by the activities of the thugs and the hooligans, and the physical price of constantly having to resource an ever-expanding police and community security budget, let alone the price of running an effective offender management service and the Prison Service.</p>
	<p pid="b.132.2/19">For the respect agenda to take root and flourish, and for it be accepted for real by a jaded public, it has to be seen as part of an all-embracing and holistic programme that is a core part of the life of the community and adopted by all agencies as central to their work. What has been achieved in Middlesbrough shows the way to roll out the respect agenda across the streets, towns and cities of the United Kingdom. I invite my hon. Friend the Minister to Middlesbrough where he can see for himself what we have been able to achieve.</p>
	<p pid="b.132.2/20">What I have articulated today is a real programme for raising the hopes of our people and improving their quality of life. I am sure that my hon. Friend will return from Middlesbrough with a great deal of information that he can use for the subsequent respect agenda.</p>

	<p pid="b.135.0/1">I begin by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1714" name="Ashok Kumar">my hon. Friend the Member for Middlesbrough, South and East Cleveland (Dr. Kumar)</phrase> on securing this debate. Tackling local crime is an important issue for all right hon. and hon. Members and I am glad that he had the opportunity to air his views. I pay tribute to his personal role in bearing down on criminality in his constituency.</p>
	<p pid="b.135.0/2">My hon. Friend kindly invited me to come to Middlesbrough to see some of these things for myself. I paid a private visit to his constituency as recently as last Saturday; sadly, it was to attend the funeral of a very dear friend of mine, David Boyes. I hope to return in happier times.</p>
	<p pid="b.135.0/3">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his forthright and considered assessment of the current position on crime and disorder in Middlesbrough. He attributed considerable credit to the elected mayor and it was encouraging to hear his observation that the residents of Middlesbrough are pleased with the progress that is being made. The local crime and disorder reduction partnership is making a real difference and I am pleased to join my hon. Friend in praising the local police. I was particularly pleased to hear him emphasise the way in which the agencies in the Middlesbrough area are working well together and making the best use of the available resources.</p>
	<p pid="b.135.0/4">This debate comes at a very opportune time as the crime and disorder reduction partnership in Middlesbrough has undergone a number of changes recently. It is now in a better position to deliver its ambitious target of reducing crime by over 20 per cent. by 2008. Such a target is not an end in itself but, if achieved, will have a considerable impact on the safety and confidence of my hon. Friend's constituents.</p>
	<p pid="b.135.0/5">I will comment in more detail on the situation in Middlesbrough in a moment. But first, I should like to set the context by saying one or two things about the Government's overall strategy for reducing crime and the progress that we are making.</p>
	<p pid="b.135.0/6">Although it is true that our constituents remain understandably worried about crime and still perceive it as one of the main issues that the Government need to address, in fact, crime in England and Wales has been falling dramatically over the past decade. Since 1997, overall crime as measured by the British crime survey is down by 35 per cent., with particularly significant reductions in domestic burglary and vehicle crime. According to the BCS, violent crime has reduced by 34 per cent. in the same period.</p>
	<p pid="b.135.0/7">However, such progress is meaningful only if it is translated from percentages into something practical and real at local level that enables local communities to feel safer and to be more secure. I am very grateful to my hon. Friend for explaining how this strategy applies in a challenging urban area such as Middlesbrough, which experiences a wide range of crime-related problems. I am certainly pleased to hear positive feedback about how crime and disorder is being tackled in Middlesbrough, and how the local community's concerns are being taken fully into account.</p>
	<p pid="b.135.0/8">As I said at the beginning, this is a good time to talk about crime and disorder in Middlesbrough. This year, the Audit Commission found evidence that fear of crime in Middlesbrough appears to be reducing&mdash;a feeling supported by recent significant reductions in vehicle crime and robbery. Acquisitive crime&mdash;such crime is often associated with drug misuse, as my hon. Friend said&mdash;has also reduced significantly overall, pointing to the success of programmes and initiatives such as the drug interventions programme, which is targeted at drug misusers caught in the criminal justice system, and the prolific and priority offenders programme. The latter is targeted at those who commit a disproportionate amount of crime and disorder in our communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.135.0/9">This progress was noted during self-assessment of the prolific offenders scheme that was recently conducted in collaboration with the Government office for the north-east. The scheme was particularly strong in areas such as performance management and establishing good practice. The interim evaluation report on the national prolific offenders strategy, which was published just a couple of weeks ago, suggests that the scheme may be having a positive impact on re-offending among this hard core group. I will follow the progress of the Middlesbrough scheme with great interest following this debate. Some other partnerships in the area are also having a positive impact. For example, the Cleveland local criminal justice board is bringing agencies together to ensure, for example, that a larger number of offenders are brought to justice, and that greater community confidence can be built throughout the local area.</p>
	<p pid="b.135.0/10">Following the 2004 crime and disorder audit in Middlesbrough, extensive consultation took place involving community organisations, businesses and other stakeholders, in order to help set out the local strategy for the period 2005&ndash;08. Respondents were asked about their main priorities for the partnership to tackle, and the following five themes were identified as being of greatest concern: antisocial behaviour, misuse of drugs, house burglary, robbery and mugging, and street violence. As a result of this consultation, the Safer Middlesbrough partnership has agreed an ambitious 20.1 per cent. crime reduction target for the period 2005&ndash;08. This target includes a reduction in common assault and wounding of 30 per cent. The partnership has been restructured to integrate drug and crime issues fully under a new chair and a new executive. Although the partnership faces a period of change, local people have every reason to be positive about the changes that have been made, which should ensure that the right structures are in place to deliver the area's crime reduction target.</p>
	<p pid="b.135.0/11">Other welcome developments include the introduction of four problem-solving groups to cover the whole of Middlesbrough, in alignment with the community policing areas. The partnership is also implementing initiatives to address drug and alcohol-related violent crime.</p>
	<p pid="b.135.0/12">I would also like to commend the partnership agencies in Middlesbrough for their success in tackling antisocial behaviour, using a range of effective tactics, such as antisocial behaviour orders and dispersal orders, to make the streets and neighbourhoods safer. My hon. Friend mentioned and laid great emphasis on the respect agenda, which is being led from the centre and right across government, introducing a range of practical measures to deal with disorder and change the culture so that we can remove fear and enable people to feel safer in their own homes and on their streets. My hon. Friend was quite right to emphasise that it is the poor and the vulnerable who suffer most when people show disrespect in our local communities. Dealing with the problem is very much a matter of social justice.</p>
	<p pid="b.135.0/13">In support of those improvements, Government investment in Middlesbrough is increasing. During the current year, the Safer Middlesbrough partnership will receive a total of &pound;345,220 from the Home Office element of the safer stronger communities fund. That will be used to help achieve the agreed crime reduction targets as well as local priorities and includes &pound;25,000 specifically to tackle antisocial behaviour.</p>
