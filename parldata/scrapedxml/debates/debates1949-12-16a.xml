<p>Unfortunately the difficulties to which I referred yesterday still persist. The men at the power stations of Brimsdown, Taylor's Lane and Littlebrook have not yet resumed work. Exception is being taken to the notice issued yesterday by the Authority which reads as follows:
<q>In view of the statements that have been made, the British Electricity Authority must make it clear that all men returning to work do so entirely unconditionally.</q>
The notice was issued by the Authority to remove any possibility of misunderstanding in view of last minute attempts by unofficial strike leaders to impose conditions for a resumption.<br/>
The dispute arises over the use of the word "unconditional," but a statement made yesterday evening by the Authority makes it clear that no question regarding the existing terms and conditions of employment arises. I am satisfied that in the discussions between the Authority and the trade unions no conditions for resumption were imposed or promises made. There is no ground for doubt on this point. I sincerely hope that the trade unions will co-operate with the Authority in getting the men back to work without delay.</p>

<p>We all feel that we do not want to comment on that statement, because it is difficult to comment usefully in the present state of negotiations. I should like an assurance from the Prime Minister or the Deputy Leader of the House. There is this difficulty, we are rising this year earlier than usual, and the situation in respect of this matter

is still anxious. The assurance I should like to have is that if the situation should deteriorate, which we all pray it will not, would the Prime Minister take into consideration any representations which we may make or which are made on his side of the House for an earlier resumption of the meetings of the House?</p>

<p>It is only right to say that it was put up on the authority of the Authority. I want to be careful about using words but the point is this&#x2014;the word "unconditional" means "unconditional." It means that no conditions were imposed by either side, exacted or demanded, and no promises were made. In other words, the men go back to work as if there had been no trouble arising, so far as conditions of any kind were imposed on them.</p>

<p>Is it possible that the men are thinking of the word "unconditional" in the same way as it was used in "unconditional surrender"? In view of the unfortunate background of that slogan, would the Minister use his influence to persuade the men that there is no victimisation?</p>

<p>I hope the main result of the statement I have made will be that that will be the men's interpretation of it. I have made personal inquiries, and I am quite satisfied that no conditions of any kind were imposed, and no promise made that this or that will or will not be done.</p>

<p><i>During last winter our overseas account as a whole was brought into balance. Trade with North America still presented special problems, but the size of the gap between receipts and payments in respect of that area was being progressively reduced as the drive to increase direct and indirect dollar earnings gathered momentum.

<p><i>In the early part of</i> 1949 <i>a fall in demand for goods from the United Kingdom, and from the other countries linked with sterling, seriously affected our earnings of dollars and the resultant difficulties were much intensified by a widespread belief that there would be an alteration in the value of the pound sterling in terms of the United States dollar. My Ministers took prompt action to reduce imports and to initiate discussions on some of the wider aspects of the problem. In July, a meeting of Commonwealth Finance Ministers was held in London to exchange views on the urgent economic problems confronting us. In September,</i>

<i>My Ministers in the United Kingdom and Canada met representatives of the United States Government in Washington, and discussed with them the trade and financial relations between the sterling and dollar areas. Complete understanding was achieved in these talks. There was recognition that the freer development of world trade required the sustained effort, not only of these three countries, but of all other countries which desired to promote a free exchange of goods throughout the world.</i></p>
