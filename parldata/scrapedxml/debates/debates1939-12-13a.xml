<p>Parcels for British civilians interned in Germany may be sent through the intermediary of the Prisoners of War Department of the War Organisation of the British Red Cross Society and Order of St. John of Jerusalem. The arrangements for packing and despatching parcels are similar to those described by my right hon.

Instructions for the guidance of relatives and others desiring to send parcels have been drawn up by the Prisoners of War Department and have been sent to persons interested in the welfare of interned civilians. A number of parcels of food and clothing have already been despatched by the Department, and further parcels are now being sent regularly to all known internees.</p>

<p>asked the Prime Minister whether he has taken any further action to press for satisfaction of the claim of Mr. Joseph Martin, of Brighton, for suffering and damage caused by fever, blindness and other injuries resulting from the brutal treatment he received during his imprisonment, without trial, in Moscow by the Soviet Government in 1919 to 1920, or, in lieu of obtaining compensation from the Soviet Government, will he now consider granting compensation to Mr. Martin, in view of the fact that His Majesty's Government, on 2nd May, 1923, omitted to include Mr. Martin's claim with those of Mrs. Davison and Mrs. Stan Harding to the Soviet Government, both of whom received compensation, although these three were the only claims which had been taken up with the Soviet Government, investigated, and compensation found to be due prior to May, 1923?</p>

<p>No, Sir. This very hard case was the subject of representations to the Soviet Government in the year 1922, but it has been found impossible, except in the two cases mentioned, to obtain satisfaction in respect either of Mr. Martin's claim or of any of the other numerous claims for compensation which are still outstanding. As regards the suggestion that His Majesty's Government should grant compensation to Mr. Martin in respect of his claim, it is not felt possible to make a special exception in his case, which differs in no essential respect from any of the other 260 claims for personal injury outstanding against the Soviet Government.</p>

<p>This accident occurred when the 9.35 a.m. passenger train from Liverpool Street to Chingford, which was standing at the down home signal at Wood Street, was run into by the 9.45 a.m. train travelling over the same route. One coach of the standing train was derailed and the guard and six passengers were injured. There was thick fog at the time. The circumstances attending the accident are now being investigated. Colour-light signalling is in use on the section of line in question, and I am satisfied that this type of signalling is generally adequate for operation during


foggy weather. The signals are shielded from aerial observation by hoods and their brilliance has not been diminished as a result of the lighting restrictions. Some trains equipped with improved lighting will be in service on the Walthamstow line this week, and it is expected that all the rolling stock working these services will be equipped early in the New Year. I am informed that 34 accidents to passengers and staff occurred on the Leyton and Walthamstow lines during the months of September, October and November, 1938; the corresponding figure for 1939 was 45. These figures relate to all types of accidents, and the whole of the increase in 1939 is not necessarily attributable to black-out conditions.</p>

The total amount of fuel available for goods and public passenger transport generally is limited, and some reduction in services must inevitably result.

normal consumption approximately equivalent to the percentage allotment for goods and public passenger vehicles generally, and I should not feel justified in authorising an increase which could only be at the expense of other services.</p>

<p>The unemployment in Oxford is due to falling off since the outbreak of war in the demand for light cars produced by the motor industry at Cowley.

<p>Until the final details have been settled of the Orders necessary to bring in full control over the collection and slaughtering of livestock and the distribution of meat, it would be impracticable to give a comprehensive statement of the details of the plan of control. Briefly, however, the proposal is that all fatstock will be bought by the Ministry of Food at prescribed prices, according to grade and classification, at collecting centres. Practically all the livestock markets at which fatstock are normally sold, have been approved as collecting centres. The stock so purchased will be slaughtered on behalf of the Government at selected slaughterhouses, and the resulting meat will be distributed, through wholesale meat supply associations, acting as agents of the Ministry, to the retail trade, at prices which will include delivery. Fat pigs will also be bought by the Ministry at prescribed prices. Producers of pigs will have the option either of sending their pigs to a collecting centre or of consigning them direct to a bacon factory. Fat pigs sent to collecting centres will be classified into bacon pigs, pork pigs and pigs for manufacturing purposes. Bacon pigs will be sent from collecting centres to bacon factories and the remaining pigs to one or other of the selected slaughterhouses to which I have already referred, for subsequent sale by retailers or for use by meat manufacturers. The number and sites of the slaughterhouses selected for use under the control plan for livestock and meat have been under review and,


as a result, a number of additional slaughterhouses are being selected. The number will be about 750. As soon as the list of slaughterhouses has been finally settled, following this review, I will arrange for the list which I have had placed in the Library of the House of Commons to be brought up to date. I should add that I propose to set up tribunals on a suitable basis to advise me, in the light of the working of the scheme, on appeals for the inclusion in the plan of slaughterhouses omitted at its inception.</p>

<p>The Government have given careful consideration to the question of ensuring to farmers in the United Kingdom reasonable prices for Ware potatoes of the 1939 crop. At present the trade in Ware potatoes is subject only to the Orders of the Ministry of Food prescribing maximum prices. It is proposed in the near future after consultation with the interests concerned, to fix minimum prices for the remainder of the season. Maximum prices will also be fixed to enable account to be taken of variations in value due to special quality or proximity to markets. The Government have taken over the regulatory powers of the Potato Marketing Board and propose to watch the situation closely and to exercise those powers as and when required. It is proposed by means of a tonnage levy payable by the first buyers, to create an insurance fund which, after the deduction of a small percentage towards the cost of the scheme will be used to ensure to farmers a reasonable return for any surplus crop remaining at the end of the season. No deduction will be made from the growers' price in respect of this levy, which will be added by the first buyer to his price on re-sale. It is not anticipated that the retail price will be appreciably affected. The details of arrangements on these lines are now being discussed with the interests concerned.<br/>
As regards the 1940 crop, the Government have already announced that it is desired, as part of the home food production campaign, to secure a substantial in-

crease in the acreage planted to potatoes next spring. Minimum prices for that crop will be fixed on the basis of the new 1939 minimum prices with such adjustment as may be necessary to take account of increased costs of production and in relation to yield. As regards the proposed adjustment in relation to yield, it will be appreciated that, if the yield of the crop generally is above normal, farmers should not expect the same tonnage return as if the yield were normal. Similarly, if yield is abnormally low, it would be right to adjust the price per ton upwards. In the event of a surplus, whether resulting from an expansion of acreage, or exceptional yields, the Ministry of Food will make the necessary arrangements for ensuring that growers will be enabled to obtain a remunerative return on their potato crop as a whole. The assurances I have given will apply in respect of all potatoes of the 194o crop marketed after 1st September.</p>

<p>I rise, Mr. Speaker, to ask you to be good enough to give a Ruling on the following point: whether Members of the House of Commons will be entitled to communicate to Members of another place who have not been present at the Secret Session information as to what took place at such Session?</p>

<p>In reply to the hon. Member, under Standing Order No. 89 it is conceded, as a matter of courtesy, not of right, that Members of the other House may remain here during Secret Sessions when other strangers are ordered to withdraw. If a Member of this House who is present at the Debate discloses what has taken place at the Secret Session to a Member of the other House who was not present, but who could have been present had he so desired, he might be adjudged to have committed a technical offence, but it would be for the House to decide whether a breach of Privilege had been committed and on the gravity of the offence.</p>

<p>Perhaps it would be as well for me to say what, in my opinion, is the position in this matter of Members of the other House. I said just now that it is conceded, as a matter of courtesy not of right, that Members of the other House may remain here during Secret Sessions when other strangers are ordered to withdraw. If a Member of the other House were guilty of disclosure of the proceedings at such a Session it would be left to the House of which he is a Member to inflict the appropriate penalty. The usual proceeding would be to examine


into the fact and to lay a statement of the evidence before the other House, whose duty it would be, upon being apprised of the fact, to take proper measures to inquire into it and punish the offender. In this connection, it is not necessary to refer to any liability to prosecution which exists under the Defence Regulation made under the Order-in Council of 11th December.</p>
