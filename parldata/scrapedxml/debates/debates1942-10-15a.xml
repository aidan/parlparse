Of these, 430 were fined 115 sentenced to imprisonment and 12 bound over. Fifteen cases were dismissed. The number prosecuted for failing to comply with lawful and reasonable orders or for persistent behaviour at work impeding effective production was 3.

<p>Is my right hon.

<p>I must remind my hon. Friend that in these cases affecting miners, I act in consultation with the Ministry of Fuel and on the advice of pit production committees. On that footing, after they have dealt with the cases, and they report a case as being one in which there is absolute refusal to obey the discipline of their own men, I am asked to take action. I must then carry out the law. The final sanction under the Defence Regulations is imprisonment, and I cannot interfere with that.</p>

<p>The answer to the first part of the Question is, "Yes, Sir." As regards the second part of the Question, it is not now necessary for women over the age of 30 to obtain green cards before taking employment. As regards others, I cannot undertake that green cards would be issued irrespective of circumstances, since this would destroy all control over the supply of labour, but they are given in all proper cases.</p>

<p>Has the Minister himself, or those for whom he is responsible, not stated, in a leaflet issued by the Ministry, that the demand for female labour in the heavy industries has practically been met?

<p>On the first part of the Question, I would refer my hon. Friend to the recent report of the Committee of the Medical Research Council on tuberculosis in war-time. The production of the standard apparatus has not yet reached a stage at which its cost can be closely determined, but it is expected to be in the region of &#x00A3;1,500. Apparatus of this kind is not, I understand, subject to Purchase Tax. It is not proposed to make special grants towards this particular item of cost to those county councils and county borough councils who will be concerned, but, as indicated in the statement which I made in reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Llanelly (Mr. J. Griffiths) on 8th October, substantial Exchequer assistance is being given towards the cost of the treatment of tuberculosis.</p>

among children, it is being combated by the Government's policy of advocating immunisation of all children under 15, which has already resulted in the immunisation of over 3,000,000 children since the beginning of 1940, and the expansion of which is being actively pursued.</p>

<p>asked the Minister of Pensions by what amounts the weekly sums paid as War Service Grants to Service men's wives who are also in receipt of children's allowances are to be adjusted and reduced when the new rates of pay and allowances become operative; and can he state the reasons for this decision?</p>
</speech>

<p>The purpose of a War Service Grant is either to provide a certain minimum standard of living for the families of serving men or to assist men who, by reason of their service, are unable to meet commitments in excess of that minimum. The new rates of pay of men serving in the Armed Forces will not affect the amount of any War Service Grant of which their wives are in receipt. The increased children's allowances will, however, form part of the family's income

and will either reduce the amount by which that income is below the minimum standard of 16s. per unit, after reasonable commitments have been met, or narrow the gap between the family's position prior to and during service. Thus in either case the increase alters the basis for the calculation of a War Service Grant and this alteration cannot be ignored. As existing grants are reviewed this factor must be taken into account along with other factors which affect the family income. As various factors come into the calculation of a War Service Grant it is: not possible to say by what amount any particular grant will be affected. Some will be reduced, some may remain unchanged, whilst there will be cases where the increase due to other factors may be greater than the reduction due to the increased allowances.</p>

<p>While I thank the right hon. Gentleman for his reply, is he aware that when the statement was made by the Lord Privy Seal in this House some weeks ago that children's allowances were to be increased, Service men's wives believed that that would be the fact, and that they now feel that they have been cheated, and his departmental arithmetic will not explain away why these grants are not to be added to the wives' income?</p>

<p>There is no question of anybody being cheated at all. The statement was made quite clearly in this House at the time of the announcement of the increase, that in calculating the family income all the income must be taken into account, and I am going to deal with these cases when they come up for review. I can assure my hon. Friend that I shall take a very broad and generous view in this matter, but you cannot possibly separate the (increased allowance for a child from the family income.</p>

<p>That shows that my hon. Friend has not listened to my answer. Increasing the pay of the men has no effect whatever. The only thing we have to take into account is the family income, and these grants were instituted

<p>No, Sir. My assurance was not intended to refer to redundant personnel, and I think the House will agree that where local authorities can maintain or increase the efficiency of their Civil Defence organisation by an increased use of part-timers, it would not be in the public interest to retain any full-time workers so rendered redundant. To remove any doubts, I am issuing a circular to this effect to the scheme-making authorities, with an intimation that they may give surplus personnel up to a month's notice to facilitate absorption into industry of those whose qualifications for other employment are not in immediate demand.</p>

<p>I need not assure the House that I take the most serious view of any suggestion that there has been maltreatment by the police of any person in custody.

The defendant in question had not previously made a complaint to any person in authority, though he has had opportunities to do so when he was before the Magistrate on three occasions before his committal to Quarter Sessions; and his allegations were denied on oath by the police officers whom he mentioned as being concerned. According to the newspaper reports the learned Recorder referred to other statements of a similar character which had reached him and in order that every effort may be made to investigate the matter I am communicating with the learned Recorder and asking him to help me by giving me any information in his possession on which his remarks were based.</p>

<p>I beg to move,
<q>That the Fish Sales (Charges) (No. 2) Order, 1942, dated 30th September, 1942, made by the Treasury under Section 2 of the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act, 1939, a copy of which was presented to this House on 6th October, be approved.</q>
The House may wish me to indicate the reasons why this Order has been presented for approval. When the price control scheme was introduced in June, 1941, the equalisation of carriage charges was an integral part of that scheme. It was clearly desirable and necessary that fish should be distributed as nearly as possible equally over the country. In the ordinary way, if the producers or merchants of fish had themselves had to bear the charges for carriage, they would naturally have been inclined to sell their fish in those markets to which the carriage charges would be lowest, and the restriction on the distribution of fish would have been considerable. Therefore, it was decided to introduce an Order which had the effect of equalising carriage charges by requiring a levy to be paid on all fish in order that the proceeds of that levy might be devoted to the payment of carriage charges. As a consequence of that, it was no longer an advantage for merchants to sell near the ports. It was equally to the advantage of a merchant to sell at a distance if his market was there. The proceeds of that levy, which was then at the rate of 6d. per stone on demersal fish, were expected, together with certain profits made by the Fish Division, to equal the carriage charges that had to be paid. It was estimated that the total amount produced by that levy would be about &#x00A3;1,400,000 in the full year. We had a matter of &#x00A3;2,300,000 to meet. We had certain profits on the Icelandic fish scheme and the Hellyer voluntary scheme which have now ceased and it is necessary to meet the difference between &#x00A3;1,400,000 and &#x00A3;2,300,000 in another way.<br/>
Therefore this Order proposes to vary the levy and to step it up from 6d. a stone in the case of demersal fish to 9d., and in the case of pelagic fish to introduce a levy at the rate of 6d., whereas there


was no levy before. It has been possible to make this proposal without at the same time increasing the cost of fish to the consumer because our examination of costs shows that there is sufficient leeway to allow this levy in the one case to be increased and in the other case to be imposed without increasing the price of fish to the ultimate consumer. The levy is of course borne in the last resort by the consumer, who naturally, in the past, bore this carriage charge in the price which he paid for the fish he consumed. This Order really is a matter of machinery, a matter of adjusting the bookkeeping in the Fish Division. I hope that the House will approve it.</p>

<p>I do not propose to detain the House more than a very few moments, because the explanation of this Order seems satisfactory except on one point. The zoning scheme, with which I think everybody agrees in principle, is now about to come into operation. I should have thought the main object of that scheme was to reduce the distances which fish have to be hauled in order to reach the public. It does therefore seem an odd moment for the Ministry of Food to come to the House and ask for an increase in carriage charges in the case of all white fish&#x2014;I prefer to stick to the old name&#x2014;and in the case of herring&#x2014;which I certainly prefer to the word "pelagic"&#x2014;it seems odd for the Ministry, when they are making reduction in haulage charges, to come and increase the price to the public, because it is on the consumer that the charge will fall.</p>

<p>Yes, I agree; but it seems to me that if the zoning scheme is a success&#x2014;and, after all, the Ministry are only balancing their books&#x2014;they might recapture a sufficient amount on the white fish to enable them to carry on without putting a new charge on herring. I do not want these few remarks of mine to lead anybody to the conclusion that I am against the zoning scheme as such. I think there are certain difficulties which it may take time to work out; but they will be rectified I hope, and it is disappointing that the Minister should now come and

ask the House to increase the charges for carriage on all fish.<br/>
There is only one other point I wish to raise. I think the handling of Icelandic herring ought not to be confided entirely to the English white fish trade interests, who never before the war touched a barrel of herring. The British Herring Trade Association ought to be allowed not only to purchase there herring, but also to arrange for their distribution. This is an important point, and there is considerable feeling in the North-East of Scotland that the English white fish people should not be allowed to take over this trade just because they are an important part of the Fish Division of the Ministry. There is a strong feeling that this business ought to be given to the people who have been conducting the business for 50 years and more, and who, owing to the complete closing of European markets, are now suffering very considerably.</p>

<p>I am much obliged to my hon. Friend for raising the matter of the economies that are likely to result from zoning. We do hope there will be considerable economies. They will be used in the first place to meet the deficit in the current year, and after that we hope they may be passed on to those who deserve the reward. On the matter of handling the Icelandic herring, I will undertake to look into the matter, and I hope I may be able to satisfy my hon. Friend.</p>

<p>I wish to raise a matter, which I think ought to receive attention, in regard to the position of pensioners in the Civil Service, the local government service, the teaching


profession, the police service and the prison service. AU these categories of people are covered by superannuation schemes. Some, as in the case of civil servants proper, are non-contributory schemes where the whole cost falls upon the State. Others, as in the case of the teaching profession, are contributory schemes, with part of the cost falling on the State, the other part being met by the contributions of the individual officers. Usually the pension is related to the length of service which the individual has put in, but under all the schemes there is a ceiling beyond which the pensioner cannot go. In the last war the same problem cropped up. There was a big increase in the cost of living. It was discovered that pensions which might have been all right in the circumstances of 1914, became hopelessly all wrong with the rising prices that took place in the last war, and the State did in fact take steps to adjust those pensions. A special Measure was passed through the House of Commons, which enabled an increase&#x2014;I think the figure was up to 40 per cent.&#x2014;to be made in the amount of these pensions.<br/>
In this war there has been a rise in the cost of living, the amount of which may be disputed. The Ministry of Labour index figure says that the cost of living has increased by somewhere about 27 per cent. In the actual experience of most of us that 27 per cent. would, I think, be regarded as much lower than the actual increase in the cost of living. I think, in the experience of most of us, the appropriate figure would probably be nearer 40 per cent. than the 27 per cent. of the Ministry of Labour index figure. In spite of that very substantial rise in the cost of living, no adjustment has been made in the pensions of any one of these various State services. That is remarkable, because in every other field of the population where we have dealt with people living on moneys from the State, we have in fact made substantial adjustments to the rates of pay or allowances. We have adjusted unemployment benefit, we have adjusted Assistance Board relief, we have adjusted the separation allowances of the Armed Forces. We have adjusted&#x2014;very inadequately, it is true&#x2014;widows' and old age pensions. [<i>Interruption</i>.] Not Army pensions? I take that point. It may be that the scope of my argument to-day

should be wider than it is. If my hon. Friend proposes to raise the matter of Army pensions, he may count upon my enthusiastic support. To-day I am raising the subject in relation to the civil services of the State.<br/>
Not only have we adjusted all the allowances I have mentioned, but we have also adjusted the rates of pay of serving officers in each of the services to which I have referred. In the Civil Service a war bonus up to a maximum figure of 13s. 6d. has been granted. In the teaching profession there is a similar cost of living bonus. Local government authorities have adjusted the pay of their staffs. And the Prison Commissioners have adjusted the rates of pay of serving warders. I submit that the need of the pensioner" is not less than that of the serving civil servant; in fact, it is very much greater. The maximum pension he may draw is one-half of his retiring salary. To pass from the active list to the retired list inevitably involves a very heavy and sharp contraction of the officer's standard of life, and when the pension is eaten into by a very heavy increase in the cost of living, which I submit is probably of the order of 40 per cent., the consequential effect on the officer is very grave indeed.<br/>
Another point I wish to make is that in all the services I have mentioned, particularly in the case of the Civil Service, it is not the whole of the service which is pensionable. It is only that part of the Civil Service which is described as "established," and a man may put in anything up to 15 or 20 years before he is passed into the establishment, and becomes eligible for pension. When he retires it is only that part of service which is established which is taken into account for pension purposes. The result is that many of these pensions are pensions of very small amounts&#x2014;5s. a week, 10s. a week, 15s. a week, &#x00A3;1 a week and so on, and the impact of an increase in the cost of living of 40 per cent. on those very low pensions has produced tragic results among those old servants of the State.<br/>
I want to urge on the Treasury&#x2014;one can never expect the Treasury to be generous; I suppose it would be inconsistent with its function if it were&#x2014;that here is a case which does call for sympathetic understanding and sympathetic


treatment. The Civil Service and other unions have raised the matter with the Government, and have been given various reasons why nothing should be done. One reason advanced to me, in respect to the Civil Service, was that before adjustments in pensions could be made the Government needed to be satisfied that the rise in the cost of living was not a temporary flash in the pan, but would extend over a very long period. I think the House will agree that three years is not an inconsiderable period, and beyond that it is as certain as anything can be, for reasons I will give in a moment, that the rise in the cost of living will persist for many years after this war is over. There is one simple factor which makes that quite inevitable. The Chancellor of the Exchequer tells us from time to time that he wishes to avoid inflation. Of course, he does not wish to do anything, of the kind. As a matter of fact he needs inflation, and he will not be able to arrange his post-war Budgets without it. When he says he does not want inflation, he means that he does not want uncontrolled inflation, but wishes to keep it within certain limits.<br/>
When this war started we had a National Debt of about &#x00A3;8,000,000,000. By the time it ends it will probably be of the order of &#x00A3;20,000,000,000, and probably more. I submit it will be quite impossible to service that Debt with the pound at anything like its pre-war value, because it would absorb the whole of a Budget of ordinary pre-war dimensions. It is a condition of servicing the Debt that we inflate, and it is pretty common knowledge that the Government intend to allow inflation within certain defined areas. But these areas are so wide as automatically to ensure that for a decade, and probably two decades, after this war is over, the cost of living will be substantially higher than in pre-war days. It seems to me that the first criterion which the Government say they require to be satisfied before doing anything about pensions is abundantly satisfied over the last three years and is certain to be satisfied for as far ahead as any one of us can look. The average life of a pensioner from the Civil Service after he has retired is about 12 years. It may be taken as axiomatic that for the whole of the rest of the life of men and women now on pension, they will be confronted with a

cost of living very much higher than that which existed before 1939.<br/>
Another reason sometimes given to us is that if the Government are to increase pensions when the cost of living rises, are we prepared to accept the proposition that pensions should be decreased when the cost of living goes down, because, it is said, if we are not prepared to do that, then we are in fact occupying an illogical and argumentatively indefensible position? My answer to that is that that problem also cropped up in the last war. Exactly the same argument might then have been used. That did not prevent our doing what economic circumstances made necessary. It ought not to prevent our doing so in this war. Day by day, I receive particulars of hardship among pensioners which make very bad reading indeed. It is a shame that men who have put in anything up to 40 years in the service of the State, and have gone on pension, which itself involves a large drop in the standard of life, are now subject to an inroad into the purchasing power of their pension because of this rise of 40 per cent. in the cost of living. It is intolerable that old servants of the State should have to resort to public assistance to eke out the inadequate pension which is given to them at the end of a lifetime of service. I ask the Financial Secretary not to stick to the narrow letter of the law, but to respond, in a human and understanding way, to this very serious grievance. As regards the numbers involved, the Financial Secretary will be better informed than I am, but the total number is probably about 100,000, of old people who have been given no relief whatever since the war started. I urge the Financial Secretary to make a statement which will bring some hope to these old servants of the State in the various services I have mentioned.</p>

<p>I was not aware that this very important subject was to be raised at this hour. I am sure many other Members would have wished to be present. I do not want to add to the very earnest and able appeal made by the hon. Member for Rugby (Mr. W. Brown), except to say a word on behalf of superannuated teachers. Their claim is a very special one. They have, like the civil servants, given their lives in many cases to the service of their countrymen,


and they are retired on exceedingly small pensions. Many of these pensions were just enough before the war to keep them not in any sort of affluence, but in respecability. In many cases they are no longer enough for even that minimum of decent life without the greatest hardship. I would like, on behalf of that most deserving class of our fellow-citizens, to put in my plea along with that which has been made on behalf of the civil servants, and I hope that it will receive the earnest attention of the Treasury.</p>

<p>This Debate has come on sooner than anybody expected, and I am at some disadvantage in countering the figures which the hon. Member for Rugby (Mr. W. Brown) gave. I hope that if I do not specifically contradict every statement he made the House will not think I am accepting them, although, of course, I know that he made them in good faith. For example, several times in the course of his speech he expressed the opinion that the cost of living was up by 40 per cent. on the pre-war cost of living. Of course, that is not the official figure, and no amount of repetition of that figure will make it the official figure. I think the official figure is 29 per cent. I know that the whole basis on which the figure was calculated was in dispute for many years, and that just before the war there was some discussion about altering the factors which went into it; but that alteration was not, in fact, made. Therefore, I repudiate the 40 per cent. figure, although I understand the reasons which actuated the hon. Member in putting it forward.<br/>
The Financial Secretary is always, by stress of circumstances, the embodiment of the negative principle. It is my experience, having been in that office for a considerable time, that when there are concessions to be made, it is generally the Chancellor or the Prime Minister who makes them; but when it is a question of explaining exactly why something which many Members think most desirable cannot be done, the normal procedure is that I should try to give the reasons. We would all be at one, with the hon. Gentleman when he points out that there are many people, alas, in this country who are, through the circumstances of war, suffering hardship, sorrow, and disappointment,

in one way or another. One man's house is blown up, another woman's husband is killed, another man's child loses its life through a bomb, and so on. It is the whole tragedy of war that we are up against. My hon. Friend lifts one small comer of the veil by calling attention to what he considers to be the special hardship of retired civil servants. The matter has been raised in the House on several occasions, and repeatedly my right hon. Friend or I have had to say that we have not found it possible to recommend an increase in the pension rates. It is true there has been no adjustment since the war started. The hon. Member says that this is different from what happened in the last war, but that is not so; there was no adjustment in the last war.</p>

<p>I did not say that the adjustment took place during the war. I said that, as a result of the rise in prices which was caused by the last war, we had to make an adjustment in pension rates. I am urging that the Government should make that alteration in this war, without waiting for the end of it.</p>

<p>I was not trying to make a debating point, but merely to clear up the question of whether there was an adjustment during the war. If the hon. Member did not say that there was, I beg his pardon. There was an adjustment after the war, when the cost-of-living figure had reached 255 per cent. of the 1914 level. That is a very different position from what we find ourselves in to-day. The hon. Member talked about an increase of 40 per cent., but I now have the correct figure, which is for September (all items) 129 per cent. of the 1939 level, that is, an increase of 29 per cent. That is very different from the 255 per cent. mentioned above. The contract which is made with the established civil servant with regard to his pension is that it is fixed with reference to conditions in force when he retires. That is well understood. There is no great evidence, I think, of stupendous hardship at present as a result of the rising cost of living. There are, no doubt, many difficult cases. On the other hand, one has to bear in mind that a great number of retired people in these days, owing to the shortage of man-power, find it possible to get one form or another of employment. It is not universally true


that because a person is pensioned he is not in a position to get any increased emoluments of which we are speaking.</p>

<p>Has not a bonus been given to existing civil servants, teachers and many other classes of the population on the grounds that there has been an increase in the cost of living which is just the same for these pensioners? The argument has been valid for those who presumably are better oft, but it is not apparently valid for those who are living in reduced circumstances on retirement pensions.</p>

<p>I was not prepared to discuss the whole question of Civil Service pay. These are not matters that I, in my office, could enter into lightly and on the spur of the moment, but the fact is that not every civil servant has received an increase of pay because of the cost of living. If I had time, I could give the exact position where the level comes in, but what actually has happened is that there have been certain increases granted in the lower ranks not linked up with the cost of living index. I think the hon. Gentleman was in at the earlier discussions, at which I was also present. It was really at that time done with a view to seeing that the scale was kept somewhere in relation to the scale which was available for people in outside industry in corresponding classes. I think that is really what the position was.</p>

<p>Is it not true to say, broadly speaking, that these increases in war bonus have been given because of abnormal conditions due to the war? These abnormal conditions are created by a number of different factors. There was an increase in wage rates and a corresponding relative decline in the value of goods and also an increase in the cost of living. It is true that the pension is given as a sort of contract at a time when a person will retire, but war conditions are entirely abnormal, and the right hon. and gallant Gentleman ought to meet that situation as far as civil servants and teachers are concerned.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman is merely reiterating the plea. I was just trying to make the point&#x2014;I was not discussing the whole question of Civil Service pay&#x2014;that such rises that were made

were not directly related to any particular rise in the cost-of-living figures.</p>

<p>They were not related to that but to a variety of factors, and I think the hon. Gentleman accepts that. However, this is a side issue which we are not disposed to discuss to-day. I know that anything can be discussed on the Adjournment, but it is a little more easy for the Minister to reply if he knows what the subjects are going to be. The position is&#x2014;we are all agreed in this&#x2014;that there has been a rise in the cost of living and that in certain cases&#x2014;I do not say universally, nor does the hon. Gentleman claim it&#x2014;it must have brought hardship and difficulty to these pensioners. The question therefore arises whether this is the moment in which anything should be done to ease that position. I can give, if anyone wants them, the references to the series of questions at different times asked by various hon. Members as to whether the Government were prepared to introduce legislation which would be required to deal with this problem. The answer which has been given has been, "No, we are not prepared to introduce legislation at the present time on this subject." My right hon. Friend has based himself on the contention that the moment is certainly not opportune nor are the conditions such as to make it necessary. The increase in the cost of living which necessitated action of that kind not during but after the last war were very different from the position as it is to-day.<br/>
On the other side of the picture, one has to bear in mind that while clearly the Government have particular relations with those pensioned persons who used to be in their service, yet the Government as a whole have to take the widest view of these problems, and one has to bear in mind that the Civil Service pensioner is not the only pensioned person in this country. There are other people who through the cost of living and the decline in interest rates and so on find themselves no doubt also in a very difficult position. Imagine a couple of brothers who years ago decided to be clerks. One went into private employment and one into the service of the State. The man who has been retired perhaps even under a superannuation scheme of his firm has no prospect of getting his pension increased by anybody.


For the man who has saved and put his money, say, into house property to use the income from that as his means of livelihood, and has his house destroyed by a bomb, there is nothing that can help him in his conditions of day-to-day existence. The Government have to have, I think the House should recognise, a pretty wide view of all these small interests, and our policy, which has been discussed before and no doubt will be discussed again, and to which sufficient attention is not always paid, of trying to cope with the problem of the rise in the cost of living and the hardships of those who are on low income standards, has been a general stabilisation policy with regard to food prices and the necessities of life, and the increased control which is being exercised both by rationing and by price control of the reduced quantity of goods in the market to-day.<br/>
I would commend to hon. Members on that point in case they do not think it is a very valid one&#x2014;I hope they do&#x2014;to look up some remarks made by the hon. Member for East Ham, South (Mr. Barnes) when we discussed agricultural and food policies on 28th July of this year, where he gave figures, which appear in the OFFICIAL REPORT, showing the amazing result of this policy of stabilisation of food prices during this year as compared with what happened when there was no such policy in 1918, and the absence of that policy in those days was one of the factors which caused the great increase in the cost of living which made it necessary, after the war, to look into and reopen the whole question of these pensions.</p>

<p>Will the right hon. and gallant Gentleman also look at the same Debate and contrast other observations by hon. Members concerning essential commodities which were not controlled in relation to the Minister's own statement, that we should all sooner or later have to become vegetarians? Observations were made by certain hon. Members directed towards the prices of cabbages, beans and other essential commodities which are in daily use and not controlled at all, but which have to make up the family budget. Pensioners can hardly benefit by the explanation the right hon. and gallant Gentleman is giving when they have to pay such high

prices for uncontrolled but essential commodities in daily need.</p>

<p>But for all that the general stabilisation policy of the Government has been of enormous assistance. That is agreed, and that is one of the new factors which must be borne in mind when comparing the difference in the conditions of people now with the conditions of corresponding people in 1917&#x2013;18. I cannot be expected&#x2014;nor would the hon. Gentleman expect me&#x2014;to agree with what he said about inflation or its desirability or all the rest of it. It is not for me to lay down any proposition, but I dare say that if it was found that the cost of living had risen by 200, 300, 500 or even 1,000 per cent., a great many things which we are not doing to-day might have to be looked at. We might have to reconsider not only this problem but others. Although there are hardships in certain cases, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor has asked me to say that he does not see his way to recommend legislation for tackling the problem of pensions for civil servants. Such hardships as there are, grievous although they may be on individuals, are not of such a general character, nor has the cost of living risen to such a figure, as to make it necessary in his view, and in the view of the Government, to re-open this question at the present time.</p>

<p>I think we all agree that degrees of hardship vary enormously, but in the lower rates they are grave and acute. If the right hon. and gallant Gentleman cannot meet the whole case, cannot he draw a line, say, at &#x00A3;3 or &#x00A3;2 per week, and then give relief under that? If he cannot meet the whole case cannot he meet the worst aspect of it?</p>

<p>It is true that subsidies have been given, but they effect everybody, whatever the range of income may be. I want to put in a plea here for teachers who are on pensions. After all, when we debated the Teachers' Pension Bill in Committee it was then laid down that pensions were deferred pay, not something coming out of the sky and through the generosity of the Treasury, but something worked for and stored up. Former teachers have stored up this deferred pay, and now they find that owing to the abnormal circumstances of the war the money has greatly reduced value. There are in the teaching profession people with pensions as low as 25s. or 30s. a week. Many of these people have written to me to point out the difficulties which they are in to-day. I hope I am not a snob, but these people have had to carry into a pension period a standard of life, a respectability, that they had to maintain while they were having salaries, and their hardship is very severe.<br/>
I ask the right hon. and gallant Gentleman whether something can be done along the lines of the bonuses which have been granted on salaries. I understand that both in public employment and, in many cases, private employment, a salary ceiling has been fixed, sometimes at &#x00A3;450 a year or &#x00A3;500. Cannot the Government fix a ceiling? I do not know whether they are prepared to receive a deputation of Members who are keenly interested in this

matter, because this question cannot be bargained and argued about in detail across the Floor of the House. I think it would be a good thing if some of us interested in the Civil Service, teachers and other organisations and associations could meet the right hon. and gallant Gentleman and put to him further details, so that we could enlist his sympathy, intelligence and ability. So, I ask whether there is any hope of a deputation being received.</p>
