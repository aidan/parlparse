<p>asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer how many notifications of Bank interest exceeding &#x00A3;15 have been received by the Inland Revenue Department under the provisions of Section 27 of the Finance Act, 1951; in what proportion of cases have the taxpayers concerned failed to return the amount, or the full amount; and what amount of unassessed tax and penalties has already been recovered.</p>

<p>Up to 31st March, 1953, about 1,200,000 notifications had been received. In about one-quarter of the cases failure to return the amount or the full amount has been discovered or is suspected. The amount of unassessed tax and penalties so far recovered is about &#x00A3;7 million.</p>

<p>Has the hon. Gentleman's right hon. Friend considered the various suggestions which have been made for drawing the attention of all bank depositors to the need to return interest for Income Tax purposes, especially on Post Office Savings Bank deposits, in order to save the painful personal and domestic circumstances which have arisen through tax being demanded so much in arrears?</p>

<p>My right hon. Friend has not only considered the suggestions, but has taken action on certain of them. If the hon. Gentleman would like particulars, I shall be glad to give them to him if he will put down a Question.</p>

<p>If Parliament approves my right hon. Friend's proposals the tax position will be governed by the ordinary law under which, where a rent exceeds the Schedule A assessment, the excess is taxable, subject to due allowance for repairs, under Schedule D.</p>

<p>Is the hon. Gentleman aware that to follow that practice would throw a very heavy additional burden of work on the Inland Revenue Department and create many additional perplexities for taxpayers? Will he consider the matter and see whether he can remove the troublesome excess rent provisions under Schedule D and try to get the whole of the income on property assessable under Schedule A?</p>

<p>There are some 30 Government securities on the market in widely differing amounts and ranging from stock maturing within a few months to undated stock. A so-called average price for all these securities would be meaningless. For averages for certain groups of Government securities I would refer the hon. Member to Table 142 of the Monthly Digest of Statistics.<br/>

<p>Is the hon. Gentleman aware that his reply will add further to the conviction that the manoeuvre of reducing the Bank rate at that time was not so much for the needs of the economy of the country as to enable a further group of friends of the party opposite to obtain their steel shares a little cheaper than they would otherwise have done?</p>

<p>The Committee's present guidance consists of my right hon. Friend's letter to the Chairman of 4th December, 1951, on general policy, supplemented by his letter of 3rd February, 1953, on the subject of Commonwealth investment. The terms were published in his replies to the hon. Member for Ealing, South (Mr. Maude) on 7th December, 1951, and to the hon. Member for Oldham, East (Mr. Horobin) on 3rd February, 1953.</p>

<p>asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer (1) how many applications have been considered by the Capital Issues Committee for issues in excess of &#x00A3;50,000 since 1st January, 1953; how many have been granted and how many rejected; and what policy is to be followed in the future, in view of the general trends towards a freer economy;</p>

<p>The answer to the first Question is that, up to 18th November, the Capital Issues Committee had this year received 1,202 applications for consent to the raising of more than &#x00A3;50,000. Consent was given to 1,153 applications and 39 were refused. Ten were still being considered.<br/>
On the second Question, I have nothing to add to my reply on 19th November to my hon. Friend the Member for Tonbridge (Mr. G. Williams).</p>

<p>Will my hon. Friend say what recourse may be had by the 39 firms who were refused permission to raise additional capital in appealing against the decision of this somewhat arbitrary body; and, in view of the march of economic events during the last two years, particularly towards freer markets, would it not be desirable to raise the present limit of &#x00A3;50,000 to a more realistic figure of, say, &#x00A3;250,000?</p>
</speech>

<p>On the first point, the function of the Committee is to advise the Chancellor whether particular applications fall within or without the terms of that general policy directive, and if any particular applicant thinks that the decision in his case has been wrong&#x2014;no doubt, because there are other factors which have not been taken into account&#x2014;he can bring these to the notice of the Committee.<br/>
On the second point, I have seen it suggested that the figure of &#x00A3;50,000 should be raised, but I have seen no convincing evidence that this would in any way improve the working of the system.</p>

<p>The hon.

<p>Is the hon. Gentleman aware that the Chairman of the Shipping Federation, as reported yesterday, has stated that we are being ousted from many foreign markets for British goods by credit facilities provided by banks and institutions in other countries, which are enabling Japan and Germany to undercut us and to give quicker deliveries than the British shipbuilding industry is able to do?

<p>At present, the U.K. has a small surplus on its overall balance of payments, but it is essential to increase exports further by determined selling efforts. As my right hon.

<p>The answer to the first part of the Question is, "Yes, Sir." As to the second part, the Government have decided that the salvage of waste food by local authorities will in future be on a voluntary basis, and my right hon.

<p>The answer to the first part of the hon. Member's question is that this matter will not be discussed next week, the business for which I have already announced.

<p>I beg to move, in page 3, to leave out lines 7 and 8.<br/>
For the second year I wish to raise the question whether we should continue the legislation which affects aliens, because it is on this occasion that the House has the opportunity to consider the law upon which the lives, liberty and property of some 400,000 people depend. It is rather a peculiar way of doing it, to be asked to continue an Act of 1919 which, in its turn, continues an Act of 1914 which was passed on 4th August, 1914, the day upon which that Great War broke out.<br/>
It was not an occasion on which, hon. Members can well imagine, there was very much opportunity for detailed consideration, and, oddly enough, this law, which was contained in some 20 Orders made under that enabling Act, has continued without ever once having been discussed in detail in the House prior to last year. Last year there was a fairly detailed discussion, and that discussion has had some results, to which I shall refer the Committee later, but I think it is worth while to consider for a moment just what we are being asked to renew.<br/>
The 1914 Act gives an absolute power to the Executive, without any recourse to law or to the courts, to make Orders to prohibit the landing of aliens, to take their property away, to take their liberty away, to expel them, to say where they shall live, and, apart from this, it provides for conferring upon
<q>&#x2026;such persons as may be specified in the order such powers with respect to arrest, detention, search of premises or persons, and otherwise as may be specified in the order or any ancillary matters for which it appears expedient to provide with a view to giving full effect to the order.</q>
I find it hard to imagine any more absolute police power given over individuals than that which we are being asked to enable the Government to have by that Act. Indeed, it is an Act that I feel would be considered adequate even by a Government beyond the Iron Curtain.<br/>
Yet, whilst on the one hand we are asked for these Draconian powers, and Parliament is being asked to extend them yet again, on the other hand we perceive in actual practice probably an administration which towards foreigners is more humane, more considerate, more reasonable than that which exists anywhere else in the world. Why should the powers which we are asked for be so utterly out of proportion to, so utterly different from, the most humanitarian performance which aliens experience at the hands of the Secretary of State? At every international meeting it lays us open to much misrepresentation when, on the one hand, we put on the Statute Book laws which are the total negation of such documents as the Declaration on Human Rights, and, on the other hand, behave with great respect to human rights.<br/>
This matter was discussed last year, and I then pointed out that one of the

great difficulties involved was that the law affecting aliens, the law which created an offence in an alien which was not an offence in anybody else, was contained in a large number of Orders which it was almost impossible for an alien to discover. I hope that, as a result of that debate, that aspect at least has now been rectified, and indeed I feel that those of us who have considered it our duty to examine in some detail the measures which the Government asked for, may perhaps add to a new Army Act at least the making of a new Order bringing up to date and making ascertainable the laws by which aliens are governed. The consolidating Order is a great improvement upon the Orders which previously had existed and been renewed from year to year.<br/>
I drew attention to a number of powers which seemed to me to be quite unnecessary, and the majority of those to which I referred have now been dropped&#x2014;or, at least, will be dropped when the new Order comes into force in April. For instance, we no longer consider it necessary in peace time to prescribe areas that are not to be visited by aliens. Again, there was a provision renewed from year to year by which any club or restaurant which had a foreign customer could be ordered to open only during certain hours which the police specified, and if it opened otherwise then it could be closed down, it being deemed to have committed an offence&#x2014;and without any recourse to the courts whatever. That Order, I am thankful to say, is also being dropped.<br/>
I think there is a marked improvement regarding the obligation to register at an hotel. A case arose at Oxford where two girls had registered in their own names save that they added the prefix "Mrs." instead of the prefix "Miss," and they were sentenced to imprisonment under the provisions of a Regulation to control the movements of aliens. They were British girls. I am thankful to say&#x2014;and I congratulate him upon it&#x2014;that the Home Secretary took immediate action to cancel those sentences, and has now introduced a provision whereby no prosecution of that sort against English people can be started save by direction of the Public Prosecutor.<br/>
That, I think, is an improvement, although I would just ask this question: why is it necessary for us to register at all whenever we go to an hotel? Why


cannot one control aliens merely by having a notice in the hotel, "If you are a foreigner, then you must register." Why should we all be required to go through the nuisance of registering for no ascertainable reason whatsoever whenever we go into an hotel for a night? I ask the Home Secretary to consider that.<br/>
That leads me to my next point. Surely it is wrong that this should be laid down by Order at all. After all, this is the law upon which the lives, liberty and freedom of no fewer than 400,000 people depend. Surely that is a matter which ought to be dealt with by statute. Surely it is a matter upon which the collective wisdom of this House, working in Committee, could provide most valuable suggestions. This is the sort of Committee point which cannot be raised on the consideration of an Order but which if we had a statute we could discuss and consider, asking ourselves whether the power was necessary. I respectfully submit that this matter ought to be dealt with by statute. It may be that it was convenient first to get it into shape with an Order and that the right hon. and learned Gentleman will be able to tell us that next year we shall have a Bill. If that were so, I should be entirely satisfied. This is surely a matter important enough and of its nature best suited to be dealt with in the proper legislative manner of a Bill and not by an Order.<br/>
I turn to the consolidating Order, which is, undoubtedly, in detail an improvement but which none the less does not deal with the fundamental objection which can be raised. In this country we have three classes of people. We have one class, which includes all our citizens, of people who are subject to the law. We have another class, the visiting forces, who are people above the law. We have a third class, the ordinary aliens, who are people beneath the law. Why cannot we have them all under the law, as is done in America under the great Fifth Amendment of the Constitution, which states that no man shall suffer in his life, in his liberty or in his property save by due process of the law? Why cannot that apply to everybody in this country? After all, in practice we are far more careful of personal liberty and freedom than are the Americans. Why cannot we establish it on our Statute Book? It would be no great inconvenience to us.<br/>
In passing, I want to ask one question about the aliens who are above the law&#x2014;the visiting forces. What is the position there. They are excluded from the new Order to be made and from the application of this Act. Has the Visiting Forces Act yet been brought into operation? Is it going to be brought into operation? What is the position until it is brought into operation? Is there any sign that the Americans are introducing reciprocal legislation? What is the position about this class of alien, men who are at present not subject to our law at all, nor, indeed, placed above it? Perhaps the right hon. and learned Gentleman will be able to tell us.<br/>
The law about the other class of aliens, which we are being asked to renew, falls into three sections. First, there are restrictions upon admission to this country, and I say immediately that any country organised as countries are today must be able to say who shall come in and who shall not. If we organise a social security system, we cannot have it entirely open to everybody who cares to enter. I concede at once that those are restrictions which cannot be other than executive restrictions; the question of who comes in must be one for the discretion of the Government.<br/>
I concede that immediately, but there are two exceptions to it. First, I ask particularly about paragraph 2 (2, <i>c</i>) of the Order which forbids the landing of an alien who has not a certificate of health. Can we be told a little about how that is worked? I remember seeing the terrible distress in the displaced persons' camps among those in whom an X-ray had shown a tuberculosis scar. They were people nobody would have. I hope a lot of those scars were cured, but those people were condemned to remain there all the time because nobody would have them. After all, we have very effective control of tuberculosis, and where there is a family in this country whose relative has had this illness or some other illness, and where the family is prepared to care for the relative, I hope a very liberal attitude is exercised about the discretion which the right hon. and learned Gentleman retains. That is a very important humanitarian point.<br/>
Perhaps a more important political point is the fact that we have always prided ourselves upon the asylum which


we have granted to the politically oppressed. I suppose that at no time in the history of the world have so many people been persecuted for their opinions as are being persecuted now. I suppose that never in the history of the world was the need for political asylum as great as it is today. I should like to see us return to that ancient tradition of ours. It is still our law.<br/>
The Aliens Act, 1905, provides specifically that fugitives from political or religious oppression shall be allowed to come to this country. That Act is suspended by the Act which we are now being asked yet again to renew. Why should it go on being suspended? To a very large extent we have gone on living up to that Act. Why not let us proclaim to the world our intention to provide asylum to the oppressed, to those who are lucky enough to get away from the manifold oppressions which are injuring and fettering the world? It would be a proud thing for us to do. Cannot we return to our ancient law and our ancient tradition? Why should we continue to suspend that generous Act, the Aliens Act, 1905, which provides this right?<br/>
The second general aspect concerns registration. I take no objection to this, for I cannot see why registration, whether it be of aliens or of natives, should be regarded as an infraction of liberty. I cannot see why all our fingerprints should not be registered, although a great many people seem to regard that as a grave infraction of liberty. It is something which we impose upon foreigners without choosing to impose it upon ourselves. I take no particular exception to it.<br/>
The really important provisions, the vital provisions, are the deportation provisions. These are the provisions which affect liberty, affect family, affect the very lives of people, and the breadth of the power is quite untrammelled and unlimited. A man may have lived here, this maybe the only language he can speak, this may be the only sky he has ever seen with his conscious eye. His wife may be English, his children may be English, but at the will of the right hon. and learned Gentleman, without any resort or appeal to the courts, he may be taken from his family, from his children, from the only land he has ever known, from the only place he has ever called home, and ban-

ished. This is a tremendous power. He may be placed on a ship when one knows full well that the only consequence will be that he will have his throat cut the moment he has gone outside the three-mile limit, for when an alien is expelled it is, by this legislation, in the right hon. and learned Gentleman's power to direct upon which ship he shall be placed.</p>

<p>There was the famous case of the Due de Chateau Thierry. He was a French Royalist who claimed to be a political refugee in this country. He had committed no extradictable offence. He had a ticket for America and a passport for America, and he desired to go there, but we&#x2014;it was in war time&#x2014;wished to hand him over to the French authorities, who wished to punish him for no extradictable offence. In spite of his American passport and ticket, on a French ship he was put, and back to France he was sent. These are formidable powers. They are powers to be exercised wholly arbitrarily without any right of resort to the courts. Is it right to take these powers of punishment?</p>

<p>Again, once a deportation order has been made, a man may be imprisoned indefinitely, without any charge and without any machinery by which his release can be secured. A number of deportation orders are made against a good many people whom everybody knows perfectly well cannot be deported because they have no nation, and nobody is prepared to accept them. There is the stateless person. A deportation order can be made against a stateless person and from that time onwards he is there to be imprisoned, without charge, without trial and without limit of time.

<p>I ask the House to consider for one moment how these powers conform with the Declaration of Human Rights of the United Nations, to which we were a party. I will for a moment refer to a few of those provisions to show how strongly in conflict what we are doing is with that Declaration.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1953-11-26a.536.4" colnum="536" time="">
<p>In its Preamble, the General Assembly
<q>Proclaims this Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations, to the end that every individual and every organ of society, keeping this Declaration constantly


in mind, shall strive by teaching and education to promote respect for these rights and freedoms and by progressive measures, national and international, to secure their universal and effective recognition and observance, both among the peoples of Member States themselves and among the peoples of territories under their jurisdiction.</q>
I ask the right hon. and learned Gentleman, and I would ask this Committee, whether by taking these arbitrary powers we are bearing these things in mind. Here are some of them:
<q>Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour,&#x2026;or&#x2026;national origin.</q>
<q>Everyone has the right of recognition everywhere as a person before the law.</q>
<q>All are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law.</q>
The alien, under the powers we are asked to give, has no protection from the law for any kind of action the executive may take.
<q>No one shall be subject to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile.</q>
We are providing powers for these people to be arbitrarily arrested, to be arbitrarily detained and to be arbitrarily exiled.
<q>Everyone is entitled in full equality to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal, in the determination of his rights and obligations and of any criminal charge against him.</q>
We recognize that deportation is a punishment; it is a sentence provided on criminal conviction; but none the less, although on the one hand we recognize that it is a punishment, it is a punishment which, even if the man be acquitted or even if his conviction be overturned on appeal, the Home Secretary retains the arbitrary power to order, no matter how much it may break up the home.
<q>Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country.</q>
We are conferring specific powers to prevent any alien from leaving by our arbitrary choice, if we say so, and we are equally conferring powers to provide that, if he does leave, he shall go to places where he does not choose and where, indeed, he may die.</p>

<p>Then again:
<q>Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.</q>

We are denying that right.
<q>The family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the State.</q>
Again we are taking rights to break up the family, and it is so unnecessary. We have no intention of using these unlimited powers but if we take these powers and say, "You shall have no resort to the courts, you shall have no rights," and we take the powers to do these dreadful things in an arbitrary manner, what is our position before the world and before the United Nations when Mr. Vyshinsky talks about our conception of liberty, when we are asking for such illiberal laws in contrast to our liberal performance?</p>

<p>I referred last year, and I do so again, not only to the Declaration of Human Rights, but to a more ancient and simple law&#x2014;the law of Exodus. There we find these words:
<q>One law shall be unto the home born, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you.</q>
Surely that is a very fine conception. Is it not one of the miraculous&#x2014;if we care to use the word "miraculous"&#x2014;qualities of the Bible that the ethical principles which it expresses are never old, but have a final quality, and I would again say to the right hon. and learned Gentleman that we should not lightly disregard ethical principles which have withstood the test of time as marvellously as have the Commandments of God.</p>

<p>I would say: Let us have a statute, let us look at this again, let us bring our law and our rights into line with our practice. So far as admission is concerned, let us return to that ancient proud privilege already upon our Statute Book. If my Amendment today were accepted, that would be once again the law of the land. The Act which we are being asked to renew suspends the old Act which granted the right of asylum to the political exile. Let those aliens within our land again come within the shelter of our law. The Americans do that. There due process of law applies to every human being whether he be a stranger or whether he be a native. Why cannot that right to due process of law apply equally to every human being within this island of ours, where liberty was in a full sense born.</p>

<p>In the case of that Act, surely we ought to draw a distinction between the mere


visitor to our shores, in whose case, if we do not like his behaviour, it is reasonable that we should ask him to go, and the man whose home is here, who has no other home, who was perhaps born somewhere else and came here when he was a few months old, the man who knows no other home but Britain, the man who is domiciled here. Surely we should draw a distinction in our law between the two classes. We merely ask the visitor to go, but in the case of the other man we impose banishment and the break-up of a family. It is a distinction which should be placed upon our Statute Book so that these men may be brought under the shelter of our law, for surely it is a wide enough tree to cover every human being who comes to this island.</p>

<p>I am sure the Committee is very grateful to my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Northampton (Mr. Paget) for having raised the matter and for the way in which he has presented it. I disagree with him on two matters. I shall give my reasons for disagreement in their chronological order. One matter was that he said that the crisis is worse today than it was 20 years ago or thereabouts. The other was that he said that every alien in the United States has the protection of the Fifth Amendment.<br/>
In what I say here I am speaking only for myself, and I may express some views which are not very widely held, but that is not a new experience for me. In what I say I imply no criticism whatever of the right hon. and learned Gentleman the Secretary of State for Home Affairs, except that I must say that I do not think a lawyer should be Secretary of State for Home Affairs. I should like to tell the Committee why.<br/>
The right hon. and learned Gentleman is a very able, honest and distinguished holder of the Office, and I do not impute any criticism of him. But it is the job of a lawyer to maintain a very high standard of integrity <i>vis-&#x00E1;-vis</i> the practice of his profession. He tends to become attached to the practice and the rules of his profession, and it is one of the traditions of the lawyer that, on the whole, humanity in the law is a bad thing, that hard cases make bad laws, and that one must stand by the fundamentals and dis-

regard the needs of individual cases. That is bad training for the Office of Home Secretary.<br/>
The lawyer who maintains a high standard of integrity earns the respect of his fellows and may ultimately become Lord Chancellor. He gets his reward on earth, but the lawyer who turns towards humanity usually drifts out of his profession and may have some hypothetical reward in a world to come.<br/>
Still less do I impute any criticism of my right hon. Friend the Member for South Shields (Mr. Ede), who was a distinguished Home Secretary and is a very great Parliamentarian. I regard him as one of the kindest men I know.<br/>
My approach to the question is, in the main, that a world which contains anything like an alien or which talks about "foreigners" is a bad world, and I shall develop that theme later. I have no particular objection to nationalism as such. Pride in home, pride in race, pride in shire and pride in family are all part of the tradition of most races and are part of a healthy tradition as long as they do not become aggressive, chauvinistic, narrow or diverted to some race hatred or criticism abroad. Indeed, it might be appropriate for me, in addressing the right hon. and learned Gentleman the Minister for Welsh Affairs, to say that no more moving demonstration of nationalism can be obtained than by hearing five or six thousand Welsh throats singing "Men of Harlech."</p>

<p>Nowhere on earth is narrow local nationalism more apparent than at Old Trafford when Lancashire play Yorkshire. A distinguished "Manchester Guardian" writer, Neville Cardus, has said that he was about to be married on the day when Lancashire opened their match with Yorkshire. He left the ground for a while for this purpose, but he came back to spend his honeymoon on the ground. He recorded that while he was away the score had advanced by 11 runs without a wicket falling, and that the excitement was intense and the antagonism almost unbearable. That is a local example which we may to some extent enjoy.</p>

<p>However, there is a bad type of nationalism, too. There is a bad type of nationalism that we can teach children. Indeed, the very theory that


there is such a thing as an alien or a foreigner is fostered by a type of nationalism. So long as we teach children to sing a national anthem which says
<q>O Lord our God, arise, Scatter our enemies, And make them fall; Confound their politics. Frustrate their knavish tricks;</q>
we are teaching something which is inherently vicious and disgraceful in the modern world. The time has come when the House of Commons in its prayers might consider ceasing to talk about "God, even our own God," as if He were a private God and we had some proprietary right to the Deity so that we could bring Him into our affairs, and sometimes into our colonial affairs, although not too often, because it is regarded as dangerous. I believe that the teaching of a narrow nationalism in the schools is one of the vitally serious influences in regard to the problem.</p>

<p>My hon. and learned Friend referred to the treatment of aliens. Those who love the history of the House of Commons will know that in years gone by there was no subject which more moved the House. Indeed, there were few subjects which more moved the country in the days when Kossuth was a visitor here, although he himself was a racially chauvinistic Magyar and a man who wanted to persecute the Croats; in the days when Haynau was, properly, punished by the brewers of London; in the days when Palmerston was asserting a narrow nationalism, which at least at times played its part in attempting to prevent cruelty in all parts of the world; and in days when, although we still had some responsibility for evil in the world, there was in this country an awareness of the brutalities committed in Europe, or in all parts of Europe except Ireland.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that when Palmerston made his celebrated remonstrance about the excesses of Kossuth in Hungary, Count Schwarzenburg replied that he had not presumed to advise the British Foreign Minister about the Government of Ireland under British rule and he expected reciprocal forbearance on the part of Britain anent Hungary. The circumstances were such as justified that.</p>

<p>In the reception of foreigners and in giving political asylum to the victims of autocrats in other parts of the world, we

used to have a very good record. My hon. and learned Friend has referred to the Act of 1905 which embodied that tradition on our Statute Book. What is the Act which we are considering today? It is the Act which was passed on 5th August, 1914, the opening words of which are somewhat remarkable. They say:
<q>His Majesty may at any time when a stale of war exists between His Majesty and any foreign power, or when it appears that an occasion of imminent national danger or great emergency has arisen, by Order in Council.</q>

"Buford" sailed from New York with its huge cargo of compulsory aliens deported on political grounds without investigation, without redress and without a hearing under the orders of the Attorney-General, Mitchell Palmer. It was one of the most vicious things that happened in regard to the treatment of aliens, and it was in the United States in December, 1919, that the first seeds of Fascism and Nazism were sown in the world. That is a lamentable piece of history, and what is even more lamentable is that our record has got considerably worse as the years have passed. We have nothing to complain about and nothing to boast about in this connection.</p>

<p>I am following the hon. Gentleman with a lot of sympathy, but will he not agree that this is not in isolation, and that the same period has seen the appearance of that unpleasant object the passport, the growth of world wars and great dangers to the world, and that, unfortunately, the mental climate for freedom has become less favourable?</p>

<p>Yes, indeed, I agree with the hon. Gentleman. I am not for a moment suggesting otherwise.<br/>
My hon. and learned Friend made the point that aliens have the protection of the Fifth Amendment. I agree with the hon. Member for Barry (Mr. Gower) that, of course, there was a day when the British passport took one anywhere and when frontiers were places for an exchange of courtesies, and when a Briton could travel the world in freedom. But that day has long since gone. It was only recently that I found myself allowed to enter Northern Ireland without a passport.<br/>
If a committee were to investigate the matter, it might find that a vast sum of money is being expended in the enforcement of unnatural and unnecessary provisions in connection with it. But I entirely agree with the hon. Member for Barry. All I am saying is that that very respectable authority, the Dean of Law of Havard University, Mr. Zechariah Chafee who wrote the brilliant book entitled "Freedom of Speech in the United States," has reviewed the change which has come about since the war period of 1915&#x2013;1919. I am not selecting the Americans for any discriminatory criticism at all.<br/>
The provisions that were sought to be obtained by this Act were perhaps the most comprehensive provisions ever made and have the least statutory protection. I do not doubt that the Home Office do not exercise these powers as ruthlessly as they could. I do not even suggest that they exercise them ruthlessly at all, although there have been cases which one has regretted. But that the powers are ruthless and provide virtually no protection for an alien, no one who takes the trouble to read the Section can possibly dispute.<br/>
The time when British authority and British respect in the world sank to its lowest was in those wretched years of the 1930s, when I know that whoever was in charge of the Home Office at that time&#x2014;and I do not even remember who he was&#x2014;was confronted with a great problem. It was not easy, but it was the time when refugees from Hitler's persecution were coming unauthorised to these shores and were being deported back to concentration camps or execution.<br/>
There was no time when Britain's own treatment of aliens or the treatment of Britons abroad showed less respect for Britain or less respect for the traditions which Britain represented in the past. I remember, as a minor incident, that in 1938 I found myself deported from Germany into Poland because I had not taken the trouble to ascertain the provisions of an order which the late Mr. Hitler had made about a quarter of an hour earlier. He made the order at 11.45 a.m. and I was tipped out of a train on the German frontier at noon. I was locked up in a refreshment room under an armed Nazi guard for some hours until we found a telephone which was working and rang up the British Embassy in Berlin. The reply received from the Embassy was that the Germans could not do it, but they were doing it at that moment. The fact that I survived to tell the tale is apparent to the House, and I survived without any obvious physicalharm.<br/>
But the bitter brutal tragedy of this persecution in those days was not merely the result of the failure of British policy, but almost a direct result of the foreign policy of the victors of Versailles who planned a treaty in which new boundaries were created without any consideration of the rights of nationalities and minorities. They created a new Europe and new countries, with the result that one of the features of those 20 years&#x2014;perhaps the feature which will impress itself most on history out of all the features of the last 50 years&#x2014;was this wretched story of minorities being driven from their country, of displaced and dispossessed persons being driven hopelessly and helplessly as refugees, and of the stateless persons, the people who have no tribunal to which they can appeal in law for any protection and no land to give them home or even house room.<br/>
We have seen in the last week or two the extraordinary case of Mr. O'Brien who, apparently, spent some years on boats of various kinds being deported from one country to another until he was received into a Central American country only a week or two ago after travelling for literally hundreds of thousands of miles. He was one of the fortunate ones. How many have ended their lives in despair?<br/>
Surely, we have reached the stage when, if we are going to examine this whole problem of aliens, we ought here and now to summon a conference to deal with it on rational lines. The climate at the moment is at least right to the extent that quite recently there has been the ratification of the limited Council of Europe Declaration of Human Rights by a sufficient number of members to bring that Declaration into existence. I think it was only yesterday that in the House of Lords a conference on methods to enforce it was concluded.<br/>
The Secretary of State for the Colonies has told us, somewhat to our surprise&#x2014;and I think not without a shade of cynicism&#x2014;that he has extended the provisions of the Declaration of Human Rights to 42 British possessions beyond the seas. It is unfortunate that, as far as I can see, the only power to enforce this revision has not been ratified by Her Majesty's Government. There would be no difficulty&#x2014;the machinery is there&#x2014;in calling a conference at this moment in an endeavour to try to get a new approach in Europe to the whole problem of aliens.</p>

<p>I wish to raise one problem which I have raised from time to time with the Foreign Office and with the Home Office which is symptomatic of these difficulties. It is the case of Mr. and Mrs. Jerko who live in Oldham, and who have been living there since 1946. They have engaged a highly reputable and energetic firm of solicitors in Oldham to look after their affairs. They were both born in the Balkans, in a village which is now part of Yugoslavia though, of course, there was no such country when either of them was born. They were driven away as refugees by wartime circumstances and found themselves in 1945 in the American zone of Germany. Their child was born there&#x2014;I think I am right in saying their only child. They sought refuge in this country. They claim they were told that they could not take the child with them or that there would be difficulty about the child. I do not know whether this is one of the misunderstandings that happen inevitably when people talk in different languages or because of an unhappy, overworked officer having to deal with hundreds of cases a day.</p>

<p>At any rate, they left their child in the care of a relative now living in Poland.

For years they have been trying to get that child back, and for years every human effort that can be made has been made. I do not know what more can be done. I do not know what the Home Office can do&#x2014;I attribute no blame to them.

<p>I have written to Poland and to the Yugoslav Embassy. I have had courteous replies from everywhere, but everyone says that nothing can be done. It is an incredible kind of world in which that sort of case can exist, and in which all the powers of State and all the organisations of embassies and all the provisions for consultation cannot prevent parents from being separated for life from their child because of a sheer accident, with each living in wholly different circumstances and wholly different countries.</p>

<p>To come back to the question of the United States for a moment, I would suggest that although the influence of the United States today in world affairs is due substantially to her enormous economic power&#x2014;that great, almost Frankenstein monster of economic power&#x2014;her influence in world affairs was at its highest when she had produced a system of receiving immigrants from all over Europe, and turning them in an incredibly short space of time into welcome citizens of a great new country. I think that was the greatest contribution any nation has made to a spirit of internationalism. It was well in the spirit of the Founding Fathers of the Constitution, well in the spirit of the Sage of Philadelphia, that for years the Statue of Liberty really meant what its title said. I want to remind the House of those words of Emma Lazarus:
<q>Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me. I lift my lamp beside the golden door.</q></p>

<p>I wish this was the kind of world in which one could send that little quotation to Senators McCarron and McCarthy in the hope that they would read it and take it to heart. I wish it was the kind of world in which we could get away from some of these animosities, from some of these dissensions, from some of these dichotomies. I see that there is a Motion


down on the Order Paper condemning the persecution of Catholic priests in Poland. I have signed it because I object to persecution. Some of my hon. Friends have put down a Motion condemning the persecution of Protestants in Spain. I would have liked to sign that also because I have always tried to protest against injustice wherever I see it, and perhaps there is no worse injustice than in this conception of an alien.</p>

<p>At some time someone ought to sit down and wonder what an alien is. It is to be remembered that we are aliens in most of the countries of the world and that the conception of a foreigner is not a static one. Nor, indeed, will the views of varying states or governments naturally conform to a specific idea. It may be well to remind the House that in the view of the Emperor Tiberius the only loyal Jew in Palestine was Judas Iscariot. But one should not test the views or opinions of a foreigner by his reaction to our particular democratic ideals. It may be that this is the worst mistake which is being made in the world today.</p>

<p>If we really are approaching this subject of aliens seriously; if we really are anxious to see substituted for this wretched Act, some cogent and comprehensive provisions with regard to the treatment of aliens, we have to decide what are our basic and fundamental principles and which way we intend to go. Everyone knows that it is easy for a back bencher to talk about these things and that it is very difficult for Governments to interpret them and put them into force. No one wants to indulge in purely fractious criticism. Everyone realises the immensity of the problem of dealing with aliens, and everyone realises what I regret to say, but what has to be said, that at the slightest sign of unemployment there is still a reaction to the presence of working aliens here. It is one of the obvious signs that the sense of international solidarity amongst the workers is not so strong as it was 20 or 25 years ago.</p>

<p>In those circumstances I suggest that we have to decide where we are going. On that, no thinker of today has had any hesitation. People who say that this is a remote ideal, that it is an impracticable conception, that it is the wrong method of approach, have only to take

up the writing of anyone on this subject in the years immediately past or the conceptions based on the Declaration of Human Rights, to which my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Northampton (Mr. Paget) referred. The ultimate objective must be a world in which foreigners have been abolished and in which there is a central federal government representing the whole world. That must be the ultimate ideal.</p>

<p>If we could imagine for a moment that by the wave of a magic wand such a conception had been achieved, we would find what we had to do to advance towards it. If we could imagine that we had a world government in operation, that we had a world police force sufficiently powerful to control it; if we had international law based upon the fundamental conception of human rights, which is vital; if we had the basis of democracy given to all subject peoples, then our conception of an alien would have ceased to exist. The very necessity for passports would go. There might be some restrictions on vast industrial migration, but the whole of those circumstances would be altered.</p>

<p>I am sure that the Committee is obliged to the hon. and learned Member for Northampton (Mr. Paget) and the hon. Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Hale) for raising this matter, and indeed for the manner in which they have put their case. The only quarrel that I have with the hon. Member for Oldham, West is that he referred to nationalism in very derogatory or critical terms. I do not think that it is possible after emergence from a great war to deny the nations of the world their nationalism. They have only been able to fight because of their nationalist spirit. Even Russia had to revive the spirit of the old generals and had to call on men to fight in the name of Holy Russia. They had to forget international brotherhood for the time being and I think that the hon. Member for Oldham, West, although idealistic in his conception, will have to wait a long time before he can eliminate nationalism, and I do not think that it is wise to eliminate it to the extent that he suggests.</p>

It is a horrifying and very disturbing thought that even today, some eight years

after the end of the war, there should be so many millions of homeless and hopeless aliens and refugees in concentration camps in Germany, for that is what they are. Although the reputation of this country as a sanctuary for wandering refugees throughout the world has been magnificent in the past, it seems to me that we have now become an over-populated country into which, whatever the desires of the Home Secretary might be, it is almost impossible to admit any more. It is impossible economically to give full rein to our natural sympathy.</p>

<p>I wonder sometimes if the Government have taken the fullest cognizance of the Emigration Council, which has interesting and stimulating plans for taking refugees and homeless from Europe to countries beyond the seas. If they could take more interest in that council the Government would be helped and hope would be given to many who at present are hopeless. Some time ago the Home Secretary, I suppose in conjunction with the Foreign Secretary, agreed to the reception in Britain of 700 refugees from Europe. I admit that it would be terribly difficult to select them. The priorities and the conflicting claims of all those who would give their lives almost to come to this country or some place of freedom like it are almost beyond solution.</p>

I have written to him already, but no doubt in the plethora of appeals that are made to him it has not yet come to his notice. It refers to old men who fought for us in the First World War in Serbia and Yugoslavia. Theirs was the only country that raised the standard on our behalf when we stood alone. They persuaded their young king to revolt against the decision of the Government and to stand by Britain and fight for freedom. They suffered terribly in consequence.

to help them and there are many good and kind people who do so, but I appeal to my right hon. and learned Friend not to say in his reply to me that they must take their place in the queue. If they have to do so, they will be dead before their turn comes. This whole subject of refugees and aliens needs a great deal of thought and great sympathy, but if my right hon. and learned Friend deals with this one particular class it will go a long way towards relieving the consciences of people in this country with regard to the claim that weighs heavily upon them.</p>

<p>That should be said rather more emphatically than it has been said.<br/>
Let us remind ourselves and other countries of what we have done. We have more to do, but it is quite remarkable to recall what has been done already by this country under the administration of my right hon. Friend the Member for South Shields (Mr. Ede) and the present Home Secretary. My hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Hale) mentioned the Council of Europe and wondered whether there could be a conference on this subject under its auspices. He quoted from the text of the Convention on Human Rights which has been drawn up by that Council. The present Home Secretary was the distinguished chairman of the committee that drew up that document. Since we were pioneers, both under the last Government and this Government, in the ratification of that Convention, I ask the Government whether we might not take the lead too in such an international conference. My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Northampton (Mr. Paget) has stressed a number of disadvantages of our present system. He is probably right in supposing that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages, but it is a close balance.<br/>
We sometimes forget one of the advantages of our present system of aliens control. It is that, provided we have a

vigilant Opposition, we can have a debate every year. If the Opposition is not vigilant, we will not have that debate, but last year, with a vigilant Opposition and particularly with my hon. and learned Friend, we were highly critical. The result has been a great improvement in the form and content of the Order relating to aliens.<br/>
One of the advantages of the present system is the degree of discretion left to the Home Secretary. That means that he can be under pressure from Members of Parliament on matters affecting aliens, for instance their admission and treatment. As Under-Secretary of State to the Home Department, I had to stand at the Box to defend the Department in an Adjournment debate which was highly critical of the action of my right hon. Friend. I have seen and heard many questions on this matter and dealt with many individual cases raised by hon. Members. That is a real advantage of having wide discretion left to the Home Secretary and having Members of Parliament prepared to bring pressure on him.</p>

<p>I can only say, from my experience and from the experience of others in the Home Office over many years that aliens do come to Members of Parliament. Most hon. Members have had aliens come to them and there are organisations to protect aliens who bring their cases to Members of Parliament.<br/>
I think it is right that sometimes we should realise how much aliens on the whole appreciate what is done for them in this country. Here I quote from a letter which came to me when I was Under-Secretary at the Home Office three years ago. It is typical of a number which the Department have received:
<q>Dear Sir,</q>
<q>Would you please excuse me for bothering you with this letter. I feel however it is not only my gratitude which I would like to express but also my duty to write.</q>
<q>I came to this country under unusual circumstances, having left Czechoslovakia after the Communist <i>coup &#x010F;etat.</i> Here I found protection and political freedom and although I had left my own poor home-land I felt at home in this country.</q>


<q>Now when because of family reasons I have to go to Canada I would like to thank you for some kind hospitality which has been afforded to me here.</q>
<q>I will always be grateful for it and I will never forget the charm, chivalry, and all the other good qualities of your countrymen, which put them in the first place among nations.</q>
<q>May God bless your beautiful country and protect it from all violent changes.</q>

We have gone a long way from the days of 100 years ago when one of my predecessors, representing the ancient City of Lincoln, could get up in this House and say that one of the reasons why he was opposing the 1851 Exhibition was because it would bring foreigners to this country. This, he said, was in itself a bad thing because if foreigners came neither our silver forks nor our servant maids would be safe.</p>

<p>The hon. and learned Member for Northampton (Mr. Paget) and the hon. Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Hale) deserve our thanks, because this issue deserves attention. The hon. Member for Oldham, West painted a rather vivid picture of certain changes which have come over our thinking in the last 30 years. That change has not been confined to our attitude to aliens, but is concerned with many things affecting our international relationships. I thought perhaps the hon. Member pursued the argument dangerously far when he compared it with the situation in the 19th Century.<br/>
We can well understand why this country in the middle of the last century was able to afford asylum to political refugees who were escaping from countries where there was no kind of liberal democracy. They were coming here not to participate in our life, but generally to learn something of our system and, ultimately, to go back to their own countries. But in the last two wars we have been faced with a different problem of people escaping from their own countries. That may explain why a change has come over our thinking and why in some cases governments have been forced to take certain steps to protect their own communities. After all, one of the major duties of a government is to protect its own citizens. It is not surprising that after the Spanish Civil War when we learned&#x2014;perhaps for the first time in modern times&#x2014;the danger of

that new term "Fifth Column," governments all over the world have somewhat tightened restrictions on the entry of other nationals.<br/>
Nevertheless, I feel that within the terms of this Amendment there is a strong case for the attention of the Home Office. In my own area&#x2014;in fact all over South Wales&#x2014;there is a large community of Italians. Many of the children of those families were born in South Wales, while other children were not born there. Technically the children who were born in Italy and came here in their early days are still aliens and very peculiar cases arise. Recently I heard of a case of a man who went back to Italy to see his dying mother. He stayed there for a certain time after her death to put the affairs of the family in order. Now I understand he has imperilled his chance of returning to his own country&#x2014;for this country is really "his own country."<br/>
While it is proper for the Home Office to have power in certain cases to deport people who are undesirable, and perhaps to refuse entry to this country, it is wrong that a person who came here in childhood should stand in a different position before the law than I do. Why is it that if I am convicted in a court for a certain offence the only penalty that can be imposed on me is the penalty fixed by the law for that offence, while another person who came here in childhood, being convicted of a similar offence, may not only be punished for that offence but may have this terrible additional penalty of being thrown out of the country which provides the only home he has ever known?<br/>
That is why I support the hon. and learned Member for Northampton, who said that this question should be carefully examined. I hope that in the coming months my right hon. and learned Friend will find it possible very closely to examine the Regulations affecting aliens. I feel that there is real need for some modification.</p>

<p>We have at last heard the voice of the original inhabitants of these islands. After all, there was a time when the ancestors of all the rest of us, except you, Mr. Hopkin Morris, were aliens. Therefore, we must all welcome the way in which the hon. Member for Barry (Mr. Gower) has been


reconciled to the presence of the remainder of the population of the country.<br/>
From my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Northampton (Mr. Paget), and my hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Hale) we have had a very fine exposition&#x2014;with the bulk of which I concur and from none of which as far as I know do I very severely dissent&#x2014;of the traditional outlook of this country on this issue. I regret that some of the restrictions that have been placed on the entry and retention in this country of aliens have had to be made. I was particularly grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, West for the remarks he made about me.<br/>
I am not going to say that I think a lawyer is necessarily disqualified from being Home Secretary, although I think that some of my predecessors who were lawyers on occasion did take a rather pedantic view of some of the issues that have been raised today. But, so far as I know, there has been no hardening of the attitude of the Home Office towards aliens during the tenure of office of the right hon. and learned Gentleman.</p>

<p>The dreams of the Home Secretary are often quite as vivid as those of my hon. and learned Friend. If he dreams one way he must not be surprised if the Home Secretary dreams in another way, and his villains are not the same as those of the Home Secretary.<br/>
It must be realised that on accepting the doctrines laid down by the hon. and learned Gentleman and by my hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, West one is faced with the day-to-day difficulties which confront one in the administra-

tion of the law and in current public opinion. While I was glad that my hon. Friend the Member for Lincoln (Mr. de Freitas) asked the question which he did of the hon. Member for Ayr (Sir T. Moore)&#x2014;and I do not think any country in the world can claim a better record in this respect in the post-war years than this country&#x2014;I always have in the back of my mind, because it revealed itself in my postbag, the fact that not very far below the surface, and always acting in opposition to the liberal sentiments of my hon. and learned Friend, is a xenophobia which can easily be roused and which in some past years has been as clearly expressed in this House as were the liberal sentiments of the middle of the 19th Century.<br/>
In the first 10 years of this century, which unfortunately I am old enough to remember vividly, there was a very strong xenophobia in this country about the tremendous number of people who had come into the country from Eastern Europe. That is always latent, and in a period of severe unemployment it may become very strong. The Home Secretary of the day has to bear that in mind in his administration of the law.<br/>
Neither do I think that the hon. Member for Barry put the matter quite fairly when he suggested that for a first offence in this country a man, who had no other country that he knew but this one and who was legally an alien, would be deported. I do not know of any such case, and I did administer this law, I can assure the House&#x2014;and as I am sure that the right hon. and learned Gentleman does&#x2014;with a heavy sense of personal responsibility. All my upbringing and personal sentiments coincide with the line of argument adopted by my hon. Friends, and it was a matter of grief to me that on occasion the public good did demand that one should take what appeared to be very severe action; although I do not think that on any occasion has action been taken as severe as that mentioned as the kind of ultimate power of the Home Secretary.<br/>
Let me give an example. I had to deal with a very difficult problem which arose out of the large number of Polish soldiers who remained in this country after the war. At one time there were over 100,000 of them, and we tried to deal with them through the Polish Resettlement Corps. A number of these men had never had


any other occupation in life than that of being a soldier. Some of them were officers who quite early in life had reached a comparatively high rank with quite a substantial income. When we asked what civilian occupation they would like, they said, "Colonel"&#x2014;and a very good civilian occupation, too.<br/>
But as the Corps disintegrated, there were not enough positions of that rank to go round and I came across just a small group who had decided that the British people were so kind that, if they only stayed out long enough, no action would be taken against them. I had to remember that I had been a sergeant major. I took drastic action against 20 of them and then the rest of the colonels volunteered for civilian life. I give that as an example of the way in which one has as Home Secretary, to deal with a number of practical problems, which makes the application of some liberal sentiments very difficult. But I can assure my hon. and learned Friend, and others, that one adopts such an attitude only with the very greatest regret.<br/>
The Home Secretary has placed us under a debt to him for producing, before this debate, the Order which he proposes to bring into force on 1st April of next year. My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Northampton analyzed it, and I think he did so with fairness. After all, it was one lawyer dealing with another, and who am I to be umpire between them? But his analysis seemed to me to be a fair one of what this Order does. Undoubtedly it wipes out some of the features that wartime compelled, and that peace-time may enable us to get rid of, and that is something which I am sure we welcome.<br/>
I share the regret of my hon. and learned Friend that this is submitted to us as an Order, and I have no doubt that we shall have to put down a Prayer against it merely to elucidate it. I do not want it to be thought that what my hon. and learned Friend has said this afternoon, or anything I say, or which may be said by my hon. Friends represents all that hon. Members on this side of the House have to say on the matter.<br/>
When we adopt that course of action, and when Mr. Speaker is in the Chair, or, if it is in the early hours of the morning that we reach this matter, and you, Mr. Hopkin Morris, are in the Chair, we

shall have to vote on the Order as a whole. This is a long Order. There are a good many Bills, about which I hear from time to time from the right hon. and learned Gentleman, which are quite trivial matters compared with it, and compared with the number of detailed individual issues which arise from it. I would ask the right hon. and learned Gentleman whether he considers that the time has arrived when this matter should be dealt with by a Bill.<br/>
It would seem to me that this Order would make a very good preliminary draft of such a Bill, which would provide the House with an opportunity to give attention to the various detailed matters which are raised. After all, the good standing of this country in our own consciences and in the eyes of the world, will, as the years go by, be determined very largely by our legislation and administration in this matter.<br/>
The Order is certainly better than the mass of Orders that we now have. If it does nothing else, it consolidates the position so that aliens and those advising them have now only one document at which to look instead of many. I think my hon. Friend the Member for Nelson and Colne (Mr. S. Silverman) counted up the number that were revoked and found that 21 previous Orders are revoked by this one which, from now on, can be read by itself with reference only to the relevant Acts of Parliament on which its various paragraphs may depend. I ask the right hon. and learned Gentleman to consider whether, among the matters which ought to be discussed as subjects for legislation in the near future, a Bill embodying this Order ought not to be one of the Measures his Department puts forward.<br/>
I would say to my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Northampton that I do not mind signing my name in an hotel register. I do not know how Middlesex would be able to get cricketers if hotel registers were abolished in that part of London which lies north of the Thames. I was once assured by a Surrey captain that the main claim to play for Middlesex was the fact that one had registered in such an hotel. He also added that they once found a man playing for Middlesex who had not that qualification&#x2014;at least not in the name in which he was attempting to play for the


county. I do not see any special infraction of liberty in that.<br/>
The hon. and learned Gentleman does not object to my finger prints being taken, but I do. He objects to signing an hotel register, but I do not. I suggest that these are not matters that are of any serious concern.</p>

<p>While everyone has to sign that relieves the honest hotel keeper of a great difficulty which he has if he has to try to decide who is an alien and ask him to sign. He may overlook a case where a signature ought to have been, obtained. I do not like setting traps for tradesmen who are trying to carry on a perfectly honest business.<br/>
The immediate future of this service will, we presume, be administered largely under the new Order which the right hon. and learned Gentleman has promulgated. I hope that he will bear in mind the request from this side that at an early date we should have an opportunity of considering this issue in a form that will enable the various details to be considered, so that the full sense of Parliament can be obtained on each and every one of these Regulations.<br/>
If that could be done we should probably find that there were some parts of the Order which could be improved and that the aliens&#x2014;the strangers within our gates&#x2014;who are subject to our administration in these matters would have the knowledge that this was a fully considered act of the British Parliament. I do not think anyone can say that is the position today. It is a position which we should attempt to reach.</p>

<p>I certainly cannot complain about this debate taking the time which it has taken today. Last year I defended the procedure which arises in connection with the Aliens Order as providing a suitable opportunity for a general review of the administration of the Order. The Committee has taken advantage of the opportunity very well indeed.<br/>
I would say to the hon. and learned Member for Northampton (Mr. Paget) that my right hon. and learned Friend has noticed his opening words to the effect that the administration in this matter is more humane and considerate here than it is in probably any other country in the world. Not only does my right hon. and learned Friend appreciate that statement, but I am certain that all those connected with the administration of the Order will appreciate what has been said by the hon. and learned Gentleman and by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for South Shields (Mr. Ede) and other hon. Members.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman the Member for South Shields dealt with the matter from a practical point of view. It is important that we should always have regard to the practical needs of the position rather than to theoretical considerations. The present procedure is an anomaly. No one can defend that. Certainly it is not a procedure which was in any way designed in advance. On the other hand, it does not create practical difficulties and it has produced a flexible and useful piece of machinery.<br/>
There was a demand last year for permanent legislation. I do not think that the demand has been couched in quite the same terms today. But, of course, permanent legislation can mean two things. It can mean that the governing Act should be more comprehensive and made permanent in character. My right hon. and learned Friend has listened to what the right hon. Gentleman the Member for South Shields and others have said in that connection. I assure the right hon. Gentleman that this matter has received careful consideration and that it will continue to do so.<br/>
He will appreciate that there are difficulties in this connection. It may well be better to leave the position as it is for a little longer. The world has not settled down altogether. It may be that at an early date we should need something in a different form from what is now contemplated when this matter is borne in mind in a sympathetic way.<br/>
The other meaning of permanent legislation, which is attached to the phrase by other hon. Members, is that the powers of the Home Secretary should be more precisely defined than they are today by


the whole body of this legislation, including the Orders. Hon. Gentlemen in all parts of the House are concerned about the extent of the powers given to the Home Secretary and the method of the exercise of those powers, and rightly so. No one would complain of that. There are those who want to abolish all control of aliens. The hon. Member for Oldham. West (Mr. Hale) made a speech which indicated that he wishes to see all control of aliens in this country abolished&#x2014;</p>

<p>&#x2014;and in the world. The implication was that he wants this country to give a lead. I assure him and the Committee that there is still a very strong pressure to immigrate into this country. It is not without interest to realise that since the war we have admitted no fewer than 250,000 aliens to come and live here on a permanent basis. Most of those aliens were refugees or displaced persons, about 120,000 of them being the Poles to whom the right hon. Gentleman referred. The pressure still continues, and while it continues, quite obviously, some sort of control is essential.<br/>
It has been suggested that there should be some inquiry to see what could be done; this was suggested last year by the hon. Member for Bristol, South-East (Mr. Benn). Since last year, the Orders have been reviewed, and the review has produced the present consolidating Order. But if the suggestion is made that there should be a fundamental change of policy in this connection, I think that that would be quite wrong.<br/>
The sort of suggestion which is made&#x2014;one hon. Member made it today&#x2014;is that we should have something like they have in America, some form of quota system. That would be wholly inappropriate to a country such as the United Kingdom. America has a fixed quota, and provided that an individual complies with certain standards of health and so on, he can be admitted; but when the quota is filled no one else can come in until the next period begins. That would be quite wrong in this country. Our system is entirely different: it is the very reverse of that. The essence of our system is that it permits of each case being considered upon its own merits.<br/>
Perhaps I might say a word about the policy which we follow in this connection. Purely temporary visitors are welcome&#x2014;indeed, the more they come and spend their leisure and their money here, the better; but it is not only those who spend money who are welcome. Tourists and students are all encouraged to come here, provided, of course, there is no intrinsic objection to the individual concerned.<br/>
Then there is a second class of visitor, who comes, in the first place temporarily, to earn his living. People in this class are freely admitted provided that they have a special contribution to make to our economy. Last year some 25,000 foreigners came into the country under the Ministry of Labour permit scheme. They come in for 12 months in the first instance, but if their work and behaviour is satisfactory they get a renewal as a matter of course. In the ordinary way, after four years' approved employment here the conditions are removed and they are able to stay under exactly the same conditions as any ordinary resident.<br/>
That deals with the case of the temporary visitor who intends to be temporary and the temporary visitor who intends to become permanent. Then there is a third class of case: the person who wishes to come here permanently from the start. At present this class is limited to the compassionate case in which near relatives are living in this country. The rules were worked out by the last Government. They have several times been stated in the House by the right hon. Member for Grimsby (Mr. Younger) and, I think, the hon. Member for Lincoln (Mr. de Freitas), and they are not in any way stricter today. On the contrary, they have been relaxed slightly here and there. I am not saying there have been any great relaxations, but it has been found possible in course of time to make relaxations in a few directions. Broadly speaking, however, we follow the same policy as did the previous Government.<br/>
Compassionate cases are by their very nature not capable of precise definition. They range the whole way from the widowed mother, the sole survivor of a Jewish family, with her only child in this country, to the case where a man wants to bring in a mistress when he already has a wife living in this country. There is that enormous range of extraordinarily different cases.<br/>
There must, therefore, be discretion in this matter. If there is to be any control of entry, it must be a discretionary control. We cannot lay down the rules in an Act or an Order or in a whole series of Orders. That is why this new Order is necessarily very wide in its terms. It consolidates some 20 Orders and, as the Committee has already heard, it goes a little further. The changes of substance are not very great but there has been a great deal of re-arrangement and clarification.<br/>
For example, Articles 8 and 9 of the new Order deal with aliens who are refused leave to land or who are stowaways. The old provisions dealing with this class were unduly compressed and were ambiguous. The new provisions set out the position fully and clearly. But no alteration of practice has been brought about. A number of obsolete provisions have been omitted. The hon. and learned Member for Northampton mentioned two of them; they were the old Articles 9 and 10 to which he referred last year. They had not been used for a long time, and it was unnecessary to bring them in again.<br/>
Perhaps I should say a word about the provisions regarding hotel registers, which have been retained in the new Article 19. Very careful consideration has been given by my right hon. and learned Friend to the need for retaining these provisions and it was decided that it was essential to do so for the purpose of keeping track of aliens who are in this country. There are, in fact, fewer restrictions in this connection in Great Britain than, I believe, in any other European country, and probably any other country elsewhere.<br/>
It is asked, "While these provisions may be necessary for aliens, why is it necessary to retain them as far as British subjects are concerned, even to the limited extent provided in the Order that they have to enter their name and nationality?" If a British subject need make no entry in the register, all that an alien need do if he wished to avoid having to enter his name would be to say that he was a British subject. Then, he would not be required to put his name in the register and there would be no trace of him subsequently, so that the

very man who was trying to avoid being traced could escape in that simple way. Of course, it goes much further than that.</p>

<p>There is, at any rate, a significance in "Joe Smith, British." If the hon. and learned Member had waited until I finished my remarks he would have seen that the matter goes further than that. A great many people are not willing to forge their names and run the risk of severe penalties. Supposing that through carelessness an alien did not register, it would be open to the hotel keeper or to his servant, who would probably be employed in quite a humble capacity, simply to say "Well, he said he was a British subject," and the matter would then fall.</p>

<p>It would be quite impossible to enforce this Order at all unless we required British subjects simply to write their names and nationalities. It has been found to work perfectly well in the past, and that is the best answer that I can give to the hon. and learned Gentleman. Of course, it is entirely wrong to use this Article for any purposes other than the purpose of this Order, and my right hon. and learned Friend has already issued advice to chief constables on this matter, and the new paragraph 4 of Article 26 requires the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions, which will ensure that the Article is not misused.</p>

<p>I do not think I need trouble the Committee by going into the methods of control employed under the Order, but I should perhaps mention that some 800,000 aliens came to the United Kingdom in 1952, and that of that total only 1,600 were refused entry. That, of course, does not give any indication of the number which the Order was effective to prevent, because it may very well be that a very large number made no attempt to come because they knew they would be unsuccessful, but I can say that, having regard to the very large numbers involved, both the immigration officers and the police do their work in this connection extremely well. They do it thoroughly.


quickly and tactfully, and I am certain that the Committee would wish me to bear testimony to that fact.</p>

<p>May I say a word about deportation, which has been mentioned? There have been 207 deportation orders made this year, and, in fact, in only two of these cases were the individuals concerned in this country before the war. They were both cases which were considered most carefully and in which there were strong reasons for deporting them, and that is really the answer to hon. Members who suggest that individuals who have spent their entire lives here are whisked away without their cases being considered.</p>

<p>It is quite essential to retain this power to deport as a counterpart to the control of entry of aliens. If we did not possess this power to deport, it would be open to anyone to come here on a visit and later on say simply, "I am not going away," and the control of aliens would disappear. Every sovereign State reserves this right, and if I may refer to the really relevant paragraph in the Declaration on Human Rights, it runs as follows:
<q>In the exercise of his rights and freedoms, everyone shall be subject only to such limitations as are determined by law solely for the purpose of securing due recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms of others and of meeting the just requirements of morality, public order and the general welfare in a democratic society.</q></p>

<p>For example, let us suppose that a worker with a Ministry of Labour permit simply gives up his job, which very often happens. We must have some power to be able to let him take a new job. Or, let us suppose that while he is here he marries a British wife or, indeed, let us suppose all the other possible circumstances that might affect him. We could not possibly provide by statute that a worker who comes here with a Ministry of Labour permit shall have to go as soon as he stops doing that particular job. We must, therefore, have some discretionary machinery, and the discretion is important, not from the point of view of being able to exercise any tyr-ranous power over the alien, but for the alien's own benefit. If we did not have this discretion, the alien would be at a disadvantage all the time. The decisions

which have to be made, both in particular cases and generally, are decisions which are properly Ministerial ones. They raise issues of policy which should be capable of challenge in this House and not in the courts. If there was no power to make a change, it would be found to operate against the alien concerned all the time.</p>

<p>The Joint Undersecretary began his speech by saying that he had no cause to complain of the tone or temper of the debate, which I think we are all grateful to my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Northampton (Mr. Paget) and my hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Hale) for having introduced. If I may say so without presumption, none of us has any complaint whatever about the tone and temper of his reply.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman said, quite fairly, that this occasion has always been treated by the Committee as an occasion for reviewing not so much the nature of these executive powers as their actual administration in practice, and he himself, as did most other people who have taken part in the debate, defended, and not unreasonably, the spirit and temper in which these powers have, in fact, been exercised Perhaps I may say, since many hon. Members who have spoken had some personal point to make, that I am not the least qualified Member of the House to pay tribute to British hospitality to aliens, since I happen to be the son of one who came here in the first quarter of the 19th Century, and I recognize, therefore, in my own person, the merits of British hospitality to refugees. Whether the nation has had an adequate return for its hospitality is a matter on which, perhaps, there may be more than one opinion.<br/>
The subject which is before the Committee is not in fact the actual spirit in which these executive powers are administered, but the much wider question from one point of view&#x2014;though narrower from another&#x2014;whether they are an appropriate subject either for the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill or for delegated legislation.


The essential point which always dominates these discussions is that the effect of this power is to create one class of person&#x2014;and not a small class&#x2014;in our community which is subject to the personal discretion of one Minister for its security and for its liberty.<br/>
No one ever thought, and I think that no one even now thinks in principle, that these are matters which, if things were normal in the world, this House and this country would tolerate. The hon. Gentleman himself said that he wanted us to continue them for another 12 months, with the implication that perhaps it might be necessary to do the same next year. In justification of that he said, "The world has still not settled down." It has been pointed out already that these powers were made under the war-time emergency Act dated 5th August, 1914. The world has not settled down in that 40 years. I doubt whether anyone who has taken part in this debate, or who is responsible at all for the administration of these matters, would dare to prophesy with any confidence that the world would settle down from that point of view within the next 40 years.<br/>
It is commonplace of our time that we are living in a time of transition. All times are times of transition. Our own time has been a time of violent and ceaseless transition, and the unsettlement, as the hon. Gentleman quite rightly said, is still there, and shows no sign of disappearing. Therefore it is artificial to treat this matter as if we are only being asked to continue it for one more year, after which there was some practical prospect of not having to renew it again. Assuming that every one of these powers, as now defined in the new, amending, and consolidating Order, were judged by the House of Commons to be right, reasonable and fair, and if we were prepared to give a unanimous approval to the continuance of these powers, even then they ought not to be done in this way. They ought to be done by permanent legislation in a form which would permit the House to review it and amend it.<br/>
On that point I do not think, with all respect to him, that the hon. Gentleman gave us a satisfactory reply when he said that the world had not settled down, and that these powers were necessary and should be continued; the more necessary

it becomes that the House shall have an opportunity not only of reviewing the general administration of the powers, but the powers themselves. I am not going to discuss the new Order but only to use it for reference. Look, for instance, at Articles 20 and 21, which are not new law but the existing law. Under them, the Home Secretary has absolute power to recommend for deportation, to deport, and to imprison indefinitely pending deportation. The hon. Gentleman said, reasonably enough, that the right to deport was a necessary concomitant of the right to admit or to refuse to admit. I suggest to him that that is not quite so.<br/>
The right to deport might be a necessary concomitant of the right to refuse admission in the case of temporary visitors who break the conditions of their admission, behave improperly and prove themselves in any respect undesirable. The Home Secretary, who has the obligation of saying whether they shall come in or not, ought also to have the right to say, "You came in, and I'm not satisfied with you. You shall go out." Is it reasonable that he should have that power in the case of a man who might have lived here for 30 or 40 years and has no other home or country? It is no answer to say, "But we never do it." We say to the right hon. and learned Gentleman that he ought not to have so wide a power as that, and that if there is to be such a power it ought not to be at the arbitrary, uncontrolled discretion of the Home Secretary or of any other individual.</p>

<p>The right hon. and learned Gentleman the Home Secretary was telling us only two days ago what he thought were the limits of continuing delegated legislation. I hope he will not mind if I quote what he said, and if I adopt the words that he used. Dealing with transitional powers, he said this:
<q>&#x2026;first, that administrative convenience alone was not a sufficient ground for keeping any Regulation or part of a Regulation, but that retention of a provision could be considered only if it could be demonstrated positively that its continuance was necessary in the public interest;</q>
Demonstrated to whom? Demonstrated surely to Parliament, which would have the right to agree or disagree with the proposition.
<q>&#x2026;secondly, that the retention of powers which might be necessary or useful in a future national emergency, but were now in abeyance, could no longer be justified;</q>
That is the whole of the matter. The powers must have regard to an existing war situation, a consequence of one or in anticipation of one.
<q>&#x2026;and thirdly, that in the circumstances of 1953 a less comprehensive range of control and enforcement was appropriate."&#x2014;[Official Report, 24th November, 1953; Vol. 521, c. 200.]</q>

There has never been any difference on the subject of not interfering with liberty in the sense of personal freedom, freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom before the law and freedom from arbitrary executive disposition.

<p>This is really an exception which was taken long ago under delegated legislation by Order in Council for an emergency purpose.

<p>I feel we have much to be grateful for from the Government both in the administration of this scheme and in the consolidation that they have done. I hope very much by next year that they will have considered permanent legislation and also whether they can draw a distinction between the alien who is here on a temporary permit and concerning whose deportation, of course, there must be powers if he does not comply with that permit; and the alien who is not here on a temporary permit but whose home is in this country. I feel myself rather strongly that some form of appeal or some process of the law should be brought into operation before an alien of the second category is banished from his home.

<p>I beg to move, in page 3, to leave out lines 20 to 35.<br/>
I wish to call the attention of the House to the continuance of the Prevention of Violence (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1939. Last year we had a very useful debate on this subject. It is becoming increasingly difficult to complement Her Majesty's Ministers on anything, so with alacrity I take this opportunity of saying at once that last year we got a very sympathetic response from the Home Secretary, and I am sure the whole Committee appreciated the action he then took.<br/>
I am sure also that we in this Committee regret&#x2014;a regret which is shared

by all responsible opinion both in the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland&#x2014;that there has been some evidence of a return to terrorism and violent activities. I, for one, recognize the difficulties of the right hon. and learned Gentleman the Home Secretary. I concede at once that we have learned from experience that democracies are entitled to protect themselves against terrorism from whatever quarter it may come, and I appreciate the difficulties which the Home Secretary previously explained to the Committee arising from the fact that the Aliens Restriction (Amendment) Act, which we have just been discussing, does not apply to the citizens of the Irish Republic. At the same time the citizens of the Irish Republic have freely chosen not to come into the Commonwealth.<br/>
I recognize, too, the perpetual dilemma of the right hon. and learned Gentleman in trying to reconcile the rule of law with the individual rights of each citizen. Nevertheless, we must constantly remind ourselves now that legislation we are considering arose and in what circumstances it was born. In fact, we resorted to this legislation only after those operating the "S" plan decided to abandon all regard for human life and when the Government of the day believed that those conducting these operations were partially at any rate in league with a foreign Power and this country was facing a very real risk of war. In other words, this legislation arose out of very peculiar circumstances and its continuance can only be justified on the grounds of absolute necessity. It is for that reason, I am sure, that the Home Secretary expects this matter, very properly, to be reviewed each year that he seeks the continuance of these powers.</p>

<p>I have referred to the sympathetic response that he gave and the constructive action that he took last year. I think he went a long way to meeting those of us who have doubts regarding the continuance of this legislation. He then told the Committee that there had been no new Orders, and that he only wished to maintain this legislation to preserve the validity of the present Orders. He also said&#x2014;and this is one of the reasons I am raising this matter this afternoon&#x2014;that he would keep under constant review those Orders which were being kept in force. He told us 12 months ago that the position was


that there were then no registration Orders in force, that he had reduced the number of expulsion Orders by nine in the previous 12 months, and had reduced the number of prohibition orders by four. I should like the Under-Secretary of State to tell the Committee what further progress he has been able to make in the past 12 months, and also to consider this further method of review.</p>

<p>Personally, I do not think it is politically expedient to allow avoidable martyrdom. If we can prevent people, however hard they may seek it, from wearing that mantle, we should do so. I therefore ask the Under-Secretary and the right hon. and learned Gentleman to review these cases, regardless of whether requests are made, and if the right hon. and learned Gentleman feels that he has sufficient evidence before him&#x2014;and I do not know what his resources are in obtaining such information&#x2014;making it reasonable to terminate some of these Orders, even though no request has been made, I think it would be a wise and sensible thing to do.</p>

<p>In view of the concession which the right hon. Gentleman made last year, it would be unreal to expect him to forgo absolutely his powers, but in view of the circumstances out of which this legislation arose, I hope we can have an assurance that the question of the lapsing of this particular legislation will continue to be anxiously reviewed. I realise the Home Secretary's difficulties, because I know there is a very valid argument that if we allow irresponsible behaviour by a few extremists it aggravates the good relations between ourselves and the Irish Republic. On that ground I know there is a very powerful argument to continue the Orders, or some of them, at present in force, because most of us accept that there has been a recurrence of terrorism, and that the very terrorism itself can aggravate relations between our two countries.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1953-11-26a.573.2" colnum="573" time="">
<p>In spite of that, however, I feel that the aggravating thing, in connection with our relations with the people in the Irish Republic, is the continuance of the main legislation. It might be quite illogical but it is a fact that this is regarded as a slur by a very large number of Irish people who have no sympathy at all with the I.R.A. and its activities. This is something which has repercussions, not

only in the Irish Republic but, as we have said every time this matter has been reviewed, wherever Irishmen happen to be&#x2014;in the United States and throughout the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind that, while this Act continues on the Statute Book, Irishmen the world over will argue about its injustice, and the unfairness of the reflection it casts upon them, I hope the Home Secretary will be able to give us the assurance that, the moment he feels the Act can be allowed to lapse, he will allow it to do so. With its lapsing we can then look forward to much happier relations between ourselves and the Irish people, and the disappearance of the bitter animosities which often I feel very unnecessarily divide us.</p>

<p>Perhaps I may intervene, as Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone&#x2014;and I am sure that in this my colleague is with me&#x2014;to protest against this legislation. We represent an area amounting to roughly one-third of the total area of Northern Ireland. We speak for the majority of the people there, and we think that, in view of the comparatively good relations that have existed for a considerable time between this Government and the Government of the Irish Republic, there was no need for the introduction of powers so drastic as these appear to be.<br/>
When the original Act was introduced in 1939, certain conditions then existed in this country, and I appreciate, as do others on this side of the House, the difficulties of the Government at that particular period. But a lot of water has flowed under the bridges in the meantime. That was 14 years ago and no one can compare the conditions existing between the two peoples today with those prevailing in 1939. The upheaval and disorder in 1939 was due entirely to the indignation of the Irish people at the partition of their country.<br/>
Unfortunately, that indignation was not confined, and cannot always be confined, merely to constitutional protests. At that particular time they had seen the great success of the Tory people of Northern Ireland in their physical force movement, and naturally they were tempted to think that what had proved so efficacious in the case of the Northern


leaders might be very much more effective than any constitutional protest they might make.<br/>
This 1939 Act is directed against the Irish people. It will be so regarded by a great many people, not merely by those who reside in the 26 counties, but by the people in the North and in the Colonies. We are not a great nation, we have not any great power, we have neither bombs, Navy nor Air Force, but we have a spiritual dominion which extends to every part of the British Commonwealth and our influence there is probably far greater than the Government of the day comprehend.<br/>
I feel that we should be conscious of the need for good will, particularly in the United States of America, where our people are very numerous and influential. There will be considerable indignation expressed there when they read of this Act of 1939 being continued into 1953. Here we have power put into the hands of any constable to apprehend any man going about his lawful occasions. It is a case where the police force have the power of the judiciary. I know that some things can no longer be done, but we can still deport.</p>

<p>I think the hon. Member is under a misapprehension. The main purpose of this part of the Act is not to apprehend any individual but to make certain Orders preventing certain individuals from coming into the country.</p>

<p>Surely the hon. Gentleman does not pretend that we can deport a man without apprehending him. He cannot be blown out of the country by some process. The man has to be apprehended first; that is my interpretation. The Ireland Act irritated the Irish people very much indeed. It enables a minority of people to stand in the way of Irish unity so long as they please. The Government are now seeking to keep alive an Act which is equally repugnant to all sense of decency and any idea of freedom.<br/>
I know of young men who were in gaol for years because they would not give an undertaking not to do something which they had no thought of doing. They objected to giving such an undertaking because they had not offended, and it was

merely because somebody thought that they had offended or were about to offend that the Order was made. Take my own case. I was interned and I was asked to give an undertaking that I would keep the peace. I took the view that I had not broken the peace. How could I give an undertaking that I would keep the peace in the future unless I admitted my offence? I think the idea of the Home Office was to get me to make that admission, and I refused to make it. They had to discharge me in the end.<br/>
Suppose this Act had been in force in 1914; what would have been the position of Northern Tory leaders? It was a time when arms were imported from abroad, with the intention of setting up a government opposed to the Government of the King. Everyone would have been interned. I appeal to the Home Secretary to consider this matter rationally and reasonably, and to think what will be the feelings of ordinary Irish men, whether in Ireland, the United States or in this country, when they hear that a police constable can take a man into custody merely because the constable has an idea that the man may do something which he probably has no intention of doing, and that then the right hon. and learned Gentleman will make an order against him. Such a state of affairs would involve the admission by such a person that he was going to commit an offence which he had no intention of doing.<br/>
This legislation is directed entirely against the Irish people. There is a better feeling existing today, and we hope it will continue. But there is no justification whatever for the Government to retain these arbitrary powers if they are not going to use them. If they are going to use these powers, the Government wilt replace that good feeling by another sort of feeling which will not help this Government in its relations with other countries, especially the United States.</p>

<p>I had not intended to intervene in this debate but for the remarks of the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Mr. Healy), and I only do so briefly to answer a few of his misconceptions.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman said that the Act is directed against the Irish people. That is not in accordance with the facts. It


is not aimed at the Irish people but at a few irresponsible and irrepressible elements who believe in the use of physical force to achieve their objectives. The hon. Gentleman may hold different views from my own about Ireland, but I am sure that he would be not be a party to the use of physical violence to achieve his aim of a united Ireland. The Irish Republican Army is an illegal organisation both in Eire and in the North. I have never heard a responsible political person in Southern Ireland advocate anything other than the achievement of Irish unity by constitutional means. The people against whom this Act is directed believe in the use of the bomb and the gun.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Sunderland, North (Mr. F. Willey) who raised this matter, and to whom we are all grateful for the clear way in which he did so, has referred to the regrettable fact that during the past year since this matter was previously before the House, there has been some return to physical violence. There have been reports of the importation of arms and ammunition and of a revival of activities of the I.R.A., and I hope that when the Minister replies he can give us an assurance that he has sufficient powers to enable him to meet this possible danger.<br/>
In Northern Ireland as well as in this country, in view of these rather alarming reports, I think there has been some disquiet and fear that there might be a recurrence of the outrages which disgraced their perpetrators at the time of the passing of the original Act. I believe that I am speaking for everyone, certainly on this side of the House and particularly in Northern Ireland, when I ask for that assurance.</p>

<p>The hon. and gallant Member for Belfast, North (Lieut.-Colonel Hyde) speaks of a new danger looming, and of the necessity to retain certain powers which, it has been suggested, we all hope to see terminated at some time or other. I feel that keeping legislation of this sort, which is in line with the process of shaking our fists at people we fear, in itself creates the dangers that threaten us. I believe that there has come into our relations

with Ireland a new feeling of good will which later on might crystallise into something of a permanent character.<br/>
I realise that when this legislation was first brought into being there was an outbreak of violence which the Government of the day thought could not be controlled except by some extraneous legal process, such as that laid down in the terms of this Act. Although I am never sure that one is right to take that point of view, I am quite sure now that, at a time in our history when we can select the process of dealing with these matters, the Government should be much more willing than they are to put an end to their reliance upon Orders and legislation of this sort.<br/>
I am quite sure that Ireland is prepared and capable to settle down into the same relationship as now exists between ourselves and India. Not very many years ago we were treating people in India on the basis of their unreliability and willingness to resort to violence. We were putting them into prison and keeping in being extremely repressive laws which we know now, by the new relationship which has come into being, were not capable of producing the results we thought they would produce.<br/>
The process of dealing with those extreme Irishmen who, from time to time, seem willing to break out into violent measures, cannot be helped by a continuance of repressive legislation. It means that we are confessing our inability to use the ordinary law for dealing with the sort of offences against which this Act is directed. I am not at all moved by what my hon. Friend the Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Mr. Healy) has said about the necessity to do this, that or the other because of what America may do. We have to face the fact that if Irishmen can settle down in America, with the injustice of the McCarran Act hanging over them, together with the other measures which modern America is now practising, there is no reason to expect that Irishmen in America are going to wax furious because we continue to introduce legislation which is not anything like as bad as the legislation which America has introduced.<br/>
It is because I feel that the retention of a special provision against violence weakens our sense of belief in the


ordinary law that I say we should get rid of it as early as possible, and trust in those more reconciling processes between Ireland and ourselves that were going on without the help of this kind of legislation.</p>

<p>Last year my right hon. and learned Friend gave an explicit assurance that the Prevention of Violence (Temporary Provisions) Act would be used only to maintain the validity of then existing Orders. Upon that assurance an Amendment similar to that moved by the hon. Member for Sunderland, North (Mr. F. Willey) was withdrawn. As the hon. Member for Sunderland, North has said, my right hon. and learned Friend has gone rather further this year, and the Committee will see that it is not proposed to continue the Act at all for the purpose of making Orders but only for the purpose which he mentioned last year.<br/>
In 1939 there was a series of outrages by the Irish Republican Army. It must be remembered that the Irish were not, and still are not, aliens. The Act which was then passed gave the Home Secretary power to make three kinds of order. There was the expulsion order, which enabled him to expel from Great Britain persons concerned with acts of violence, there was the registration order, which compelled such persons to register with the police, and there was the prohibition order keeping them out of the country.<br/>
The hon. Member for Sunderland, North asked for some figures, which I shall gladly give to the Committee. The total number of Orders made&#x2014;and they were mostly made in 1939&#x2014;were, 190 expulsion orders, 29 registration orders and 71 prohibition orders. Last year there were still effective 117 expulsion orders, no registration orders, and 57 prohibition orders. My right hon. and learned Friend undertook to look carefully into the position. He has done so, and a very large number of these orders have since been revoked. I shall give the present position, but I should tell the Committee that some of the persons concerned have died, or have probably died, in the meantime, and I cannot distinguish such cases completely, so that there may be some revocations which are not altogether real.<br/>
The present position is that there are now effective nine expulsion orders and 48 prohibition orders. In other words, there are 57 persons of whom the Government feel such suspicion that we have thought that they should not be allowed to come into this country. I should tell the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Mr. Healy) that all those persons, as far as I know, are perfectly free in Ireland, and will remain free unless they try to come into Great Britain.<br/>
I should mention that it is open to any of the individuals concerned to apply for a revocation of the order against them. If they so apply the position will be considered. I can give that undertaking to the hon. Member, and also the undertaking that the Government are keeping the position generally under review. Having given those assurances, the hon. Member for Sunderland, North will probably be willing to withdraw his Amendment.</p>

<p>I very readily respond to that invitation. On this occasion two Members for constituencies in Northern Ireland have taken part in the discussion. We enjoyed seeing both of them here. As far as I know they never resort to violence, although their differences are very marked. I hope that this spirit will extend to Irish political discussion generally. For myself, I once very nearly became a citizen of Northern Ireland. If I had done so, under the peculiar electoral arrangements in that part of the Commonwealth I doubt whether I should ever have come to this House. That may be a matter of indifference to the Committee, but it would have been a great loss to myself.<br/>
In asking leave to withdraw this Amendment, I would pay a real tribute to what the right hon. and learned Gentleman has done. He has certainly made very great progress during the past 12 months, and I hope that very soon for all practical purposes, we shall see the end of this legislation.

<p>I think it will be generally agreed that the rent tribunals set up under the Act which is to be prolonged by this Bill have done very valuable work throughout the country and have enabled very many people to secure more reasonable rents than they would otherwise have been able to do. Although there has been discussion from time to time of the operation of the rent tribunals, I do not think there is any doubt that the tribunals throughout the country have endeavoured to interpret their duties fairly and properly, or that they have done a great deal to help many tenants who otherwise would have paid unconscionably high rents.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1953-11-26a.581.3" colnum="581" time="">
<p>I think there are two matters of some concern to hon. Members, at any rate on this side of the Committee. What is the attitude of the Ministry today about the closure of rent tribunals? Some months ago many hon. Members were concerned at reports of the closure of quite large numbers of tribunals, particularly in Lancashire. I think that in 1952 about 15 tribunals were closed down. In the last year, as far as I can work out from some figures that I got from the Department a little earlier tonight, some six additional tribunals have been closed.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1953-11-26a.581.4" colnum="581" time="">
<p>It is of importance to know whether they have been closed because there are no further applications being made to them, or whether it is because there is an attempt slowly to reduce the number of tribunals in any case and, indeed, as it were, to make the Act less operative. In

my view it is of the greatest importance that these tribunals should be kept in existence and that their activities should be well known, even though it may well be that they should operate very much on a part-time basis. Therefore, I should very much like to know from the hon. Gentleman what his views are about the continuance of the work of the rent tribunals.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1953-11-26a.582.0" colnum="582" time="">
<p>Under the 1946 Act&#x2014;and it is the tribunals under that Act which we are considering at the moment and not the work done under the 1949 Act, which is not prolonged by this Bill&#x2014;the rent tribunal with which I am most conversant, the one in Newcastle, dealt during the last quarter with something like 66 cases, which is a fairly considerable number when we consider the amount of investigation that has to go on. It is noticeable that, in all the cases the tribunal has taken, there has been an average percentage reduction of rent of something like 28 per cent. That does show of what enormous value these tribunals have been. Other tribunals have had a higher percentage than that. We do want some reassurance that there is no intention to close down this valuable work.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1953-11-26a.582.1" colnum="582" time="">
<p>The second point we are concerned about is the fact that in the minds of many of us the tribunals have to some extent been stultified in their work because of the effect of recent court decisions and judgments. I say "recent," although in fact a judgment was laid down some 12 months ago or a little more. Unfortunately, however, we have not had an opportunity to raise the matter before, in this form at any rate. It is the fact that some of the court judgments have had the effect of frightening potential applicants under these procedures from making application to the tribunals for rent reduction, because they feared that their tenancies would not be secure.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1953-11-26a.582.2" colnum="582" time="">
<p>Under the 1946 Act there is only a three months' guarantee of tenure to applicants for reduction of rent who apply to the rent tribunals. Another Act did extend that provision, but the extension has been called in question by the courts, with the result that many tenants who might no doubt have made use of the procedure of the rent tribunals have been dissuaded from so doing, and many officers of tribunals, not only in the North


but elsewhere, have told me they are quite satisfied in their own minds that these court decisions have undoubtedly had a bad effect on the use of the tribunals and the tribunal procedure during the last year or 18 months.</p>

<p>Although we attempted to raise this matter a year ago, we were prevented from doing so by the Government's following a rather out-dated procedure to stop discussion which, in their view, had been going on a very long time on other parts of the Bill that year. I thought it was unreasonable that the Government should not at that time 12 months ago have been willing to give us any information at all about their views on the operation of this important Act, and particularly about the possibility of any reform or amendment of it. It will be understood that this is the only opportunity we have of discussing the operation of this Act and of hearing the Government's views about it. It is with the object of elucidating the situation and getting some further information that I move the Amendment.</p>

<p>I rise to support the Amendment, and I do so for similar reasons to those succinctly and cogently given by my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle-upon-Tyne, East (Mr. Blenkinsop). The 1946 Act introduced these tribunals for the purpose of giving an opportunity to those who wished to find out whether the rent they were paying was reasonable by having the matter decided by such a tribunal. In my view, the tribunals have done their work extremely well. My hon.

Friend said there were occasions, as there must be, when some tribunals made an error but, taking it by and large&#x2014;and I have seen the working of these tribunals in a number of districts and have followed it very closely in Leicester&#x2014;I am satisfied, and I think everybody who has any knowledge of their working is satisfied, that they have fulfilled and are fulfilling a very useful function.<br/>
Are the Government serious about continuing the 1946 Act? If they are, why are they taking steps to reduce the effectiveness of the Act? This is not the first time I have raised this point, and I think it is highly important that we should know where we stand by ascertaining the Government's intentions. On 10th November, I received a reply to a Question in which the Parliamentary Secretary stated that 17 tribunals will be closed down by 31st December. Only two of them remain to be closed. In other words, 15 have been closed already.<br/>
I do not know whether the Minister considers that by depriving a district of a tribunal this means nothing more than that another tribunal will do its work. I do not think that the reduction in the number of tribunals is a wise policy. On the contrary, unless and until it is proved beyond a shadow of doubt that a tribunal mo longer has effective functions to perform, that tribunal should remain for the benefit of the people in the district.<br/>
It is not only necessary to remember that the tribunals deal with a large number of cases, although that in itself would be sufficient because they have reduced rents very considerably. The tribunal has another effect in that the influence of a tribunal regularly sitting in a town is to prevent excessive rents from being charged. A reasonable landlord&#x2014;and there are very many reasonable landlords&#x2014;is enabled to settle differences by going to the office of the tribunal with his tenant and receiving the advice and the benefit of the experience of those who are concerned in the tribunal's work in adjusting the matters at issue.<br/>
What is the idea about Leicester, for example? The tribunal is being taken away. It is true that arrangements have been made for an occasional session in the town itself; there is to be a regular session on one way a week. But the general advantage of the regular office in the town is lost. That is quite apart


from the fact that Leicester seems to be chosen by the Government on so many occasions when they wish to remove useful offices to other towns&#x2014;as, for instance, their attempt to remove the probate office and the bankruptcy office. There are constant attacks on that town in comparison with amenities possessed by other towns.<br/>
I do not see why Leicester should have been selected on this occasion. Apart from the work which has been done by the tribunals in the past, I understand that the Government propose to utilise those tribunals set up by the 1946 Act for even greater and more extensive purposes in the future. Why close them down? It is the duty of the Government under the Acts, including the 1946 Act, to make known to the community their right and so to use these offices not merely for the purpose of dealing with applications as they arise but in order to advise on the law where possible. In a vast number of tenancies that information is still not known, and I venture to suggest that hundreds of thousands of pounds, if not millions of pounds, have been paid in rent by tenants throughout the years during which the tribunals and the Acts have been in existence because they have been entirely ignorant of their rights under the Rent Acts.</p>

<p>I hope that the Minister will tell us that the Government intend to keep the 1946 Act going and that, instead of reducing the number of tribunals, they will maintain those which are in existence and will change their mind about those which are to be closed in Leicester and Watford. I hope he will set up other tribunals so as to cope not only with what is essential in the 1946 Act but also to deal with the provisions of the Bill to be considered in the immediate future.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Member for Newcastle-upon-Tyne, East (Mr. Blenkinsop) for moving this Amendment, which he moved purely for the purpose of getting an assurance from the Government. I am also grateful to him for his kind references to my slight dental mishap this afternoon. It was not dealt with under the National Health Service, however; I could not get an appointment.

If I curtail my remarks in reply to the debate, it is not because of lack of courtesy but because of difficulty in making myself audible and understood<br/>
A curious mixtures of names is down to the Amendment, as the hon. Member for Newcastle-upon-Tyne, East said. He reproved the Government for attempting to curtail this discussion last year, and I thought it was singularly appropriate that immediately afterwards one of his colleagues, the hon. Member for West Ham, North (Mr. Lewis) should use the well-known procedure of calling a count which, had it been successful, and had not many of my hon. Friends entered the Chamber to the rescue of the hon. Member for Newcastle-upon-Tyne, East, would have prevented this discussion altogether.<br/>
The attitude of hon. Members 12 months ago was naturally one of apprehension that the number of rent tribunals would be reduced to too small a figure to cope with the work involved. I think that was a genuine apprehension, not only amongst hon. Members but in some cases&#x2014;not all&#x2014;amongst the tribunals themselves. It was a natural thing. As time has passed, it has been proved that those apprehensions were misplaced, because the work which the reduced number of tribunals have had to do has been such that they could cope with it quite easily.<br/>
I have been asked for some statistics. At the peak, there were 80 tribunals, whereas at the end of this year we hope there will be 61. It is not so much a closure of tribunals as an amalgamation. As the work gets thinner on the ground, as is bound to happen as the years go on&#x2014;I think the hon. Member for Newcastle-upon-Tyne, East will agree with that&#x2014;we have to find a different method of dealing with applications. Instead of having a large number of static tribunals, it is better to have a smaller number of mobile tribunals which can go to the tenants. We have made the procedure much easier inasmuch as the tenant can go to the local authority, obtain his application forms from it, and, if necessary, make application by post. The tribunal will then inspect the property and any hearing will be held in the locality to suit the convenience of the tenant. I think that is a good service.</p>

<p>Does the hon. Gentleman appreciate that one of my anxieties is that if there are moving tribunals&#x2014;and I appreciate the value of them&#x2014;people cannot get information as well as they can when there is a fixed office for all general inquiries?</p>

<p>There are always the local authority and the Citizens Advice Bureaux which can give a comprehensive reply to any rent problem which arises, and if not, it can be referred to the tribunal when it next comes round. In the case of Leicester, I think the hon. Gentleman said it was there every week.</p>

<p>That means that people would have to wait seven days to get their queries answered if the Citizens Advice Bureaux could not answer them straight away.<br/>
The number of cases decided under the Act of 1946 over the year to 30th September, 1951, was 7,848, and to 30th. September, 1952, 6,221. This year, taking the date, for the convenience of statistics, to 30th March, 1953, 5,516 cases were dealt with and reductions were granted in 3,730 cases. The average reduction was 29 per cent.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman asked for an assurance about the effect of the closings. We are making no reduction in the service given to the tenant. We may make a reduction in the number of tribunals for administrative purposes and economy, but there will be no reduction in the service given to the tenant. The Government's view will be made quite clear next week. I do not want to get out of order, but possibly I may mention, in passing, that there may be additional duties which will be put upon the rent tribunals. If it is found that they cannot carry these duties&#x2014;and that can be found only by trial and error&#x2014;there will have to be an adjustment. If, on the other hand, it is found they can carry these duties easily and that there can be a further reduction, this will be made.<br/>
I can give the general assurance that we are not closing down these tribunals to make their work less effective, but to make economies and to secure efficiency, and at the same time to give the tenant the service intended under the Act.<br/>
I think that I have dealt with most of the points raised. There is one further matter concerning security of tenure. There has been only one case, I think, in which the House of Lords has reversed the decision of the lower courts. That was the Pickavance case. The position has now been restored to what we always thought it was, namely, that these tribunals have power to give tenants extended security of tenure. I hope that this may be given more publicity, and that it will prove to the hon. Member for Leicester, North-West that the assurance of the Government means something.</p>

<p>I beg to move,
<q>That the Draft Police Pensions Regulations, 1953, a copy of which was laid before this House on 4th November, be approved.</q>
These Regulations were made under Sections 1 and 3 of the Police Pensions Act, 1948. In accordance with the requirements of that Act, the Home Secretary has consulted the Police Council and they have expressed their agreement with the Regulations.<br/>
The object of the Regulations is very narrow. It is to provide increased pensions for the widows of certain policemen, those who are in effect murdered while acting in the execution of their duty. The numbers involved are very small indeed. There are nine known cases, including two in Scotland and four in the Metropolitan police district. A detailed


examination has only been made in the case of the Metropolitan police records, so it may be that in provincial forces a few more cases will come to light, but we do not expect that there will be more than a dozen or so altogether.<br/>
The present Regulations provide for a common level of pension for the widows of all police officers who are killed in the execution of their duty. The pension rate in those cases, after taking into account certain payments from National Insurance sources, is not less than one-third of the husband's average rate of pay during the last three years of his life.<br/>
Recently there have been several cases in which a policeman has been murdered by armed criminals and the public has been perturbed at the amount of pension available to the widow. The matter was discussed on an Adjournment debate in this House on the 11th November, 1952, when it was raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, North (Mr. F. Harris). Since that debate the Government have considered the matter very carefully.<br/>
As I explained during that debate, when I was answering for the Government, there were very grave difficulties in this connection. Those difficulties are of two kinds. First, the widow of a police officer who is, for example, drowned in a gallant attempt at rescue, or the widow of a police officer who is killed while on point duty, is no less deserving than the widow of one of the policemen referred to in the Order. Secondly, there are other occupations than the police in which a man has to run very special risks and may be killed and the widow might seek some corresponding claim to special treatment. But the Government, after very careful consideration of this matter, have concluded that the widows of policemen who die as a result of an attack "intrinsically likely to cause death" can be put in an altogether special category.<br/>
It is always possible that the policeman on duty may meet an armed criminal, and the policeman himself is very rarely armed to deal with such a criminal; he is not armed as a matter of principle. Moreover, there is a strong tradition in the force that the police officer must be reasonable and fair in his dealings with even the most worthless and most ruthless elements in the com-

munity. These restraints are peculiarly characteristic of British police methods. They have had their effect on the criminal community and I am certain that no one in any part of the House would wish to see any alteration in those methods. We all think it is essential that the policeman should generally go unarmed and that he should display fairness even towards the criminal.<br/>
Nevertheless, in a very small number of cases, the result of this is to expose the police officer to a quite exceptional risk. I do not mean an exceptional risk in the sense that it is exceptionally great, but it is of a quite peculiar kind. The police officer uniquely has to run, not, perhaps, a higher risk than people engaged in some other occupations, but a risk against which he is deliberately not protected, or not as fully protected as he might be. The Government feel that the peculiar character of this risk demands special treatment. It is vitally important that the police officer should accept the special position which tradition and policy require him to adopt, and it is right that he should know that his position is recognised by the community. That is what these Regulations seek to do.<br/>
The Regulations themselves are fairly simple. Where a police officer dies in the exceptional circumstances referred to, the widow's entitlement under them will be at least one-half, instead of one-third, of the average of the pay for the last three years. To give a practical example, in the Croydon case, which was discussed in the Adjournment debate in November, 1952, the widow will receive &#x00A3;4 4s. 6d. a week, instead of &#x00A3;2 16s. 4d. as under the existing Regulations.<br/>
The Regulations are retrospective in the sense that an increase can be given to existing widows; Part II is concerned exclusively with past cases. But they are not retrospective in the sense of giving any increased benefit for back periods. I am advised that it is beyond the power of any Regulations to do that, and so the matter cannot even be discussed. I think that the Regulations are fair and will be generally acceptable to the House.</p>

<p>I ask hon. Members to support the Government in bringing forward these Regulations. I give away no secrets of the last Government when I say that my right


hon. Friend the Member for South Shields (Mr. Ede) set this scheme in motion. In fact, in December, 1951, two months after he ceased to be Home Secretary, he said from this Dispatch Box that when he left office he was having negotiations with his right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer and that he hoped the present Home Secretary would be able to continue them and introduce such Regulations.<br/>
I mention that because I know that the Under-Secretary would not wish to mislead the House. It is true that he has the credit for bringing in the Regulations to night, but it is not only since the 1952 Adjournment debate that this matter was taken up; it had been taken up a long time before. As it happens, the hon. Gentleman has the honour of introducing something which was denied to me when I was in his office.<br/>
I entirely agree that one of the reasons that we have respect and affection for our police is that they go about their business unarmed, like ordinary citizens. It must be difficult to have the same respect and affection for police in countries where they are armed. On psychological grounds there are many arguments, but there is the practical one of the temptation to use the arms unnecessarily.<br/>
I read about a year ago in the "New York Times," which is sent to so many hon. Members free by the United States Government, of a case where, during a practice black-out in New York, a policeman went to a tavern and told the tavern-keeper to dim his lights. The tavern keeper refused to do so and said, "Why should I?" The policeman told him that it was dangerous not to do so. The man said he would not do it. There and then, the policeman drew his revolver and shot and badly wounded the tavern-keeper, thereby proving his point that it was dangerous not to obey the regulation.<br/>
We recognize that these men who are murdered while performing their duties are real heroes, because in accordance with our tradition they have gone into battle unarmed. I can think of seven of these heroes since the war: Edgar, Baxter, Fraser, Jagger and Miles in England, and Gibson and MacLeod in Scotland. The very least that we can do for them is to make further provision for

their widows, and I am sure that the House will accept this Order.</p>

<p>These Regulations bring benefits to a number of police widows, which I am certain both sides of the House welcome. But the discussion of these Regulations gives us an opportunity of stating the case for another group of police widows who ought to be included in these Regulations and given certain benefits. This group includes those widows of police men whose husbands died before July, 1948, and who are excluded from the benefits of the improved pensions that have been given since.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have considerable doubts whether these particular Regulations should be approved by the House, and one of the reasons for my attitude is the inequalities that exist in pensions for other police widows. I fully realise that what we are discussing is a very narrow subject, but it is a factor in our minds which will affect our attitude to these Regulations. With great respect, I should like to suggest that this will have some bearing on our attitude to these Regulations.</p>

<p>I cannot answer for what effect these Regulations will have on the minds of hon. Members. I am bound by these Regulations, and the debate must be confined to them. There are other large questions surrounding this issue of pensions for police widows, but they must be discussed on other occasions. This debate is confined strictly to the subject matter of the Regulations. Those are the rules of the House, and I have no power to vary them.</p>

<p>I rise to support these Regulations, as I am sure every hon. Member will. I can assure the House that it is not my intention to emulate other members of my family in detaining the House unduly at this time. I think once in a period of seven days is quite adequate for that kind of thing.<br/>
I support these Regulations because, quite obviously, they do justice and protect a section of the community that is most vulnerable and one that has rendered a public service in preserving law and order, which is one of the fundamental characteristics of this great country. We feel that those who are exposed to this particular risk should feel that in the event of anything happening to them their widows should enjoy particular benefits. I am very glad that the widows of the men who were murdered before 5th July, 1948, are included.<br/>
The Under-Secretary of State widened the discussion on these Regulations, because he posed the Question whether the Home Secretary should not include the widows of men who were drowned while doing a meritorious act. He was able to argue the position in regard to those widows, and I am afraid that we are, Mr. Speaker, in <i>pari delicto</i> in this particular matter. I bow to your Ruling in this respect, but I am very anxious to find a way, if it were possible, to include all the widows whose husbands died before 5th July, 1948. They are known as the pre-Oaksey widows.<br/>
The widows of men who were murdered before 5th July, 1948, and are covered by these new Regulations, were not covered by National Insurance. They were precluded in that period from paying contributions, and yet we are pleased to see that, although they did not make any contributions under the National Insurance Act, their rights are not worsened by virtue of that fact. We are delighted that the Under-Secretary of State should have created yet another precedent which we hope he will follow in regard to the general class of pre-Oaksey widows other than those whose husbands were killed during the course of their duties.<br/>
There are disparities for the widows other than those who were murdered before 5th July, 1948. Under the 1921 rate they are still getting 11s. 6d. per week or &#x00A3;30 per annum, whereas those

who were widowed under similar circum stances after 5th July, 1948, received as much as 19s. 2d. per week plus the equivalent of the National Insurance widow's pension of 32s. 6d. per week, making a total of 51s. 8d. a week.<br/>
While the Home Secretary was correct in consulting the Police Council about this matter, I feel that he ought to have extended his consultations to the National Association of Retired Police Officers, who are particularly interested in this matter of widows' pensions. They welcome these new Regulations but say that they do not by any means go far enough. So, while hoping that the Regulations will be agreed to, I trust that the Home Secretary will take an early opportunity of sweeping away all injustices applicable to widows other than the widows of men murdered before 5th July, 1948, so that justice will be done in all cases where men have died in the course of their service as police officers.<br/>
In conclusion, may I say that in my opinion the time has come when we ought to set up a Royal Commission to deal with the whole question of pensions. There are so many fields in which pensions are payable and payable at varying rates by different Departments&#x2014;</p>

<p>All I want to do is to point out that when a layman wants to refer to a particular question, he asks a question about the widow of a man who was murdered before 5th July, 1948, and he is then able to see at a glance what is the position with regard to other sections of the community. I hope the Home Secretary will think again about the other widows whom he knows that we have in mind and to whom we should like to see justice done.</p>

<p>I should like to ask one or two questions about these Regulations, and my attitude to them will be dependent to some extent on the replies I get. The Under-Secretary of State gave the House an explanation of the principles he is applying in arriving at the rates and the categories of benefit. I appreciate his


difficulties regarding the extension of these more favourable rates to other categories, but I will not go into that.<br/>
It seems to me to be relevant to the argument to discuss how he in fact arrived at those figures. Were the figures related specifically to the general widows' pension rates, because it seems that there must be a relation between the two? Were they related to the figures of the pre-1948 widows, who are a category that has been taken into account, and what were the special circumstances that arose?<br/>
It seems to me that the hon. Gentleman should also bear in mind the variations in the value of the &#x00A3; in arriving at the figures set out in the Regulations. I am referring both to the variations in the original contributions of the police officers concerned at a time when the &#x00A3; was of a much greater value than it is today and also the actual return that they receive.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned that he could not make these Regulations retrospective, and it would be out of order to discuss that aspect of the matter, but the action is retrospective in that it refers to events which took place in the past. Obviously the entitlement of these widows must, in the mind of the hon. Gentleman and in the minds of the Minister and his advisers, depend to some extent on the rate of contribution which was paid.<br/>
I do not ask the Parliamentary Secretary to copy my hon. Friend the Member for Ardwick (Mr. L. M. Lever) and offend against you, Sir, by going out of order, but I respectfully submit that in the form in which I have presented this, it is relevant to our discussion of these Regulations, and it is relevant to the attitude of mind that we shall take in arriving at our decision. I hope, therefore, that the hon. Gentleman will look at the different categories of widows who gain an advantage from these Regulations, and also at those who do not, and will tell us the principles which he applied in arriving at the figures read out in the Regulations under discussion.</p>

<p>I am grateful to you, Mr. Speaker. I realise now, as one unlearned in the ways of the House, that what I wanted to do was to congratulate the Home Secretary on having in these Regulations made provision for the widows of men who were killed before July, 1948. That is a wise provision because, had the right hon. and learned Gentleman not made it, the widows of men who were murdered previous to 1948 might be suffering the kind of disparity of treatment and the unjustness of treatment which other older police widows suffer.<br/>
That injustice, and the kind of injustice which these widows would have suffered, can be realised by the fact that the widows of men who died before July, 1948, if they are the widows of sergeants and constables, get 11s. 6d. a week as opposed to the normal provision of 19s. 2d. a week. Because their husbands were not entitled to insure under National Insurance, they are deprived of the extra National Insurance benefit of 32s. 6d. a week and can only obtain from every source a maximum of 32s. 6d. as compared with the normal police widow's pension of 51s. 8d., so that if the Home Secretary had not made this kind of provision for the widows of murdered men, he would have been dealing as unjustly with them as he is with the older widows for whose cause I would have liked to plead if it had been in order.</p>

<p>The only question which the hon. Member for Preston, South (Mr. Shackleton) asked which appeared to be strictly in order was how the figures were arrived at, and I thought I had explained it.

Under these Regulations the amount is one-half of the average of the last three years' pay. I do not think I can make it any plainer than that.</p>

<p>We welcome this step towards putting right a matter that was causing some apprehension in the minds of the general public. It is fortunate that the type of offence anticipated here is not common. Violence of this kind at the moment seems mainly confined to misguided youths who do not seem to find any proper outlet for their rather militant activities. These youths seem to be confined mainly to our big cities where there is no expanse of country and none of the facilities that ought to be taking up their time. Crime in earlier days used to be associated with poverty but, curiously enough, in these later days much of this crime is not concerned with poor people struggling against poverty, but seems to have developed into a kind of bravado commando enterprise in which people from many parts of society are taking part&#x2014;</p>

<p>I must remind the right hon. Gentleman that he is not entitled under these Regulations to discuss the causes of crime in general. The debate is confined to whether we should make

this provision for the widows of men who are, to use the military term, killed in action.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1953-11-26a.598.0" hansard_membership_id="7427" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/22243" speakername="Mr. Woodburn" colnum="598" time="">
<p>That is a point to which I was coming&#x2014;that it is a different type of crime with which we are dealing that is coming from a quite unusual source. In earlier days the police were able to deal with the type of crime that I have described, but this type is quite unusual in many circumstances and comes quite unexpectedly. Therefore, policemen are placed in a very difficult position.<br/>
In dealing with this type of crime the policemen have to risk their lives. As the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department said, people risk their lives in many occupations, but in this case I gather that what is meant is that when a policeman is faced with an armed person and goes forward to deal with his armed assailant&#x2014;in other words to arrest him&#x2014;the policeman is really taking the offensive. Under the terms of these Regulations, is the policeman attacked when the man resists arrest and shoots him? In other words, will the close reading of the words of these Regulations deprive the very people we want to benefit of the blessing of this if a lawyer comes along and says, "That man is not attacking, he is defending himself against the policeman"?<br/>
I think a lot of misunderstandings will arise. I have in mind two cases in which policemen were shot. The deputy-chief constable of Edinburgh was shot by a man with a revolver. I do not know that anybody is quite sure why the crime was committed. The deputy-chief constable was not arresting the man, he was merely driving in his car. He was shot at without warning and killed. I take it that in his case the widow would be entitled to a pension. There was another case in which a policeman was shot on his beat by a man who turned out to be a mental defective. Does this provision cover that case?<br/>
There could also be the case of a policeman who endeavours to stop a motor-car and jumps on the running board and the driver, in order to get rid of the policeman, crushes him between his own car and a tram. That would be a case of a policeman being attacked, but it would not be an attack by an armed man.


The Joint Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department mentioned an armed attack. I take it that there is nothing in these Regulations which says that death must occur as a result of an armed attack.</p>

<p>I should like to know whether the Regulations cover a case where a policeman jumps on the bonnet of a car and the driver causes him to be crushed against a tram in the way that I have described. I am afraid that many difficulties may arise in trying to ensure fair treatment under these Regulations. I hope that the Home Secretary will look at the wording and, if necessary, revise it so as to secure a clear indication of what is meant. There is a possibility that the people for whom the Regulations are intended to cater may by some quirk be deprived of benefit. I have known this House pass legislation before and by the time it got to the Treasury it was interpreted quite differently from what the House of Commons meant, with the result that the people whom it was intended to benefit received nothing at all. I hope that the Home Secretary will look into that point.<br/>
Another point which will have to be looked at again concerns this question of the continually changing value of money, to which reference has already been made. I think that some day these pensions must be based, not on the amount of money received by the husband in the last three years of his service, but on the current scale of pay of persons of the same rank still serving in the force, so that if, for instance, a constable's pay rises, the widow's pension would rise in some relationship with that pay. I realise that that introduces a much wider question, but nevertheless it is a very important point.<br/>
This new provision may save policemen's lives. I can imagine, just at the very moment when he is going to arrest an armed man, a policeman's mind fluttering for a moment to thoughts about his wife and children and that if there was the slightest doubt about their subsequent welfare he might hesitate to act. One could understand his hestitating, and in certain circumstances he who hesitates

is lost. We are doing the minimum of our duty in trying to give some assurance to people who have to risk their lives for the community that, at any rate, their wives and bairns will not suffer from the consequences. But I am not sure whether these Regulations will ensure that for every policeman. It is for that reason that I hope that if the Home Secretary finds that the wording of the Regulations will not accomplish all that he intends it to do he will withdraw the Regulations and introduce fresh ones to achieve his purpose.</p>

<p>Not for the first time I am lost in admiration of the capacity of my right hon. Friend the Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn) to find a wealth of material in a very narrow and small point. I merely want to utter one or two sentences in commendation and to welcome these Regulations, because I think that it is as well that a back bencher from Scotland should add a few words.<br/>
It is a most remarkable circumstance, which probably could not be paralleled anywhere else in the world, that out of a population of five million in Scotland there are only two widows affected by these Regulations, only two policemen having been killed since the war in the execution of their duty. More remark able still is that out of a population of 50 million in Great Britain there are only nine of these widows. I do not think that that could be possibly be said of any other country. Still more remarkable to contemplate is that in Scotland these widows are widows not because of any act by hardened criminals going about their criminal intentions. As far as I can recall, they are widows because of the momentary impulse of a youth who was not a criminal and had a sudden brainstorm.<br/>
In connection with these Regulations dealing with the pensions of police widows, it might be topical to mention that, in spite of the real or illusory activities of men in Scotland who are not criminals but who are engaged perhaps in dangerous occupations and pastimes, we have no fear that the number of women to benefit by the Regulations will be increased&#x2014;that is, in spite of the Scottish Republican Army and its alleged


activities. I welcome the Regulations because the police of Scotland are such an excellent body of men and women. I know them in my own constituency. It is an encouragement to Members of Parliament who know their police forces so well that this additional small but important improvement in their conditions of service has been granted by this House.</p>

<p>As the hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. J. Taylor) has spoken as a back bencher from the other side of the House, I feel it incumbent upon me to say a few words as a back bencher from this side in commendation of these Regulations. When I came into the House a moment ago, I had no intention of doing so, but I feel that these Regulations remedy an injustice which might be suffered by the widow of a policeman who was killed in the execution of his duty. I believe that this new provision has arisen from the well-known Croydon case, but we hope that the population of Scotland will be so law-abiding that there will be no occasion for the Regulations to be used in future.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman the Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn) referred to the wording of the Regulations, and I hope that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department will look into the question whether the words
<q>&#x2026;was attacked by a person&#x2026;</q>
really cover all the possibilities that might occur. But there are other guiding words&#x2014;
<q>&#x2026;acting in the execution of his duty&#x2026;</q>
and I doubt if any police authority would look with unsympathetic eyes on a case where a policeman was killed in such circumstances.<br/>
I am not absolutely certain that in all cases a policeman is covered when he has not been killed but has been injured. I am afraid I cannot develop that point now. It seems tome, provided the words are enough, that this should bring justice to the few people affected in Scotland. I hope that in the future, as in the past, the people of Scotland will be so law-abiding that it will not be necessary to evoke these Regulations at all.</p>

<p>By leave, the point raised by the right hon. Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn) affects both England and Scotland, and perhaps I may answer for the two at the same time. If the right hon. Member will look at the English Regulations&#x2014;exactly the same applies in the case of the Scottish&#x2014;he will see that the decision rests on "the opinion of the police authority." They have to decide, not a legal question, but a pure question of fact. They have to see first whether the police officer was attacked, and then whether death occurred as a result. Those are two fairly simple facts to ascertain.<br/>
They have also to ascertain whether the police officer was attacked in a manner "intrinsically likely to cause death." In other words, supposing something was done which in fact caused death but which would not in the ordinary way cause death to a normal person, that widow would not be within the Regulations. If her husband happened to have a thin skull and received a knock which would not have killed a normal man, the widow would not be within the Regulations.</p>

<p>If my hon. Friend will look at the Regulations he will see those words quite clearly. In the case of England, they occur in the proviso to the first Regulation. I was explaining to the right hon. Member that he must look at the word "intrinsically" and appreciate that it does not mean that where a death happened to ensue that is enough. It has to be shown that the form of the attack was such that a reasonable person might expect death to ensue from it.</p>

<p>I do not think the hon. Member has dealt with the point I made. If we take the instance of the policeman who, in order to effect an arrest, jumped on a motor car and the person in the car drove it against a tram-car with the object of scraping him off and killing him that would certainly cause death. It would be an attack on the policeman but it would not seem, under the strict reading of the word "attack,"


to be so interpreted. But, in the case of a policeman who was shot by an attacker while in the execution of his duty, the policeman might be quite unconscious and never realise anything before death. He may be acting in no sense in an unusually brave manner for a policeman but be definitely attacked by an armed man and his widow would benefit, whereas the widow of the other policeman I mentioned who did an act of bravery by trying to arrest an escaping gangster by crashing a car would not benefit.<br/>
I do not see that "the opinion of the police authority" could get past the Regulation; according to the wording it is only their opinion which has effect. I may be wrong, but it does seem that it should not be left entirely to their discretion to estimate the whole circumstances of the case. That might exclude some of the very people whom I gather it is intended should benefit.</p>

<p>It is not a question of discretion in the sense that the police authority can do as they please. They have to comply with the Regulation and form a fair opinion as to the facts to see that they comply with the Regulation. The right hon. Member is trying to define the dividing line. There must be such a dividing line, and whether a particular case is within it may be a difficult question to determine. I am afraid that is inevitable whenever we seek to draw up Regulations of this kind. I would hesitate to try to give an opinion on hypothetical facts such as the right hon. Member put forward, but I do not think that in the great majority of cases there will be any difficulty about seeing whether the facts do or do not fall within the Regulations.</p>

<p>I beg to move,
<q>That the Draft Civil Defence (Grant) Regulations, 1953, a copy of which was laid before this House on 5th November, be approved.</q>
The House has always shown complete unity where matters of Civil Defence are concerned and these Regulations, so far as I am aware, contain no controversial issue. On the contrary, the work which led to them was started by the right hon. Member for South Shields (Mr. Ede) when he was Home Secretary. My right hon. and learned Friend had no hesitation at all in taking up the work at the very point at which the right hon. Member set it down.<br/>
The Regulations are concerned purely with financial matters. They constitute a complete code governing the respective share of financial responsibility for Civil Defence expenditure to be borne henceforward by the central Government on the one hand and local authorities, police authorities and water authorities on the other.<br/>
Section (1) of the Civil Defence Act, 1948, laid on what is called
<q>the designated Minister</q>
responsibility for taking
<q>such steps as appear to him&#x2026;to be necessary&#x2026;for Civil Defence purposes.</q>
Different Ministers have been designated for different functions under the Act. The Home Secretary is the designated Minister if no other Minister is designated and he is the designated Minister for the purpose of making these Regulations. The Regulations apply to financial matters in connection with all Departments to which they relate. It is, however, convenient to have one single code dealing with the whole matter.<br/>
Section 2 of the Civil Defence Act requires local authorities to perform the functions laid upon them by Regulations to be made under the Act and Section 3 allows Regulations to be made for the purpose of paying grants to local authorities carrying out those functions. That is what these Regulations are.<br/>
When the Civil Defence Bill was debated in 1948, several hon. Members


argued that the whole cost of Civil Defence should be the responsibility of the central Government. That was rejected at the time, I think with the concurrence of the then Home Secretary, and the present Home Secretary, and Section 3 of the Act provides that there shall be full reimbursement in those cases that may be prescribed and that the grant towards the other expenses shall not exceed 75 per cent.<br/>
The right hon. Member for South Shields gave two undertakings at the time. The first was that the lower rate would be 75 per cent. unless the Minister concerned was not satisfied with the way in which a particular local authority was carrying out its duties. The second was that the associations representing local authorities would be fully consulted before these Regulations were made.<br/>
There has been about five years' delay from the passing of the Act to the present time, and I would not suggest for one moment that the local authorities are in any way responsible for that delay. The questions which have been raised have been difficult, complicated questions of an important character, and it has taken a great deal of time to reach agreement.<br/>
On the Second Reading of the Civil Defence Act, the right hon. Member for South Shields told the House of a broad basis for the division between the 100 per cent. reimbursement cases and the 75 per cent. reimbursement cases which he had already discussed with the local authorities. However, when that broad basis came to be examined in detail after the passing of the Act&#x2014;the hon. Member for Lincoln (Mr. de Freitas) will correct me if I am wrong, because I am speaking of the time when he was in my present office&#x2014;it was found that there was difficulty about carrying out the basis which had been put forward by the then Home Secretary, and indeed all parties were agreed that it would be unsatisfactory to attempt to do so.<br/>
By October, 1.951, however, a fairly substantial measure of agreement had been reached by the previous Government, and the discussions have been continued and final agreement has been reached. I should tell the House that it is genuine agreement; it has been freely accepted by all parties concerned as a fair and reasonable basis.<br/>
I should inform the House that my right hon. and learned Friend has made two promises in this connection. The first is that these Regulations will be open to review after two years, and that the associations will then be free to revive, if they wish, any alternative proposals made during the negotiations. The second is that the associations have been told that the Government will introduce at the first convenient opportunity legislation providing for the reimbursement by the Exchequer of any amount by which expenditure on capital works in any year in a particular rating area exceeds a level at which the share of the local authority on the basis of 75 per cent. grant exceeds the product of a two penny rate; in other words, the expenditure of local authorities on capital works in any year will be limited to the product of a two penny rate.<br/>
There are two more general matters outside the Regulations which I must mention. In the first place, the local authorities will not suffer financially because of the delay which has occurred in making the Regulations. Since 1949, grants of 75 per cent. have been paid to the authorities concerned on all Civil Defence expenditure. If these Regulations are approved, my right hon. and learned Friend and the other Ministers concerned will arrange to pay a further 25 per cent. on all expenditure that would have qualified for 100 per cent. reimbursement if these Regulations had been made before.<br/>
Secondly, these Regulations are intended to apply only to expenditure incurred in peacetime. Financial arrangements appropriate for wartime would have to be considered by the Government of the day, and I do not think it possible to consider this evening what they might do.<br/>
I turn to the Regulations themselves, and I think it would be best if I described their effect only in broad terms. If any hon. Members have questions upon them I will try to answer them later in the debate. The Schedule contains the list of expenses which are to be completely reimbursed. By Regulation 2 these must be fully reimbursed, and the others, that is to say anything not covered by the Schedule, will receive a 75 per cent. grant. By Regulation 3 grants are payable only on reasonable expenses approved by the designated Minister.


This Regulation is common form, as are the other Regulations to which I shall refer.<br/>
Regulation 4 in effect empowers the designated Minister to recover income or other payments attributable to property acquired by a local authority with the aid of an Exchequer grant. If, for example, property acquired by means of an Exchequer grant is a means of earning income by letting, possibly even by selling off a piece, then that adventitious sum coming in to the local authority will have to be accounted for by it to the central Government, who have provided the money.<br/>
Regulation 5 enables the designated Minister to make deductions if a local authority is to blame for avoidable expense or loss. Regulation 6 enables the designated Minister to withhold grants if a local authority does not carry out its responsibilities satisfactorily.<br/>
I commend these Regulations to the House as representing justice between the taxpayer on the one hand and the ratepayer on the other. They are proof, if proof be needed, that the Government regard the responsibilities for Civil Defence as enduring, and that the Government and this House appreciate the importance of Civil Defence and are prepared to give a really solid measure of help to see that the duties are properly carried out.</p>

<p>I welcome this Motion, and I welcome this agreement which has been reached between the local authorities and the Home Office as laying yet another stone as a basis for sound Civil Defence. The Joint Under-Secretary of State referred to the discussions and debates which have taken place over the last few years between the local authorities and the Home Office as to the apportionment of the cost. I remember the negotiations in 1950 and 1951, and, as he pointed out, there were difficulties then. There always will be difficulties in these matters. Now we are told that there is genuine agreement and I notice that there have been certain changes.<br/>
I am pleased to see, for instance, that there has been an abandonment of the basis of discussion at that time regarding

equipment, excluding uniform. I learn of the abandonment of the complicated definition and distinction between major and minor expenditure and note that it will be on free loan or on reimbursement. Secondly, there is the important point, which the Under-Secretary of State mentioned, about the complication at that time of making reimbursement on a scale of cost of work being more than &#x00A3;2,500 or the product of a halfpenny rate, whichever was the less. Now it is to be 75 per cent. with the promise of legislation to make reimbursable the excess above the figure of the amount which would come in from a 2d. rate. I think that a sound and sensible arrangement. I notice that under other reimbursable services included in the Schedule is the provision for emergency feeding services.<br/>
I think it right that the Under Secretary of State should emphasise, as I will emphasise, that the whole basis of our system of Civil Defencelies in co-operation between the central Government and local authorities. Our method of organising Civil Defence is such that it shall be essentially a neighbourhood scheme, so that men and women may come together to protect their neighbours and themselves in the event of war. These Regulations may be entirely financial and exceedingly technical; but they are all part of the scheme of Civil Defence. I welcome them, and I hope the whole House will do the same.</p>

<p>I regret that I cannot agree entirely with my hon. Friend the Member for Lincoln (Mr. de Freitas). I do not believe that these Regulations are as fair and as equitable as they ought to be. When the Bill was debated on Second Reading, almost five years ago today, many hon. Members opposite referred to the difficulties confronting certain local authorities regarding the cost of these necessary Civil Defence expenditures. It was pointed out then that quite a number of local councils would find themselves in difficulty about the suggested formula which the then Home Secretary put forward, concerning the 75 per cent. grant in certain instances and the full 100 per cent. Exchequer reimbursement.<br/>
I well remember raising this question then and receiving from the then Home Secretary a statement that there would


be full reimbursement for what might be termed,
<q>any expenditure on major capital works&#x2026;"&#x2014;[Official Report, 23rd November. 1948; Vol. 458, c. 1095.]</q>
On page 6 of the Schedule, we find a number of these necessary expenses and items which would qualify for the 100 per cent. grant. I am amazed to learn, from an urgent message which I received from the town clerk this afternoon, that my own local authority of West Ham has been refused reimbursement for the construction of a report and control centre.<br/>
I suggest to the Under-Secretary of State that if he feels it necessary fully to reimburse local authorities for such items as air-raid shelters and for billeting and transferring the population&#x2014;I agree that is necessary, in fact I subscribe to all the items mentioned on page 6 of the Schedule&#x2014;then most certainly there should be reimbursement for a report and control centre which is necessary in any Civil Defence scheme.<br/>
I do not see how it can be argued that such a centre is not a major capital outlay. My local authority has approximately &#x00A3;14,700 to spend on building its control centre, excluding furnishings and equipment. I appreciate that the Undersecretary may say that the furnishings and equipment generally can be reckoned for 75 per cent, grant, but I ask him to give me an answer in regard to what is in this instance a local point, because I am speaking only for my own authority, although it may equally well apply, and probably does, to many other areas which may wish to set up a similar centre.<br/>
I wish to express the strong feeling of the Civil Defence committee in West Ham, and my own feeling, that here is an exclusion from the 100 per cent. grant of something which should be included in the Schedule. Local authorities generally were encouraged to believe that they would receive the 100 per cent. grant. I have quoted my right hon. Friend the Member for South Shields (Mr. Ede) who, when he was Home Secretary, said that such major requirements would receive a 100 per cent. grant.<br/>
I would remind the Under-Secretary that as comparatively recently as January, 1949, his Department issued a circular. It was Circular No. 2 of 1949 and it was issued on 19th January. I appre-

ciate that the hon. Gentleman was not ire office, but he has agreed that in matters of Civil Defence there is no question of politics, and therefore it makes no difference what Government were in office at that time. The Circular stated:
<q>At the conference with representatives of the Local Authority Associations held on the 8th November, 1948&#x2026;it was agreed that proposals to be laid before Parliament for Exchequer assistance to local authorities in respect of expenditure on Civil Defence preparations should be based on the following principles: Any expenditure on major capital works required at the direction of the appropriate Minister for the Government's general plan of Civil Defence would be reimbursed.</q>
The control centre for my authority will cost &#x00A3;14,700. That means that the local authority, the ratepayers, will have to find about &#x00A3;3,675. That may not appear to be large for some areas, but when it is appreciated that, because of the blitz, West Ham lost over one-third of its rateable income and that it has to cut down on necessary undertakings and day-to-day administration because it cannot afford to spend more, it will be agreed that it is grossly unfair to expect the ratepayers to find &#x00A3;3,675 to set up a Civil Defence centre. I emphasise this because, without a control centre, what is the good of having a full grant for billeting, air-raid shelters and other matters which are secondary to the major consideration, which is obviously the provision of headquarters?<br/>
I ask the Under-Secretary to review the matter. He may say that the Local Authority Associations have agreed to this provision. I am not interested in that. I am concerned with the fact that he said that it is possible to review these items. If the Under-Secretary cannot do it now, I ask him to introduce an amended provision in the review to state specifically that the erection of a Civil Defence report and control centre will rank for 100 per cent. grant.<br/>
It may be argued by the Home Office that the amount proposed to be spent is excessive. The Home Office would be entitled to argue about whether there is a waste of money. That would be reasonable, but I am arguing on the principle of the 100 per cent. as against the 75 per cent. grant. I ask the Undersecretary to give deep consideration to the problem. I have spoken to his office today. He has full information about


the matter. I hope that he will deal with it on a general basis, because it must affect many other local authorities.</p>

<p>Before I put questions to the Under-Secretary, I should like to say that basically I support these Regulations because the Government have come down definitely on the side of retaining the civic character of this defence force. The Under-Secretary will recall that I had some misgiving whether the Government would decide in this way, because I was aware of some of the views expressed by people in high places who wanted to make it a military defence and not a Civil Defence force, and a kind of fourth arm to the Armed Forces. Therefore, I wish to add my support to that of my hon. Friend the Member for Lincoln (Mr. de Freitas).<br/>
I wish to ask the Under-Secretary about the definition of the words "local authority." May I take it that the local authorities in question are the county council and the county borough authorities, and that if any borough council or urban district council incurs any Civil Defence expenditure reimbursement will go through the county council? If not, will it go direct to the other authority concerned?<br/>
I appreciate what has been said by my hon. Friend the Member for West Ham, North (Mr. Lewis). I should like to put the matter in what may be a more specific way. I have looked at the Schedule, and I realise that one must make a rough calculation of exactly what expenditure will rank for the 75 per cent. as against the 100 per cent. grant specified there. I have in mind two main considerations. One is the payment of wages and salaries to Civil Defence personnel, and the other is the provision of uniforms.<br/>
I wish to ask whether the payment of wages and salaries and the provision of uniforms will rank for 100 per cent. or 75 per cent. grant. I hope that it will be the former, because the incidence of air warfare is not even over the country. If the item of wages and salaries is to rank for only 75 per cent. grant, and 25 per cent. must be borne by the ratepayers, that might be an easy burden in certain parts of Wales, but it could be a

heavy item of expenditure for those local authorities which are likely to be in the front line of air attack. That item should rank for 100 per cent. grant.<br/>
Those were the questions I wished to put to the Under-Secretary purely for the sake of clarification. I do not know whether I am in order in doing so, but I should like to ask whether I may take it that the method of determining wages and salaries for Civil Defence personnel will be decided by a central body and administered by the local authorities, as was the case during the last war and before.</p>

<p>The Regulations have been generally welcomed, and I should like to thank the hon. Member for Lincoln (Mr. de Freitas) for what he said. I should like to give an answer to the hon.

<p>I appreciated that and therefore I went to the trouble of informing the hon. Gentleman's Parliamentary Private Secretary and his office, and the Home Secretary's private secretary. I tried to get hold of him personally, but he was otherwise engaged. I assure him that I did everything possible to contact him to ensure that he should be briefed about the matter I wished to raise.</p>

<p>I entirely acquit the hon. Gentleman of any discourtesy. I think this is the seventh time that I have spoken today on rather technical matters, and that is the explanation. All I can say is that I will consider what he said and I will write to him. I have ascertained that his local authority did receive a circular, to which he has referred, and I have seen a copy of the circular which referred to the broad basis of agreement which I mentioned in my opening speech as the one indicated by the then Home Secretary at the time of the passing of the Civil Defence Act.<br/>
The circular refers to principles. It says that it was agreed that proposals to be laid before Parliament for Exchequer assistance to local authorities in


respect of expenditure on Civil Defence preparations should be based on certain principles. I think that statement gave some warning that there was not yet any firm arrangement. Indeed, I believe that the council of West Ham is a member of the Association of Municipal Corporations, and I think it must have known that discussions were going forward on these matters. I have no doubt that it thought everything was all right, but it must have appreciated that there was nothing at all in the way of a firm promise and that there was every possibility that there might be a change.</p>

<p>May I thank the Undersecretary sincerely for his kind offer to have the matter looked at in the usual way through office channels? I appreciate that, but I would say that West Ham, while appreciating that this original circular might obviously have had to be altered in some minor form later, felt that the question of major outlay on capital plant and on actual buildings&#x2014;particularly such a thing as the main Civil Defence control centre&#x2014;would qualify for 100 per cent, grant, in addition to some of these other items which are not half so essential as the main control centre.</p>
</speech>

<p>Perhaps I could say something further which might help to mollify the hon. Gentleman. As I have said, the Government have undertaken to introduce legislation that will limit a local authority's expenditure on capital works in any year to the product of a two penny rate. That is a firm promise. This, of course, may help such authorities as West Ham. In addition to that, the expenditure on Civil Defence that does fall on the rates will count for the purpose of the equalisation of grant under the Local Government Act, 1948.<br/>
In this way the rate of grants which may be actually paid in a particular case&#x2014;I cannot say whether it will be paid in this case; I have not yet had a chance of considering the matter&#x2014;directlyand indirectly, by the means that I have suggested, on a control centre such as that indicated by the hon. Gentleman, might reach as high as 90 per cent. I think the hon. Gentleman need not fear that all is lost, and that West Ham will have to bear 25 per cent. I appreciate that there is disappointment. When there is a change, someone is bound to be disappointed, but I rather think that where

the loss has fallen it will probably have to lie. However, I will write to the hon. Gentleman.</p>

<p>I appreciate that we cannot continue this matter, but as it is rather important, I should like to know whether, if the council concerned so desired, the hon. Gentleman would be prepared to meet the town clerk and the members of the council to discuss the matter. I personally cannot agree that, even if the grant were 90 per cent., the council should have to find even 10 per cent. I feel that the Exchequer should find the whole amount. Perhaps he would meet the town clerk and the council and discuss the matter.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman is arguing a different case. It is one which was decided as long ago as the time of the passing of the Civil Defence Act. I appreciate that his local authority may have been disappointed, but only disappointed in the way that everyone is disappointed when things do not turn out exactly as one hopes they will.<br/>
The hon. Member for Oldbury and Halesowen (Mr. Moyle) raised a number of points. He asked about local authorities qualifying for grant. All authorities on whom functions are conferred by Regulations under Section 2 of the Act&#x2014;that is to say, generally speaking, county councils and county boroughs&#x2014;will qualify for grant. Some district councils will receive the grant direct, but there is an exception where a district exercises the function of agent of the county; in that case the grant will be paid to the county and passed on. That is the position. I think that answers the hon. Member's point. The hon. Gentleman also asked what was included in the 75 per cent. grant.</p>

<p>No. I asked whether wages, salaries and the cost of uniforms were to rank only for the 75 per cent. grant, and I expressed the hope that it would be the 100 per cent. grant.</p>

<p>The position is that what is in the Schedule will receive the 100 per cent. grant&#x2014;full reimbursement. Anything that is not mentioned in the Schedule will rank only for the 75 per cent. grant. Local authorities do employ paid people for Civil Defence purposes, although, of course, the great majority of


the members of the Civil Defence Corps are volunteers and are unpaid. But where wages are paid&#x2014;for example, to instructors and Civil Defence officers&#x2014;they will rank for 75 per cent. only and not 100 per cent. I think I have answered the points raised, and I hope the House will now give this Motion unanimous approval.</p>

<q>That the Draft Coastal Flooding (Acreage Payments) Scheme (No. 2), 1953, a copy of which was laid before this House on 17th November, be approved.</q>
This is the second Scheme under the Coastal Flooding (Emergency Provisions) Act of this year, and it provides acreage payments for the rehabilitation of farm land and allotments damaged by the floods of 31st January last. The details of the second Scheme follow similar lines to those of the first. Hon. Members will notice that there have been some modifications and telescoping in the Schedule, but the main criteria for qualification for acreage payments will be the state of the land on 1st January next and, combined

with that, the general method of management which is then approved for the land in the coming year.<br/>
Payment will be made to the occupier of the land on 4th June, and his application must be in by 31st August. This will enable the county agricultural executive committees to ensure that the land is dealt with in the approved manner during the greater part of next year, before payment is actually made, and so will ensure that the proper measures are taken to rehabilitate the land, or, in the process of so doing, to bring it back into cultivation. I believe that the Scheme as drafted will give farmers the help which they need in this rehabilitation.</p>

<p>The Parliamentary Secretary has been commendably brief, and I shall try not to be unduly long in my remarks, but I feel that I must ask him a number of questions, particularly in regard to the experience of his Ministry in the administration of the previous Scheme that was adopted by this House. We were dealing with something rather novel. It was a new experience, and we might be able to learn something from it. Before parting with this Scheme, I think we ought to know something about the way in which the first Scheme has worked. That will give us an idea whether the second Scheme is likely to work well or ill.<br/>
This is very largely a continuation of the first Scheme, except for certain modifications, which I believe to be in the right direction. The first Scheme made provision for acreage payments at rates which varied according to the crop and to the extent of damage to the land. In the case of damage to the land the payment differed according to whether the land was flooded or only damaged and not flooded by sea water. Both types of payment seemed to me to contain&#x2014;as, of course, they did&#x2014;a considerable element of compensation. But the main purpose of the Act was to bring the land back into full productivity as soon as possible.<br/>
That was the main consideration as far as the nation is concerned. To the individual farmer the aspect of compensation was a pretty considerable one, but the intention to bring back the land into full productivity was the matter which


was of interest to the nation. I have been wondering what the first Scheme actually achieved in the way of a return to full productivity, and in what way it has simulated the farmer. Can the Parliamentary Secretary say that in his opinion the first Scheme was a success?<br/>
My second point concerns the extent of the cost to the Treasury. This is an important matter. We are here as guardians of the money which comes from the taxpayers, and it is our job to find out how much these Treasury payments have amounted to. If we can be told that, we shall be able to decide whether or not they have been justified. Is the Minister satisfied with the way in which the county agricultural executive committees have been approving the management of the land for which these acreage payments have been made, that is, with a view to a return to full productivity? I am assured by farmers in Suffolk, whose land was very badly damaged by this flooding, that the administration of the Scheme in that county has been reasonable. There has been great care exercised by the county agricultural executive committee in checking the claims that the farmers have made.</p>

<p>What I am trying to do, before parting with the new Scheme, the second made under these arrangements, is to ascertain what has been done under the old Scheme, and the experience there has been of it, to give us an idea whether we can approve this Motion, this second Scheme. I do not want to go into this fully. Indeed, I am coming to the end of my questions on the administration and experience of the first Scheme.<br/>
The points I want now to make arise definitely out of the Scheme before the House at the moment. The first question is, what is the estimated cost of the Scheme? Second, what steps has the Minister taken to satisfy himself that the payments now proposed are roughly fair to the farmers whose land was heavily inundated with salt water? As the Parliamentary Secretary himself said, payments have been scaled down under this second Scheme, and I wonder if he has taken steps to ascertain the point of view of the

people concerned as to whether the payments are fair having regard to the fact that there are many acres from which very little will be got, I think, in 1954.<br/>
I have only two more questions. On the point of the crops mentioned in the second Scheme, I am wondering whether they have been selected because they are regarded as tolerant of salt. I think myself all the cereals are certainly in that category, but I am wondering about some of the crops included under the heading of agricultural crops. That can embrace almost anything, and many of those crops, I should think, are not suitable for sowing on land that has been affected by the inundation of sea water.<br/>
The last question is one on the laying down of the grass as mentioned in the second paragraph of the Schedule. I am wondering whether suitable advice was given under the old Scheme and will be given under the new Scheme as to the type of grass best suited to salty conditions. I noticed in the "Farmers' Weekly" last Friday that from Dutch experience it has been shown quite clearly that Ryegrass, Meadow Fescue and Perennial Timothy are the most suitable types of grass following salt inundation. I am wondering whether care has been taken to ensure that that sort of advice has been given to farmers under the old Scheme and whether the farmers will be suitably advised, having regard to Dutch experience, under the Scheme before us.<br/>
Finally, I do welcome this Scheme. I am glad I am able to do this at a time when everything seems to bleak for the Minister and Ministry of Agriculture. It is nice that we should be able to give a welcome to a Scheme produced in the conditions which we have now. I support it.</p>

<p>As I live in Cambridgeshire and represent a Lincolnshire constituency, naturally I am very interested in this Scheme. My constituency being the city of Lincoln, none of my constituents is affected by it, but since there are, unfortunately, no other Lincolnshire Members present when this important Motion affecting the whole acreage payments under the Coastal Flooding Scheme comes up, I think it is only right that I should ask if the Parliamentary Secretary is satisfied that the


fanners of the heavily inundated areas of Lincolnshire are going to get a fair share of the payments under this Scheme. I should like to take this opportunity of agreeing with the concluding words of my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, South-East (Mr. Champion). When something goes right for the Ministry of Agriculture it is fair that we should say so, because they have taken such a beating in every part of the country.</p>

<p>Perhaps, by leave of the House, I may reply to the questions put to me by the hon. Member for Derbyshire, South-East (Mr. Champion). The first question, which I may answer by your leave, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, is germane to the Order because this Order and the Schedules are based entirely on the experience we have had this year and the terms of the first scheme.<br/>
I was asked what the first scheme has achieved in the way of rehabilitation in the 12 months which expire at the end of this year and in returning the land to productivity. The general answer is that it has made only a beginning. On some of the lighter lands, where the soil structure does not suffer so much by salt damage, on the one hand, or, on the other hand, where there are good soil drainage conditions and where possibly the rainfall has helped to leach the salt out a little, there has been some improvement during the past eight or nine months, but the general condition of the land varies not only from county to county but from field to field according to the nature of the land, the period for which it was flooded, the amount of salt which was in the water when it was flooded and the rainfall which has been experienced since then. There are a number of variables in the picture.<br/>
We have the impression that on the heavy lands&#x2014;and that will account for most of the marsh grazings in Essex, Norfolkand Suffolk on the clay soils&#x2014;rehabilitation is going to be a fairly long job and is likely to take, at any rate on the most difficult land, the whole of the five years provided in the Act; that is to say, probably up to the end of 1957. We have, however, gained a great deal of valuable experience in the first year and we are fairly confident that the lines we are pursuing are the right ones.</p>

<p>May I put a further question on that point? I am not very clear from my memory of the previous scheme&#x2014;perhaps I ought to be&#x2014;whether any point is established at which the land can be said to have been rehabilitated. My hon. Friend has mentioned light land where drainage is good and leaching may have removed the salt. Presumably if land recovers within the period it ceases to be eligible for payment when it has recovered to its proper condition.</p>

<p>Yes. That is so. It is not possible to lay down any clear definition of the exact condition which land must reach to be fully restored. We have regard to the percentage of salt in the soil, and we have regard to the look of the land and to the conditions on the field itself.</p>

<p>Yes. I was about to come to that in dealing with one of the questions asked by the hon. Member for Derbyshire, South-East. Perhaps I may first deal with the bon. Gentleman's question about cost and then I will return to the question asked by my hon. Friend. The cost up to date, until November, has been &#x00A3;1,190,000, and we expect that by the end of this year it will probably be about &#x00A3;1,500,000. That covers an acreage of 139,545,including some 237 acres of allotments, about which I recollect the House was rather anxious when we discussed the last scheme.<br/>
Coming to the point of the administration of the agricultural executive committees who continue under this new scheme to be our agents in this matter, the House will be interested to know that they have done a really good job. Between the executive committees, their advisory staffs and the district committees they have tried to survey every single field which has been flooded in all the counties concerned and advise the farmers individually about every field, about how they could cultivate it or not cultivate it, or how they could crop it or not crop it in this year.<br/>
They have done a tremendous job when one considers that they had to survey some 139,000 acres. They are now in


progress, in connection with the scheme before the House, of making a re-survey in order to decide what is the condition of each field with regard to its qualification for acreage payments and what mode of management should be followed in the coming 12 months. When they have made their second survey, it is intended that they shall put in writing, in order to give greater certainty to this second scheme, exactly what the conditions should be for the coming 12 months. The House can be assured that this work has been most conscientiously done, that the money voted for the purpose is being properly spent and that the land is being properly brought back into production.<br/>
We have been greatly helped in this by the Dutch, and I should like to pay tribute to them on behalf of the Government for the assistance they have given us. They have been most helpful in inviting us over there to see what they have done and in giving us every facility from the technical experience which they have had of this matter in the past.<br/>
I have been asked for an estimate of the cost of this new scheme. While it is difficult to be certain about it, I should say that it will be between &#x00A3;1 million and &#x00A3;1&#x00BD; million, in other words, about the same amount as in the past year. I was also asked what steps had been taken to ensure that the acreage payment will be adequate.</p>

<p>On the point of &#x00A3;1 million or &#x00A3;1&#x00BD; million against &#x00A3;1&#x00BD; million last year, I noticed that this Order makes provision for just about half the amount of the payments. Does that mean that additional acreages will qualify?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1953-11-26a.621.1" hansard_membership_id="9846" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/18980" speakername="Mr. Nugent" colnum="621" time="">
<p>The only Schedule where the payments are being halved is in respect of the very expensive horticultural crops, for which in the first Scheme we provided &#x00A3;80 an acre and this year are providing &#x00A3;40 per acre. The actual acreage involved there is very small indeed&#x2014;20 to 30 acres of small holdings, which although important, are not really significant in the total sum.<br/>
The far greater part of the acreage concerned is marsh grazing&#x2014;something like 91,000 acres&#x2014;and most of the rest of it is arable land growing cereal crops. The House will see that the broad picture is that most of this will have to continue in much the same way as it has

this year and will qualify for acreage payments in much the same way. Some of it will have to carry crops of some kind, but it will still need acreage payments because the crops will not be very big.<br/>
A great deal of trouble has been taken to study this matter on the spot. We have had advice from all our county agricultural officers so as to get a clear picture, and in the light of that we have made a few adjustments in the Schedule. One or two items have gone up a little, particularly in regard to cereals, because experience has shown that cereal crops sown on this salt damaged land in practice yield less than we expected. In many cases the plant looked quite good during the early summer months but when crops came to harvest they proved to be very light indeed. Therefore, we learnt that if farmers were to be asked to plant crops in this flood-damaged land, because it would be beneficial to the land to do so, we must give them a slightly larger acreage payment to reimburse them for the poor crop which they would gather.<br/>
I was then asked whether the crops covered by paragraph 3 of the Schedule have been specially designated because they are resistant to salt. The answer is that they are not. They are simply the ordinary crops, and in most places it will be cereal crops that are grown. We have included horticultural crops because it is possible that in some cases, and particularly that of the smallholder, the person concerned would wish to plant a horticultural crop and our adviser might think that it was worth while to do so. I imagine, however, that that would be the exception and that normally, if the land was in a doubtful condition, it would not be worth planting a crop as expensive as that.<br/>
On the question of advice on the best grass seeds to sow, we are making full use of the Dutch experience in this matter and are giving similar advice to our farmers. I stress again, however, that undoubtedly we have quite a problem with this permanent grassland, which is the main part of the flooded land and which has shown during the year that it was far worse damaged than we expected. Most of the grass has gone and nearly all that is growing there now are salt-loving weeds. It will take quite a long


time before we can get that land back into a condition where we can sow grass seeds with a reasonable prospect of their taking earth. However, that will be persisted with. Further applications of gypsum will help, and all the proper management will be applied.<br/>
I hope that following these lines of action we will progressively bring this considerable acreage of farmland back again into production, and I hope that the House will now be prepared to give its approval to the Scheme.</p>

<p>At times when the House has sat into the small hours of the morning, I assume that it would be in order to apologise for detaining the House still further. Fortunately, tonight I have no such qualms of conscience, because the Motion for the Adjournment has been moved at a reasonable hour. At the start, I should declare my interest. I am a commander, R.A.O.C, in the Army Emergency Reserve, and as a result I have a personal interest in this subject.<br/>
I should make it clear, because I still have another year's training to do, that what I say tonight and what I have said in the past on this subject of the training of the Army Emergency Reserve must not be interpreted in any way as a criticism of the way in which my own corps undertakes its training. I do not think any praise could be too high for the efficiency and enthusiasm of the headquarters responsible, aided by its training establishment. It has shown remarkable ingenuity over a long time in making the maximum number of bricks with the minimum amount of straw, but it cannot do the impossible, and in my opinion the

training of the Army Emergency Reserve is not producing the results that we require.<br/>
I am well aware that the A.E.R. consists very largely of service and administrative units, such as the R.A.O.C, R.A.S.C, R.E.M.E., and so on, and I know that a large number of these units are to be used to reinforce the static and semi-static home and base installations. I am not concerned with that type of unit tonight. As far as I can judge, their training is probably adequate and is very well carried on in the existing home depots. I want to concentrate my remarks entirely on the training of the field force units.<br/>
I think that all hon. Members are well aware that the Reserve Army today plays a vital part in the European defence system. When it is remembered that the Western Powers are able to deploy only a very limited number of Regular divisions in Europe, as against a Power that has available, so we are told, something like 175 Regular Army divisions and something like 70 satellite divisions, it can be seen that the task that would face our Regular divisions in time of war would be a very formidable one. Their chance of survival would depend very largely on our ability to mobilise our Reserve Forces very quickly and move them to the place where they were most urgently required. Those Reserve Forces at the outset would be put up against the regular forces of the enemy, and if their training was not adequate, then, to put it no higher, they would start at a very considerable disadvantage.<br/>
A large number of the A.E.R. units will not be found further forward than the corps area, but under conditions of modern warfare it is as essential for them to be efficient as it is for the forward units. What we have to ask ourselves is whether the training now given to the A.E.R. is likely to produce at the end of three years units able to operate efficiently in the field and, above all, to survive as far as they can.<br/>
The A.E.R. is, I think, the Cinderella of the Reserve Army, and, unlike the Territorial Army, it has no drill halls or the amenities that go with them. The units draw their men from all over the country and rarely do they see one another except for the two weeks' training camp each year. In general,


it is true to say that less training equipment is issued than to the Territorial Army, and the units very rarely receive in training anything like the number of vehicles which they would normally have in war establishments in time of war. As a result of that, especially in the case of technical units which normally have a large number of vehicles, the unit commanders get the wrong ideas about the problems involved in movements of vehicles and in their dispersal under the threat of jet plane attacks, which they may have to face in time of war.<br/>
A small point is that, unlike the Territorial Army, they never see their scale of equipment, G.1098. Again unlike the Territorial Army, they do not enjoy the facilities of standing Training Camps with permanent staffs which take a large burden of the administration from the officers, thus enabling them to devote much more time to the more essential work of training. Another very small grouse is that, in general, they have to carry out all their fatigues. That means that a large number of their men are engaged day by day on fatigues instead of training. I know the problem there is one of man. power, but it is a problem which we have to face.<br/>
Most of these are deficiencies which we can make good, but there is one problem which is more difficult, and that is the problem of instructors. It is probably true that the resources of the Regular Army today are strained to the limit. I should have thought that the problem of training this ever-growing Emergency Reserve was becoming an absolute nightmare, and, furthermore, it is a fact that the A.E.R. finds it extremely difficult to provide sufficient efficient instructors from its own resources.<br/>
When we take that into account, together with the fact that the average emergency reservist receives less than six weeks effective training in the whole of his three years' service, it makes it more essential that the training programme should depart from the usual conventional type of training like drills, demonstrations and lectures, and concentrate mainly on the practical training designed to enable the Reservists to operate quickly, to be able to move quickly and to look after themselves.<br/>
Without going any further into the demerits of the existing system, perhaps I may be allowed at this stage to make some suggestions which I hope my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for War will regard as constructive and helpful. On the administrative side, I suggest that the Reserve units should have a Regular Army adjutant allocated to a group of units over a period of training. Such an adjutant would take off the shoulders of the Reserve officers many of the problems that beset them at the moment. He could help with the mass of paper work, and he could give officers and the orderly room staffs very valuable personal training.<br/>
It is much more difficult to be specific with regard to the period of training because the requirements of units vary according to their type. However, perhaps I might make a few general suggestions. I would say from experience of handling technical units that it is practically impossible to give adequate technical training to a unit in a two weeks' period in each of three years. Therefore, the emphasis should be on the practical field work, such as driver training, with its corollary of movement discipline and map reading. Again the emphasis should be on concealment dispersal and protection against air attack, which will be a vast and difficult problem for units with a large concentration of vehicles.<br/>
Then, again, much greater attention should be paid to practical weapon training rather than concentration on lectures, because the standard of weapon handling amongst certain service units of the Army today is at a deplorable level. The units should take part as far as they can in exercises with other units, and if possible with formations. For instance, why cannot they take part in Territorial Army divisional exercises?<br/>
In the third year I suggest that Army emergency units&#x2014;certainly corps units and possibly Army units&#x2014;might train with a formation in Germany. I am well aware of the financial and other difficulties in the way of such a suggestion, but if a corps unit goes through an exercise of mobilising and moving to a European theatre of war, not only the units themselves but the general staff will get much extremely valuable experience in the problems that will arise if the Reserve Army has to be mobilised and moved rapidly.<br/>
Above all, I would plead for sufficient training equipment, and that the unit at least sees the number of vehicles which it has to handle in time of war, so that it can see the problems of drivers, of dispersal and of movement that are likely to arise. If the manpower situation makes it impossible for others to do the fatigues which would normally fall to the lot of such a unit, I would plead that it does its training under field conditions where fatigues are reduced to a minimum, and where such as are done at least give training in field craft or field domestic work under more realistic and characteristic conditions.<br/>
Perhaps I ought to conclude this brief grouse with a reference to the major problem that besets the Emergency Reserve and conditions its entire efficiency&#x2014;indeed its existence&#x2014;the problem of the volunteer. I know that the Secretary of State for War has done everything he can to stimulate recruitment. I know that my right hon. Friend has endeavoured to interest the Press and to do other things designed to give publicity to the need fox recruits. It is almost impossible to form and maintain an efficient unit without a nucleus of volunteer officers, especially N.C.O's.<br/>
If I may quote the R.A.O.C. as typical of the whole, the number of volunteers there, including National Service men, is 15 per cent. of the existing Reserve strength, and of that 15 percent. probably two-thirds may have had active service experience in the last war. That situation may deteriorate because a number of the existing officers, especially commanding officers and senior N.C.O's, when they come to the end of their present three-year term of training, may not volunteer for a further period. At any rate, that seems to be the present tendency. As a result of these problems we are not able to form all the units required, and large numbers of men today are being trained under the block training system, which everybody agrees is not the best form of training by a long way.<br/>
Perhaps I could make a few suggestions here. One of the main obstacles that I have found to persuading men to volunteer is the fact that many of them have to give up their holidays to attend training camp. Their wives very naturally object, and they themselves

object. There are some employers, and Government Departments who give a very good lead in this respect, and who make up the whole or part of that service, but there are many who do not. It is understandable, therefore, that it is very difficult to get a married man, especially a very young man recently married, to volunteer to give up his summer holidays for training in the Army. He feels that when he has finished his National Service liability there is no reason why he should do so.<br/>
I suggest that the Government might consider a scheme rather similar to that introduced for disabled ex-Service men whereby the employer would be asked to give special facilities to volunteers under similar conditions to those under which they were asked to employ a certain percentage of disabled ex-Service men. That might be regarded as impracticable, but I make the suggestion because I regard an efficient Reserve Army as vital to the defence of Europe. If we think today that we have a well-trained Reserve Army, we are deluding ourselves. I do not think that we have.<br/>
There are one or two minor suggestions which might be considered. If we are going to issue a walking-out uniform to emergency reservists at any time, the volunteer might be given the first issue. That is a small point, but there is no doubt that an attractive uniform plays a part in recruitment. I suggest also that Territorial Army headquarter facilities might be placed at the disposal of the Reservists so that during the year they can go to the canteen or the sergeants' mess or officers' mess in their locality and enjoy the hospitality of the Army and keep in touch with Army ways and developments during the intervening years.<br/>
Lastly, I should like to appeal to the Press. This problem of volunteers is not new. There is an old Army saying which refers to the adjectival inadvisability of volunteering for anything and with the development of national conscription I sometimes think that the volunteer spirit is beginning to die out. I hope that I am wrong. I should like to be proved wrong, and I should like the Press to help me prove myself wrong. I think that it was Oscar Wilde who said that if there is one thing worse than being talked about, it is not being talked about. That is


something from which the Army Emergency Reserve suffers. It has not been talked about enough.<br/>
The Press could do a great deal in presenting the case to the public and calling for volunteers, and I hope that it will do so. If the general public were made aware of the really vital importance of a Reserve Army to the security of this nation, we might get the volunteers, employers might be prepared to play their part in giving facilities to the men to volunteer, and the wives and womenfolk might be persuaded to encourage the men to do so.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe (Mr. John Hall) has embarked on a complicated theme and has carried me with him on to a complicated theme. He highlighted certain suggestions which I think arose from his own experience, but I think that it would not be unhelpful if I were to paint a slightly broader picture to begin with and come at a later stage to the particular points to which my hon. Friend was drawing attention.<br/>
When, after the war, we planned to reconstruct our auxiliary forces, that is, the Territorial Army and the Army Emergency Reserve&#x2014;up to then known as the Supplementary Reserve&#x2014;we were faced with a great many complicated problems. Firstly, the technical character of modern warfare and at the same time the immense extension of welfare, which has been going on all the time&#x2014;rightly going on for the benefit of the soldier&#x2014;brought into existence a multiplicity of services generally of a rather specialised and small type. They were things like mobile laundries, light-aid detachments, and the tyre repair units. There must be very few members of the general public who have any idea of the tremendous gamut of different organisations, both Regular and Reserve which exist at present. In addition, there are the more normal services, such as the Ordnance Corps, R.E.M.E., the Signals, the R.A.S.C., and so on. Some of these small units are destined in the event of an emergency to go with the Army overseas and others are destined or earmarked to stay at home.<br/>
One of our problems is how we are to gather together the relatively small

numbers of individuals who do that specialised work and are scattered all over the United Kingdom from Land's End to John o'Groat's and weld them into a unit. It is quite a different matter when we have a large number of individuals with the same experience of warfare and the Army living closely concentrated. Then one can make headway on training. That was the first category with which we had to deal and the first problem with which we were presented. The second category might be described as the reinforcements we wanted&#x2014;first-line reinforcements&#x2014;for base Ordnance depots, command workshops and so on. The men who were earmarked for that r&#x00F4;le did not themselves form into units but were to be fitted into existing Regular units.<br/>
The third and much the biggest category was of those who were in neither of the other two categories either because they did not get trade training, or because the units were already full, or the geographical distances between them was such that they could not be fitted into T.A. units. In that category, known as A.E.R. II, there are such pools upon which we can call for first-line reinforcements for infantry, the R.A.C. and other combatant duties. My hon. Friend said that some only of the A.E.R.&#x2014;as the Bills and Acts say, "hereafter to be referred to as reservists"&#x2014;are destined to be part of the field force in one form or another, but it is almost the whole lot. I do not think we can say that one particular type is entitled to get a higher form of training than another, because ultimately most of them are to be fitted into some form of unit, either as reinforcements of the infantry, the R.A.C, or some of the other Services in the field.<br/>
With the exception of the volunteers, the Reserve consists of National Service men who are doing their part-time training. Naturally, we are anxious to get as many of these volunteers as we can&#x2014;as my hon. Friend rightly said&#x2014;because if a man can be persuaded to stay on after he has done his obligatory period of part-time service he automatically exhibits an interest and keenness in his training which make him a valuable individual. I wholeheartedly back up what my hon. Friend said about the importance and desirability of


persuading these reservists to volunteer. We are making a little headway here, although it is not anything like what we want. The total of the Army Emergency Reserve is at present 110,000. Whereas in October, 1951, the figures for volunteers were 1,069 officers, 1,268 warrant officers and N.C.O's and 3,298 other ranks, on 1st October this year, there were 2,972 officers, 4,616 warrant officers and N.C.O's and 4,836 other ranks. That is a satisfactory increase, and what is particularly satisfactory, as I think my hon. Friend will notice, is that the biggest increase has taken place in the case of warrant officers and N.C.O's. These are exactly the types we want to have.<br/>
Turning to training in general, the reservist has to do, as in the Territorial Army, an obligatory 15 days annual training. In some cases they volunteer&#x2014;they are not forced to do so&#x2014;to do some extra part-time training in the form of going on courses or to training conferences. All this represents a pretty heavy headache to us, especially in the case of those who come into the third category. An enormous number of individuals are not earmarked for any particular task, they are earmarked for some arm or service and are looked after by the headquarters of their arm or service. They have no specific tasks for which they are already being trained, apart from the general training.<br/>
As the National Service men are passing out of their full-time service in ever-increasing numbers, the total which we are having to deal with is becoming formidable. How do we try to deal with the annual training of these 110,000 men? Let me take the category which I first mentioned, those reservists who are already in units or sub-units of Ordnance parks, R.E.M.E. light aid detachments, etc. They do their training under the auspices of, but are not absorbed into Regular units. The Regular units, so to speak, stand sponsor for the training and help them; they will train with their own personnel but will also get personnel lent by the Regular Army.<br/>
There are a few, and they must be volunteers, who do their training in B.A.O.R. because, as my hon. Friend has recognised, one of our greatest difficulties is that we are short of enough Regular

parent units in this country to be able to shoulder all the responsibilities which we ask them to do all the time&#x2014;Territorial Army, floods, strikes, etc. All kinds of odds and ends of jobs are landed on to the Army. A few of the reservists train with the Territorial Army but the great majority are not incorporated in units and are regarded, as I say, as first-line reinforcements who are trained with the Regulars.<br/>
My hon. Friend had some criticism to make of the equipment made available for the training of all these men. The majority of the categories which carry out their training are either with, or under the supervision of, Regular units. They will clearly get the same equipment as the Regular units have because in one case they are with the Regular units and are using their equipment, while in the second case they will normally use their own A.E.R. equipment, but this in its turn is drawn from equipment held for peace-time maintenance and is comparable to the mobilisation equipment.<br/>
Of course, equipment changes&#x2014;tanks, wireless sets, vehicles, guns, etc.&#x2014;and with the best will in the world it is not possible that the latest piece of equipment should always at once be available for all the units that go to make up the British active Army and Reserve Army. I am sure that my hon. Friend will recognize that. Through the process of time much of this modern equipment gradually filters through&#x2014;</p>

<p>That is the theory, I have no doubt, but in fact the training equipment available even for a Regular unit is quite inadequate.</p>

<p>That can be gone into, but I am informed that many of these units are not fully issued with equipment to which they are entitled, because they are not up to strength, and I think that is a reasonable way of looking at it. We cannot expect a unit greatly under strength to be issued with the same equipment as a unit fully up to strength, but I would be glad to have a talk with my hon. Friend about that to see if we can find any examples.<br/>
Even if what he says is true, my argument still applies, that we cannot get the latest form of whatever piece of equipment or weapon it is into the hands of everyone, even the whole of the Regular Army, at the same time. He may say that we are taking a prodigiously long time to do it, but that is another argument. It is not physically possible, for example, if we decide to change from Sten to Patchett guns, for every unit to have Patchett guns on the following Monday. Of course I am exaggerating and oversimplifying the matter, but it does take time to filter through. I think it must be agreed that we must give the Regular forces equipment, particularly those in action in places like Malaya or Korea, before we can afford to supply it elsewhere.<br/>
As regards the training of the R.A.O.C. in particular, we have had some difficulty in finding parent units to which to attach some of the Army Emergency Reserve units, because in fact these parent units are not in existence. So some of the training has had to be a little artificial, and it needed a good deal of imagination to get oneself into the true picture. But after all we have had to do that in a great many military exercises. Nothing, for example, could be more artificial than a telephone battle, but that is a perfectly well known, recognised and useful form of exercise. We are in fact organising a new system of training rather on the same type as applying to Territorial units. There will be unit training for a couple of years, then brigade training for one year, and finally divisional training.<br/>
My hon. Friend asks that these units should be used in divisional exercises. Most certainly that should be done and they have been and will be so used this year. It is valuable and necessary that Service units or sub-units of a Service should be given a chance of operating under the conditions in which they will be called upon to operate in time of war, and I am absolutely in agreement about that. In the past year we have trained about 100 R.A.O.C. units, workshop, stores section, laundry units, port units and "A" and "B" vehicle units. Reservists have been given training at Chilwell, which is a motor transport depot, at Bicester, which is a technical stores depot, and Didcot, which is a general stores depot.<br/>
I wish to come to the question of publicity. It is true that the A.E.R. is not sufficiently well known. Of course this to a certain extent stems from a sparseness of funds. But we have a pretty ambitious programme for the current year, including a series of Press advertisements appearing in three Sunday national papers and approximately 65 provincial papers. We are also producing new A.E.R. posters, and on the stands of the Royal Tournament, at Radio Olympia and the Amateur Radio Show there were posters featuring the A.E.R., Royal Signals and R.E.M.E. But anything which can be done to bring to the public notice these important "boffins" of the Reserve Army who are most valuable, most precious and who play a vital r&#x00F4;le in keeping a modern Army in the field&#x2014;anything which can be done to show in full our appreciation of them would be immensely valuable.<br/>
The day has long since gone when an Army could saddle its horses or march off and live off the country. Nowadays we have to have an endless, complicated chain of organisations behind an Army to allow it to move and to provide the supplies of fuel, food and ammunition which it consumes in appalling quantities. It is part of this duty that the Army Emergency Reserve would in fact fulfil. They are immensely important.<br/>
There are some public-spirited organisations which have recognised that they have within themselves talent&#x2014;talent in their ordinary civilian work of every day&#x2014;which could be of value to the Army and to the Reserve in some form or another. Thus we have had the Automobile Association encouraging their members to join the Provost companies and this year they trained 230 strong at the headquarters of the Army Emergency Reserve Royal Military Police at Aldershot.<br/>
Then there is the Thomas Cook Travel Agency who have produced a Movement Control group which carried out its military training this year at the Embarkation Establishment at Harwich. If it is to these good folk something of a busman's holiday, at any rate they are patriotic busmen. Those are just two examples of the way in which organisations can turn the talent and the experience which is theirs to the benefit of the Army.<br/>
I hope that I have not left too much unanswered. I have answered the main questions and I do not think I have missed much. My hon. Friend talked about fatigues and about trying to relieve the Reserves during their training. I do not think that is possible. Each unit has to stand on its own feet as regards fatigues. Who will do them otherwise? We cannot expect National Service men or Regular soldiers to do them, other wise National Service will become less popular or more unpopular&#x2014;</p>

<p>I appreciate that, but I suggested that perhaps a far greater amount of training could be done under field conditions. Will my hon. Friend refer to my suggestion that the third year's training should take the form of a mobilisation exercise?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1953-11-26a.635.1" hansard_membership_id="6495" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30027" speakername="Mr. Hutchison" colnum="635" time="">
<p>I should like to look into that question. It is a big commitment to make on the Floor of the House. My hon. Friend is right. Practical training rather than technical training is probably, in a fortnight, more valuable. At the moment the plan is that in most units the men spend the first week on general military training, in musketry, on ranges, and so on. But I should like to look into that matter. It is a little difficult for one who is not a technical soldier to be able to give answers on these questions of detail. My hon. Friend knows far more about this than I do. Perhaps he will allow me to look into that question. I will have a talk with my advisers and see what they have to say.<br/>
I underline the fact that these reservists are paid for the period of training which

they do each year during the 15 day obligatory period of training. They get the ordinary Army rates of pay and marriage allowance during the period when they are temporary soldiers. In addition, the volunteers get annual bounties which vary between &#x00A3;9 and &#x00A3;50 a year. Those who get &#x00A3;50 a year are very special technical individuals and, in fact, they do not have to do much training either. If this was more widely known I think there would be an appreciation of just how generous these offers are.<br/>
I hope that my words, and the words of my hon. Friend, may persuade some who were doubtful or hesitant to volunteer to continue, after part-time service is over, in the Army Emergency Reserve. But I think it will be recognised&#x2014;I certainly do&#x2014;that as time passes, the organisation which can persuade and bring influence to bear upon the Army Emergency reservist to volunteer after he has come out of his full-time service with the active Army, is the active Army unit in which he is serving.<br/>
In the future, there is going to be practically no other source of recruitment, and it is hoped that while a man is in the Regular Army doing his National Service, where we trust he will be well treated, the prospect of continuing that training for 15 days each year for a certain number of years will appear to him to be not only a patriotic act but something that is not too distasteful.</p>
