<p>With your permission, Mr. Speaker, I beg to present a humble Petition signed by some hundreds of citizens of the United Kingdom most loyal subjects of the Crown. The Prayer is as follows :

The CLERK OF THE HOUSE (SIR EDWARD FELLOWES) <i>read the Petition to the House as follows :</i>
<q>To : The Honourable the Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in Parliament assembled :</q>
<q>The Humble Petition of the undersigned citizens of the United Kingdom sheweth :</q>
<q>That the Government and people of the United Kingdom by solemn declaration and affirmation have subscribed to the Charter of the United Nations.</q>
<q>And that the said Charter lays down in its preamble that the peoples of the United Nations are determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, to practice tolerance and live together in peace with

one another and as neighbours and to ensure by the acceptance of principles and the institution of methods that armed force shall not be used save in the common interest.</q>
<q>And that for these purposes provision has been made by Articles in the said Charter for the peaceful settlement of all disputes and that the ultimate responsibility for the implementation of these provisions shall be the Security Council and the General Assembly.</q>
<q>And that Her Majesty's Government have issued an ultimatum to the Government of Egypt which not having been accepted has led to armed conflict between the two countries on the instigation of Her Majesty's Government.</q></p>

<p>My Department on 28th October increased the basic price at which it sells raw sugar from 42s. 10&#x00BD;d. to 46s. 10&#x00BD;d. a cwt. in order to cover its costs on sugar during the current financial year. As a result, there was a corresponding increase in the first-hand price of granulated sugar. If the whole of this increase were passed on to the consumer it would amount to about &#x00BD;d. a lb., but there is keen competition and I expect the price to continue to vary from shop to shop. Since the effect upon the retail price is not known, it is not possible to estimate the additional cost to the consumer.</p>

<p>As the Government have failed in reducing prices&#x2014;and in some other respects as well&#x2014;has not the time come for the right hon. Gentleman to follow the praiseworthy example of his right hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Nutting) and tender his resignation from the Government?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-11-05a.1919.7" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. Amory" colnum="1919" time="">

<p>Why has the right hon. Gentleman jumped the gun? He has

just appointed the Sugar Board; why could he not have left this to the consideration of the Sugar Board? Does he not realise that he is open to the suspicion that he is doing this purely to help private enterprise?</p>

<p>The reasons arise, as I have explained, in pursuance of our normal policy of covering our costs. As I explained, I think, to the hon. Member for Sunderland, North (Mr. Willey) at the time the Sugar Bill went through the House, we did not intend to sell our stocks of sugar&#x2014;and these are purely seasonal stocks which will accumulate, as they always do, in the last three months of the year&#x2014;to the Sugar Board but, instead, to sell them to the refiners.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-11-05a.1920.3" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. Amory" colnum="1920" time="">
<p>Since June, 1954, 201 such proposals for private slaughterhouses have been received, of which 156 estimated to cost about &#x00A3;300,000 have been approved. Twenty-one are under consideration. In the same period, improvements costing &#x00A3;330,000 have been carried out at 42 slaughterhouses provided by local authorities, and one new public slaughterhouse costing &#x00A3;16,500 has been built. Many local authorities are known to have proposals for building new public slaughterhouses or for major reconstruction of existing premises. Owing to the restrictions on capital expenditure, I am at present unable to approve any local authority schemes except where the work is essential in the interests of public health and safety.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman says he is unable to approve many schemes submitted by local authorities and by private enterprise. Is this not happening at the same time that very great improvements are being made to facilities for beef imported into this country ; and is the home producer not, therefore, at a disadvantage in the quality of his produce reaching the consumer?</p>

<p>I am entirely with the hon. Member, I think, in wanting to see many new slaughterhouses built and existing ones improved. If the hon. Gentleman will study my answers, he will see that we do approve the very big majority of applications for private slaughterhouses, and the temporary restriction at present is on local authority slaughterhouses owing to the paramount need to restrict Government and local government expenditure temporarily.</p>

<p>Does not the right hon. Gentleman realise that it is quite intolerable to show this bias against the public authorities? Why this distinction? In Sunderland, as he is well aware, we have a scheme which has been supported by all interests in the town, and we have been told it is inopportune to put it forward now because there is no chance of it being accepted. Why distinguish between the public schemes of local authorities and those of private enterprise?</p>

<p>As my hon. Friend knows, silage varies enormously in quality, but I have had many indications that the average level of quality has been improving


during the past year or two. I am quite certain that good silage does help us to save a great deal of imported feeding-stuffs. That is one of the reasons why I am anxious to encourage it. Another reason is because I am sure that it will be to the economic advantage of the farmer to make it, provided that it is good.</p>

The only information is derived from the agricultural returns which are collected for other purposes and which exclude holdings of one acre or less and those parts of agricultural holdings not used for agricultural production.

<p>The earlier answer to which I referred showed that for the year ended 31st March, 1955, the latest year for which doctors' practice expenses have been reassessed, they were estimated for Great Britain to have been &#x00A3;23,549,227 or &#x00A3;1,114 per doctor, which is an increase of &#x00A3;114 over the preceding year. For 1954&#x2013;55 the balancing payment which has to be made when the final returns are in is about &#x00A3;4&#x00BC; million, which works out at about &#x00A3;200 per doctor, and this will be paid out with the December quarterly cheques.</p>

<p>With your permission, Mr. Speaker, and that of the House, I will make a further statement on Hungary in reply to Question No. 50.<br/>
At mid-day on Saturday, 3rd November, a meeting took place between senior Soviet and Hungarian officers to discuss the technical aspects of the withdrawal of Soviet forces from Hungary. The Soviet commander agreed that no more Soviet troops would cross the border during the course of the negotiations. The meeting was adjourned until 10 p.m. that night. The Hungarian military representatives, who returned to the meeting as stated, have not been heard of since.<br/>
At the time these negotiations began, Budapest was surrounded by two Russian divisions. Another five Soviet divisions were in the country.<br/>
Early on Sunday morning, Soviet forces attacked Budapest. In the course of the morning, a message reached Her Majesty's Legation to the effect that at 8 a.m. a Soviet ultimatum had been given to Mr. Nagy's Government, threatening to bomb Budapest if the Government had not capitulated by noon. By the time this message was delivered, the building in which Mr. Nagy and his colleagues were assembled was already surrounded by Russian tanks. The fate of Mr. Nagy and his Government is not yet officially known. According to agency reports, they are under arrest.<br/>
The resistance of the loyal Hungarian forces has not been overcome, although Moscow radio has, of course, announced that they have been crushed. Moscow radio also announced the formation of a Hungarian Revolutionary Workers and Peasants' Government with Mr. Kadar as Prime Minister. The first act of the puppet Government was to appeal to the Soviet Forces Command to crush their compatriots, whom they described as "mutinous forces."<br/>
Since yesterday morning, these tragic developments in Hungary have been discussed by both the Security Council and the General Assembly of the United Nations.<br/>
The General Assembly, in calling on the Soviet Government to desist from its intervention in Hungary and to withdraw its forces from the country, have asked the Soviet and Hungarian Governments to admit United Nations observers. They have also called on member Governments to make available food, medicines and other supplies which might be needed for the people of Hungary. This resolution was opposed only by the Soviet Union and its satellites.<br/>
Her Majesty's Government have decided to make a further grant of &#x00A3;25,000 to the Red Cross for supplies for Hungary.<br/>
In Hungary, we are witnessing a reversion to the worst features of the system of domination of other states which the world had come to associate with Stalin. The brave struggle for

freedom of a nation which was in breach of no agreements, desired only neutrality, and threatened no other country, continues against heavy odds.</p>

<p>Is the Foreign Secretary aware that many people in this and other countries will believe that the action of Her Majesty's Government in using force against the people and Government of Egypt offered a direct encouragement to the Government of Russia to employ the brutal force that they did yesterday, in Budapest, to suppress the struggles of the Hungarian people for freedom and independence? In those circumstances, may I ask the Foreign Secretary whether the Government will not do better than give another &#x00A3;25,000, but will give an assurance to the House that they will do everything possible to co-operate, in order to mitigate the sufferings of the Hungarian people, by providing economic aid&#x2014;</p>

<p>The right hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Rowley Regis and Tipton (Mr. A. Henderson) does no good to the people of Hungary, of Egypt, or of this country, in trying to suggest that these two actions are comparable. The action in Hungary is an intervention from without to suppress and prevent the independence of a country. Our intervention is to try to prevent a state of war between two countries.</p>

<p>A ghastly tragedy has befallen the people of Hungary. On behalf of Members of the Opposition side of the House, and, I have no doubt, of the House as a whole, I want to re-emphasise what my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition said, that our hearts go out to the Hungarian people who have been stricken as a result of this terrible situation in Hungary.<br/>
I wish to ask three questions of the Foreign Secretary. First, would he ensure that there is no <i>de jure</i> recognition of this new Government of Hungary? Secondly, will he give the medicines, the food and other supplies which the Hungarians need until it hurts, and not count the cost in &#x00A3; s. d.? Thirdly, as, in his statement, he indicated that the United Nations is calling on the Soviet Government to desist from their intervention in Hungary and to withdraw their forces from that country&#x2014;and as I have no doubt the representative of the Government in the United Nations will support that decision of the United Nations&#x2014;would it not be as well to carry out the United Nations decision on Egypt so that we can go to the United Nations with clean hands?</p>

<p>The question of recognition has not yet arisen because, as I say, the conflict in Hungary is not yet over. On the question of medicines, we did make a grant of &#x00A3;25,000 last Tuesday and as soon as that was spent a further grant of &#x00A3;25,000 was offered, as I have announced today. As I have said in answer to a question on my former statement, we shall be very ready to see an international force introduced in Hungary.</p>

<p>Everyone, I should imagine, throughout the free world is deeply moved by the agony of the Hungarian people, but sympathy, indignation and relief are not enough. These people want their freedom. Although Her Majesty's Government have weakened our position as the moral leaders of the world, can they not do something in the United Nations to help these people? Could they not suggest to the United Nations that more than observers should go there&#x2014;that an international police force might go there to take charge and, failing that, that sanctions should be then

administered against Russia, diplomatically and economically?</p>

<p>One of the difficulties of the present situation is that moral leadership is not enough. It is precisely for that reason that we had to take effective action and we have done what lay within our power to bring hostilities to an end in a troubled part of the world. I will certainly consider what the right hon. and learned Member has said, but I do not know whether it is feasible, in the situation in Hungary, to do more than is being done. I think it will be a difficult problem.</p>

<p>With your permission, Mr. Speaker, and that of the House, I will make a further statement on the Israel-Egypt situation.<br/>
Since the House met on Saturday the General Assembly of the United Nations, meeting in emergency Special Session, has passed three resolutions.<br/>
The first was sponsored by a number of Asian and African states. This called for a cease-fire, the halting of the movement of military forces and arms into the area and the withdrawal of all forces in the area behind the armistice lines. It authorised the Secretary-General to obtain compliance.<br/>
The second resolution was sponsored by Canada. It requested the Secretary-General to submit within 48 hours a plan for the setting up, with the consent of the nations concerned, of an emergency international United Nations force to secure and supervise the cessation of hostilities in accordance with the terms of the ceasefire resolution of 2nd November.<br/>
In a telegram received yesterday morning the Secretary-General of the United Nations drew the attention of Her Majesty's Government to these resolutions and requested all parties to bring a halt to all hostile military actions in the area by 8 o'clock Greenwich Mean Time yesterday. Her Majesty's Government had already invited the French Ministers to come to London for consultations. They informed Mr. Hammarskj&#x00F6;ld of this fact and explained that it was not possible to give him a definite answer to his message within the time limit which he had stipulated. As a result of their consultations with the French Government they sent a telegram to the Secretary-General very early this morning. This read as follows :
<q>The Governments of the United Kingdom and France have studied carefully the resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly passed on 3rd and 4th November.</q>
<q>They warmly welcome the idea which seems to underlie the request to the Secretary-General contained in the resolution sponsored by Canada, and adopted by the Assembly at its 563rd meeting, that an international force should be interpolated as a shield between Israel and Egypt pending a Palestine settlement and a settlement of the question of the Suez Canal. But according to their information


neither the Israeli nor the Egyptian Government has accepted such a proposal. Nor has any plan for an international force been accepted by the General Assembly or endorsed by the Security Council.</q>
<q>The composition of the staff and contingents of the international force would be a matter for discussion.</q>
<q>The two Governments continue to believe that it is necessary to interpose an international force to prevent the continuance of hostilities between Egypt and Israel, to secure the speedy withdrawal of Israeli forces, to take the necessary measures to remove obstructions and restore traffic through the Suez Canal, and to promote a settlement of the problems of the area.</q>
<q>Certain Anglo-French operations, with strictly limited objectives, are continuing. But as soon as the Israeli and Egyptian Governments signify acceptance of, and the United Nations endorses a plan for an international force with the above functions the two Governments will cease all military action.</q>
<q>In thus stating their views, the United Kingdom and French Governments would like to express their firm conviction that their action is justified. To return deliberately to the system which has produced continuing deadlock and chaos in the Middle East is now not only undesirable, but impossible. A new constructive solution is required. To this end they suggest that an early Security Council meeting at the ministerial level should be called in order to work out an international settlement which would be likely to endure, together with the means to enforce it.</q>
This message to the Secretary-General crossed a telegram from him informing Her Majesty's Government of the passing of a third resolution. This referred to the Canadian resolution, which I have already described, and to a preliminary report from the Secretary-General on the plan to set up an emergency International United Nations Force. It called for the establishment of United Nations command to secure and supervise the cessation of hostilities in accordance with all the terms of the earlier cease-fire resolution. It appointed General Burns, Chief of Staff of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation, Chief of Command on an emergency basis.<br/>
It authorised General Burns immediately to recruit from the Observer Corps of the Truce Supervision Organisation a limited number of officers who shall be nationals of countries other than those having permanent membership of the Security Council and further, in consultation with the Secretary-General, to undertake the recruitment directly from various Member States other than the permanent Member States of the Security Council the additional number of officers

required. Finally, it invited the Secretary-General to take such administrative measures as may be necessary for the prompt execution of the actions envisaged in this resolution.<br/>
Her Majesty's Government abstained from voting on this resolution. [HON. MEMBERS : "Shame!"] They fully approved the principle of an International United Nations Force. But although the steps called for in this latest resolution might be considered to be a beginning, they are not in themselves likely to achieve the purposes set out in our message to the Secretary-General. We do not know that hostilities between Israel and Egypt have ceased or that they will not be resumed. The measures to be taken under the latest resolution could not be sufficient to ensure that.<br/>
It is the policy of Her Majesty's Government to ensure that the Israel forces withdraw from Egyptian territory. We have also told the United Nations that we believe it is necessary to secure the speedy withdrawal of Israel forces. But we cannot ensure that the Israelis withdraw from Egyptian territory until we are physically in the area to keep the peace, to give the necessary guarantees and to prevent a repetition of the events of the past few years.<br/>
There must also be immediate means on the spot to take the necessary measures, as I have said, to remove obstructions and restore navigation through the Suez Canal, and to promote a settlement of the problems of the area.<br/>
It will, of course, be a matter for the Security Council, if our proposal for an early meeting at ministerial level is accepted, to consider what part the United Kingdom and France should play in achieving all the objectives to which I have referred. Meanwhile, Her Majesty's Government believe that the Anglo-French forces, once they are established in the area, will be the best guarantee that these purposes will be effectively and speedily achieved.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-11-05a.1958.0" hansard_membership_id="4695" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/15124" speakername="Mr. Gaitskell" colnum="1958" time="">
<p>The House has heard with astonishment the statement of the Foreign Secretary on why Her Majesty's Government abstained from voting on the Resolution of the United Nations General Assembly setting up an international force. Is the Foreign Secretary aware that the Resolution was sponsored by


Canada, that New Zealand has already said she is prepared to contribute troops to this force&#x2014;[An HON. MEMBER : "So are we."] On the contrary, the Government have just explained that they could not support this proposal.<br/>
Is the right hon. and learned Gentleman also aware that the United States Government, whilst accepting the proposal that the force should be composed of the troops of countries which are not permanent members of the Security Council, has nevertheless made it plain that she will make available aircraft and supplies for this international force? Can we clarify a little more the attitude of Her Majesty's Government to the international force proposal?<br/>
Therefore, the second question I ask is this : is it not the case that in the first Resolution, again introduced by Canada, the purpose of this force was defined as of secure and to supervise the cessation of hostilities in accordance with the terms of the Resolution of 2nd November ; that is to say, the cease-fire, the withdrawal of the combatants to within their own territories and the absence of any other intervention by any other party? If that is the case, why did Her Majesty's Government, in replying to the Resolution passed by the Assembly, suggest that the idea of the international force was not merely to secure and supervise the cessation of hostilities but also to secure a final settlement of the Suez Canal problem?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-11-05a.1959.0" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Hon. Members" colnum="1959" time="">

<p>Is the Foreign Secretary aware that by imposing that particular implication the effect is to confirm in the minds of the whole world that the real reason for British and French intervention here was not to separate the combatants but to seize control of the Canal? Is he further aware that if Her Majesty's Government insist that the purpose of the international force under the United Nations must be to deal with the Suez Canal problem, they will effectively sabotage the whole idea of that force?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-11-05a.1959.2" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. Lloyd" colnum="1959" time="">
<p>With regard to the question of the Resolution, the right hon. Gentleman has asked why the representative of the United Kingdom abstained. First, we could not vote for a proposition which excluded detachments of the forces of the permanent members of the Security

Council from this international force. [HON. MEMBERS : "Why not?"] The reason for this is quite simple&#x2014;that there has to be some reality about the situation. One has to consider the people who are able effectively to contribute those forces.<br/>
If hon. Members opposite still think that a few officers&#x2014;because that is all that the Resolution amounts to&#x2014;rather fewer than there have been in the Truce Supervision Organisation already, are going to solve this problem, they are quite mistaken. This Resolution may be a beginning but it will not solve this problem unless the international force is constituted to a much greater extent than is envisaged by the Resolution.<br/>
The Leader of the Opposition made a second accusation that we had done wrong in suggesting that the problems of the Suez Canal should be included to be settled whilst the international force was there. I should have thought he would have understood that the blockade on the shipping of a certain country going through the Canal&#x2014;[<i>Interruption</i>.]&#x2014; is one of the matters a settlement of which we have to try to get out of this situation. As for the talk of people being humbugs or hypocrites&#x2014;[<i>Interruption</i>.]&#x2014; those words apply to the people who for the past four years have consistently urged forcible action to deal with this matter.</p>

<p>Are we to understand from what the right hon. and learned Gentleman has just said that when Her Majesty's Government, in their reply to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, made reference to the settlement of the Suez Canal problem, all that they had in mind was ensuring the free passage of Israeli ships?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-11-05a.1960.1" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. Lloyd" colnum="1960" time="">

<p>Is it not a thousand pities that this positive, constructive proposal for an international police force, which may well be the key to the problem, should not receive much more objective treatment than apparently it has received up to now? In particular, the many points&#x2014;major points, but still points of detail&#x2014;such as the composition of the international force, could well be examined with an open mind, because


all of us would agree that there should be reality in this business and not merely imagination. It is also very desirable that the four belligerents should not find themselves actively engaged in a police force, if that proves to be possible.<br/>
Surely, the Leader of the Opposition is at fault in suggesting that the six principles which were voted by the United Nations in its consideration of this very question should be left out altogether when the international police force is being considered. Therefore, from all these points of view, I beg that it might be possible for the House to examine this&#x2014;it may be the only solution for the problem&#x2014;without the terrible heat which seems to be creeping into it just now.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-11-05a.1961.0" hansard_membership_id="4695" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/15124" speakername="Mr. Gaitskell" colnum="1961" time="">
<p>For my part, I entirely agree that we should examine this proposal objectively. I assure the right hon. Member for Kelvingrove (Mr. Elliot) that I was endeavouring to get clarification of the Government's view on it. I must, however, also say this and I put it in the form of a question. Is the Foreign Secretary aware that it is vitally important to distinguish between the setting up of an international force to deal with the Arab-Israeli question and an international force to impose on Egypt a solution of the Suez Canal problem? Does the Foreign Secretary realise that it is because I feel that this distinction is vital that I am pressing the difference between the two proposals?<br/>
Has the right hon. and learned Gentleman any information about where the proposed international force would be stationed? Is he, for instance, in agreement with the Prime Minister of New Zealand, who is reported as saying today that he presumed that the force would be stationed on the border between Israel and Egypt?<br/>
May I also ask the Foreign Secretary&#x2014;again, pursuing what the right hon. Member for Kelvingrove described as objective examination&#x2014;why Her Majesty's Government, in their first reply on this matter, made their consent to&#x2014;and, indeed, their acceptance of&#x2014;the United Nations Assembly Resolution conditional on Israel and Egypt both accepting the idea of an international United Nations force, whether they still adhere to that view and whether, if Egypt accepts, as she has done, it is the view of Her Majesty's Government that

nothing further can be done about this unless Israel also accepts? Could the Foreign Secretary enlighten us on these points?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-11-05a.1962.0" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. Lloyd" colnum="1962" time="">
<p>On the first point, with regard to the question of imposing a settlement of the Suez Canal issue, there is no question of imposing a settlement. I should have thought that every sensible person would have agreed that these things having happened, it was wiser that there should be a settlement of all those matters before the international policemen were removed. With regard to where the international force is to be stationed, I think that that would be a matter for the force commander himself to discuss with the Governments concerned.<br/>
Thirdly, with regard to the matter of acceptance by Egypt and Israel, I should have thought that as a practical proposition it would very much facilitate the development of this idea if those countries did agree to accept the international force, as it would have very much facilitated matters had both countries accepted our request of last Tuesday.</p>

<p>Will my right hon. and learned Friend urge upon our representative at the United Nations that in any future discussion on this subject, the test as to the composition of this United Nations force should not be whether those prepared to participate are small Powers who cannot provide the forces or large Powers who can, but should be the willingness of the nations concerned to accept United Nations observers and a police force in their own country?</p>

<p>Does my right hon. and learned Friend agree that the fact that this country has, in principle, agreed to the proposals of the Canadian Government for a police force&#x2014;and many of us hope that details can be worked out&#x2014;blows to smithereens the allegation that

<p>In view of the question which has just been asked, may I ask the Government to give their attention to what appears to be becoming apparent in almost all quarters of the House, that the war aims of the Government are being elicited from them day by day, and that they are being changed day by day? [<i>Interruption</i>.]<br/>
I earnestly suggest to hon. Members opposite that some of us are trying to maintain an objective attitude in this matter. It is extremely difficult to do so in face of the fact that the right hon. and learned Gentleman comes here without being armed with the information he ought to possess. If it is being said that the main objective of the Government has always been to separate the Jewish and Egyptian forces and not to achieve any objective beyond that, how does it come about that the Supreme Command uses this language in a leaflet :
<q>One thing which you can do is to wear civilian clothes. And go to your homes to see if any soldiers or tanks are concealed in your villages. Tell them to clear out before we come and destroy those villages. If they do no : evacuate, there is no doubt that your villages and homes will be destroyed. You have committed a sin, that is, you have placed confidence in Abd Al-Nasir and believed his lies. Now you are hearing the truth.</q>
This is the Supreme Allied Command, addressing Egyptian soldiers, sailors and pilots. In my respectful submission we have here not a military action to separate Israeli and Egyptian troops ; we have a declaration of war against the Egyptian Government, in the most brutal terms. Surely it is very hard indeed for one to use moderate language to describe behaviour of this sort. Will the Government stop lying to the House of Commons?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-11-05a.1965.1" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. Lloyd" colnum="1965" time="">
<p>The purposes which the Government have in mind in undertaking this action are to stop the hostilities, to prevent their resumption, and to procure a settlement of the problems of the area. The directive to the Supreme Commander was to avoid civilian casualties. The test is what has actually happened&#x2014;and that is what has happened.</p>

<p>May I, therefore, ask a question? What we are having is almost

a serial story. Will the Government give an assurance to the House of Commons that they will issue a White Paper setting out these various pronouncements to the Egyptian people, so that we may study them? Surely it is necessary that the House of Commons should know what is being said on its authority and behalf. After all, the guilt will be ours ; it will not be that of our soldiers, or the Supreme Command. Will the Minister therefore give a guarantee that this information will appear as early as may be in the form of a White Paper?</p>

<p>At 0515 hours G.M.T. British and French paratroops were dropped in the Port Said area. Landings were made on the airfield to the west of Port Said and around the bridges to the south of the town.<br/>
Repeated warnings have been given to the civilian population of Port Said to keep away from clearly defined areas of danger.<br/>
Since then my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has read a telegram from the Allied Commander-in-Chief.<br/>
I gave the House an undertaking that I would say something in amplification of the circumstances of the sinking of the Egyptian frigate "Domiat."<br/>
At 0130 hours on 1st November the cruiser "Newfoundland" was moving up the Gulf of Suez when she observed a darkened ship passing her in the opposite direction. "Newfoundland" turned parallel with her and identified her as an Egyptian frigate. A signal was flashed to her to "Stop or I fire." This was correctly acknowledged and the frigate appeared to slow down. "Newfoundland" signalled to report she had stopped.<br/>
The frigate then switched off her navigation lights and trained her armament on the "Newfoundland." The latter then opened fire and the frigate opened fire immediately afterwards. After five minutes the frigate was seen to be sinking and firing ceased. Searchlights were trained on the water to assist in rescue work and 70 survivors were picked up.<br/>
Rescue work continued for an hour and a half, after which a marker buoy was dropped and the South African vessel "President Steyn" was asked to continue the search.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman and ourselves are in an identical position about this. The only information we have of the situation is the telegram which has been read out. [HON. MEMBERS : "Read it."] I am quite prepared to read it again if the House so wishes. It says :

Are they in force further down the Canal or is the main body of the Egyptian troops withdrawn towards Cairo?<br/>
Thirdly, having regard to the fact that the Canal is now effectively blocked and that it will be a considerable engineering operation to clear it, which really cannot be done successfully without the peaceful co-operation of the Egyptian people, can instructions now be given to change Her Majesty's Government's policy and to stop bombing the people who have been the victims of the major aggression?</p>

<p>The location of the troops was, as I have said, some to the west of Port Said on the airfield, which is seven or eight miles to the west of Port Said, the others astride the two bridges to the south of the town west of the Canal.

<p>Can the right hon. Gentleman confirm or deny the report that an Israeli plane was shot down by British forces last night? Can he say whether the landing this morning was timed precisely at the time of the expiry of Mr. Hammarskj&#x00F6;ld's message deliberately, or by chance? Was the reply to the United Nations, who sat waiting for him for some hours, deliberately delayed until after the operations had been initiated?<br/>
Is he aware that I have had a radiogram from Egypt which reports that
<q>residential areas in main Egyptian towns are being indiscriminately bombed, houses, streets and passenger buses are strafed with bullets by raiding planes &#x2026; British radio stations are now threatening the bombing of railway stations, waterworks, electricity supply. British journalists in Cairo give eye witness reports of destruction of civilian property, mosques, schools and churches. Number of killed and wounded, amongst them innocent women and children, mounting hourly &#x2026;</q>
That telegram is signed on behalf of the Egyptian Federation of Trade Unions.<br/>
This, after all, is the country to which the right hon. Gentleman was exporting tanks two months ago and offering loans of &#x00A3;30 million and &#x00A3;40 million only a few weeks before. Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that statements made from the Government Front Bench recently have been so far from the truth that it is difficult for us to know now where we can get reliable information?</p>

<p>The timing of this operation was based on the only possible thing on which one could carry out such an operation; that is, operational considerations, which would mean a considerable time ago, and it had nothing to do with Mr. Hammarskj&#x00F6;ld's speech&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS : "How long?"] The hon. Gentleman asked me whether it was timed with Mr. Hammarskj&#x00F6;ld's speech, which was made only a few hours ago. The timing of this operation was fixed at least two days ago.<br/>
I have been carefully into the question of the areas bombed and the extent and the accuracy of our bombing. I would say that what is contained in that telegram is completely untrue. The bombing has been absolutely and strictly limited to military targets, and has been extremely accurate.</p>

<p>May I ask whether this news from Egypt&#x2014;which we must all welcome if it means a cessation of hostilities&#x2014;does not give us a chance to set about binding up the wounds in the Western alliance? At this stage of world events, with the happenings now taking place in Eastern Europe&#x2014;and which may be repeated in other countries in Eastern Europe&#x2014;it is tragic that we should be separated in any degree from our allies and the Commonwealth, as I am afraid that we are. Cannot we, therefore, say something rather more encouraging about the Canadian proposal for observers than has so far been published? Cannot we make it clear that, anyway, within the near future we will accept some observers in the area and some chance of a direction to hand over the future to the United Nations?</p>

<p>That point was made clear by the Prime Minister, and we have said it again and again. When a force is constituted we are perfectly willing to hand over our responsibilities to it.

<p>Is it the fact that Colonel Eley, the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation representative in Cairo, protested to us that the terms of the British radio announcement, making a change in the future of our bombing tactics would be such that, as he said, there would be terrific loss of civilian life? Does not that very much endorse what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South-East (Mr. Benn) when he read out the terms of that broadcast? Will the Minister of Defence, in those circumstances, say what reply was given to Colonel Eley? After all, he

must have some knowledge about it&#x2014;it was in <i>The Times</i> this morning?</p>

<p>These targets were carefully selected and every single airman concerned took a pride in the operation not from the point of view of damage, and so forth, but purely that he carried out his mission without loss of civil life. As regards Colonel Eley's statement about this change of programme causing great additional loss of life, events that I have had full information about since the change was made do not confirm that statement.</p>

<p>May I press the right hon. Gentleman on two points? First, with regard to the leaflets, is it or is it not true that leaflets have been dropped on both sides&#x2014;both on the Israelis and the Egyptians&#x2014;or only on one side? Secondly, pursuing the important point about the Suez Canal and its blocking, it is obvious that there can be no danger to British shipping for quite some time. One of the objects of the Government's intervention was to take care of &#x00A3;50 million of British shipping that was going to be in the neighbourhood. Clearly, none of it is in the Canal or likely to be there for a long time. Surely this makes it inexcusable that the bombing should go on of so-called military targets, such as military centres and telephone exchanges, which are bound to be in the middle of civilian centres?</p>

<p>I admit that it is hypothetical, but the chance of British shipping being damaged if there had been no intervention by us would have been much increased. On the question of bombing telephone exchanges, if some hon. Gentleman will give me details of what telephone exchange, or where, I will look into it. So far as I know, not one telephone exchange has been bombed.</p>

<p>In view of the concern on the question of the efficiency and accuracy of our bombing, will my right hon.
