	<p pid=".38.0/1">I warmly congratulate the proposer and seconder of the Loyal Address. Both spoke with fluency and wit and both are renowned as tireless campaigners for the causes in which they believe.</p>
	<p pid=".38.0/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1789" name="Kevin Barron">The right hon. Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron)</phrase> entered the House the same year as I did, 1983, although we probably have rather fonder memories of that year than he does. Two years later, he became the Parliamentary Private Secretary to Neil Kinnock, but he has come a long way since then. Earlier this year, he came fifth in the ballot for private Members' Bills and he used it to propose a tax cut&mdash;in stamp duty, no less. As he explained,</p>
	<p pid=".38.0/3" class="indent">&quot;hard-pressed first-time buyers will see a significant reduction in their stamp duty bills, with hundreds of thousands . . . paying no stamp duty at all.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".38.0/4">He is on the right lines and we look forward to his next proposal for tax cuts.</p>
	<p pid=".38.0/5">The right hon. Gentleman is also a keen supporter of Rotherham United. Unfortunately, they have been relegated, so they have changed their manager and are bringing in younger talent to complement the more experienced members of the team. It is a strategy I wholly recommend. I congratulate the right hon. Gentleman on his excellent speech today.</p>
	<p pid=".38.0/6">Last July, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1775" name="Vera Baird">the hon. and learned Member for Redcar (Vera Baird)</phrase> was in <i>The Guardian's</i> list of 101 overlooked women intellectuals, but she has been overlooked no more. First, <i>Spectator</i> Back Bencher of the year, now seconding the Loyal Address, and soon, no doubt, in Government. And she was not the only member of her household to win an award last year. Her Bedlington terrier, Zack, won the Westminster dog of the year prize in October, although I understand that he was run very close in the sit-up-and-beg competition by the new Nor<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1800" name="Shaun Woodward">thern Ireland Minister, the hon. Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Woodward)</phrase>. As for the title &quot;best-groomed poodle&quot;, I believe that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1527" name="Alan Milburn">the right hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn)</phrase> has ruled himself out this year. In contrast, the hon. and learned Lady, of course, has always been her own woman and she was not described as one of the brightest of the 2001 intake for nothing. Her speech today was a model of its kind.</p>
	<p pid=".38.0/7">I congratulate the Prime Minister on his election victory. The people have spoken and of course we respect their verdict. They elected a Labour Government, but they also voted for a stronger Conservative Opposition to hold the Government to account.</p>
	<p pid=".38.0/8">I also welcome the new Members on both sides of the House. This is a new intake of high calibre and we look forward to their contributions.</p>
	<p pid=".38.0/9">Immediately after the election, the Prime Minister said that he would now deliver on the people's priorities. As I said at the time, whenever he does so, we will support him and these days the Prime Minister needs all the support that he can get. His former Transport Minister says that he should go &quot;sooner rather than later.&quot; His former Sports Minister says:</p>
	<p pid=".38.0/10" class="indent">&quot;Every MP that comes back will tell him just how unpopular he was.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".38.0/11">And his former Health Secretary, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1639" name="Frank Dobson">the right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson)</phrase>, described him as &quot;an enormous liability.&quot; But perhaps the best advice came from someone who worked with him even more closely than they did: the former Foreign Secretary, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2000" name="Robin Cook">the right hon. Member for Livingston (Robin Cook)</phrase>, who gave us the benefit of his reflections in a recent article in the <i>Evening Standard</i>. He mused:</p>
	<p pid=".38.0/12" class="indent">&quot;We have all been here at some point in our lives. Most of us have known a friend who clings to a relationship long after the other partner has any appetite for it. We have sighed when they plead for one more chance or another full term. Eventually, one of us takes our friend down to the pub for a pint and tells him it is over.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".38.0/13">Now perhaps I can offer the Prime Minister some advice of my own. It comes from personal experience. The way to get your colleagues to ask you to stay is to set a timetable for your departure. I hope that the Prime Minister will take that advice in the constructive way in which it is intended.</p>
	<p pid=".38.0/14">The Prime Minister said the day after the election that he had listened and learned, and that this time he would &quot;focus relentlessly&quot; on people's priorities. The signs, I fear, are not encouraging. Take the crisis in manufacturing. During the general election campaign, we saw the closure of Rover&mdash;a tragedy for thousands of workers and their families and a painful reminder of the problems faced by manufacturing industry. Britain's competitive position is under threat. What was the Prime Minister's response? He looked at this policy on trade and industry, and what did he do? Did he change the policy? Did he change the direction? To give him credit, he did take decisive action: he decided to give the Department of Trade and Industry a new name&mdash;a name designed to show that it was a great new organ of government: a Department for Productivity, Energy and Industry, but he had not looked at the acronym. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry told the <i>Financial Times</i> that the Department had attracted &quot;various descriptions&quot;, including &quot;Dippy&quot;. When asked whose bright idea that was, he replied:</p>
	<p pid=".38.0/15" class="indent">&quot;I don't know. It certainly wasn't mine.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".38.0/16">That is not the only thing on which the Prime Minister did not get his way. It is not just the names of the Departments: he was thwarted in deciding which Minister goes where. He was not able to get the Trade and Industry Secretary he wanted. He was not able to get the Education Secretary he wanted. He was not able to get the Health Secretary he wanted. He has been saddled with second-choice Ministers, but at least one person is delighted with his job: the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. He says:</p>
	<p pid=".38.0/17" class="indent">&quot;It's a fantastic privilege to be Secretary of State for Northern Ireland&mdash;having a castle to stay in&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".38.0/18">Alas, his new deputy, the hon. Member for St. Helens, South, thinks differently. He is going to find his room a bit pokey and I am told that it has only got one butler.</p>
	<p pid=".38.0/19">Then there is the new Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Defence, Lord Drayson. Parliamentary Under-Secretaries spend lots of time travelling to far-flung places where the British flag still flies: Gibraltar, the Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands&mdash;all locations with which he and his tax advisers are very familiar indeed.</p>
	<p pid=".38.0/20">What about the Minister the Prime Minister forgot, the Minister for Women whom he appointed as an afterthought? He asks her to do the job in her spare time and tells her that she is not going to be paid. So much for the manifesto promise to narrow the pay gap between men and women.</p>
	<p pid=".38.0/21">We welcome many measures in the Government's programme. For example, we support legislation that will genuinely help in the fight against terrorism. We support any legislation that will restore the integrity of the voting system, which was recently described as something that would &quot;disgrace a banana republic&quot;. But why are the Government continuing to ignore the advice of the Electoral Commission that voters should register individually? Why are on earth will the Government not agree to that?</p>
	<p pid=".38.0/22">In Northern Ireland, we support the Government's efforts to secure a comprehensive agreement, but there should be no place in government for any party that is engaged in crime or maintains its own private army. I hope that the Prime Minister will agree that the onus is now firmly on the republican movement to deliver what it promised in 1998.</p>
	<p pid=".38.0/23">I pay tribute once again to the courage and professionalism of British troops serving around the world, and especially in Iraq. The killing of Anthony Wakefield is a tragic reminder of the bravery that they show day by day.</p>
	<p pid=".38.0/24">The world faces many other challenges. Hundreds of thousands of people have died in Darfur. I repeat the view already expressed many times from these Benches that urgent action should be taken to bring that killing to an end, starting with a new resolution at the Security Council of the United Nations.</p>
	<p pid=".38.0/25">The Gracious Speech also mentioned Britain's presidency this year of both the G8 and the European Union. That gives us a singular opportunity to press for reform on the international stage and, in particular, to lift people out of poverty by fighting for freer and fairer trade. We also, of course, support a referendum on the European constitution. Will the Prime Minister confirm to the House the Government's unequivocal commitment to giving the British people a vote on that constitution even if other countries vote no? If he does so, why will he not name the day for the referendum?</p>
	<p pid=".38.0/26">The day after the election, the Prime Minister set out his priorities, the priorities that are meant to be reflected in the programme before us today: controlled immigration, school discipline, cleaner hospitals and police. Come to think of it, they sound rather familiar to me. In fact, it is almost a complete set. We had no idea that he was thinking what we are thinking. The only one of the five that is missing is lower taxes. I wonder why.</p>
	<p pid=".38.0/27">In looking at the Government's programme, our position is clear. Where the Government do the right thing, we will support them. We support more choice in schools and hospitals, and greater use of the independent sector where it provides quality and value for money&mdash;likewise with genuine reform of incapacity benefit and proper controls on immigration. On these measures, if the Prime Minister means what he says, takes a stand on the things that matter and sends a clear message to his Back Benchers, we will support him.</p>
	<p pid=".38.0/28">The Prime Minister's manifesto set out new Labour's commitments for a third term. In his first two terms, he found it impossible to keep just five pledges but, for his third term, there are 274. I suppose that he hopes that people will not notice when he breaks them. He says that there will be a points system for immigration, but what is the point of a points system without a limit? Is it not utterly pointless?</p>
	<p pid=".38.0/29">What of health reform? The Prime Minister was absolutely astonished to discover what everyone else knew: that his GP targets stop people getting an appointment when they want one. It is not just GP targets that are a problem. Hospital targets are too. We know that they stop hospitals dealing effectively with the superbug. The chief executive of the NHS himself says so.</p>
	<p pid=".38.0/30">I was pleased to hear that the Government are to introduce measures to provide for cleaner hospitals, but I was less encouraged to hear the Secretary of State say that, if hospitals fail, she will prosecute them. A simpler solution would be just to get rid of the targets. If only the Prime Minister would listen to his chief policy adviser, Matthew Taylor, who said:</p>
	<p pid=".38.0/31" class="indent">&quot;The downside of targets are several. One is that you get perverse outcomes . . . A second is that people cheat . . . But perhaps the greatest problem of targets is that they deny autonomy to frontline managers&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".38.0/32">The reason why the Prime Minister will not scrap the targets is that he does not trust people. He does not trust professionals, parents or patients to make decisions themselves. In the misguided words of the Chancellor, Ministers do not know any other way than targets to achieve value for money.</p>
	<p pid=".38.0/33">The Prime Minister says&mdash;the hon. and learned Member for Redcar referred to this&mdash;that he wants to restore respect in Britain. I agree, and I have said so many times. Let me suggest one practical way in which we can do that. If children do not learn to respect their teachers at school, they will not respect others when they grow up. The one thing that would most encourage respect in the classroom would be to give head teachers complete control over what happens in their schools. That is the way to teach children respect at an early age, so if the Prime Minister takes action to bring that about, we will support him. The minority should never be allowed to ruin the education of the majority of the children in our schools.</p>
	<p pid=".38.0/34">The Prime Minister also promises a regulatory reform Bill&mdash;it is certainly needed. Just in the past fortnight, we have had figures showing bankruptcy up, insolvency up and more job losses on the way. Meanwhile, production, retail sales and manufacturing orders are all down. What is the Labour party's response? Last week, the Prime Minister's own Members of the European Parliament voted for more burdens to be placed on British business by abolishing the individual opt-out from the working time directive. His manifesto promised that the Government would work hard with Labour MEPs and would</p>
	<p pid=".38.0/35" class="indent">&quot;ensure that EU regulations are proportionate&quot;,</p>
	<p pid=".38.0/36">yet days after the election, in the first test of the Prime Minister's authority, his MEPs completely ignored him and voted for a measure that he described as &quot;wrong&quot; and &quot;completely misguided&quot;. He has not even got the authority to get his Members of the European Parliament to listen to him.</p>
	<p pid=".38.0/37">It is not only red tape, but tax, too, so I want to remind the Prime Minister of his election promises on tax. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-15">15 April</phrase>, it was put to him that almost every expert thought that he was</p>
	<p pid=".38.0/38" class="indent">&quot;going to have to raise National Insurance after the election&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".38.0/39">He said:</p>
	<p pid=".38.0/40" class="indent">&quot;I don't agree with that at all&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".38.0/41">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-20">20 April</phrase>, he was asked:</p>
	<p pid=".38.0/42" class="indent">&quot;You are going to have to raise taxes after the election, aren't you?&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".38.0/43">He said, &quot;No&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".38.0/44">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-28">28 April</phrase>, he was asked:</p>
	<p pid=".38.0/45" class="indent">&quot;what new stealth taxes do you plan to introduce first?&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".38.0/46">He said:</p>
	<p pid=".38.0/47" class="indent">&quot;well, I don't plan any&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".38.0/48">There we have it: no increase in national insurance, no new stealth taxes and no raising of taxes at all. We shall not forget those promises. We will hold the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer personally responsible for each and every one of them.</p>
	<p pid=".38.0/49">I hope that those pledges prove more durable than those of the Liberal Democrats. Their education spokesman says that they might be offering tax cuts next time round. The decapitated Liberal Democrat ex-Member for Guildford said that the local income tax was unpopular with hard-working couples. What a surprise.</p>
	<p pid=".38.0/50"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1723" name="Peter Hain">The right hon. Member for Neath (Peter Hain)</phrase> promised that this programme of legislation would be</p>
	<p pid=".38.0/51" class="indent">&quot;a really strong, radical, fizzy first Queen's Speech.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".38.0/52">He said:</p>
	<p pid=".38.0/53" class="indent">&quot;it's going to surprise people&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".38.0/54">However, he was the one with the surprise coming because he is no longer Leader of the House. For the rest of the country, all we have had so far is more fizzy rhetoric. What matters now is delivery.</p>
	<p pid=".38.0/55">It is time to reward people who do the right thing: the people who play by the rules, work hard and take responsibility for themselves and their families. It is also time to restore respect in our society: to tackle the yob culture head on, to restore discipline in schools and to ensure that the punishment fits the crime. The Prime Minister talks about these things, so for the sake of our country, I hope that his actions will finally match his words. If they do, we will support him, but whatever happens, this party will hold him to account for the promises that he has made to the British people.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-05-17.43.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1806" speakername="Tony Blair" speakeroffice="The Prime Minister"  colnum="43"  time="15:29:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050517/debtext/50517-04.htm#50517-04_spmin0">
	<p pid=".43.0/1">I congratulate the proposer and seconder of the Loyal Address on their excellent speeches. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1789" name="Kevin Barron">My right hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron)</phrase> and I have known and worked with each other for a long time, having both entered Parliament in 1983 on the back of a disastrous election defeat for our party. In those days, of course, winning just 209 seats was regarded as a catastrophic result for an Opposition party. Nowadays, it is apparently a cause for delirious celebrations. Within a few years, he and I were working closely together as shadow Energy Ministers, where his personal expertise as a former miner went some way to compensate for my total ignorance of the subject.</p>
	<p pid=".43.0/2">My right hon. Friend came to the House with a rich and interesting history. Just two years before he was elected a Member of Parliament, he had been Arthur Scargill's successful campaign manager for the National Union of Mineworkers presidency elections. Who knows? If he had stuck with those politics, he might have made a new recruit for the Liberal Democrats, but, fortunately, he did not. As an MP for a mining constituency and sponsored by the NUM, it took enormous bravery for him to stand up and criticise the leadership of his union over the handling of the strike. Despite savage personal attacks on him, he never flinched or gave ground. His principled stand won him the respect of Members of Parliament of all parties at the time.</p>
	<p pid=".43.0/3">My right hon. Friend's courage was also seen as he began the long and difficult job of modernising the party. As Parliamentary Private Secretary to Neil Kinnock, he did it with great skill and loyalty. He took on the job of heading the new clause 4 campaign with enthusiasm and dedication. I congratulate him on the same determination he has shown in his long campaign to reduce the death toll from smoking. I know that he is proud of this Government's action to curb tobacco advertising, but that he is determined to continue pressing us to do more to tackle that threat to public health. His was a superb speech. It showed not just ability but judgment and character. He deserves our heartiest congratulations.</p>
	<p pid=".43.0/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1775" name="Vera Baird">My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Redcar (Vera Baird)</phrase> is also to be warmly congratulated. Like my right hon. Friend, she has a surprisingly colourful history. There cannot be many barmaids at a Pontin's holiday camp who have gone on to become one of the country's top QCs. When I asked my colleagues last night what I should say about her, one advised me to make a few jokes about women from working-class backgrounds who are staunch feminists and go on to become highly successful QCs. I thought about it and I simply say how deeply I admire such people.</p>
	<p pid=".43.0/5">I understand that my hon. and learned Friend was at first going to be a medical student, but decided that she would rather spend her time dissecting arguments than bodies. Medicine's loss has been the law and politics' gain. Her expert and passionate advocacy on behalf of the victims of rape and domestic violence in high-profile court cases has had a profound impact on how the modern law and the criminal justice process have evolved. Her energy, vitality and principle have made her a contributor to this House's debates, and she is respected by Members on both sides. As I represent a seat not far away from her constituency, in the north-east&mdash;a region, by the way, where our party held every single seat on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-05">5 May</phrase>&mdash;I know how successfully, through hard work, she has won the trust and respect of our constituents.</p>
	<p pid=".43.0/6">My hon. and learned Friend once said:</p>
	<p pid=".43.0/7" class="indent">&quot;The only way a working class girl from Oldham was able to become a QC was because of Labour Governments that saw the point in providing decent dry housing, good healthcare and free education for children like me. I want to repay some of that and make sure that others have the same chance.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".43.0/8">There could be no better way of summing up the central purpose of this historic Labour third term.</p>
	<p pid=".43.0/9">Now for <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1587" name="Michael Howard">the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard)</phrase>. He made some fun at my expense, but I say good luck to him for the future. Let me gently remind him, however, which party won and which lost the election. He has 197 MPs. We have 356, and I stand here and he sits there. After only three elections since the war has the Conservative party had fewer than 200 seats&mdash;this was one, and the others were in 1997 and 2001. The truth is that the people were not thinking what he was thinking. Unfortunately, they were remembering what we were remembering: 15 per cent. interest rates, 3 million unemployed, two recessions and under-investment in our public services.</p>
	<p pid=".43.0/10">The right hon. and learned Gentleman can put all of that behind him now, but his speech was rather like the election campaign: there were a few good lines but no real vision for the future of our country. He and the Conservative party did not just lose the election&mdash;they lost the argument in the course of the election. On the economy, their mixture of spending increases, tax cuts and borrowing cuts swiftly collapsed. On public services, we had the spectacle of the Conservatives being willing to do doing anything other than engage in debate on their flagship vouchers policies. The oddest thing about the election was that we were more interested in discussing Tory policy than the Tories were.</p>
	<p pid=".43.0/11">Where are those policies now? Who will defend cutting &pound;35 billion from Labour's spending programmes now? <i>[Interruption.]</i> I am being told, &quot;Get on.&quot; I assume that that policy has gone now. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Oh, so the Tories did not say that they would cut &pound;35 billion from our spending programmes. Oh yes they did. How about national health service vouchers&mdash;has that policy gone too? Have school vouchers? As a parting present, can we now be told&mdash;I know that they know&mdash;where was that fantasy asylum island?</p>
	<p pid=".43.0/12">Now, the battle is on for the leadership&mdash;the fifth Tory leader I will have faced. The most profound question in that debate appears to be to wear a tie, or not to wear a tie? Aspirant Tory leaders fall over themselves to appear tieless on TV&mdash;it is not so much a policy statement as a fashion statement. No wonder I am told that Lord Saatchi has left&mdash;to be replaced by Lord Gucci, no doubt. The only candidates&mdash;there is quite a field&mdash;who seem to stand no chance are those on the right and the left of the Tory party who want to debate policy. The most intelligent analysis of the state of the Tory party&mdash;I mean no disrespect to him&mdash;came from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1463" name="John Bercow">the hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow)</phrase>, who was immediately condemned by his leader as disloyal. However, the ultra-moderniser, the new party chairman, came to the rescue in his interview in this morning's <i>Financial Times</i>, which reports:</p>
	<p pid=".43.0/13" class="indent">&quot;Tim Yeo, leadership contender and former shadow cabinet member, has suggested that true modernisers needed to do more than just 'just appear on television without a tie'. But even Mr Yeo would concede that Mr Maude goes the extra modernising mile: he conducted his interview with the FT in his socks.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".43.0/14">The mind boggles as to where further acts of modernisation might take us. That is today's Tory party: tieless, shoeless but, above all, clueless. It is not clothing the Tories need to discard, it is policy, and the sooner they realise that, the better. However, the party chairman got one thing right when he concluded his interview by saying:</p>
	<p pid=".43.0/15" class="indent">&quot;We need to look forward not back.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".43.0/16">How right he is.</p>
	<p pid=".43.0/17">Not that the Liberal Democrats are any better. I understand that they have ditched the policies on which they fought the election, instituted a major policy review and now have a policy blank page. If they take my advice, the page will remain that way&mdash;it is more in keeping with their politics. Theirs is the party of Gladstone, Lloyd George, Beveridge, Keynes and, now, Brian Sedgemore&mdash;<i>[Laughter.]</i> They run to the right of Labour in Tory constituencies and to the left of Labour in Labour constituencies. In this Parliament, we are going to make them choose.</p>
	<p pid=".43.0/18">Only one serious programme for government was put forward in the election&mdash;the one that is now in the Queen's Speech. At the heart of the Queen's Speech are policies that prepare our economy for the future, continue the investment in and reform of the national health service and our education system, and protect our citizens from terrorism and crime. They are quintessentially new Labour: economic prosperity combined with social justice, right in 1997, being delivered now in 2005.</p>

	<p pid=".47.1/1">Surely, the whole point is that we are allowing the tenants themselves to choose. Some of them have chosen to make the changes because they think that they will receive a better service.</p>
	<p pid=".47.1/2">As for child care, there will be a duty on local authorities to provide extended child chare between 8 am and 6 pm for children aged three to 14. Sure Start will be expanded. Let us remember that, when we came to office, child benefit had been frozen, there was no working families tax credit, maternity pay was &pound;55 a week and paid maternity leave was only 14 weeks. Now, child benefit is up by 25 per cent. in real terms, the child tax credit benefits millions of families in this country and maternity pay is more than double what it was. Maternity leave is 26 weeks, it will be increased to nine months and, in time, to one year. That is a Labour Government delivering for the people of this country.</p>
	<p pid=".47.1/3">There is, however, a need to make further reforms to our welfare system. A total of 1.2 million people have been helped through the new deal, including lone parents, young people and disabled people. I believe that the new deal has worked well for the people of this country. I remember that when my right hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley and I were first campaigning, people used to talk about skivvy schemes. They used to talk about young people being taken off the dole, given a programme for a short period and then being put back on the dole. No one describes the new deal like that, and I urge both Opposition parties to drop their rejection of it. It is a good programme delivering real opportunities to people who need them, and it should have received our wholehearted support in the House.</p>
	<p pid=".47.1/4">Reform of the public services and the welfare state is one theme of the Queen's Speech. Another focus is on continuing to cut crime, the fear of crime and, in particular, antisocial behaviour. Antisocial behaviour measures have been built up over several years and, in many cases, work well. I remind the House that there have been over 90,000 fixed penalty notices and 4,000 antisocial behaviour orders. Hundreds of houses used by drug dealers have been shut and millions of pounds of their assets have been seized. There are an extra 13,000 police and 5,000 community support officers. The new legislation will crack down on imitation firearms and target knife crime and binge drinking. It will tighten antisocial behaviour laws and give the police new powers to tackle drug dealing. In addition to the record numbers of police, there will be a further 20,000 community support officers. When we first introduced CSOs, they were a bone of contention in the House and were opposed by many hon. Members. Again, I hope that all parties now accept the contribution that they make and will support them.</p>

	<p pid=".55.1/1">Yes. I agree with the Chancellor and with the proposition that the hon. Gentleman has put forward. Clearly, if the royal prerogative were passed to Parliament on the question of war and if we pass the royal prerogative to the people on the question of the treaty, it could never go back again. That is a development in our constitution that we should all welcome. The right hon. Anthony Wedgwood Benn&mdash;Tony Benn&mdash;would, as I said, welcome that more than anyone.</p>
	<p pid=".55.1/2">The destiny of the treaty establishing a constitution for Europe is in the hands of United Kingdom citizens. When the referendum comes, they will have an important decision to make. That decision will affect not only this generation, but generations yet unborn. Mr. Speaker earlier urged us to have a careful debate and to be polite among ourselves as we discuss points with care and interest. When it comes to the European debate, we ought to be careful with the facts and to ensure that we have a proper debate that can go out to the country so that the country can make its decision. As the right hon. Member for Ross, Skye and Lochaber said, some 58 per cent. of those who voted in the general election voted for parties in favour of a yes vote.</p>
	<p pid=".55.1/3">There have been references to the 1983 election from my right hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley, from the Leader of the Opposition and from my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister. We fought that election on a manifesto that called for peace, jobs and freedom. As <i>The Guardian</i> succinctly, if drily, said, that was better than fighting for war, the dole and slavery. If we think about the history of our continent over the past 60 years, however, we can see that we have lived in peace from one end of it to the other, apart from the difficulties in Northern Ireland&mdash;I am glad to see <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1375" name="Ian Paisley">the hon. Member for North Antrim (Rev. Ian Paisley)</phrase> in his place&mdash;and on the eastern front in Kosovo and such places. We have had peace in Europe, and that is due in no small measure to the fact that the European nation states wished to come together, did come together and have stayed together ever since. We tend to overlook the fact that the continent was riven by war for 1,000 years, and I ask any Member who cannot sleep at night to dip into Gibbon's &quot;Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;, where he or she will find that for many generations before nation states existed, tribes in Europe were also involved in warfare.</p>

	<p pid=".61.7/1">You are very wise, Madam Deputy Speaker, and I willingly accept your ruling.</p>
	<p pid=".61.7/2">The Gracious Speech adopts certain Conservative language on some crucial policies. Naturally, I welcome the Prime Minister's conversion to the idea that choice, quality, differentiation and diversity are important matters for educational improvement. I look forward to seeing how many of his right hon. and hon. Friends he can carry with him in the Lobby if he decides to put those issues to the test. However, one of the big let-downs in British politics in the past few years is Labour's mantra that cash will be allied to reform, but we have not seen proper reform.</p>
	<p pid=".61.7/3">We have seen a massive over-centralisation and a huge increase in targets and bureaucracy. We have seen teachers, nurses and doctors driven mad to distraction by having to fill in forms instead of looking after their charges and by having to deviate from doing what they would like to do&mdash;teaching well, or looking after their patients in the best manner&mdash;to deal with the priorities imposed by a centralised bureaucracy, sometimes driven by Ministers and sometimes seemingly acting without a great deal of ministerial direction of any kind. Sometimes, if we challenge Ministers, we are told that they will look into things, as though they had absolutely nothing to do with them. Sometimes we think that they may not have anything to do with Ministers: they look very surprised by what the bureaucracy had been doing in their names. On other occasions, they are more honourable and say, &quot;Yes, of course, we as Ministers are responsible&quot;, and suggest that they will make some changes.</p>
	<p pid=".61.7/4">I will believe that the Prime Minister is a true convert to the cause of proper reform when I see the moves that I think he needs to make. He needs to strip out many of those central targets and bureaucracy, and he needs to say that popular schools will be able to expand and that parents will have a genuine choice of school and that the resources and the wherewithal will be made available so that that choice is realistic and their children have a good choice of getting into the school that has been chosen. He also needs to stop his party threatening or menacing the grammar schools.</p>
	<p pid=".61.7/5">One of the most disappointing features of the Labour Government over the past eight years has been the decline of social mobility. One would think that Labour&mdash;which, like the Conservatives, wants opportunity for people from poor backgrounds&mdash;would be a champion of ways in which people could exercise their rights and could achieve greater social mobility. We heard poignant stories at the start of this debate about people who had managed to move upwards from humble beginnings. Many of us on the Opposition Benches did not start with anything, and the way in which we were able to move upwards was often through educational opportunity at a grammar school or, in my case, a direct grant school where I was able to win a free place. That system was abolished by a previous Labour Government and that school is now independent, so people from the background that I came from are no longer able to go to that school and to enjoy the greater opportunity to go on to a good university and make progress. I do not know whether we all regard getting to the House of Commons as making progress, but there are many who still do. I regard it as a great privilege to be in this place, and I am very conscious of the role that education played in enabling me and many others to get here.</p>
	<p pid=".61.7/6">The Prime Minister must be serious about allowing different types of schools and about backing and supporting the schools of excellence that are often the subject of jealous attack from some members of his party. He needs to be serious about stripping away the centralisation and urge to control and intervene that have done so much damage to our schooling and part of our health care under this Government so far.</p>
	<p pid=".61.7/7">I also look forward to seeing how the Prime Minister intends to buttress his policy of harnessing the private sector's role in the provision of better health care. I think that the important thing about the national health service, which brings together many people and has traditionally united the main parties since the post-war settlement, is the principle that all those who need treatment can get it free at the point of use. It is quite wrong to say that they are getting it free, because all of us are paying very dearly for health care. Very often those who receive it have, over the years, paid many times more than the cost of the health care that they finally need.</p>
	<p pid=".61.7/8">I have described the important principle and we have no ideological hang-up about how the pledge is met. Any sensible person would want it to be met in the most efficient way so that people can access care quickly and in the best way so that the outcome of the treatment or care is the best possible. If the Prime Minister is serious about that interpretation&mdash;a more Conservative interpretation than his party has traditionally gone in for&mdash;I will very willingly support him. I am sure that all my right hon. and hon. Friends feel the same. I have a sneaking suspicion, however, that he is not going to carry that reform forward in the way that he claims he will because there will be political difficulties in his party and because I do not think that he can draw himself away from all the targets, bureaucracy and regulation that are the hallmarks of this Government and in which he is so deeply immersed.</p>
	<p pid=".61.7/9">The Government have also, rather late in the day, become a convert to the idea of less regulation. It was some months ago that the Prime Minister boldly announced that for every new regulation that the Government introduced, one would be removed. It was a very crude approach to deregulation, because regulations are not units of account. It would be possible for the Prime Minister to meet his target by introducing a very expensive regulation such as the recent one on the limitation of overtime and by taking out an old-fashioned and cheap one. He could then say that he had met his target and he would at least have stuck to what he said he was going to do. However, in the past few months since he made his statement, I do not find that he has struck off many regulations but that many regulations are still being introduced.</p>
	<p pid=".61.7/10">In the Gracious Speech, we are promised legislation to make it easier to remove unnecessary and undesirable regulations, but in the words that the Government crafted for Her Majesty we are not actually promised real deregulation. It is well beyond the time when we should just be discussing that process or the idea. If the Government are serious about wishing to undo some of the many mistakes that they have made by over-regulating and interfering too much, they need legislation this Session that will remove a sizeable amount of regulation from the statute book.</p>
	<p pid=".61.7/11">There are many examples of regulations that achieve the opposite of what they set out to do, or fail to do anything along the lines of what was intended. The Government must know about that because they have introduced and supervised many such regulations, so I urge them to beef up the Bill and make it a more serious contribution, if they really think that they have learned the lesson from the electorate.</p>
	<p pid=".61.7/12">My view of the electoral mood in the many places that I visited before the general election and during the campaign itself was that people were conscious, as consumers, that when they bought something, they usually got good product information and some sort of after-sales services, and that if things went wrong, they got redress. When it comes to government, however, which is the biggest thing that they buy&mdash;they have no choice about that because they must buy it&mdash;they find that there is not a proper after-sales services. Measures often do not do what the product information purports to say. There is often little product information of any kind and people find it difficult to get redress.</p>
	<p pid=".61.7/13">That is why many people are heartily sick of all of us and the political theatre. They begin to think that all there is political theatre and that Parliament does not engage with the lack of value, responsiveness and accountability that they find day by day when they discover that they cannot get appointments with their doctors on time, that they cannot get their operations on time, that their children do not get the teaching in schools that they think they deserve, that there is not the discipline in schools that they think is needed, that police do not respond as quickly as they would like to serious crimes in the neighbourhood, or that policemen are not seen on the beat when casual violence or yobbish behaviour is under way. All our constituents witness those failings from time to time, but that does not seem to produce a response here in the elected Parliament that drags the Government to account and gets them to make things work better for the enormous amount spent.</p>
	<p pid=".61.7/14">The constituents of all hon. Members pay on average &pound;4 out of every &pound;10 that they earn in taxation, although they often do not see that happening. For example, if they are lucky enough still to be able to buy petrol for 80p a litre&mdash;it is now usually a bit more than that at the pump&mdash;60p of that 80p is tax that goes straight to the Government. When people buy a product or service that has VAT on it, 17.5 per cent. goes straight to the Government. People can see obvious deductions from their income due to income tax and large deductions due to council tax because that annual bill makes them aware of how much the Government can take.</p>
	<p pid=".61.7/15">If the Queen's Speech is seriously to help Parliament and the Government to re-engage with the electorate, we must start from the proposition that the public are not getting value, do not think that they are getting value and feel that the Government are not responding to their worries about the way in which services are delivered and money is spent. All of us need to lift our game and show that Parliament can be incisive and cause the Government to provide better and more responsive services because people will otherwise continue to leave the political theatre.</p>

	<p pid=".67.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1644" name="Celia Barlow">the hon. Member for Hove (Ms Barlow)</phrase>, who spoke from the very same place from which I made my maiden speech 35 years ago. She might be not be encouraged to hear that, but she might at least be encouraged to know that this place does not kill us&mdash;we can live through it all and enjoy it even as we become older and, perhaps, wiser.</p>
	<p pid=".67.0/2">I am at a disadvantage, in that I cannot enter into the battle of the election that has been fought again in the House today. The Conservative party, the Labour party and the Liberal Democrats have all fought the battle again, but I have no one to fight with. The Social Democratic and Labour party Members are not here, nor are the Sinn Fein Members&mdash;thank God&mdash;and the remaining Ulster Unionist party Member. As a result, I am on my own, as it were, with my hon. Friends.</p>
	<p pid=".67.0/3">I was reminded by one of my constituents that when I spoke in the House the other day I should have mentioned a little song that they sing sometimes in Ulster about bottles&mdash;nine green bottles hanging on the wall. It was suggested to me that I should have said that there were nine bottles but they were not hanging, and that they were not green but orange. Perhaps that sums up the matter.</p>
	<p pid=".67.0/4">I was reading Edmund Burke the other day. He was an Irishman who spent his time in this place teaching the English people democracy, so he said. He wrote:</p>
	<p pid=".67.0/5" class="indent">&quot;That which is morally wrong can never be politically right.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".67.0/6">That is something that we need to consider in this place.</p>
	<p pid=".67.0/7">I come from a province that has been torn asunder by terrorism. I come from a province that lost its democratic structures because this House thought that the way to deal with it was by taking away the democratic structures that it had. They were not perfect. I am sure that many of us think that the structure of this place is not perfect. However, it was the will of the people that put the structures in place. Alas, we have been through momentous years.</p>
	<p pid=".67.0/8">I asked for the figures for the three main years of the previous Parliament, given that some parliamentarians think that all the trouble is over and that the peace movement, as it is called, and progress are absolutely successful. In 2002, we had 350 shootings and 188 bombings. Three incendiary devices exploded and there were 120 incidents of attacks by firearms and explosives. There were 312 paramilitary attacks.</p>
	<p pid=".67.0/9">In 2003, we had 229 shootings and 77 bombings. There were eight incendiaries and there were 156 finds of explosives and firearms. There were 305 paramilitary attacks. In 2004, we had 185 shootings and 64 bombings. There were 21 incendiaries. There were 90 finds of firearms and explosives and there were 228 paramilitary attacks.</p>
	<p pid=".67.0/10">The darkness is still upon us. The murders are still prevalent, as are the killings. I take cognisance of your looks towards me, Mr. Deputy Speaker, but we have been told that the Government will work to bring about the conditions that are necessary for the restoration of political institutions in Northern Ireland, and it is to that that I am addressing my remarks.</p>
	<p pid=".67.0/11">It is all very well for the Government to say that they will deal with terrorism, but they need to start with terrorism in their back yard, which is Northern Ireland. It must be dealt with. There is no use telling our people&mdash;I want to make this plain to the House&mdash;that we will do our best to rejuvenate the so-called agreement that has failed four times: it was set up, it broke down again and it was broken up. We must go down another road, which must be that no terrorist, whether they come from one side or the other, can be in any Government of any part of this United Kingdom. An ultimatum must be given by the Government that the day of terrorism is over and that people cannot shoot their way into Government office. They cannot murder people, rob banks and destroy their country and then demand that, because they have a mandate, they must get into government. The Prime Minister has promised that. I told the Prime Minister privately that I was a Blairite on that matter. I told him that I was a convinced Blairite, and that I was not changing. There are nine Members from Northern Ireland in the House because of it. The people do not want terrorists in the Government of Northern Ireland, and the time has come for the Government to deal with that.</p>
	<p pid=".67.0/12">Today, I talked with an emissary from the American Government, and I have talked to the people representing the south. They, too, must take a stand on that issue. They should unite, then move forward. If people do not want to get on the train of democracy, they will be left behind on the platform. The train of democracy must move forward in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid=".67.0/13">It is not morally right for terrorists to be in the Government of Northern Ireland. I should like the House to get to grips with that issue, and the Government to keep the promise made by the Prime Minister, to which he referred when I questioned him in the previous Parliament. He gave an undertaking, and I should like it to be honoured. I should like the other parties in the House to recognise it and realise its importance. There is not a single Member in the House who would like to have the situation that we have in Northern Ireland in their own constituency. I make a plea to the House&mdash;let us get to grips with the issue.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-05-17.71.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1986" speakername="David Marshall" colnum="71"  time="17:14:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050517/debtext/50517-11.htm#50517-11_spnew4">
	<p pid=".71.0/1">I congratulate you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, on your reappointment as Chairman of Ways and Means. I also congratulate my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister on winning an historic third successive general election. I should like, too, to congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1644" name="Celia Barlow">my hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Ms Barlow)</phrase> on an excellent maiden speech, and I hope that she will be with us for many years to come representing the people of the Hove constituency.</p>
	<p pid=".71.0/2">I consider myself privileged to have been elected as the first Member of Parliament for the new Glasgow, East constituency, following the substantial boundary changes that took place in Scotland at this election when we saw our representation reduced from 72 seats to 59. I should like to place on record my appreciation of the people of Glasgow for their support for me over a number of years, because I was first elected to the House in 1979 for the Shettleston constituency, which is no longer a parliamentary constituency. I should also like to thank all the party members and others who worked so tirelessly on behalf of the Labour party and myself in the election campaign.</p>
	<p pid=".71.0/3">During the last eight years, the east end of Glasgow has undergone a renaissance. There have been tremendous improvements in that part of the city, yet one of the most annoying and distressing aspects of all is the fact that the media, or some parts of it, still portray the area in negative terms, which is depressing for local people and unfair to the area. It would be much better if the media were to concentrate on the positive aspects of the east end to encourage its regeneration and to assist Glasgow as a whole.</p>
	<p pid=".71.0/4">No one would deny that there are problems, but the good things overwhelmingly outnumber the bad. A youth organisation that I visited in the greater Easterhouse area, staffed entirely by volunteers, has 500 young people passing through its doors every week. It is sad that so many people engaged in voluntary organisations, who are the salt of the earth, should get kicked in the teeth by negative comments in the media about the area. I am sure that that applies in other cities in the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".71.0/5">As one would expect from a traditional working-class area, the main issues raised with me during the election campaign were bread-and-butter ones: law and order and the national health service, both devolved to the Scottish Parliament; jobs; pensions; tax credits, which are very popular, especially with people on lower incomes; the taxation of low incomes and pensions; the future of the new deal if Labour were to lose the election; and moral issues such as abortion, euthanasia and cloning, which came up at all the hustings meetings and the various other meetings held throughout the campaign. However, the No. 1 concern of people in the east of Glasgow was the economy. People remember only too well what life was like for 18 years under the Tory Government, when the Queen's Speech was something to be afraid of and dreaded.</p>
	<p pid=".71.0/6">By contrast, there is much in today's Gracious Speech that will meet with universal approval. I welcome the proposal to introduce an offence of corporate manslaughter, and I hope that the legislation will not be delayed, as this is a long-overdue measure. Companies and their directors should be held responsible for their actions.</p>
	<p pid=".71.0/7">I welcome legislation to reduce casualties on the roads, but I hope that that will not be merely a breeding programme for more speed cameras. The proliferation of such cameras is one the reasons why public-police relations are deteriorating, which is to be regretted. People lose their licences and their jobs, and they feel aggrieved. I am sorry to have to say that many people feel that the police would be far better engaged chasing burglars and other criminals than harassing motorists.</p>
	<p pid=".71.0/8">I welcome new consumer credit law to provide greater protection for consumers and to create a fairer credit market. There should be a limit on the rate of interest that banks, companies, stores and anyone lending money can charge. Some people need protecting from themselves. It is far too easy for them to get into debt by obtaining credit that they have no hope of ever repaying. We need to take steps to prevent that.</p>
	<p pid=".71.0/9">I welcome measures to give the police and local communities new powers to tackle violence related to knives, guns and alcohol. I regret, however, that no specific mention is made in the Queen's Speech of air guns. Sadly, just before the election campaign started, a terrible tragedy occurred in my constituency when a two-year-old toddler was killed by an air gun pellet. While I appreciate that legislation will not prevent some people from committing crimes, urgent action needs to be taken to tackle the problems caused by the misuse of air guns. I understand that the Home Secretary will consult the Scottish Executive on introducing proposals on this issue later this summer. I hope that that will happen sooner, rather than later.</p>
	<p pid=".71.0/10">On crime, I feel sorry for the police. I give them my full support and they do splendid work, but much of what they do is to some extent negated by the courts, which let down the law-abiding citizens of this country and its police force. If the courts were to make an example of some criminals, particularly those who commit acts of violence, crime would rapidly decrease. I cite an example from 40 or 50 years ago, which some Members may remember. Lord Carmont sentenced a few razor-slashers in Glasgow to 20 years' imprisonment, at a time when 20 years' imprisonment meant precisely that. Overnight, razor-slashing ceased. One way to deal with law and order issues in society is for the courts to take tougher action on criminals.</p>
	<p pid=".71.0/11">I welcome long-term reform to provide sustainable income for those in retirement. In addition, no tax should be levied on small occupational pensions, nor on small pensions for widows. In addition, we should consider reducing the age at which pensioners qualify for a free TV licence from 75 to 70. A TV licence is a substantial part of a pensioner's income, just as it is for people who are unemployed or on low incomes. Whether the TV licence is good value is a separate matter, but many of my constituents struggle to find the money to pay for it.</p>
	<p pid=".71.0/12">I also welcome measures to offer greater support for working families, such as extending maternity benefit and improving child care provision, along with reform of the welfare state in order to reduce poverty and offer greater equality. However, I am concerned about measures to reform the benefit system. Benefit fraud must of course be tackled, but so must tax avoidance and evasion by mega-rich companies and individuals, which must cost the country a lot more than benefit fraud does. Most people on benefits are not there by choice. They do not get rich, and although there might be the odd such case that the media can highlight, it is only &quot;the odd case&quot;. The vast majority of people on benefits merely survive. They cannot afford the same lifestyle as that enjoyed by those in employment.</p>
	<p pid=".71.0/13">Many people are genuinely unfit for work, or do not have the necessary skills to find jobs in their area or the resources to move elsewhere. They cannot just get on their bikes and go somewhere else. In some areas, jobs are not available in sufficient numbers, so this issue has to be handled carefully, especially in Scotland, if the approach taken is to command universal support. For example, in my city of Glasgow 100,000 people&mdash;one in three of the available work force&mdash;is classified as economically inactive, whatever that means. Most of the constituencies in Glasgow&mdash;there are now only seven&mdash;have higher-than-average levels of unemployment and numbers of pensioners. They have people who are caught in the poverty trap, problems with child poverty, lower-than-average adult male life expectancy&mdash;it is substantially lower than in prosperous areas elsewhere in Scotland or in the south of England; indeed, it is lower by as much as 14 to 17 years&mdash;and people surviving on benefits.</p>
	<p pid=".71.0/14">There is a crime and a drug problem in Glasgow as, sadly, there is in many of our towns and cities today. But part of Glasgow's problem is its former industrial heritage, which has affected the health of many people such as miners, steel workers and others who worked in heavy industry. Their lungs were badly damaged by dust, and they have had to live on benefits since retiring or being made redundant, which many were; indeed, they never worked again when Mrs. Thatcher was in power.</p>
	<p pid=".71.0/15">Glasgow is Scotland's only metropolitan area and it attracts people to work and play&mdash;leisure, as well as work. It does not always attract people to live there, as many do not want to pay the city's council tax, choosing to live on the perimeter estates and commute. When people in Glasgow get a good job, one of the first things that they do is to move outside to somewhere that they perceive, for one reason or another, to be different. Conversely, if people have problems with alcohol or drugs, or their marriages break up, they tend to drift into the city, so we have a continual turn-around, which creates problems in many constituencies and many parts of the city.</p>
	<p pid=".71.0/16">I have said several times in the House that Glasgow alone cannot solve the city's problems, which must be dealt with and resolved. Glasgow used to contain about a quarter of the Scottish population, but the figure is now much lower. I should have liked to hear something in the Queen's Speech about dealing with the problems of cities such as Glasgow. It is not unique, as other cities in the UK have similar problems. What we need is perhaps some special taskforce with a senior Minister in charge&mdash;someone who can accelerate the necessary action to combat the problems and work with all the other organisations in the area, such as devolved Administrations, local government departments, and the private, public and voluntary sectors.</p>
	<p pid=".71.0/17">There is a need to speed things up, but it is not just a matter of consultation. The GEAR&mdash;Glasgow eastern area renewal&mdash;project, which started in 1976 and was wound up by the Conservatives in 1987 when it was only half way through its task, was a classic. Much time was spent in consultation and the writing of reports, but what is needed to tackle the problems of sub-standard housing, crime and litter and to create prosperity for the city is action. I would favour some sort of pilot project that, if successful in a city like Glasgow, could be adopted to tackle problems in other cities.</p>
	<p pid=".71.0/18">I welcome the Scottish Executive's recent decision to overrule the public inquiry and to complete the M74, which I hope will bring thousands of jobs to the city, lead to an improved environment, develop derelict land and divert much of the traffic that currently goes through residential areas on to the new road.</p>
	<p pid=".71.0/19">I continue to have concerns about identity cards and will await the specific proposals with interest. Another of my concerns is the reform of public services. I believe that public services are best carried out by public sector workers themselves. They frequently fail to get appropriate recognition for the job that they do. They do not deserve to be privatised or have their pension scheme altered after years of service. New entrants may have to be treated differently from existing staff, but that is another matter.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-05-17.80.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1674" speakername="Keith Vaz" colnum="80"  time="17:48:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050517/debtext/50517-13.htm#50517-13_spnew10">
	<p pid=".80.3/1">The figure was 63 per cent.&mdash;up on the previous general election&mdash;and the postal vote turnout was about 74 per cent., although it is impossible to say how many of those who received postal votes actually voted. Turnout affects us all in our constituencies and we would like as many people to vote as possible. I favour compulsory voting at elections because as turnout would be very high indeed.</p>
	<p pid=".80.3/2">We put forward our mainstream policies, we put forward the record of this Government, and the people returned a Labour Government. I know that it is possible to play with statistics. One might say that the Conservatives won in this or that region or in England, and that the Labour party won in Scotland and so on, but overall we have a Labour Government&mdash;a properly and duly elected Labour Government&mdash;and those who accept the results of 1979 have to accept the results of 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".80.3/3">I pay tribute to the Prime Minister for leading us to an historic third election victory. I want him to serve a full term as Prime Minister, as he promised to do during the election campaign. It is very important that he fulfils that pledge because his work has not been completed&mdash;and judging by the number of Bills in the Queen's Speech the Government's legislative programme is very full indeed.</p>
	<p pid=".80.3/4">I want to make three quick points about three aspects of policy. The first concerns a subject that was mentioned by both the leader of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1713" name="Stuart Bell">the Liberal Democrats and my hon. Friend the Member for Middlesbrough (Sir Stuart Bell)</phrase>, namely, the Government's European policy. I welcome the number of Bills on Europe that are currently before the House. I welcome the fact that the Government are still committed to the enlargement of the European Union. They did not stop with the enlargement on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May 2004</phrase>, which has brought huge benefits to our country. Some of my hon. Friends will remember the concerns expressed by Opposition Front Benchers about the number of eastern Europeans coming to the United Kingdom. They were all supposed to be applying for benefits and unemployment was going to go up. Of course, that has not happened. The arrival of the new members has benefited Britain enormously and contributed greatly to our economy.</p>
	<p pid=".80.3/5">It is right that we should introduce legislation that will allow Romania and Bulgaria to enter the European Union. It is right that the Government, and the Prime Minister in particular, are the champions of enlargement, and are therefore pushing the case for Turkey. I would like us to look again at the block that we put on the entry of Croatia, for the reasons that have been outlined. It is important that we do not put a cap on membership of the European Union. We should ensure that it is as wide as possible, providing our country and Europe with great opportunities.</p>
	<p pid=".80.3/6">If we are to meet the targets of the Lisbon agenda we need to make absolutely certain that we can compete with the United States, and to do that we need the widest possible reform. That is why I hope that when we take over the presidency of the EU on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-01">1 July</phrase> we will push forward that reform agenda&mdash;an agenda that was set out clearly in the joint letter from the Prime Minister and Chancellor Schr&ouml;der in 2002. They detailed a long list of reforms that they thought were essential for the progress of the European Union. We have not ticked all those boxes, but we have a golden opportunity from <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-01">1 July</phrase> onwards to ensure that that agenda really is part of what we hope to achieve. We simply cannot accept a common agricultural policy that is so out of date that it does not actually benefit the agricultural agendas of this country and other European countries&mdash;apart, of course, from the French.</p>
	<p pid=".80.3/7">I look forward to hearing the new Minister for Europe when he addresses the House tomorrow. I understand that he will be opening the foreign affairs debate because the Foreign Secretary will be absent. I welcome the fact that the Prime Minister has decided that the Minister for Europe should attend Cabinet meetings. I have always felt that it is essential for the Government to give Europe a much higher priority. It is impossible for the British Foreign Secretary to give detailed attention to the European Union agenda. We have had seven Ministers for Europe over the past eight years, but I am sure that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2008" name="Douglas Alexander">my right hon. Friend the Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, South (Mr. Alexander)</phrase> will last longer than some of the others. The fact remains that we need to have that expertise at that level to take us through the presidency and beyond.</p>
	<p pid=".80.3/8">I well remember <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1875" name="Andrew MacKinlay">my hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay)</phrase> being extremely beastly to me when I was Minister for Europe, chiding me for not visiting the Balkans, despite the fact that as Minister for Europe I, like my predecessors and successors, had almost a third of the world as part of my portfolio. Indeed, when I was first appointed I was asked by the then Foreign Secretary whether I would take on entry clearance in addition to my European portfolio, and I was told by the permanent secretary that to do so would mean that I had to give up Russia.</p>
	<p pid=".80.3/9">It is impossible for a Minister to do his job effectively unless he is given the time and space to do it. I know that the Minister for Europe can only attend Cabinet meetings, but I see no reason why he should not permanently attend Cabinet&mdash;perhaps in a kind of Chief Secretary to the Treasury role&mdash;thereby enabling two Ministers to represent the Foreign Office. It will stop Select Committees and colleagues being horrible to Ministers by saying that they have not visited this or that country. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock is very keen for the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry to visit Poland&mdash;that was one of his great campaigns. I do not know whether Ministers have managed to do so, but this will enable that work load to be shared.</p>
	<p pid=".80.3/10">On the European constitution referendum, I take a different view from that advanced by my hon. Friend the Member for Middlesbrough. If France votes no in its referendum at the end of the month, I do not see why we should have a referendum. If a major country like France rejects the European constitution in a referendum, what is the point of our having a referendum?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-05-17.101.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1875" speakername="Andrew MacKinlay" colnum="101"  time="18:55:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050517/debtext/50517-20.htm#50517-20_spnew0">
	<p pid=".101.1/1">It would. At the back of my mind is the Herald of Free Enterprise. The people who ran that ship were trying to maximise profits and turnaround time with blatant disregard for the safety of passengers and crew. The individuals who were pilloried and received most of the penalties and the blame were not the directors but people who were low on the scale of responsibilities. Earlier, it was suggested that we should not oppose for opposition's sake. I certainly do not do so, but there are some things that we ought to embrace. I hope that all the parties embrace that proposal.</p>
	<p pid=".101.1/2">On the question of identity cards, when the Identity Cards Bill received its Second Reading in the last Session, David Trimble, the previous leader of the Ulster Unionist party and I challenged the Minister in charge to explain how he would deal with the common travel area between the United Kingdom and the Irish Republic. I remember the occasion, because it rankles with me that we were brushed aside as if that problem were irrelevant. It has still not been addressed. I am not opposed to identity cards, but I believe that legislation should have great clarity, precision and effectiveness. We have not been told, however, how the Government will deal with people who commute from the Irish Republic to the United Kingdom. We have a common land border, and many people also commute from the Irish Republic to London on Mondays and go home at weekends. Once identity card legislation is in force, everyone will have either an identity card or a passport in London&mdash;except for people from the Irish Republic. I am not criticising the Government, but I am alerting them to the fact that the arrangements have not been thought through. There is a common travel area, but, quite rightly, we cannot legislate for the Irish Republic&mdash;that would be a monumental cheek. Bearing in mind that I raised the matter some months ago, I invite the Minister to tell me tonight how the Government intend to remedy it.</p>
	<p pid=".101.1/3">According to the Gracious Speech, we are to have a fair and flexible system in relation to immigration and asylum. I listened to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1674" name="Keith Vaz">my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz)</phrase>, who is no longer present. I thought he did a wonderful job of clarifying the position and challenging the Conservatives to say how and to what extent they would have reduced immigration. There is controlled immigration to this country already. I was frustrated by the fact that members of the Government Front-Bench team did not challenge the Conservatives more on this during the election.</p>
	<p pid=".101.1/4">There has been a conflation&mdash;that is the buzz word, I think&mdash;of asylum and immigration, which are two separate issues. I challenge those on the Conservative Front Bench to explain to us this evening through which categories of people immigration would be reduced. As my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East pointed out, immigration is strictly controlled. I deprecate the fact that the Conservatives use the term without spelling out the consequences and where there is scope for reduced immigration&mdash;even assuming that that is necessarily a desirable objective, which I do not accept.</p>
	<p pid=".101.1/5">On asylum, which is a quite separate matter, the problem has been in the administration of the applications, as my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East pointed out. We have a proud record under successive Governments of allowing people who suffer persecution to come to the United Kingdom. Like hon. Members in all parts of the House, I have seen in my surgeries people who have endured the most terrible atrocities against themselves, their families and their loved ones. Sometimes, commentators and some of our constituents do not fully understand what such people have suffered.</p>
	<p pid=".101.1/6">Reference was made to public meetings. I remember one public meeting that I had with representatives of the Churches in my constituency during the election. Although by and large the mood of the meeting was with me, I thought it important to remind those attending the meeting that 2,000 years ago there was a little boy who fled persecution in Palestine with his mummy and daddy. The new testament does not tell us whether the people of Egypt said, &quot;All these Jewish carpenters are economic migrants, coming to take our jobs&quot;. It is interesting that Christ was a refugee from persecution. Sometimes I wonder whether we have moved on enormously in our understanding and compassion. It is fair to remind everyone of our obligations and duties and to give examples from 2,000 years ago to illustrate our commitments to our brethren.</p>
	<p pid=".101.1/7">The Conservatives made a big issue of hygiene in our hospitals. Over a long period some of us Members on the Labour Benches have also made an issue of MRSA, as it is commonly known. The hon. Member for Salisbury generously said that on many such issues it is difficult to apportion blame. It is now acknowledged that there is a real problem. My own view, which I want to share with the House, is that part of the problem was not with Conservative or Labour Ministers, but with Ministers who do not stand up to officials.</p>
	<p pid=".101.1/8">On <phrase class="date" code="1997-03-19">19 March 1997</phrase>, I held an Adjournment debate in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1754" name="John Horam">the House, to which the hon. Member for Orpington (Mr. Horam)</phrase> replied. He is a decent man, but he worked off a brief and basically said that the hon. Member for Thurrock was exaggerating and that there was no problem&mdash;the matter was under control. I challenged him, saying that figures were not being kept for infection rates in our hospitals, but the hon. Gentleman said that that was wrong. Baroness Cumberlege, who was a Conservative health Minister, said the same thing in the other place. Instead of challenging officials, Ministers often accept what they say and dismiss what Back Benchers, who have their ear to the ground, are asserting in the House of Commons. I hope Ministers will start listening to Back Benchers earlier, regardless of party, if they have a point.</p>
	<p pid=".101.1/9">I cannot help feeling that if people like me&mdash;I say this with some humility, uncharacteristically&mdash;and Lord Fitt, who raised the matter in the House of Lords in 1997, had been listened to, we may well have been on top of the problem of MRSA earlier. We would have understood that hospitals had a vested interest in covering up their deficiencies. The absence of corporate liability and the existence of star points for hospitals and a competitive environment led to a conspiracy of silence from the lowest level in the health service right up to the top, and reluctance to admit that there is a problem and that it should be tackled.</p>
	<p pid=".101.1/10">Both Conservative Ministers and the early Labour Administration fell into that chasm, listening to officials rather than to Members of Parliament. However, credit is due to the former Secretary of State for Health, now the Secretary of State for Defence, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1958" name="John Reid">my right hon. Friend the Member for Airdrie and Shotts (John Reid)</phrase> and others, who recently started to address the problem. I wish that had been done earlier, not just by my Government, but by Conservative Ministers, too.</p>
	<p pid=".101.1/11">We heard in the Gracious Speech that there is to be legislation to protect the natural environment. For me, that flagged up the green belt. During the election my opponent suggested that the Deputy Prime Minister personally was going to build 16,500 houses in one of the most beautiful areas in my constituency. There was not a scintilla of truth in that, but I want it stated and underlined that the green belt is sacrosanct. There is a good reason why that should be so. In my constituency and in the constituencies of many other hon. Members, there is a rich reservoir of derelict land&mdash;brown land&mdash;redundant industrial land, the development of which would be in the interests of environmental improvement. There is no need to encroach upon the green belt in my area and elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid=".101.1/12">Perhaps that needs to be restated. Let me be generous&mdash;perhaps there has been a misunderstanding. The green belt concept, which was created by a Labour Government, should be sacrosanct and we should be proud of it, as we are of the national health service. I hope that will be borne in mind. No doubt my hon. Friend the Minister will tell the Deputy Prime Minister this very evening what I have said and urged.</p>
	<p pid=".101.1/13">I referred to new Members who made their maiden speech. I made my maiden speech on the first day of the Session in 1992 and I was pleased to get it over. I revisited it to see what I had said then and what had come to pass. One thing I said was that the existing electoral system was indefensible. Secondly, I argued that we should be doing all we could to bring the countries of central Europe&mdash;Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic&mdash;into the European Union, and we have done that. In fairness, John Major started that process, but when history comes to be written, the present Prime Minister will be entitled to claim considerable credit and take considerable pride in the enlargement of the European Union. In today's Queen's Speech, it is anticipated that we will bring in Romania and Bulgaria, which I welcome. For me, the enlargement of the EU is an economic, commercial and political matter, but there is also a moral aspect. Those of us who have been able to enjoy parliamentary democracy since 1945 cannot deny those other countries the opportunities that come from membership of that democratic club. We should all embrace and encourage that where we can.</p>
	<p pid=".101.1/14">The third issue was Select Committees. I said that I had heard it rumoured&mdash;this was in 1992&mdash;that the Government might go slow in setting up Select Committees. I want a reassurance that there is no prospect whatever that that will happen this summer. It is extremely important that the Government are scrutinised by the Select Committee system, which has moved on considerably since 1992. It is important that one should refer to one's maiden speech from time to time.</p>
	<p pid=".101.1/15">The hon. Member for Antrim, North spoke about his party's endorsement in the Northern Ireland elections. I do not want to trespass into that, but the Government should ensure that there is proper scrutiny of legislation that relates to Northern Ireland, rather than dealing with it in an hour and a half in a Committee upstairs, with no opportunity of amending it. In addition, the Northern Ireland Assembly, which is costing a large sum of money, must be brought into force. Even if the Executive cannot be up and running, the Assembly needs to scrutinise measures endorsed by this House. That would be the appropriate democratic procedure and in the best interests of government.</p>
	<p pid=".101.1/16">My final point&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> It has not been raised so far, so even if it is a boring point, it is a new point. The Queen's Speech says:</p>
	<p pid=".101.1/17" class="indent">&quot;My Government will continue to play its full part in international affairs.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".101.1/18">With respect, no reference has been made in the House to the events in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, where the situation is grave. Elsewhere in the Queen's speech there is the theme of promoting democracy and human rights. There should be an early statement on Uzbekistan, because our policy, our stewardship and our representation in Uzbekistan needs to be discussed. I see <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1778" name="Crispin Blunt">the hon. Member for Reigate (Mr. Blunt)</phrase> acknowledging that. The Foreign Affairs Committee, when I was a member and previously, tried to argue with the Foreign Office that there should be an embassy in Kyrgyzstan. There is not one. It had a velvet revolution six weeks ago and there was no British representation there. Refugees are now crossing the border from Uzbekistan to the very small republic and fragile state of Kyrgyzstan, and so far as I am aware there is no British embassy there even today. That is a serious failure. I do not entirely blame Ministers; I blame Sir Michael Jay who runs the Foreign Office. He has been told time and again by the Foreign Affairs Committee that we should have an embassy and an ambassador in Kyrgyzstan, and he has refused. Our representation in Uzbekistan has been seriously flawed. There are some issues in Uzbekistan, unrelated to Craig Murray, concerning what has gone on in the embassy, which require serious examination. Two articles in <i>The Guardian</i> and<i> The Observer</i> have alluded to that. It is now time for a statement on the region. The Select Committees with appropriate jurisdiction should examine what has happened there and why there has been neglect in that area, and ensure that there is an early improvement in our representation in that region, which is critical in terms of its geopolitics, energy and human rights. I regret that that has not been done.</p>
	<p pid=".101.1/19">Members groaned when I started to make this point, but I hope that they will agree that that was an original point, which it is valid to raise in the House. I thank the House for its patience, but I hope that those points will be picked up by the Minister when he replies.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-05-17.110.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1710" speakername="Elfyn Llwyd" colnum="110"  time="19:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050517/debtext/50517-22.htm#50517-22_spnew0">
	<p pid=".110.0/1">First, I should like to say how much I enjoyed both the maiden speeches today. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1875" name="Andrew MacKinlay">The hon. Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay)</phrase> made a thought-provoking, non-partisan and excellent speech, and I also agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1935" name="Ken Purchase">the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, North-East (Mr. Purchase)</phrase> that the whole idea of choice in education has to be predicated on winners and losers. I could not agree with him more about that.</p>
	<p pid=".110.0/2">We have heard a fairly vague, but longish Queen's Speech today and we are promised some 46 Bills in 18 months. If anyone believes that, they should go and lie down. I believe that it will go the same way as the last Queen's Speech. It is packed full of goodies and baddies and packed full of stuff to make us think that Labour is now hitting the ground running. If we reflect on what is contained in it, hitting the ground running is a barely credible notion; indeed, it seems to me that the Queen's Speech is hardly even reaching the ground.</p>
	<p pid=".110.0/3">Before I get into a lather of criticism, I should like to mention one or two parts of the particular egg that may be palatable. The charities Bill is one, because I agree that charity law needs reforming. I approve of the Bills on common land and on consumer credit, though the devil is always in the detail. I also agree that the corporate manslaughter Bill will recommend itself to the House. The child contact and inter-country adoption Bill and some other measures may be welcome.</p>
	<p pid=".110.0/4">There are also, Madam Deputy Speaker, some pretty awful measures in the Queen's Speech; in particular the incapacity benefit Bill. We are not journalists but mere politicians, so we do not know much about what will appear in that Bill. However, we do know from what the Secretary of State has already publicly said that he wants to move 1 million people from the incapacity benefit list on to something else. In other words, he wants to bring 1 million people into work. Like others in the House, I have no objection to people going to work when they should be working. I have no truck with that at all, but the carefully manufactured leaks over the weekend talk about &quot;curbing&quot; the payments to people receiving such benefits.</p>
	<p pid=".110.0/5">I feel somewhat worked up about this matter because a friend of mine, the late Mr. Gwyn Jones, received a letter on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-11">11 March</phrase> whose contents I shall explain. Mr. Jones lived in my village and was therefore my constituent. He had been terribly ill for 10 years, and in need of heart, lung and liver replacements. He varied from being extremely ill to being merely ill, and it was patently obvious that he would never work again. The letter was from Mr. Jones's &quot;personal adviser&quot; who was writing to arrange a meeting. It explained that the records showed that he had recently passed &quot;a personal capability assessment&quot;, and went on to put pressure on Mr. Jones to attend the Dolgellau job centre the following Friday. Mr. Jones was on his deathbed when he received this letter, and passed away a few days later.</p>
	<p pid=".110.0/6">Needless to say, I am angry about that. If that is how payments are to be &quot;curbed&quot;, I am more than just angry&mdash;I am disgusted. I hope that a Minister will tell the House what the Government's real intentions are. The soundbites give the impression that money will be taken off those who are the most vulnerable in society.</p>
	<p pid=".110.0/7">As I said, I do not object to people not being paid when they do not deserve it, but I want to repeat a point that I have made before. Since becoming a Member of Parliament, I have conducted hundreds of tribunal appeals on behalf of people turned down for incapacity benefit. Between 90 and 95 per cent. of those appeals succeeded. I am a barrister by profession and I like to think that I am a reasonable advocate, but I am not that good. The figure that I have quoted suggests to me that those applicants should not have been turned down in the first place.</p>
	<p pid=".110.0/8">Under the present system, general practitioners have to fill in a form on behalf of applicants. One young lad had been invalided out of the Royal Air Force after losing both a shoulder and a leg. Even so, the doctor involved in his case said that the lad could walk 100 m in a matter of seconds. That is an example of abuse, and if time permitted I could give many more examples. However, my point is that GPs&mdash;who are paid &pound;125 or &pound;130 for the few minutes that it takes them to fill in a form&mdash;often say that people are fit for work when it is clear that they are not. I do not care about the amount that the GPs are paid, but the system needs to be reformed.</p>
	<p pid=".110.0/9">To be fair to them, the Government have changed the basic form involved. A slightly more user-friendly version has been piloted in Glasgow, and I am pleased about that, but abuse by medical officers engaged by the Department is still widespread.</p>
	<p pid=".110.0/10">On the previous occasions that I have mentioned the problem, I expected to receive letters saying that I was ignorant and that I misunderstood the system. This is the third time that I have mentioned the matter on the Floor of the House, and not one GP has told me that I am wrong. To my way of thinking, that underlines that a real problem exists.</p>
	<p pid=".110.0/11">One of the big issues in Wales has to do with affordable housing. Real steps need to be taken to provide that, and a leak over the weekend suggested that some assistance would be extended to first-time buyers. I can see no such provision in the list of proposed Bills, but I hope that I am wrong. Housing is a major issue in Wales and the UK as a whole. We need to enable young people in particular to get on the housing ladder. That can be done through the use of part-ownership schemes, community land trusts, planning controls, the provision of social housing or the cheap sale by local authorities of land to community land trusts. It grieves me that young people in many parts of Wales never have a chance to live in their own community. That can never be right, but I am sure that the same problem is replicated throughout England and Scotland.</p>
	<p pid=".110.0/12">My party issued a consultation paper on housing a few months ago. I invite the House to have a look at it. We do not pretend to have all the answers, but we think that we have a few that might work.</p>
	<p pid=".110.0/13">The House will shortly debate the ID cards Bill again. I have never been convinced that ID cards are a good idea. A strange climate of fear was engendered last time the matter came up, which was intended to soften up opposition to the original Bill. That opposition was very strong in this House, and I believe that it will be so again.</p>
	<p pid=".110.0/14">We have been told that there are two main justifications for ID cards&mdash;that they will help in the fight against terrorism, and that they will contribute to the reduction of benefit and other fraud. The Government are at pains to stress that ID cards will be voluntary at first, but how will that assist in the apprehension of terrorists? The awful individuals who perpetrated the 9/11 atrocity and the Madrid bombings carried ID cards, so what justification for them can there be?</p>
	<p pid=".110.0/15">The first sentence of the initial Government consultation issued last year said that ID cards would not become compulsory. I believe that there has been a change since then and that, once introduced, such cards will inevitably become compulsory within a few years. Furthermore, if ID cards are so necessary in the fight against terrorism and if they are such a useful tool, what will happen in the 10 years or so that it will take to implement the legislation in full? The ID card system will cost billions of pounds, but could that money not be used more efficiently by putting more police officers on the street?</p>
	<p pid=".110.0/16">In addition, an ID card system will require a national database. How confident can we be that the necessary IT will be up to the job? I am sorry to say that the Government's record on IT is lamentable given the serial failures of the Child Support Agency systems and a similar failure at the Department for Work and Pensions. Are we not heading for another costly and damaging IT disaster, and to what purpose?</p>
	<p pid=".110.0/17">One fascinating aspect of the ID cards debate is that no Minister has ever explained how such cards could combat terrorism. We are still waiting for that explanation.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-05-17.127.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1422" speakername="Andrew Robathan" colnum="127"  time="20:51:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050517/debtext/50517-26.htm#50517-26_spnew0">
	<p pid=".127.0/1">I welcome <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1408" name="David Evennett">my hon. Friend the Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford&mdash;and/or Eirth&mdash;(Mr. Evennett)</phrase> back to the House. We are pleased to see him and congratulate him on his born-again maiden speech. May I also say that I enjoyed <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1808" name="Michael Fallon">the speech by my hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon)</phrase>, who made important incisive comments?</p>
	<p pid=".127.0/2">On the first day of a new Parliament, it is fitting for all Members to recall who sent them here. I register my thanks to the good people of Blaby for returning me to my fourth Parliament. I hope that it was an expression of trust. It may have reflected the fact that C came before L on the list when it came to deciding whether to vote Conservative or Labour. Nevertheless, I felt that it was an expression of trust and I am grateful to them. I shall serve all people of my constituency, whichever way they voted, or even if they did not vote, to the best of my ability for the next four or five years.</p>
	<p pid=".127.0/3">The election was not a triumph for the Conservatives. We all know that. One must congratulate the Government on being returned to office. I think that it was unwise of the electorate, but the people have, indeed, spoken. However, it was not a triumph for any party. The Government saw their majority savagely reduced. The Conservatives increased their numbers, but we did not win. I think that the Liberal Democrats saw their vote reduced overall. They got a few extra seats, but they did not do particularly well. No one should pretend that it was a great triumph. It was not a great triumph for democracy when the turnout remained so low.</p>
	<p pid=".127.0/4">There is much in the Queen's Speech, with 40-odd Bills, but as my hon. Friend the Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford said, it is curiously thin for one with so much in it. I shall dwell on a few points that arise from it. First, however, I am struck by the fact that far from relishing victory, we see empty Labour Benches on the first day of the new Parliament. Where are Labour Members? Why are they not here, relishing the fact that they are back in government? We find ourselves in the dire dog days of this Administration. The Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs laughs, but where are her Members? She was a Whip and should have ensured that a few people at least showed an interest in the Parliament to which they have been returned. These are, without a doubt, the Prime Minister's twilight days. He has said that these are his last days, although we do not know whether they will last three and a half years or four, three months or six months.</p>
	<p pid=".127.0/5">It is extraordinary that, whereas we have returned enthusiastic for the fray, Labour Members do not look as though they are keen on joining in. That is partly because, under the present Prime Minister, new Labour has promised so much and achieved so little. That has spread the cynicism that has led to low turnouts, and the dissatisfaction with the system that we all saw in people's reactions on the doorstep.</p>
	<p pid=".127.0/6">We have heard a lot about education. Why, after eight years of a Labour Government and with huge amounts of extra money put into the education system&mdash;I do not criticise that&mdash;is a higher proportion of children now going into private education than has since the Butler Education Act of 1944? Why are more people than ever before opting for private health care and private operations for which they have to pay themselves rather than through insurance? In the Queen's Speech, we are promised another immigration Bill&mdash;is that the fourth or the fifth? Why do we need it? It is because the Government have created a huge mess in the immigration and asylum systems. Famously, the Prime Minister has not got a clue how many failed asylum seekers are in this country.</p>
	<p pid=".127.0/7">My hon. Friends the Members for Sevenoaks and for Bexleyheath and Crayford referred to that part of the Queen's Speech that says that the Government are determined to foster &quot;a culture of respect&quot; in our society. That sounds good&mdash;although no one knows what it means&mdash;but who destroyed respect? Why is there so little respect in our society now? That is a complex issue and I do not claim to have all the answers. I suspect that many people are responsible, not least the media, but I suggest that there is a connection between deference and respect. What we have now is a culture of rights in which there is no deference, no respect and no responsibilities, as we have heard. Ali G and his &quot;respect&quot; and &quot;gangsta rap&quot;, as I believe it is called, is perhaps what many young people think of when one talks of respect. Personally, I respect each individual for his value as a human being&mdash;each person is valued in the sight of God and should be valued in society, too, whatever they do. However, it seems to me that the liberal left has reduced respect by denigrating so many institutions in this country. We need only look at the empty Benches opposite to understand that.</p>
	<p pid=".127.0/8">I remember Peter Mandelson, when he was a Cabinet Minister, in that chattering class way laughing about the &quot;chinless wonders&quot; in our armed forces. I do not think that he ever apologised for that. Perhaps he should have. Today on the television, Lord Hattersley was sneering quietly about the fact that we had a state opening of Parliament, because he is a republican. The House of Lords has been reformed, but I am not sure that it is a better place. Grammar schools are denigrated and under attack from the Government. Under the Labour-Liberal coalition, property rights in Scotland have been subjected to astonishing attack, and the right to roam attacks property rights in this country as well. The fault is not entirely on one side, but the problem is one of reducing respect for other people and their property.</p>
	<p pid=".127.0/9">Over the past eight years&mdash;in fact, over the past 40 years&mdash;we have seen the fostering of the culture of rights. The 10-year-old who tells a police constable who remonstrates with him, &quot;I know my rights&mdash;don't you lay a finger on me,&quot; is a deeply worrying phenomenon. That culture is backed up by the so-called Human Rights Act 1998. Human rights sound marvellous, but the Act, against which some of us warned eight years ago, has contributed to the lack of respect and the yob culture that all of us are now supposed to turn against. For an example, let us take Travellers. They know their rights, they know about human rights and they know about legal challenges, but in my constituency just before the election they were defecating on the doorsteps of law-abiding citizens.</p>
	<p pid=".127.0/10">So-called modernising also reduces respect. Roy Jenkins might not be the best example I could use, but he was quoted earlier and, all credit to him, he came a long way&mdash;from a Welsh mining village, I believe. He delighted in speaking the Queen's English perfectly. Some people took the mickey out of him for so doing. We now have a Prime Minister who speaks with an accent that was never heard when he was at Fettes or at Oxford. This is a dumbing down and a denigration of perhaps what people used to look up to.</p>
	<p pid=".127.0/11">Modernising is in with the new and out with the old, change for its own sake. Consider all the fuddy-duddy old ways that the Government have been kicking. We should respect the history of this country and not apologise for it. What do we apologise for? Should we apologise for the potato famine in the 1840s or the slave trade, or any other such nonsense?</p>
	<p pid=".127.0/12">We should stand up for and support those who are in authority such as head teachers. We should show deference to the position of a head teacher or a police officer, people who are serving society. We should defer to and respect a nurse, a waitress, a road sweeper or a doctor, or even the Prime Minister, because of the positions that these people hold. We may not respect them enormously but we should acknowledge that which they are meant to be doing for us all.</p>
	<p pid=".127.0/13">The ghastly liberal left-leaning media have contributed hugely to the iconoclasm and the lack of respect that I believe has led to many of the problems that we are talking about. We need to foster a culture of respect. The Government have denigrated our institutions when they should have been standing up for them.</p>
	<p pid=".127.0/14">Deference to a position&mdash;for example, to a head teacher&mdash;is not obsequiousness. Instead, it shows mutual respect. The Government's determination to equalise and dumb down has led to a person who has, for example, got excellent A-levels or a very good degree, discovering that there is no respect from others for his or her achievement. People say, &quot;A-levels are devalued these days&quot;, and respect for a degree is devalued as well.</p>
	<p pid=".127.0/15">We should be proud of this country, of its institutions and of its democracy. That brings me on to what was perhaps the most disturbing element of the election campaign from my point of view. I am proud of the House and this mother of parliaments, so called. However, just before the election, Judge Richard Mawrey said that postal voting in this country was worthy of a banana republic. I think that I am quoting him correctly. Indeed, the mother of parliaments was reduced to such a state. He went on to say that the postal voting system was</p>
	<p pid=".127.0/16" class="indent">&quot;an open invitation to fraud.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".127.0/17">There are so many postal voting forms that they are thrown out like confetti. I have several in my office. I could easily have used them all. Like most Members, I am registered in two places, as is my wife. We could all use them because there is no cross-checking. I do not know whether right hon. and hon. Members realise but if Tipp-Ex is used on a postal vote&mdash;cross out one mark and put in another&mdash;that will be fine. According to electoral law, one is explaining to the returning officer that that is one's choice. If an envelope is ripped open and then resealed, that is fine. There is nothing in legislation about that, yet that is what has been happening.</p>
	<p pid=".127.0/18">There is no proper identification of postal votes. As I have said, there is no cross-checking. It is not only Members who are registered in two places. Universities and colleges have been registering all their students. Enormous numbers of students have been registered at both home and university. This is a matter of concern. There should be cross-checking.</p>
	<p pid=".127.0/19">Regrettably, most students did not vote rather than voting twice, but that is something else. In Leicester, it was reported on the Jeremy Vine show that there were 450 foreign students in one hostel&mdash;it catered for foreign students&mdash;who had all been registered for postal votes. Is no one checking this procedure? Some people were sent postal votes who had never applied for them. I know many people who found themselves in that position. Those who did want a postal vote because they were going on holiday or who lived overseas&mdash;I received many letters from people in such circumstances, and I am sure that it is the experience of other hon. Members&mdash;never received such a vote in time. I have received letters from people in Spain, telling me that they had applied for a postal vote. They live in the country for six months each year but the form never arrived. They told me that they would have voted for me, which was nice, but they could not do so.</p>
	<p pid=".127.0/20">There have been endless complaints. People went on holiday expecting to receive their postal vote more than a week in advance, but did not. I understand that postal votes, according to legislation, have to be out only on the day before the election. That is ridiculous, and it negates the purpose of postal voting for overseas voters or people going on holiday. The system is hopeless. It should be reformed from top to bottom, and I hope that the Bill we have been promised will do so.</p>
	<p pid=".127.0/21">I am ashamed on behalf of my country of the postal voting fiasco, and the Government should be ashamed of themselves for introducing it. It has destroyed the integrity of our electoral system, as there is no trust in, or respect for, a system that was changed in the name of so-called modernisation. The change was introduced, hon. Members may recall, to increase participation. I thought then, and I still think, that it was introduced to increase participation by Labour voters, as the Government were worried that they might stay at home in future. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-05">5 April</phrase>, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1602" name="Nick Raynsford">the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford)</phrase>, who was previously the Minister for Local and Regional Government but has now been reduced to serving on the Back Benches, said in the House that individual registration in Northern Ireland had reduced the number of people on the electoral roll, which was a bad thing. I am not the only person who knows that the &quot;vote early, vote often&quot; mantra came from Ireland. Of course registration went down, because many people were wrongly on the electoral register in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid=".127.0/22">The judge in the Birmingham fraud case said that the Government were guilty</p>
	<p pid=".127.0/23" class="indent">&quot;not simply of complacency but of denial&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".127.0/24">We must restore the integrity of the register and the voting system as a first step towards restoring trust in, and respect for, our political system. We should end postal voting on demand, and should have individual registration, as recommended by the Electoral Commission. We should have proper identity checks, perhaps at polling stations, and there should be cross-checking to discover whether people are registered in two places. We must limit postal votes, which should be sent out well in advance so that people can vote if they have registered.</p>
	<p pid=".127.0/25">Turning to service voting, on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-02">2 February</phrase>, in response to my question, the Prime Minister told me that all service voters would definitely have the opportunity to vote. When I was in Iraq at the end of January, however, a straw poll revealed that eight out of 10 soldiers were not registered. That is an unscientific poll, but a large number of service voters were not registered at all. One of them told me, &quot;I didn't think that we were allowed to vote.&quot; The Prime Minister promised that everyone would have a form to register as a service voter before <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-11">11 March</phrase>, the cut-off date for registration for an election on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-05">5 May</phrase>. Those forms never arrived. They may have arrived in some places, but I could give the details of many establishments where they did not do so.</p>
	<p pid=".127.0/26">What chance did someone in Iraq, Afghanistan or on the high seas who had registered as a service voter and received a postal vote have of returning that vote if they received it two or three days before the election? Typically, the forces' Iraq post takes 10 days in either direction, so there was not any chance of returning those votes. That, too, shames the Government, who have effectively disenfranchised the service personnel whom they have sent into dangerous parts of the world to do their bidding and serve the country.I was in the Army for 15 years, but I only recall registering once&mdash;I probably changed my details once or twice&mdash;as I had a proxy. Typically, a spouse, parent or, in my case, a brother acted as a proxy in elections. I hope that my brother always voted the right way&mdash;to a certain extent, one must trust people.</p>
	<p pid=".127.0/27">In the service voting fiasco, the Government deliberately dragged their feet. Ivor Caplin, who was a defence Minister in the last Parliament, said on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-20">20 January</phrase> that</p>
	<p pid=".127.0/28" class="indent">&quot;the situation is not nearly as bad as it seems&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-20">20 January 2005</phrase>; Vol. 429, c. 1002.]</p>
	<p pid=".127.0/29">He was right&mdash;it was much worse. I should like the Government to instigate a proper investigation to find out how many service personnel had the opportunity to vote on the Government's shambolic policies. I have already written to Sam Younger of the Electoral Commission asking him to do so. I wish he would spend more time investigating such subjects instead of sending us lots of glossy brochures that do not say very much.</p>
	<p pid=".127.0/30">I turn briefly to another couple of points. On Northern Ireland, we heard a rather good speech from the leader of the Democratic Unionist party. The Government's well-intentioned Belfast agreement, which many of us feared was built on sand, has produced exactly the opposite result to that which the Government hoped for. It has polarised opinion, so that the Democratic Unionists, who used to be considered extremists, are now the authentic voice of the Unionist or Protestant side&mdash;whichever one wishes to call it. I have no problem with the Democratic Unionists, but I have a worry that the people who were once referred to as extremists now romp back with nine seats to the one that the official Unionists got. At the same time Sinn Fein, despite the Northern bank robbery, the McCartney murder and everything else, increased its representation by one seat.</p>
	<p pid=".127.0/31">The reason for those results goes back to the matter of respect and trust. The Unionist community voted for the Belfast agreement because the Prime Minister promised that there was no place in government for those who had not given up violence for good. That message stands on its own.</p>
	<p pid=".127.0/32">Finally, I shall deal with the single farm payment. The environment and agriculture were mentioned only briefly in the Queen's Speech. I am a farmer and I have just had to fill in the forms for the single farm payment. Sadly, no Minister from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is present. I challenge any DEFRA Minister to fill in those forms. I meet many of my farming colleagues in my constituency and get on very well with them. They have told me that they believe the forms were introduced to drive decent old family farmers&mdash;not necessarily the best educated&mdash;out of business and get them to leave farming. Perhaps one or two other hon. Members have filled in the forms. I challenge anyone to fill them in and not to think, &quot;My God, what is all this about?&quot; They are so complex that all DEFRA Ministers should have to sit down and fill them in before they talk about farming.</p>
	<p pid=".127.0/33">In conclusion, when the Government came in eight years ago, they said that things could only get better. If I am honest&mdash;I see a Whip in the front row&mdash;I, like many people of Conservative persuasion throughout the country, shared a little of the optimism surrounding the brave new Government, the young Prime Minister and the dynamic nonsense. Do we now believe that Britain is a much better place? Do we feel more at ease with ourselves?</p>
	<p pid=".127.0/34">Some things are certainly better. I was ambivalent at the time, but I applaud the Chancellor's decision eight years ago to give independence to the Bank of England. Whatever we say, there are improvements in hospitals. In many cases waiting times are down, but so they damn well should be, with the amount of money that is being spent on such things. Generally, do we feel that things are that much better? I believe that there is a sense of hugely raised expectations that have been dashed. That has led to cynicism, a lack of trust in politicians and a lack of respect for politicians and for our democratic institutions like Parliament, which should hold out hope and optimism for the people of the United Kingdom. The Government are failing in that and are failing the people of the country whom we are all here to serve, when there is not enough hope for the future, as we would all wish.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-05-17.132.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1781" speakername="Nigel Evans" colnum="132"  time="21:13:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050517/debtext/50517-27.htm#50517-27_spnew0">
	<p pid=".132.0/1">I congratulate you on your re-appointment, Mr. Deputy Speaker, and I congratulate the three hon. Members who have made maiden speeches today&mdash;the hon. Members for Hove (Ms Barlow) and for Eastleigh (Chris Huhne) and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1408" name="David Evennett">my hon. Friend the Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford (Mr. Evennett)</phrase>. I reserve most of my praise for my hon. Friend. It is great to see an old colleague coming back after eight years. What took you so long, as we say?</p>
	<p pid=".132.0/2">Education's loss will be Parliament's gain, but my hon. Friend will see some changes since he left the House in 1997. The worst change is that we now occupy the Opposition Benches. I had hoped that we would return to the Government Benches. Another change is the new hours of the House, which I do not like at all. It is good that we have gone back to sitting until 10 pm on Tuesday, but it would have been better if we had got Wednesday and Thursday back to a later time as well.</p>
	<p pid=".132.0/3">We have talked about the lack of respect and how to engage people in the democratic process, and another matter that I find problematic which my hon. Friend will notice, particularly in Committee, is how all legislation is timetabled these days. The automatic guillotine falls, and we simply do not have the opportunity to scrutinise the legislation in the way that we should. However, it is wonderful to see my hon. Friend back in his rightful place.</p>
	<p pid=".132.0/4">This is my fourth term, as it is that of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1422" name="Andrew Robathan">my hon. Friend the Member for Blaby (Mr. Robathan)</phrase>. I had a good result in the Ribble valley, although the celebrations were tempered by the death of my agent, Keith Brunskill, the next day. Keith was a tremendous supporter of mine. He supported me through my summer tours over 14 years in the Ribble valley. The Queen's Speech refers to respect, and everybody I know who knew Keith respected and admired him. He was a community man and did so much for everything that he became involved in, whether it was politics, the church or just his local community and the village cricket team. My thoughts are with Kate, Mike and Vivian. He was a tremendous man and will be a great loss to us.</p>
	<p pid=".132.0/5">I have had five private Member's Bills so far and if I am as lucky in this Parliament as I have been in the past my next one will be the letter-box Bill. Having delivered thousands of leaflets over four weeks, I want to see legislation stipulating that letter-boxes should be horizontal and in the middle of the door, with no brushes, so that the leaflets go through smoothly. <i>[Interruption.]</i> That will clearly be a popular Bill; it may be my leadership bid. Everybody else is standing so I do not see why I should not. It was a hard-fought campaign.</p>
	<p pid=".132.0/6"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1875" name="Andrew MacKinlay">The hon. Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay)</phrase> referred to his maiden speech, and I remember mine in 1992. It was at half-past 1 in the morning. It was on Maastricht and it was an awful speech. I spoke mostly on what I liked about Maastricht, which were its opt-outs. This Queen's Speech refers to the European Union constitution, and I say to the Minister: let us bring on that referendum and give the British people an opportunity to vote on it, irrespective of what France does on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-29">29 May</phrase>. If it votes no, so be it, but let us give the British people a chance to vote on the European Union constitution. I have no doubts about what they will say. We had to drag the Prime Minister into having a referendum in the first place. The only reason he caved in in the end was that he wanted to save what he thought were a few seats at the European Union elections that were coming up, and I am not so sure that he was successful at that, because it was quite a dreary result for the Government. But he promised a referendum and I hope that we will have that. It would not be a bad idea if we had the date of that as quickly as is possible.</p>
	<p pid=".132.0/7">One reason why I did so well in the Ribble valley, with the Lib Dems only just clinging on to second place, was my support for BAE Systems. We have talked about manufacturing today, and the Ribble valley has all the technical and manufacturing skills required to help to make the Eurofighter. The Lib Dems were against tranche 3 of the Eurofighter, and that went badly against them. The Labour party candidate was in favour of it and he increased his vote. I want to ensure that we have the manufacturing skills required to manufacture products such as the Eurofighter jet, that we give those skilled workers our full support, and that we have the work for them in the future. We also need to ensure that our armed forces have the defence capacity that they desperately need for the job that they will have to do in the future.</p>
	<p pid=".132.0/8">The Queen's Speech also refers to support for rural services, but we do not really know what that means. We have talked about the vagueness of the Queen's Speech and its thinness in parts&mdash;none of us had the 200-page document that all the journalists had&mdash;and I heard what my hon. Friend the Member for Blaby had to say about farming. When I was knocking on doors during the election campaign, one youngster of 18 or 19&mdash;a farmer's son who works on the farm&mdash;said to me, &quot;Mr. Evans, will I have a job to go to?&quot; If we want a countryside that everybody can visit and working rural villages, the primary point is to ensure a farming industry that can sustain the families that live in and around those farms. This is my worry, and given the Government's desire to support rural services, I hope that they will support farming, which props up our rural areas. But we must also ensure that this is more than just words. We must ensure the survival of our rural post offices and buses, which allow people to live in such villages and to have a full life.</p>
	<p pid=".132.0/9">A children's Bill is also mentioned in the Queen's Speech. At the tail-end of the last Parliament, I asked the Prime Minister about the tragic case of a young boy in my constituency who died in the care of a child minder. Shortly afterwards, I met the then Minister with responsibility for children, who said that the Government were going to introduce a children's Bill. Having listened to what she and the Prime Minister had to say&mdash;I believe that the Prime Minister was being sincere&mdash;I hope that the Government will look at the facts of this tragedy. If they consider this children's Bill an appropriate vehicle, I hope that they will ensure that safeguards are included in it, so that our child minders are fully trained and know what to do when accidents or emergencies happen. Training and certification also have to be better. What happened to Joshua was an absolute tragedy, and if we can learn lessons from it, we can ensure that it never happens to anyone else.</p>
	<p pid=".132.0/10">The Queen's Speech also refers to a Bill on road safety&mdash;an issue which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1986" name="David Marshall">the hon. Member for Glasgow, East (Mr. Marshall)</phrase> mentioned. I enjoyed everything that he had to say on dealing with speed cameras; it was absolutely superb. The current situation is clearly over the top. There are far too many speed cameras throughout the country, and not all of them are in the right places. He said that people are losing their licences and he is absolutely right. I do hope that we will take a more intelligent approach to speed cameras and to the points system.</p>
	<p pid=".132.0/11">We also need to spend the money raised from speed cameras&mdash;well over &pound;100 million a year&mdash;more intelligently. We need to spend it on ensuring that the roads are made safer. There have been several tragic accidents and deaths on the A59, which runs through my constituency. A particularly tragic incident occurred between Sabden and Clitheroe, and the cost-effective answer was to stop the traffic turning right into Clitheroe along the A59. A few months after that was done, there was another accident in which somebody tragically died. What is needed there is a roundabout. No doubt that would cost more money than the cones that are currently littered along the A59, but they are not an effective road safety answer. Let us ensure that some of the money raised from motorists&mdash;money raised on the back of a road safety argument&mdash;is indeed spent on effective road safety measures. I hope that we will see a lot more such measures.</p>
	<p pid=".132.0/12">We have talked a lot about crime today, and about drugs. I asked the Prime Minister whether he thought that he made a mistake in reclassifying cannabis from class B to class C. He went on a bit, saying that the Government will have a look at this issue. If the commission that they have set up recommends returning it to class B, they will do so, but why did the commission not examine this issue in the first place? Why did it not look into the various consequences of reclassifying cannabis, taking on board the various psychiatric disorders that cannabis causes, and then make a judgment as to whether it was right to reclassify it? It is a very dangerous experiment and the Foreign Secretary has already said that the Government may have made a mistake. If so, let us be big about it, admit the mistake and reclassify cannabis as a B drug. A mistake has been made and it has sent all the wrong signals to youngsters up and down the country. The impacts of the reclassification were never taken into account.</p>
	<p pid=".132.0/13">The electoral system has already been mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Blaby, and I am also very concerned about postal votes. It seems that a number of people who did not ask for them received them; that some who wanted them did not receive them; and that others received more than one. We must therefore listen seriously to what the Electoral Commission has to say about the problem&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I see my hon. Friend the Member for Blaby is waving a spare ballot paper for us. We must take this matter very seriously indeed. We must ensure that the electoral system in this country is rigorous: there are ways to achieve that. Let us learn the lessons of the 2005 general election and bring forward a Bill that all political parties, not just one, will support. We need effective measures in place to ensure that people receive the voting papers that they need.</p>
	<p pid=".132.0/14">In my own constituency, more than 100 people were turned away at one of the polling stations in Fulwood simply because the clerks supervising the ballot were overwhelmed. When someone phoned through to ask for more clerks, the request was denied. A police officer then turned up&mdash;not to ensure that everyone could vote, but to quell the 100 people involved and to tell them that, sadly, it was 10 o'clock, so they could not vote. It was announced on the television that 100 people in the Ribble Valley were turned away from voting. We must learn the lessons there, too. When people turn up to vote and there is a queue, there must be a system in place whereby doors can be shut or a police officer called to prevent people from joining that queue after 10 o'clock. Anyone joining the queue before that time, however, should be able to vote. We talk so often about encouraging people to vote, yet these people were turned away, which is wrong.</p>
	<p pid=".132.0/15">Finally, I want to talk about democracy in the mo<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1886" name="David Clelland">ther of Parliaments. The hon. Member for Tyne Bridge (Mr. Clelland)</phrase> mentioned that reforming the House of Lords was not the No. 1 issue on the doorstep, but spoke almost exclusively about it during the rest of his speech. I want to ensure that we have a rigorous and effective Parliament, and the Government well know that they have been returned on the basis of just 36 per cent. of the vote. The last thing we want to see in this Parliament is a Government with 36 per cent. of the vote completely nobbling the second chamber. The Government are not content just to pack it full of their own cronies to gain the upper hand in numerical terms. They were upset by what happened at the tail end of the last Parliament, when not just Conservative or Liberal Democrat peers, but Cross Benchers and Labour peers repeatedly told the Government to think again on anti-terrorism legislation. The Government said that they could not do this or that, but every time the Bill came back here, we did think again and it was revised and sent back again. We ended up with an improved Bill, which both Houses were happy with. Of course, the Government said nothing about that during the election campaign, but waited until the election was over. As I said, not happy with packing the House of Lords full of their own supporters, they now want to neuter it so that the second chamber becomes ineffective against the mighty Labour Government&mdash;elected, I remind the House, on 36 per cent. of the vote.</p>
	<p pid=".132.0/16">On the day after the election, the Prime Minister said that he was humble and would listen to what the public had to say, and we all took him on trust. We will carry on taking him on trust, but he has to ensure that his policies reflect the percentage of the votes that he secured. He may wish to introduce many measures, such as ID cards and reform of the House of Lords, but he should think again. That is what the second Chamber is for. It tells the Government to think again, and the result of the 2005 general election is telling the Prime Minister the same thing&mdash;that he must think again. I hope that that is what he will do.</p>

	<p pid=".142.2/1">I am greatly honoured to have obtained the first Adjournment debate of the new parliamentary Session, and I know that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1785" name="James Duddridge">the constituents of my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend, East (James Duddridge)</phrase> and my constituents of Southend, West are very pleased that I have had this opportunity to debate a number of issues with the Minister.</p>
	<p pid=".142.2/2">I congratulate the Minister on his well-deserved promotion. I always thought he did a splendid job when he replied to the Christmas, Easter, Whitsun and summer Adjournment debates, always conscientiously following up the different points that we had raised. I hope that if I continue to flatter him more, I will find that I get the right answers to the points that I wish to raise in this short debate.</p>
	<p pid=".142.2/3">My hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend, East and I wanted to fight the general election campaign on national issues, but the reality was that for four weeks we fought it on local issues, and we fought it on the issue of the 20,000 people who were left off the national census. But I was shocked when, halfway through the general election campaign, the Chancellor of the Exchequer decided to make that matter a key point of the election.</p>
	<p pid=".142.2/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-21">21 April</phrase>, I wrote to the right hon. Gentleman about what he said during one of his briefings:</p>
	<p pid=".142.2/5" class="indent">&quot;I understand that you have suggested today that I have committed my party to a further &pound;14 million of spending in Southend. That is absolute nonsense. I am sure that you would not want to make a untruthful statement about what I have said and I can only assume that you have been badly briefed.</p>
	<p pid=".142.2/6" class="indent">When the National Census was conducted in Southend, 20,000 people were left off it, with disastrous consequences. We have lost a huge amount of funding. I am meeting the National Office of Statistics on Monday 9th May and I will be presenting them with evidence that they have made a mistake. That matter has nothing whatsoever to do with the Conservative Party's spending plans.</p>
	<p pid=".142.2/7" class="indent">I trust now that you will take action to correct the untruthful press release which you have issued apparently about myself.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".142.2/8">I have not yet received the apology&mdash;perhaps it has been delayed in the post&mdash;but now that this will be reported in <i>Hansard,</i> I am sure that the Chancellor will wish to correct the statement that he made during the general election campaign.</p>
	<p pid=".142.2/9">The crux of the matter for the Minister is that, as a result of national census, Southend has received funding for 20,000 fewer people than it should have. It is absolutely crazy for the Office for National Statistics to claim that the Southend's population has shrunk by 20,000 since 1990, when every other element of the Government has said exactly the opposite in parliamentary responses. In other words&mdash;I shall come to the meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-09">9 May</phrase> in a minute&mdash;according to the ONS, everyone is wrong, except it. That is simply not the case, and I shall tell the Minister about the result of the funding crisis in Southend.</p>
	<p pid=".142.2/10">The borough council originally expected to increase its council tax by 9 per cent. Thus the residents of Southend would have had to endure council tax increases in excess of 15 per cent. over two years. Obviously, that would have made things very difficult for many local residents. Given the original &pound;5 million-worth of cuts, the council would have had to make savings of &pound;12 million over two years. The &pound;5 million cuts in social services have included 12 redundancies; efficiency restructuring; the withdrawal of free school transport to voluntary-aided schools, with the exception of disadvantaged children; a reduction in school uniform grants to children from disadvantaged families; the closure of the Palace theatre, community centres and a mobile library; reductions in the park ranger services and grounds maintenance; the withdrawal of all bus route subsidies; and a 3 per cent. increase in charges for Southend borough council services. Obviously, that has not been very popular with local residents, so my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend, East and I have done pretty well over the past four weeks to survive the sort of criticism that we have received on the doorstep as a result of the financial crisis. I certainly do not blame the Minister for that, but I simply ask him to listen to what I have got to say tonight and to give my hon. Friend and me some assistance.</p>
	<p pid=".142.2/11">The Minister's predecessor warned Southend that it could be capped, so we obviously found ourselves with an increase in council tax that would not lead to rate capping. In spite of that, I have been advised today by the treasury office in Southend that we have still had to take &pound;800,000 from reserves and an additional &pound;70,000 in rent income from beach huts. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1437" name="Tobias Ellwood">My hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood)</phrase> is here, so I must be careful, especially as I lived there for three years, but my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend, East and I believe that Southend is the finest seaside resort along the Thames estuary. Some &pound;20,000 less has had to be paid to the Essex police authority for police community support officers, and &pound;1.1 million less provided for the cost&mdash;</p>
	<p pid=".142.2/12" class="italic">It being Ten o'clock, the motion for the Adjournment of the House lapsed, without Question put.</p>
	<p pid=".142.2/13" class="italic">Motion made, and Question proposed, That this House do now adjourn.&mdash;[Mr. Cawsey.]</p>

<gidredirect oldgid="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-05-17.143.0" newgid="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-05-17a.143.0" matchtype="changes"/>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-05-17.143.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1829" speakername="David Amess" colnum="143"  time="21:52:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050517/debtext/50517-30.htm#50517-30_spnew0">
	<p pid=".143.0/1">As I was saying, &pound;1.1 million less was provided for the costs of job evaluation.</p>
	<p pid=".143.0/2">On Valentine's day, my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend, East, myself and many others went to No. 10 Downing street where we engaged in a peaceful demonstration and gave the Prime Minister a Valentine's card. Many organisations of different types that represent the local community were present. They included the Southend Association of Voluntary Services, the Friends of the Palace Theatre, Southend Carers Association, Growing Together, Trust Links, and Southend Youth Council to name just a few.</p>
	<p pid=".143.0/3">Not only has the result of the census devastated council services, but on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-24">24 February</phrase> the very able leader of the local authority, Councillor Howard Briggs, announced that he intended to step down in May. That was not because he was gutlessly walking away from the problem, but because his health had suffered. He just felt that, in all conscience, he could not go on and face all the difficult decisions that will have to be made in future unless the Government get the national census results changed.</p>
	<p pid=".143.0/4">I know that the Minister is fair minded, and I say to him that Southend, West&mdash;I must get the figure right, because I think I claimed the last time I raised the issue that I had a constituent who was aged 120&mdash;has the most people aged between 100 and 112 in the country. There are a huge number of senior citizens, and Southend council is now having to making awful changes in terms of the support provided to a number of them.</p>
	<p pid=".143.0/5">In 1981, 160,000 people resided in Southend and, in 1991, the census told us that the figure was then 176,000. My hon. Friend and I represent an urban area, so it is not a question of people just vanishing. It is an urban area with more people than ever living in it. There can be absolutely no dispute whatever about that, and the Government agree with me. A couple of months ago, a Home Office Minister answered a question on population growth. She said:</p>
	<p pid=".143.0/6" class="indent">&quot;In February 2005 the Home Office announced that intensive family support will be introduced in 50 TOGETHER antisocial behaviour action areas through a &pound;1.25 million cash boost. The &pound;1.25 million will be split equally between the 50 action areas with each area getting &pound;25,000. The growth areas which will be covered by the scheme are: Harlow, Peterborough, Southend on Sea, Northampton and Hackney.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-15">15 March 2005</phrase>; Vol. 432, c. 202W.]</p>
	<p pid=".143.0/7">Just two months ago, in a written reply, the Home Office said that Southend was a growth area.</p>
	<p pid=".143.0/8">We then had an argument about the number of patients who are registered with general practitioners. According to the Southend-on-Sea primary care trust, there are roughly 177,522 people registered with general practitioners in Southend. A written reply from the former Health Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1874" name="Stephen Ladyman">the hon. Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman)</phrase>, confirmed that figure, but according to the national census, there are 17,000 fewer people in Southend.</p>
	<p pid=".143.0/9">Now I come to the rub, and my meeting with the national census people on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-09">Monday 9 May</phrase>. I frankly tell the Minister that I was disappointed by the meeting. I shall not name individuals, but I was worried that the officials whom I met, who seemed slightly heartless, did not understand the terrible effect that the census has had on residents in Southend. It has had a devastating effect, but their response in the meeting was, &quot;No, no, no&quot;&mdash;everyone was wrong except them. I said to them at one stage that the only way forward would be for me to try to persuade the Government and the Minister to ask the Office for National Statistics to examine carefully the results of its census. As the meeting went on&mdash;admittedly, I was fairly robust&mdash;I was dissatisfied with their answers about how the census was conducted.</p>
	<p pid=".143.0/10">There is a huge number of immigrants and asylum seekers in Southend. When the new director of social services arrived on the scene&mdash;she has now gone&mdash;she immediately embraced the Government's helping hand to assist Kosovan refugees. However, not one Kosovan has ever gone back. They are still in Southend in large numbers, and I am advised that many asylum seekers and immigrants simply did not show up on the census. When I asked the ONS how many prosecutions it had pursued in Southend, I was told that not one person was prosecuted for non-compliance with the form. I tell the Minister that that is crazy. When I asked how many staff were employed to conduct the census, I was told that officials would write back to me, but what was said did not convince me that the process was entirely rigorous. I was also not convinced about how the mid-census figures had been checked because it seemed to me that just some sort of computer analysis of the situation had been undertaken.</p>
	<p pid=".143.0/11">The Government want respect, so I hope that the Minister will ask the ONS to treat the matter seriously. It has dealt with one or two concerns raised by other hon. Members, so my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend, East and I now want this matter to be treated seriously. We cannot wait until 2011 and 2013. The situation must be dealt with pretty quickly. The local authority believes that the ONS has badly underestimated Southend's population in the 2001 census. The ONS has missed households in the census and the census coverage survey. There was a low response within households to the census in Southend, which means that not everyone in the household was included on the form. That was a huge mistake. Following the 2001 census, the ONS revised mid-year estimates since 1991 show a flat or declining population, whereas all the administrative data point to an increase. What the census has come up with is crazy.</p>
	<p pid=".143.0/12">The Minister knows that the conduct of the 2001 census has been subject to criticism. The census estimate of population is subject to significant statistical manipulation, whereas local administrative data and sources are not. The census and MYEs are not consistent with local administrative data, such as council tax, primary care trusts, GP registrations and planning records, which all point to a higher population and to population growth in Southend. They certainly do not indicate decline. The ONS track record on projected population estimates between the census is doubtful. Its method for estimating migration, especially international migration, is not robust. For example, according to the ONS, Southend has flows of around 7,000 internal migrations and about 1,000 international migrations, which net off to a small increase. Small errors in those figures can account for inaccurate estimates.</p>
	<p pid=".143.0/13">Even the ONS found a difference of 1,412 occupied dwellings between council tax registration and the census. That is a 2 per cent. increase. My hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend, East and I would welcome the extra funding for 1,500 people. If the Minister could at least persuade it do to something about that, it would go part of the way towards making amends for the 20,000 missing people.</p>
	<p pid=".143.0/14">The ONS estimation of Southend's population does not support long-term demographic trends, such as the ratio of babies to four-year-olds when the number of women of childbearing age has risen rather than fallen. The statistical manipulation of the census returns is undermining confidence in the result. For example, the ONS places great store on the census coverage survey conducted after the census to pick up people in households who were missed by the census. However, it seems unable to acknowledge that households and people could have been missed by both the census and the census coverage survey.</p>
	<p pid=".143.0/15">The ONS projects a population growth for Southend of 160,000 to 171,000 in 2021&mdash;some 11,300 people. That is not consistent with the Government's Thames gateway plans for 6,000 additional homes in Southend by 2021. All Departments disagree with the ONS. So how is it that everyone else is wrong bar the ONS?</p>
	<p pid=".143.0/16">I end with these thoughts on the way forward. The Government tried to find a way forward in 2004 because Southend is a low council tax authority. Excluding the Isles of Scilly, there are 46 unitary authorities and only three have a lower council tax. The council have taken the Government's threat of capping seriously. The Government expect the town to grow in line with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's Thames gateway ambitions. All other Departments think that the population of Southend will increase by more than that.</p>
	<p pid=".143.0/17">I want the Minister to agree to a meeting with me, my hon. Friend and perhaps the chief executive and leader of the council to discuss these important issues calmly. I also want the Minister to talk to the ONS and ask it to carry out a population study into Southend in advance of the 2011 census. We simply cannot wait until then to put matters right.</p>
	<p pid=".143.0/18">I know that the Minister is fresh to the job, but he has listened to my concerns before, albeit in an office different from the one he now holds. I simply ask him to reflect on the fact that all Government Departments appear to disagree with the ONS, to offer a helping hand to my hon. Friend's and my constituents in Southend and to help us to get those 20,000 people back on the census so that we can receive appropriate funding.</p>

	<p pid=".146.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1829" name="David Amess">the hon. Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess)</phrase>. It is traditional to congratulate hon. Members on securing Adjournment debates, but I do so genuinely. He has raised constituency issues and done so in a way that is not partisan, so it behoves me as the Minister to respond properly. I also congratulate him on his doughnut of hon. Friends who have turned up to support him; my doughnut is particularly thin this evening.</p>
	<p pid=".146.0/2">I hope that the hon. Gentleman takes my remarks in the spirit in which they are intended. He has raised a constituency matter about which he obviously feels very strongly&mdash;looking back through <i>Hansard</i>, I see that he raised it on <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-12">12 January 2004</phrase> and again on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-08">8 March</phrase> this year&mdash;and I feel an obligation to respond. The best postcard that I could send to him and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1785" name="James Duddridge">his hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend, East (James Duddridge)</phrase>, whom we welcome, is one that says that of course we will have a meeting to discuss the matter and his concerns. We shall arrange that with the local authority chief executive, as the hon. Member for Southend, West suggested. He kindly gave me a long timetable, extending to the next census in 2011, so perhaps I should not make commitments so far in advance. Let me explain the policy that has led to the current situation, then I shall reply to some of the points that he has made.</p>
	<p pid=".146.0/3">The overall increase in the formula grant for 2005&ndash;06 is &pound;2.6 billion. Every council will receive a formula grant increase at least in line with inflation; in addition, councils will receive increases in specific grants. The total increase in grant is therefore &pound;3.6 billion, or in percentage terms&mdash;although percentages do not always present the right picture&mdash;6.3 per cent. The background for Southend and everywhere else is that the Government have been able to give significant increases in grant.</p>
	<p pid=".146.0/4">The hon. Gentleman is arguing a constituency point based on the census. I note that he met representatives of the Office for National Statistics last Monday, <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-09">9 May</phrase>. Most of us spent the days after the election sleeping, so he should be commended for his fortitude. The point I make is that the ONS is independent of the Government, and were I to intervene and direct the ONS, he would probably seek another Adjournment debate or take some other opportunity&mdash;he assiduously participates in the pre-recess Adjournment debates&mdash;to criticise the Government for compromising ONS independence. However, the hon. Gentleman is on the Opposition Benches and he reserves the right to have his cake and eat it. I reserve my right to stick to the facts of the argument.</p>
	<p pid=".146.0/5">The &pound;3.6 billion increase builds on a sustained grant increase over the years since 1997. In real terms, the increase has been 33 per cent. in grants to local government since then, compared with the 7 per cent. real-terms cut in the previous four years. That is the context of the debate. Southend has received generous grant settlements&mdash;generous is, I think, a fair word in this context&mdash;from the Government. It will receive a 4 per cent., or &pound;5.3 million, increase in formula grant from the Government in this financial year 2005&ndash;06. This is the third year in a row that Southend has had an above inflation increase, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman acknowledges that that is the position.</p>
	<p pid=".146.0/6">Another point to note is that Southend also benefits from the floor system in the local government grant formula to the tune of about &pound;3 million. In addition, it stands to receive about &pound;26.6 million from specific grants on top of the 4 per cent. increase. The hon. Gentleman raises a constituency point using ONS statistics and the flaws that he sees in those statistics. I do not think that he can argue that the formula and the Government's policy have been anything other than generous to his council. I do not think that Southend can reconcile these facts with claims that it has been underfunded.</p>
	<p pid=".146.0/7">The hon. Gentleman mentioned some of Southend's budget decisions on service provision taken by the borough council. Those are matters for it and its electorate. It seems that Southend may be misdirecting itself in the way that it considers its total budget. I understand that it has usually been its practice to set its budget in line with a figure that is now known as formula spending share, or FSS, which replaced the earlier standard spending assessment from 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid=".146.0/8">I will clarify in the brief time available to me what FSS is, or perhaps clarify what it is not. FSS is not the Government's estimate of the funding's authority's need to provide its services. It is not the Government's view of the level of expenditure that authorities are expected to meet. It is not the Government's calculation of the level of grant that is needed by authorities. FSS is simply part of the mechanism for distributing the pot of funding available to local government. This is well understood by local government throughout the country.</p>
	<p pid=".146.0/9">The main theme of the hon. Gentleman's speech is the population estimate for Southend and his claim that it is inaccurate. When calculating formula grant allocations, the Government use the best and most up-to-date data that are available on a consistent basis throughout all authorities. For population, these are the mid-year estimates produced by the ONS. The calculation of population estimates is a matter for the ONS. Queries on their derivation and accuracy should be raised directly with it. I commend the hon. Gentleman because he has done exactly that.</p>
	<p pid=".146.0/10">Revised population estimates were published by the ONS as recently as September 2004. These followed the completion of the 2001 census, which was based on local authority population studies. Southend was one of the authorities that the ONS investigated as part of this work. After consideration of all the analysis, the ONS concluded that no adjustment should be made for Southend. The statistics were based on independent analysis by the ONS. I think that right hon. and hon. Members on both sides of the House would criticise me if I were to deviate from that independent advice.</p>
	<p pid=".146.0/11">The hon. Gentleman argued that we should use the most up-to-date data from the 2001 census in the settlement. I sympathise with his point about ensuring that data are up to date, but we faced a dilemma in considering the use of data other than population based on the 2001 census. In proposing not to use that census data in the 2005&ndash;06 formula spending share calculations, we had to balance our desire to use the most up-to-date data against our aim of providing stability in local authority funding. Using new census data in the funding formula is not, as the hon. Gentleman has acknowledged, a simple task. The changes needed to incorporate the 2001 census data would break the formula freeze and could cause large changes to the distribution of FSS. We will look at incorporating the 2001 census data in the funding formula once that freeze has ended. That would allow us to use the census data from 2001 in the 2006&ndash;07 settlement, assuming that agreement can be reached on an appropriate way of doing so.</p>
	<p pid=".146.0/12">The hon. Gentleman cited figures for losses of grant to Southend as a result of not using the 2001 data. However, there is no way to calculate those losses. The figures that he cited today and in previous debates merely resulted from putting the 2001 census data into the existing formula. That would be technically incorrect. We must wait for the new formula options before we can see broadly what effect the 2001 census data will have. We have therefore given Southend generous grant settlements. It has benefited from the floor, but the authority has still set high council tax increases. If that proves anything, it is that Southend does not have a case for its claims that it is poorly funded. Consistently good settlements from the Government ensure that all properly run authorities can provide a high level of service without making excessive demands on the council tax payer.</p>
	<p pid=".146.0/13">I am sure that as a matter of policy the hon. Gentleman would agree with those sentiments. In conclusion, I commend him on raising the issue, as he has done in two previous debates. He kindly acknowledged my genuine attempts to answer his questions in Adjournment debates, and I undertake to look at the points that he made and to meet him to discuss them. He has raised a constituency issue and I hope that his colleagues will note that Ministers do not respond in a partisan way to such issues. They will try to meet concerns, but the established fact is that there have been good grant increases, supplemented by additional grants, which have secured a steady increase in funding for the hon. Gentleman's council in Southend.</p>
	<p pid=".146.0/14" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid=".146.0/15" class="indent">Adjourned accordingly at twenty-eight minutes past Ten o'clock.</p>
