	<p pid="a.622.0/1">I think the House will recognise that that answer is only marginally helpful. Under the last Labour Government, a lot of secondary and primary schools in inner-city areas such as mine were rebuilt. At the moment, it is very unlikely that any primary schools, even those in great need, will see rebuilding or major refurbishment programmes. When will the money be available to those schools to ensure that children in inner cities get the education they deserve.</p>

	<p pid="a.629.2/1" qnum="56600">Following the abolition of education maintenance allowance, further education colleges are finding it difficult to plan ahead for pupils on low incomes, those who may have been on free schools and those from low-income households. How on earth will colleges be able to plan ahead if they are not receiving information about the people trying to enrol? Can the Minister say what he is going to do about that?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-23a.633.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40065" speakername="Dominic Grieve" speakeroffice="The Attorney-General"  colnum="633"  time="015:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110523/debtext/110523-0001.htm#1105237000735">
	<p pid="a.633.2/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to respond to my hon. Friend on an issue that I know is of considerable concern in this House as well as to the public and the media. The Government believe that freedom of speech is a cornerstone of our democracy, and that it is of the greatest importance that people should be able to discuss and debate issues as freely and openly as possible. This includes those occasions when freedom of speech is exercised provocatively, as it is supposed to be in a free country.</p>
	<p pid="a.633.2/2">Plainly, however, there are also occasions when an individual is entitled to have their privacy protected. There is a balance to be struck and this is reflected in our existing legal framework. The Government recognise the importance of finding the correct balance between individual rights to privacy on the one hand and rights to freedom of expression and transparency of official information on the other. We also recognise that there are widely differing views on what that balance should be. It is in no one&#8217;s interest to rush to judgment on this.</p>
	<p pid="a.633.2/3">The complexity of the issue and the lack of consensus are some of the reasons why the report of the Master of the Rolls&#8217; committee on the procedural aspects of super-injunctions and anonymity injunctions published last Friday is to be welcomed, and why we will want to take on board its carefully thought through recommendations. It reaffirms that open justice is a fundamental constitutional principle, and that exceptions are permissible only to the extent that they are strictly necessary in the interests of justice. While such decisions will necessarily be made in each particular case, dependent on the facts of that case, it does offer a likelihood of some greater clarity.</p>
	<p pid="a.633.2/4">The report indicates that when some degree of secrecy is necessary, the facts of the case and the reason for secrecy should be explained, as far as possible, in an openly available judgment. It also emphasises that super-injunctions&#8212;where the fact that there is an injunction, as well as the substantive issues, has to be kept secret&#8212;are now only being granted for very short periods where secrecy is necessary to ensure that the whole point of the order is not destroyed. We hope that its analysis and recommendations should help to allay concerns that super-injunctions were being granted far too readily and about their potential open-endedness.</p>
	<p pid="a.633.2/5">Of course, a range of wider issues has been raised by the events of the past few months and especially the past weekend. We take seriously the need ensure that we have the correct balance between privacy and freedom of expression. Today, the Prime Minister will write to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40385" name="John Whittingdale">the Member for Maldon (Mr Whittingdale)</phrase> recommending that a Joint Committee be established to consider how current arrangements can be improved. Such a Committee will be able to use representation of both Houses and the considerable expertise that Select Committees have to examine whether the current</p>
	<p pid="a.633.2/6">arrangements are working and to consider whether we might make any changes that would make things work better.</p>
	<p pid="a.633.2/7">In the meantime, it is right to emphasise that just as any change in the law is a matter for Parliament, the interpretation of the law is a responsibility placed on the judiciary. Legal mechanisms exist to review individual decisions that may be mistaken. If we believe in the rule of law, it is our duty as parliamentarians to uphold those principles.</p>

What I can say is that widespread public interest and, indeed, disquiet have been expressed about the events of the past few weeks and days, and that&#8212;as the report by the Master of the Rolls clearly showed&#8212;they raise the question of how a person&#8217;s privacy can be balanced against the requirement for the public to be properly informed, and also the question of how injunctions may be enforced. I would add, however, that the courts have power to punish those who breach injunctions, and those who decide flagrantly to do so should bear that in mind when they embark on such a course.</p>
	<p pid="a.634.1/2">The question of parliamentary privilege it is not a new issue. While it is fully recognised that we have complete privilege in this Chamber to say what we like&#8212;and the Lord Chief Justice reiterated that in the clearest and most unequivocal terms in this comments last Friday&#8212;it is also the case that the question of the extent to which communication between a constituent and a Member of Parliament is covered by parliamentary privilege remains uncertain. What is entirely clear is that&#8212;from the judiciary&#8217;s point of view as much as those of the Government and Parliament&#8212;that is an</p>
	<p pid="a.634.1/3">undesirable state of affairs, which is undoubtedly susceptible to both clarification and rectification if the will is there for that to be done.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-23a.635.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40065" speakername="Dominic Grieve" colnum="635"  time="015:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110523/debtext/110523-0001.htm#1105237000739">
	<p pid="a.635.1/1">I shall deal, so far as I can, with each point in turn. First, the Government have made it clear that it will be a Joint Committee, and have asked</p>
	<p pid="a.635.1/2">&#8220;Business Managers to establish a Joint Committee of both Houses to consider these issues. The remit will be to advise the Government on how current arrangements can be improved and put on a more sustainable footing, aiming to report in the autumn.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.635.1/3">The Government have also</p>
	<p pid="a.635.1/4">&#8220;asked the Justice Secretary and Culture Secretary to liaise&#8230;on the Terms of Reference.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.635.1/5">The right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s second question was about privacy law. It is undoubtedly the case that it would be open to this House to enact a privacy law, if it</p>
	<p pid="a.635.1/6">wished. However, I have to say to the right hon. Gentleman that he misquoted my right hon. Friend the Culture Secretary, as what he actually said was:</p>
	<p pid="a.635.1/7">&#8220;We&#8217;re not minded to have a new privacy law but we&#8217;re not ruling out the need for legislative changes.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.635.1/8">If I may say so, it is possible to have legislative change without necessarily having a full-blown privacy law, and this seems to me to be precisely the sort of issue that the Committee will need to consider, and in a measured and sensible fashion.</p>
	<p pid="a.635.1/9">The right hon. Gentleman rightly raised the question as to whether a privacy law would make any difference to the existing arrangements. That, too, is an interesting subject to both legal and political debate, and it is precisely because that needs to take place that the suggestion has come forward that this is the best way in which to proceed.</p>
	<p pid="a.635.1/10">Finally, the right hon. Gentleman asked a number of questions about enforceability. It has been clear for some time in a number of different spheres that the enforceability of court orders and injunctions presents a challenge now that information can rapidly be posted on the internet, but that does not necessarily mean that the right course of action is to abandon any attempt at preventing people from putting out information that may, in some circumstances, be enormously damaging to vulnerable people or, indeed, be the peddling of lies.</p>

	<p pid="a.636.1/1">I have to say to my right hon. Friend that my reading of what was said is rather different. In the clearest and most unequivocal terms, both the Lord Chief Justice and the Master of the Rolls spelled out what is the existing fact, which is that the privilege we have under article 9 of the Bill of Rights is unimpeachable in any court in respect of what is said in this Chamber. The control mechanism that is put in place is, in fact, entirely dependent on yourself, Mr Speaker. That then raises the question of the extent to which there is a necessity, by convention, to be comity, whereby this House, through Mr Speaker&#8217;s authority, respects the rulings of other courts, being a court itself. As I understand it, there has never been any suggestion that any of the proposals being put forward call into question those basic principles. Indeed, as I pointed out in an earlier answer, the evidence is pretty overwhelming that where there is a lack of clarity in this area in terms of communication between constituent and Member of</p>
	<p pid="a.636.1/2">Parliament, there seems to be a universal view that it would be well if we could clarify things, and the Government recognise that.</p>

	<p pid="a.637.0/1">We welcome the Attorney-General&#8217;s clarification, but is it not a fact that if we continue to use parliamentary privilege to usurp court orders, we are not only bringing Parliament and the courts into conflict, but we are interfering with the separation of powers. Is that desirable or is it not?</p>

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40400" name="Stuart Bell">the Member for Middlesbrough (Sir Stuart Bell)</phrase>. Although it is right that we do not have a strict separation of powers in this country, we adhere to the principle to some degree as it is accepted that we write the laws and the courts interpret and apply them. In that context, does the Attorney-General agree that Members of this House should exercise extreme caution when, as we have in some senses just witnessed, they take it on themselves to breach court orders using parliamentary privilege when they are not fully apprised of all the evidence in the way that the judges who hear the cases are? We have the power, after all, to change the law if we see fit.</p>

	<p pid="a.666.2/2">Let me get one thing out of the way first. I have always believed, along with every sensible person, that Britain needs a criminal justice system that is effective in properly punishing offenders for their wrongdoing and in protecting the public from further crime. When I took office as Justice Secretary it seemed to me perfectly obvious that that had to be the first priority for all my policies. That is self-obvious; it is a platitude. The Government&#8217;s policy, and my first duty, is to punish</p>
	<p pid="a.666.2/3">crime and have an effective system for protecting the public from further crime. The problem that I face, which causes the reforms, is the fact that I inherited a system that was not effective in protecting against offenders&#8217; committing further crime or even in punishing offenders. So that is at the forefront of where we are going.</p>
	<p pid="a.666.2/4">Without going over all the exchanges that we have just had, let me explain briefly what we have taken over, which causes the need for the proposed reform. Our prisons are pretty nasty, unpleasant places, far from the holiday camps they are sometimes made out to be. The people in most of them pass their days in a state of enforced idleness, quite a few of them making some tougher friends than they have had in the past, and not facing up to what they have done. That is not what I think of as a satisfactory and effective punishment. But a bigger scandal still is our system&#8217;s failure to protect the public from future crime committed by offenders after completion of their time inside. Reoffending rates in this country, as we have taken over the system now, are straightforwardly dreadful.</p>

	<p pid="a.667.1/1">The point that I make is not the one that hair-splits the variations between different forms of sentence. All our reoffending rates are very bad. I have no intention of addressing the sentencing tariffs for any offence in this country. I have no proposals for reducing the overall powers of the courts to deal with any crime. What we are talking about is the difference between someone who pleads guilty, particularly at an early stage, and someone who makes the witnesses and the victims go through the crime. That is what I will address.</p>
	<p pid="a.667.1/2">Ever since I published the proposals five months ago, although we have not faced any clear alternatives or views from the Opposition, I faced a debate about my apparent desire to let prisoners out and reduce the sentences. I have no such desire, nor do I use statistics to illustrate the need for that. What I am talking about&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="a.668.1/1">Let me finish describing the legacy of the previous Government, then we will move to the more constructive matter of my reforms and I will give way to my hon. Friend.</p>
	<p pid="a.668.1/2">I have not forgotten, and I am sure the public have not forgotten either, what 13 years of Labour government was like in this field, despite the attempts of the right hon. Member for Tooting to skate over some of it. We had 13 years of eye-catching initiatives, schemes, meddling and prescription that made a complete Horlicks of the criminal justice system. We had more than 20 Criminal Justice Acts. Thousands of new criminal offences were created. Senior judges complained that</p>
	<p pid="a.668.1/3">&#8220;Hell is a fair description of the problem of statutory interpretation&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.668.1/4">when talking of this stream of legislation. We had a 39% increase in the number of prisoners in our jails&#8212;it was not planned and it was not policy&#8212;with the cost to taxpayers rising by two thirds in real terms.</p>
	<p pid="a.668.1/5">And what for? That was meant to be the embodiment of the policy of being tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime&#8212;an attempt to give reality to an admittedly rather catchy slogan. What we got was a sentencing policy so chaotic and badly managed that, as my hon. Friends quite rightly keep emphasising, the previous Government had to let out early 80,000 criminals, who promptly went on to commit more than 1,000 crimes, including alleged murders and one rape. We had a system under which more than 1,000 foreign national offenders were released without being considered for deportation&#8212;the total number of foreign prisoners in our jails doubled during Labour&#8217;s period in office. We had a system under which offenders serving community sentences in practice usually completed only one or two days of unpaid work each week. Above all, as I keep emphasising, there was the national scandal throughout Labour&#8217;s period in office&#8212;not a new problem&#8212;that the exorbitantly high reoffending rates went completely ignored.</p>
	<p pid="a.668.1/6">Why was that? A recent quote from the right hon. Member for Tooting is worth repeating, as he gave an extremely good description of what went wrong and what was driving Labour&#8217;s policy. Speaking to the Fabian Society about New Labour&#8217;s record on this subject just two months ago, he said that</p>
	<p pid="a.668.1/7">&#8220;playing tough in order not to look soft made it harder to focus on what is effective&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.668.1/8">He gets a murmur of approval from the Conservative Back Benches, and certainly from those of us who had to witness the effect of that policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.668.1/9">Let me move on to our proposed reforms, including the one to which the Opposition&#8217;s motion refers. What are the problems that we are now tackling and that our large package of reforms seeks to address? First, criminal trials are needlessly long, drawn out and expensive. The court experience is often deeply unpleasant and almost always uncomfortable for victims, witnesses, jurors and</p>
	<p pid="a.668.1/10">most people who have anything to do with it. As I have said, at least half of all crimes are committed by people who have already been through the criminal justice system. More than one in 10 adults in prison have never been in paid employment, almost a fifth of prisoners who have used heroin did so for the first time while in prison, and one in five appear to have mental health problems. If we wish to take this subject seriously and really want to protect society and the victims of crime, we must recognise that that is the context of today&#8217;s debate.</p>

	<p pid="a.669.0/1">I thank the right hon. Gentleman for giving way at last. He is talking about practical studies on how to deal with prisoners with mental health problems, such as the work done by the Bradley review. I will go along with him on those issues, but I do not understand what studies he has done on the precise issue that we are debating today and on the effectiveness of early guilty pleas. It is clear that already two thirds of Crown court cases that result in a conviction involve people who have pleaded guilty. More than 10,000 of those cases in 2008-09 were at the door of the court but could easily have been dealt with in a magistrates court. Why is he not acting to ensure that those guilty pleas happen in a magistrates court, rather than having this widespread policy that will lead to violent criminals being let off?</p>

Friend, but I have to bear in mind the people trying to be called, otherwise there will be no Back-Benchers&#8217; debate, and as someone who was until recently a Back Bencher for many years, I always used to find it irritating when we had a short Opposition day debate.</p>

	<p pid="a.670.4/1">Halfway through the sentence, people are released on licence, therefore they are liable to recall. If they reoffend, they are brought back; they are not free of their conviction for some time. We are going to address not just release on licence or supervision on licence, but what more can be done once people are out of immediate custody in order to increase the chances of them not reoffending. That is where we get into payment-by-results schemes, and that is why I already</p>
	<p pid="a.670.4/2">have contracts at Peterborough prison, one I inherited, and at Doncaster prison, a new one, whereby we will pay more to providers who stop such people coming back when they leave prison. That is not for today, but it is a key part of our reforms, and I do not think that any Member opposes it.</p>
	<p pid="a.670.4/3">Let me move on to what we are debating. We have the decades-long principle of offering for an early plea a reduction of up to one third on the sentence that a judge hands down. The previous Government made that clearer, because they calmly allowed the Sentencing Guidelines Council to spell out the one third, and it was actually made more binding on the courts in 2009. If anybody in the Opposition is against in principle the idea of what I say is unfortunately called a &#8220;discount&#8221; for a plea, why have they not mentioned it for the past 13 years? Why was the previous Government&#8217;s policy based on that principle and on the arguments that I have just raised? Why are we readdressing this?</p>

	<p pid="a.674.2/1">It is a pleasure to follow the Secretary of State, who presented a familiar face. There was a mixture of pragmatism, an element of bluster and just the occasional shaft of precision in his argument.</p>
	<p pid="a.674.2/2">I begin by making an obvious point, and I do so at the risk of sounding like Michael Howard, now Lord Howard. We often lose sight of part of the meaning of what he said on the subject. Prison does work, at least to a limited extent. It seems to me an incontestable fact that while somebody is locked up in prison, they cannot commit offences out in the community. There have been many cases in my constituency over the years in which people have been given a custodial sentence and been taken out of the community, even if only for three or six months, and there has been an appreciable difference in the crime rate. Local police inspectors and senior officers in my area, and I am sure in other areas, will attest to the fact that prison works in those circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.674.2/3">In my remaining time, I wish to cover two issues, the first of which is sentencing in general, which is the main subject of the debate. I approach it from the vantage point&#8212;or it might be a disadvantage point&#8212;of having sat on the Gage working group, which reported in July 2008. I will refer briefly to that report, then I want to say a word about community sentences.</p>
	<p pid="a.674.2/4">The Gage working group examined, among many other things, the causes of the increased prison population to which the Secretary of State referred. We highlighted nine points. I will not go through all of them&#8212;time forbids, and in any event the Secretary of State has already referred to them, and my right hon. Friend the</p>
	<p pid="a.674.2/5">Member for Tooting (Sadiq Khan) has covered the same points. However, I wish to pick out one of the nine, because the Secretary of State made a great point of talking about reoffending. Point (5) in paragraph 2.2, on page 5 of the report, states that</p>
	<p pid="a.674.2/6">&#8220;re-offending including breaches of supervision, licence recall, suspended sentences and community orders&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.674.2/7">is one of the drivers that increase the prison population. I shall come back to that point later, but it is important to recognise that the prison population increased for reasons relating to the alternatives to prison sentences.</p>
	<p pid="a.674.2/8">This month, the new Sentencing Guidelines Council, which was established from the Gage commission and subsequent legislation, produced a survey, &#8220;Attitudes to guilty plea sentence reductions&#8221;, which is germane to this point&#8212;it is included in the note produced by the House of Commons Library. I shall focus on three of the survey&#8217;s findings that have some force, the first of which is a point that the Secretary of State used to criticised my right hon. Friend the Member for Tooting. First, the survey states:</p>
	<p pid="a.674.2/9">&#8220;The public assume that the key motivation for the guilty plea sentence reduction is to reduce resources (time and money)&#8230;There is a strong sense that the drive for cost savings should not impact on a system effectively delivering justice.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.674.2/10">Secondly, it states:</p>
	<p pid="a.674.2/11">&#8220;For the general public, there was weak support for higher levels of reductions beyond the current guideline range of up to 33%&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.674.2/12">Thirdly, it states:</p>
	<p pid="a.674.2/13">&#8220;The public (and some victims and witnesses) do not like the idea of a universal approach to reductions&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.674.2/14">There is therefore a strong disconnect between the Secretary of State&#8217;s proposals and how the public feel things need to be handled, which is a real problem. I accept that he is making a genuine attempt to address the issue&#8212;he is not one for eye-catching initiatives. However, he has not won over the public, and he certainly has not won over large numbers of his own Back Benchers, and for that&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="a.681.0/1">I want to talk about this Government&#8217;s record on crime where women are victims or offenders, and to show that the latest attempt to propose a 50% discount for early guilty pleas&#8212;which was offered up by the Under-Secretary of State, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40496" name="Crispin Blunt">the hon. Member for Reigate (Mr Blunt)</phrase>, as doing women rape victims a favour&#8212;is a desperate ploy that could only be the product of a men-only Department that, to be frank, just does not get it when it comes to women and crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.681.0/2">It is not just Ministers&#8217; fault, however: when I was a Home Office Minister working with the National Offender Management Service, I discovered that officials believed that women offenders in prisons were basically exactly the same as men and were to be treated the same. The consequence was an appalling deluge of women self-harming and killing themselves in jail. I realised that we needed a comprehensive rethink of the issue, and helped to commission Baroness Corston to look at it. She came up with an excellent report that showed many of the ways that prisons dealt ineffectually and unfairly with women, who are more likely to be jailed for non-violent offences than men, more likely to be remanded when they are later found innocent, and very likely to have been victims of violence themselves before committing any offence.</p>
	<p pid="a.681.0/3">It seems that we are getting the same kind of cloth-eared view on how women as victims are treated. We need to approach them in the same way that Baroness Corston approached women offenders: by really looking at how to reduce future crime, by ensuring that the children of offending women are less likely to become offenders themselves, by listening to victims and those in the system, and by doing a careful study rather than what I believe we are facing, which is a back-of-the-envelope calculation&#8212;&#8220;This&#8217;ll get me off the hook with the Treasury.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.681.0/4">Let us look briefly at Labour&#8217;s record, which Government Members have mentioned extensively. The most striking thing in relation to rape is the increase of sentences served between 2005 and 2009, the period for which we have the most recent figures. Sentences served increased by 14 months over that period because of determined work by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member</p>
	<p pid="a.681.0/5">for Camberwell and Peckham (Ms Harman) and Baroness Scotland, who worked together to start taking unduly lenient sentences back to court and ensure that dangerous rapists were not released early. We then realised that we were not doing enough, so we commissioned Baroness Stern to look at how rape was treated in the criminal justice system. She was impressed by a number of the changes that we had made, including introducing specialist police units, which are now due to be cut by the Home Office, increasing by 15% the number of rapists convicted, improving the way cases were dealt with in court, and introducing specialist prosecutors in all 42 Crown Prosecution Service areas. Of course, the number of CPS areas has now been cut, so although every area might claim to have specialist prosecutors, I doubt whether there will be as many as there were.</p>
	<p pid="a.681.0/6">The difference between that and what we see now is carefully thinking through what will make a difference. I am genuinely shocked by the Minister, who I do not think is a bad man. I share his desire to reduce reoffending, and I recognise his point that short sentences&#8212;those under four years&#8212;are ineffectual. That is one of the reasons why I want to ensure that no rapist is in jail for less than four years. He said that there was no loud opposition to the proposal. What that means is that he has not bothered to read the representations that women&#8217;s organisations made in response to his Green Paper. I am afraid that we are seeing a cloth-eared, don&#8217;t-get-the-women approach from this Department. I want Ministers to think again. We were told that victims&#8217; organisations would really welcome the proposal because victims would not have to go through the horror of a trial. Yes, rape trials are horrible&#8212;they are very degrading for the victim&#8212;but if the trial does not go ahead, then although the judge hears the plea in mitigation, he never hears how the victim&#8217;s life has been destroyed.</p>

	<p pid="a.687.1/1">I completely agree with my hon. Friend, as he will find out if he listens a little further. I am great proponent of tougher prison sentences, of making them longer for certain crimes and of taking away the televisions and the PlayStations in favour of making prisoners do hard work during the day, learn a skill and work towards being creative members of society on coming out of prison.</p>
	<p pid="a.687.1/2">The problem with the case of Labour Members, some of whom have made an alliance with some of the more extreme Conservative Members [Hon. Members: &#8220;Name them.&#8221;] No, they know who they are! It is an interesting alliance. <i>[Interruption.] </i>Just wait and they will be proposing flogging next. What Labour Members do not understand is that for short custodial sentences, we are seeing increasing rates of reoffending, which means only more victims. That is not to say that we should be putting people on pansy community sentencing; we should not, because many of those sentences do not work. Why can we not follow the example of the Germans, who have a prison population of 72,000 people in an overall population of 80 million; or of France, whose prison population is 60,000 in an overall population equivalent to our own? In both jurisdictions, crime is lower because their community rehabilitation systems are stronger, especially for short-term custodial sentences.</p>
	<p pid="a.687.1/3">We have heard from Members representing constituencies in the north-east and the north-west, where more than two thirds of court cases crack before their end either through the incompetence of the Crown Prosecution Service or because of the guilty plea being made either mid way through or at the end of the trial. None of that does anything to help victims, which is important, and on top of that it commits millions of pounds that could be spent on picking up criminals, putting them in court, convicting them and keeping them in prison if they are danger to the public.</p>
	<p pid="a.687.1/4">Let me finish with another point about criminals. The victims commissioner, Louise Casey, said of these cracked trials that they increase &#8220;anxiety among victims&#8221; and caused great fear among witnesses at the &#8220;prospect of giving evidence&#8221;. Why cannot Opposition Members congratulate the Justice Secretary on bringing proposals to the House that will reduce anxiety among victims and help to improve the prospects of bringing people to justice rather than just jump once again on to a passing media bandwagon? I am afraid that they also show once again that in the absence of their own policy, the Opposition have nothing to offer this country&#8212;not even an apology for their grievous mistakes over the past 13 years.</p>

	<p pid="a.689.0/1">I have been a Member of Parliament for a year, but I do not think that I have ever smelt such rank political hypocrisy as that which is emanating from the Opposition Benches. I practised as a criminal barrister for 16 years, just a little longer than the tenure of the last Government. During those 16 years, and particularly during my 13 years at the criminal Bar, I saw almost daily the harsh reality of their sentencing policy, a policy which led to the present chaotic state of our prisons and which neither added up nor delivered all that they claimed it would do.</p>
	<p pid="a.689.0/2">As Members may recall, Labour claimed to be tough on crime. They used to say that they were turning the key on the prison gates and bars in order to secure someone, but at the same time they could not push people out too quickly. That is why we saw the release schemes enjoyed by so many people during their time in office, and why I asked the shadow Secretary of State about overcrowding. That is the last Government&#8217;s legacy, and that is the reality of Britain&#8217;s prisons today.</p>
	<p pid="a.689.0/3">What has the policy of the last Government meant in the real world in which some of us worked before we came to this place? I had clients aged 18 and 19 who were on remand, which meant that they were innocent, in adult prisons because there were no places for them in young offenders&#8217; institutions. I had clients who, when I asked them whether they been to see their drug worker, said that they had been unable to arrange an appointment because of the overcrowding. I had clients&#8212;as I now have constituents&#8212;who were willing to go on courses in order to be rehabilitated and educated, and who could not obtain places on those courses. That is the legacy of the Labour party. It is an absolute disgrace, and it is even more disgraceful that they are in denial about it.</p>

	<p pid="a.692.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40130" name="Anna Soubry">the hon. Member for Broxtowe (Anna Soubry)</phrase>. I have not got as much professional experience as her; she practised as a criminal barrister for 16 years, whereas before the general election I was a pupil barrister in my local chambers in Hull. I practised as a criminal solicitor for some time prior to that, however, and I have not met or spoken to anyone from the profession in recent days who has said the policy in question is a good one. Indeed, I have spoken to Members who sit on the hon. Lady&#8217;s side of the House, including practising barristers, who have said that this policy is simply wrong.</p>
	<p pid="a.692.0/2">I have a great deal of respect for the Lord Chancellor; I think he is a very honourable man, and I am sure that the explanation for his remarks last week is that he did not choose his words very well. Indeed, to be honest, when I heard, and listened back to, his comments, I understood the point he was trying to make. The reality, however, is that some sentences that are currently on the statute book are too low. In an earlier intervention, I made a point about convictions and sentences for the offence of causing death by careless driving while over the limit&#8212;<i>[Interruption.] </i>I have done the maths; the hon. Member for Broxtowe might be able to correct me if she thinks she is more experienced than me. The figure for that offence is nine months. How can that possibly be fair to victims? Also, the maximum sentence for the offence of dangerous driving per se is two years imprisonment, but that offence often causes paralysis; it leaves people in wheelchairs, their lives ruined, yet the starting point is 12 months.</p>
	<p pid="a.692.0/3">There is no evidence that the proposed policy will encourage people to plead guilty even earlier.</p>

	<p pid="a.692.3/1">Last week, the Justice Secretary showed us how out of touch he is with the women of this country, and this afternoon we have had a demonstration of how out of touch he is with communities on the issue of crime. In recent days, the Justice Secretary has said that he does not want to change sentences for serious crime, and he said that again this afternoon. He is playing word games with the public, however, because he knows perfectly well that under his proposals people could spend just one quarter of the sentence given to them by the judge in prison. The safety of our communities is too serious for us to play these word games.</p>
	<p pid="a.692.3/2">No wonder the public lose trust in the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.692.3/3">&#8220;many people feel that sentencing in Britain is dishonest and misleading.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.692.3/4">The Tories said that in their manifesto, and they promised to improve transparency; another broken promise. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40375" name="Nia Griffith">the Member for Llanelli (Nia Griffith)</phrase> said, they promised to redevelop the prison estate and</p>
	<p pid="a.692.3/5">increase capacity. Instead, they are cutting the prison building programme. The one manifesto promise the Justice Secretary has fulfilled is to</p>
	<p pid="a.692.3/6">&#8220;stop talking tough and meting out ever longer prison sentences&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.692.3/7">That promise was in the Liberal Democrats&#8217; manifesto, of course.</p>
	<p pid="a.692.3/8">My hon. Friends the Members for Llanelli and for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart)&#8212;who was an excellent Home Office Minister in the previous Government&#8212;have spoken of their concerns about the way the issue of rape was treated last week. That revealed that the ministerial team does not know the facts and does not know the law.</p>
	<p pid="a.692.3/9">Unfortunately, most of the 1,000 rapes that are committed every week in this country are committed by partners and ex-partners. Also, the law has changed since the Secretary of State was practising at the bar in the last century, and he should know what it now is. Consensual sex between an 18-year-old and a 15-year-old is unlawful, but it is not rape.</p>
	<p pid="a.692.3/10">The Labour Government ended cross-examination by assailants, and they ended questioning on people&#8217;s sexual pasts. The way to win the confidence of women in this country is not to cut the sentence for people convicted of rape; rather, it is to keep the specialist police, maintain local authority support for sexual assault referral centres, and listen to the groups and lawyers working with victims. The Ministry of Justice needs a woman in the team, and the Prime Minister should find one PDQ.</p>
	<p pid="a.692.3/11">Many Members have spoken about the legacy that was left for the current Government. Government Members should remember that Labour cut crime by 43%, and cut reoffending by 15%. As my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40349" name="George Howarth">the Member for Knowsley (Mr Howarth)</phrase> pointed out, the Labour Government understood the role that prison plays, which is why we increased the number of places by 26,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.692.3/12">Everyone wants to cut reoffending and tackle the underlying problems, and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40383" name="Helen Grant">the hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Mrs Grant)</phrase> made an excellent speech on the issues faced by women offenders. The points she made highlight why we followed the recommendations in the Corston report and the Bradley report on prisoners with mental health problems, and why we invested &#163;170 million in literacy and numeracy skills, and set up new workshops in prison.</p>
	<p pid="a.692.3/13">Early guilty pleas can speed up trials and reduce the pressure on victims, but the real reason why the Government are going ahead is to save money, as the Secretary of State made clear. The Government&#8217;s own estimate is that a discount of up to 50% would reduce the number of prison places by 3,500 and save &#163;130 million. The proposal in the Green Paper appears not in the section on victims, but under the heading</p>
	<p pid="a.692.3/14">&#8220;Efficient, effective use of the courts.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.692.3/15">That is the real motivation. Of course cutting the deficit matters, but it is not the only thing that matters, and it is not possible to put a price on justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.692.3/16">What is so radically wrong with the Government&#8217;s proposal to introduce a 50% discount for early guilty pleas is that it undermines the justice of the sentence</p>
	<p pid="a.692.3/17">that is finally served. Many criminals who would have pleaded guilty early anyway will benefit. Can the Minister tell us how many thousands of prisoners fall into that category? The Ministry of Justice estimates in its impact assessment that the average discount will rise from 25% to 34%, and that is totally unjustified.</p>
	<p pid="a.692.3/18">As was pointed out by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40073" name="Alan Beith">the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir Alan Beith)</phrase>, the Chairman of the Select Committee on Justice, Ministers have produced no evidence to suggest that the proposal will affect the number of people pleading guilty early. Indeed, the Sentencing Guidelines Council will say that the strength of prosecuting evidence is the crucial factor, and the Council of Her Majesty&#8217;s Circuit Judges feels that many offenders are</p>
	<p pid="a.692.3/19">&#8220;irrational or dysfunctional and will not face up to the realities until the last possible moment.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.692.3/20">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40531" name="Philip Davies">the hon. Member for Shipley (Philip Davies)</phrase> pointed out, short sentences are known to be ineffective&#8212;that is obviously why the Ministry of Justice wants to increase the number of people on them. Another problem with the proposal is that the reduction is formulaic, so those who have committed the worst offences get the biggest cuts in prison terms&#8212;that is simply not fair. This proposal will apply to terrorists and last week Lord Carlile said:</p>
	<p pid="a.692.3/21">&#8220;The release of every prisoner convicted of a terrorist offence has a national security implication and the sooner they are released the greater the national security implication.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.692.3/22">The overwhelming problem is that the punishment will not fit the crime. My hon. Friends the Members for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Steve McCabe) and for Darlington (Mrs Chapman) pointed out that victims will feel let down and the public&#8217;s confidence will be shattered.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-23a.694.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40089" speakername="Helen Goodman" colnum="694"  time="018:55:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110523/debtext/110523-0003.htm#11052326000622">
	<p pid="a.694.1/1">The hon. Lady should have listened to the debate; we have gone through that argument already.</p>
	<p pid="a.694.1/2">I want to move on to the important issue of the Secretary of State&#8217;s &#8220;rehabilitation revolution&#8221;. That is what he has promised, but the cuts programme he has agreed&#8212;23% over four years, with a loss of 10,000 prison and probation staff&#8212;will make it impossible. He says that he wants to increase the number of hours that prisoners work from 22 to 40, but his own impact assessment says that that will need more up-front capital and ongoing staff costs to supervise prisoners for longer. He has already cut &#163;170 million from prisons, which means that prisoners will be locked up in their cells for longer. We are already seeing cuts to education and restorative justice work with offenders.</p>
	<p pid="a.694.1/3">He says that he wants more community sentences, but effective community supervision is impossible with the huge cuts to the probation trusts. As the Chairman of the Select Committee pointed out, we need to reinvest in community supervision, but this year Nottingham&#8217;s probation trust faces a cut of 7%, and the trusts of Norfolk and Suffolk, Devon and Cornwall, and West Yorkshire face cuts of 7.2%, 7.8% and a staggering 9.8% respectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.694.1/4">The strategy is just not credible, nor are the Ministers. The year began with the prisons Minister standing in front of a burning prison as the third riot of his tenure took place. Last week, he said that &#8220;a moment&#8217;s reflection&#8221; would make it clear that giving half off a sentence would help to protect the public. He has now had a week&#8217;s reflection and we see from the Order Paper that the Government are stubbornly sticking to their policy. So I urge all hon. Members to reject the amendment and vote for the Opposition motion.</p>

	<p pid="a.695.0/1">I am grateful for the chance to have a few minutes to reply to the debate and to present a set of arguments to explain why the Opposition motion is a good example of how not to debate or approach public policy in this area. It was my answer to a question here last Tuesday from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40090" name="Jack Straw">the right hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr Straw)</phrase> that led to the debate last week and, as that has developed and as we have heard this afternoon, there is a growing appreciation and understanding that the simplicity of the Opposition motion cannot do justice to the complexity of the issues and factors we must reconcile. The motion is outside of any proper context and is premature, prejudging proper consideration of our policies as a whole. It is also rather instructive that it has come forward after a prompt from media coverage and the right hon. Gentleman. I would have thought that our policy inheritance from the previous Government would have given today&#8217;s Opposition Front-Bench team pause for thought before they tabled the motion.</p>
	<p pid="a.695.0/2">A real reason for regret is that the Opposition motion indicates that a window might be closing on a unique opportunity for Parliament to show collective leadership in a difficult, complex area that is wide open to misrepresentation. We might be missing an opportunity to engage in a responsible debate and support a process in which policy is agreed on the basis of the evidence for its enduring benefit, not designed to deliver maximum short-term appeal, with evidence arranged to suit. Such support requires an exercise of principle and restraint from all of us.</p>

	<p pid="a.705.1/1">The noise on the Government Benches conveys Members&#8217; desperation about the cuts being made to police officer numbers in their constituencies right across the country. The difference is that we said yes, cuts of about &#163;1 billion would need to be made over the course of the Parliament; their Front-Bench team is making cuts of &#163;2 billion, with the steepest cuts in the first few years. That is why we are seeing 12,000 officers go and front-line services being hit.</p>
	<p pid="a.705.1/2">The storm will not go away. It will keep building. The Prime Minister may think he can make it go away by finally making a speech on crime in the next few weeks&#8212;his first since the Government began&#8212;just to show that he is taking the grip that he clearly thinks the Home Secretary and the Justice Secretary lack. But it is too late for tough rhetoric because communities across the country are already facing a tough reality&#8212;12,000 police officers to go.</p>
	<p pid="a.705.1/3">How can the Government have got so out of touch on law on order? Many people have claimed that the Prime Minister just doesn&#8217;t get it&#8212;that he is out of touch and does not understand the fear of crime in communities across the country. It is true that crime is lower in Witney than in Wakefield, but one would have thought that the Prime Minister had plenty of experience of antisocial behaviour in his street. Surely the Defence Secretary must be the first candidate for an ASBO after throwing brickbats at the International Development Secretary and the Chancellor. The Business Secretary may need an injunction for throwing brickbats at himself.</p>
	<p pid="a.705.1/4">The Justice Secretary has clearly been causing carnage wandering unmonitored through the TV studios. The Prime Minister should tag him at least, although Downing street probably thinks he is rather better locked up. The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs should serve a community sentence, replanting trees, and the Deputy Prime Minister is clearly regarded now as a nuisance neighbour. The Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change is the only one the Government can count on to be supportive&#8212;he is only person rather pleased to see the cuts to the traffic cops. The entire Cabinet is in desperate need of a family intervention project. What a shame the Government have cut those!</p>
	<p pid="a.705.1/5">Time and again we have warned in the House of the serious consequences of cutting 12,000 officers. Let us look at the evidence: domestic violence units have been cut in Hampshire, officers in sexual offences teams forced out in London, traffic cops cut in Manchester, fire arms officers cut in Nottingham, CCTV officers cut in Merseyside, neighbourhood police cut in Birmingham and&#8212;get this&#8212;in Kent the police have told us that surveillance officers have been called off their targets after six-hour shifts because of overtime cuts. I presume that as part of the big society the Home Secretary has kindly asked criminals to keep their misdemeanours to office hours.</p>

	<p pid="a.706.4/1">It is right to keep working hard to cut bureaucracy, but the hon. Gentleman is out of touch with the reality of what is happening across the country. In west Yorkshire, for example, the police are now having to go back to their offices between incidents to deal with the bureaucracy themselves because of the scale of the cuts, whereas previously they could ring in with the details of an offence or incident that they had attended. In the west midlands and Warwickshire, time and again police officers are having to do more paperwork and bureaucracy because of the scale of the Government&#8217;s cuts.</p>
	<p pid="a.706.4/2">It is not just the cuts that are causing the problems: the Government are also making it harder for the police and communities to fight crime. As a result of the DNA restrictions, the police estimate that there are 1,000 fewer criminal matches every year, including for serious offenders. It means not holding DNA at all in up to three quarters of rape cases, where charges are ultimately not brought, and we know the difficulties in rape cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.706.4/3">On CCTV, the new code of practice means a bubble wrap of bureaucracy, with more checks and balances on a single camera than the Government are introducing for police and crime commissioners, yet the Home Secretary knows the benefits that CCTV can bring. They have just installed CCTV at Twyford train station in her constituency. Did she complain then that they had not done an impact assessment on the environment, privacy or disproportionality or introduce safeguards, as her code of practice required? No. She congratulated the station manager, saying that people needed the</p>
	<p pid="a.706.4/4">&#8220;added reassurance that they can travel in safety&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.706.4/5">Too right they do, and they do not want too much bureaucracy to prevent them getting the reassurance they need.</p>

	<p pid="a.707.1/1">My hon. Friend is right.

	<p pid="a.707.2/1">The right hon. Lady may have heard the Justice Secretary say in the previous debate how important it was from the Government&#8217;s perspective to prevent people having to be witnesses and give evidence in court and how distressing that was.

	<p pid="a.707.3/1">The hon. Gentleman is right, and I know that he has spent considerable time looking at the issue of DNA. When the police analysed the offences in 2008-09&#8212;just one year&#8217;s worth of offences&#8212;they found that there were 79 matches for very serious crimes, including murder, manslaughter and rape, that they would not have got had it not been for the DNA database being in place. The concern is about not holding DNA for people who are not charged, even though they might have been suspected of a very serious offence and where the reason for not charging may not be that they are now thought to be innocent, but simply that there are difficulties, as, perhaps in a rape case&#8212;we know it is sometimes difficult to take such a case through the criminal justice system.</p>
	<p pid="a.707.3/2">The Government are out of touch, with their plans to end antisocial behaviour orders. The Home Secretary has said that she wants to end ASBOs because she is worried that they are being breached, but what is her answer? Her answer is to replace them with a much weaker injunction, with greater delays, that offenders can breach as many times as they like. She is removing the criminal enforcement for serious breaches of ASBOs and removing interim ASBOs altogether, making it much harder for communities, police and local authorities</p>
	<p pid="a.707.3/3">to get urgent action when serious cases arise. No matter how many times an offender breaches the new crime prevention injunctions or ignores the warnings of the police, they will still not get a criminal penalty. They are not so much a badge of honour as a novelty wrist band. How does that help communities that want to see antisocial behaviour brought down?</p>
	<p pid="a.707.3/4">The area that I worry about most is child protection. The Home Secretary has now been advised that there are serious loopholes in her plans by the Children&#8217;s Commissioner, the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, the Children&#8217;s Society, Action for Children, the Scout Association, the Football Association, the Lawn Tennis Association and countless other national sporting bodies. Her plans still mean that someone could be barred from working with children and yet still get part-time or voluntary work in a school or children&#8217;s sports club and the organisation would not even be told that they had been barred. She really must stop and think again on this or she will be putting children at risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.707.3/5">Time and again the Home Secretary is undermining the powers of the police and the authorities to fight crime. Time and again she is telling them to fight with one hand behind their backs. Worrying signs are already emerging. In Yorkshire, the police are saying that their figures show that crime has gone up this year. In the west midlands it is the same. Over the 13 years of the Labour Government, crime fell by 40%. The risk of being a victim of crime is now at its lowest since the British crime survey began and there is rising confidence in the police, but people want crime to keep falling. She is putting that at risk.</p>

	<p pid="a.711.2/1">My hon. Friend makes an important point about the behaviour of the Opposition today.</p>
	<p pid="a.711.2/2">On the proposal about the royal commission, the cuts we have to make and the timetable within which we have to make them means that we have to make decisions now. However, we are not just making those decisions</p>
	<p pid="a.711.2/3">as a Government. I set up the independent review into police pay, terms and conditions under Tom Winsor, who has produced his first report. The proposals from that report are now going through the Police Negotiating Board, and decisions will be taken by the Government once those proper processes have been gone through. At the beginning of next year, he will report on the second part of his review. I felt that it was important for the police that we ensured that an independent reviewer looked at these issues who could fully to take into account the impact of all the changes.</p>
	<p pid="a.711.2/4">I remind any hon. Members who are considering the royal commission proposal that in its report last summer HMIC said, in very stark terms, that there is no time for a royal commission because of the nature of the decisions that have to be taken and the speed at which they have to be taken.</p>

	<p pid="a.715.3/1">My hon. Friend makes a valid and important point about the attitude of the previous Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.715.3/2">Our reforms are based on the simple premise that the police must be accountable not to civil servants in Whitehall, but to the communities that they serve. That is exactly what directly elected police and crime commissioners will achieve. The legislation for police and crime commissioners has passed through this House and has entered Committee stage in the other place. We</p>
	<p pid="a.715.3/3">will seek to overturn the recent Lords amendment when the Bill returns to this House. Unlike the existing invisible and ineffective police authorities, the commissioner will be somebody people have heard of, somebody they have voted for, somebody they can hold to account, and somebody they can vote out if they do not help the police to cut crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.715.3/4">We now come to the Opposition&#8217;s fourth error. It is complete and utter nonsense to suggest there will be no checks and balances on the powers of police and crime commissioners. We have specifically legislated for strong checks and balances. A police and crime panel will scrutinise the police and crime commissioner. The panel will have several key powers, including the power of veto over the police and crime commissioner&#8217;s proposed local precept and over the candidate they propose for chief constable. The panel will also make recommendations on local police and crime plans, and will scrutinise the commissioner&#8217;s annual report. It will have the power to ask the commissioner to provide information and to sit before it to answer questions. It will also be able to call on Her Majesty&#8217;s inspectorate of constabulary for professional judgment over the police and crime commissioner&#8217;s proposed decision to dismiss a chief constable.</p>
	<p pid="a.715.3/5">We have published a draft protocol setting out the relationship between police and crime commissioners and chief constables. The protocol was agreed with the Association of Chief Police Officers, the Association of Police Authorities, the Association of Police Authority Chief Executives, the Met and the Metropolitan Police Authority. A copy has been placed in both House Libraries and copies are available on the Home Office website. The protocol makes it clear that commissioners will not manage police forces, and that they will not be permitted to interfere in the day-to-day work of police officers. The duty and responsibility of managing a police force will fall squarely on the shoulders of the chief constable, as it always has.</p>
	<p pid="a.715.3/6">We will publish a strategic policing requirement to ensure that commissioners deliver their national policing responsibilities, as well as their local responsibilities. A strengthened HMIC will monitor forces and escalate serious concerns about force performance to Ministers. Finally, the Home Secretary will retain powers to direct police and crime commissioners and chief constables to take action in extreme circumstances, if they are failing to carry out their functions.</p>
	<p pid="a.715.3/7">The Opposition are simply wrong to say that there will be no checks and balances on police and crime commissioners. There will be extensive checks and balances&#8212;the Opposition just choose to ignore them. Of course, unlike the current invisible and unaccountable police authorities, police and crime commissioners will face the strongest and most powerful check and balance there is: the ballot box. This should be a concept with which the Labour party is familiar: if they fail, they get booted out of office.</p>
	<p pid="a.715.3/8">I will turn to police powers. The police national DNA database, which was established in 1995, has clearly led to a great many criminals being convicted who otherwise would not have been caught. However, in a democracy, there must be limits to any such form of police power. Storing the DNA and fingerprints of more than a million innocent people indefinitely only undermines public trust in policing. We will take innocent people off</p>
	<p pid="a.715.3/9">the DNA database and put guilty people on. While the previous Government were busy stockpiling the DNA of the innocent, they did not bother to take the DNA of the guilty. In March, we gave the police new powers to take DNA from convicted criminals who are now in the community.</p>
	<p pid="a.715.3/10">Rather than engaging in political posturing, we are making the right reforms for the right reasons. Our proposals will ensure that there is fairness for innocent people by removing the majority of them from the database. By increasing the number of convicted individuals on the database, we will ensure that those who have broken the law can be traced if they reoffend. In all cases, the DNA profile and fingerprints of any person arrested for a recordable offence will be subjected to a speculative search against the national databases. That means that those who have committed crimes in the past and have left their DNA or fingerprints at the scene will not escape justice. The rules will give the police the tools that they need, without putting the DNA of millions of innocent people on the database.</p>
	<p pid="a.715.3/11">Like DNA, it is clear that CCTV can act as a deterrent to criminals, can help to convict the guilty, and is warmly welcomed by many communities. The Government wholeheartedly support the use of CCTV and DNA to fight crime. However, it is clearly not right that surveillance cameras are being used without proper safeguards. When or where to use CCTV are properly decisions for local areas. It is essential that such measures command public support and confidence. Our proposals for a code of practice will help to achieve just that. If the Opposition disagree, as was clear from the speech by the right hon. Member for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford, perhaps they should cast their minds back to the controversy over the use of CCTV cameras in Birmingham in the last year. British policing relies on consent. If that is lost, we all suffer. Sadly, the Opposition do not seem to understand that.</p>

	<p pid="a.722.0/1">May I begin, as I often do, by declaring an interest as a special constable with the British Transport police? A few people might wonder why I do that. When I was on the Home Affairs Committee, I justified it by saying that I have always felt deeply about policing&#8212;that is the reality. That is one of things that brought me into politics. I felt even more deeply about the matter when I became the victim of a burglary myself. I can tell the Home Secretary the effect it can have on a family, particularly when one of the partners is often away from home and young children are involved, to know that someone has been walking around their house with a knife in their hand</p>
	<p pid="a.722.0/2">In many ways, I am sorry to have to make this speech&#8212;it is not even a very well-prepared one&#8212;but I have to tell the Home Secretary that I am deeply concerned about some of the directions we are taking. I have a view that might be unfashionable, Home Secretary, which is that burglars, rapists, murderers, people who commit acts of violence of any sought and people who sell drugs&#8212;there is a family in Monmouthshire selling ketamine to young children in school&#8212;need to be taken off the streets and sent to prison. They should not be released early from their prison sentences, and they do not deserve 50% off their sentences, which is why for the first time ever, I think, I was unable to follow the Home Secretary into the Lobby earlier tonight. I regret that very much. But, Home Secretary, I will not be part of any Government who want to let people out of prison. I do not think the Labour party did a good job on law and order, but when I hear colleagues say that it banged up more people than we will, I start to question what I am doing here.</p>
	<p pid="a.722.0/3">Home Secretary, I will find it much easier to follow you into the Lobby tonight, because the Opposition have tabled a motion based on money, and we all know that, frankly, you are in a no-win situation. Labour Members did what they always do&#8212;they taxed and spent, they borrowed and they spent, they printed money and left us all with a &#163;1 trillion debt.</p>

	<p pid="a.725.2/1">I am talking about the situation that we have now, with the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s Government in power. I had thousands of petitions presented to me during the by-election specifically on the subject of cuts in police numbers. I must also remind him that the Deputy Prime Minister promised to increase police numbers.</p>
	<p pid="a.725.2/2">The effects of the cuts have already been noted by the Conservative chair of the Association of Police Authorities, who said that they would ultimately put at risk progress in reducing crime. In my constituency, the Oldham division of the Greater Manchester police has expressed concern not only about the direct effects of the cuts on police spending but about the cuts to the local authority budget and the abolition of area-based grants, all of which will have significant effects. The partnership working between the police, the local authority and the voluntary sector has had immense benefits for crime prevention and community safety&#8212;for example, in target-hardening measures such as alley-gating. There is strong evidence that such measures have a significant benefit for vulnerable properties. Other measures that have brought benefits include youth programmes and offender management.</p>
	<p pid="a.725.2/3">I have been contacted by nearly 50 local police officers living in my constituency. Not only are they fearful for their jobs but the recent Winsor review and Hutton report will have significant implications for their terms and conditions and for their pensions. Sergeant David Donlan asked me:</p>
	<p pid="a.725.2/4">&#8220;How many people have to go to work in body armour, routinely putting their lives at risk to protect our communities, and yet have imposed on them where they can live, who they can associate with or even marry? We can&#8217;t join a union, let alone strike.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.725.2/5">I am committed to working closely with the police on reform, but I think that the Government have mishandled this review process and treated police officers poorly. The Home Secretary pre-empted the final report and has attempted to paint the police as inefficient and not interested in reform. I urge her to reconsider the question of the royal commission. The discussions that I have had with local police officers make it clear that they want to see modernisation, but it must be fair. I know that we will be debating pensions soon, but the point for this debate is that, in addition to major changes in terms and conditions and cuts to the work force, the changes to their pensions are yet another hit for the police.</p>
	<p pid="a.725.2/6">My final point concerns the long-term consequences of the Government&#8217;s cuts. In addition to the short and medium-term impacts on crime, I am worried about the long-term effects that these ideologically driven cuts will have on the social fabric of our society. Last week, we heard how pay disparities between the UK&#8217;s highest and lowest paid workers were taking us back to Victorian times. There is strong evidence that the increase in socio-economic inequalities will not only result in widening differences in life expectancy between the rich and poor but also be associated with higher levels of crime and disaffection. The trust that underpins community cohesion and positive relationships in a multicultural society is once again being eroded by a Tory Government who are determined to drive their disastrous cuts through.</p>

	<p pid="a.726.0/1">I have been a Member of the House since 1997, and I still naively expect this Chamber to be a place of rational debate. However, there has certainly been no evidence of that from the Labour Front-Bench contributions today, either during the previous debate on sentencing or during this one on policing. There is no recognition of their share of the responsibility for the significant cuts that the coalition is having to make. They are tougher than we had expected because the finances we inherited were deteriorating faster and the international climate was tougher for countries that were not tackling their deficits.</p>
	<p pid="a.726.0/2">There is no willingness from Labour to demonstrate how the &#163;7 of savings it was going to make, as opposed to the &#163;8 that the coalition is having to make, would safeguard police numbers. Indeed, Labour Members are not even listening to their own party leader, who said in his speech to the Progress conference on <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-21">21 May</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.726.0/3">&#8220;There will be those who say it is enough for Labour to hunker down&#8230; I hear it quite a lot: let&#8217;s be a louder&#8230; Opposition&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="a.726.0/4">but he then went on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.726.0/5">&#8220;But to think that it is enough is to fail to understand the depth of the loss of trust in us and the scale of change required to win it back. We must recognise where we didn&#8217;t get things right&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.726.0/6">So their leader is asking Labour Members to adopt a more honest and considered approach, but they do not listen to their leader, as we found out during the AV campaign when he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m right behind it&#8221; and half of them walked off in the opposite direction.</p>
	<p pid="a.726.0/7">It was the Opposition&#8217;s choice not to have a debate about what is achievable from an efficiency savings point of view and what is achievable in terms of police numbers. We heard in an intervention that police numbers in Staffordshire had been maintained.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-23a.728.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40147" speakername="Alun Michael" colnum="728"  time="020:57:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110523/debtext/110523-0003.htm#11052336000158">
	<p pid="a.728.5/1">Further issues arise from cuts which are too deep and too sudden, and, in the case of the police, made even more painful by being front-ended. We also face an upheaval as the Government press on with their plan to establish police and crime commissioners for each force in England and Wales&#8212;apart from that in London, which strikes me as an odd omission.</p>
	<p pid="a.728.5/2">If the Government are truly confident that theirs is the right approach, they would have been well advised to pilot the idea, because the devil will be in the detail of relationships. The wholesale implementation of the Government&#8217;s proposals in 41 forces at a time of massive cuts, wholesale retirements and the serious demoralisation that arises from pension changes can only be described as truly courageous.</p>
	<p pid="a.728.5/3">I do not want to become bogged down in numbers, but newer Government Members may be unaware of the disastrous record of the last Conservative Government and the way in which the ground was recovered during the subsequent years of Labour administration. It is vital that the Government and the commissioners&#8212;if the other place allows their introduction&#8212;fully understand the importance of a partnership approach to cutting crime. When Robert Peel set up the first police force, he stated clearly that cutting crime and preventing offending was the key role of the police. I am pleased to acknowledge that both the Minister for Policing and Criminal Justice and the Home Secretary underlined those words when they appeared before the Home Affairs Committee. That belief, however, needs to be supported in practice and in substance, through partnerships linked to a clear and objective analysis of why, when and where crime happens.</p>
	<p pid="a.728.5/4">I am also pleased that the crime reduction partnerships which I introduced in the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 are to continue, with some new titles and rebranding. That is fine: refreshing the model is an entirely appropriate move by Ministers in a new Government. However, this Government need to make sure that they build on the cuts in crime achieved under the last Labour Government and squeeze out the further gains in crime reduction that are there to be made. That requires a clinical approach and an engineering approach to crime. My favourite example in that regard is the violence reduction strategy in Cardiff, led, as it happens, by a medic&#8212;Professor Jonathan Shepherd&#8212;which has resulted in a cut of now well over 40% in the number of victims, as measured not by arrests or reports to the police but by the reduction in the number of people needing treatment at an accident and emergency unit following a violent incident. Such results do not happen by accident. Intelligent analysis, partnership and ambition are what drove that improvement, and we need that approach everywhere. The result is savings to courts, to prisons and to the NHS. There are therefore benefits for all those who are part of a partnership approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.728.5/5">My second example relates to youth crime. The numbers in residential detention have come down as the youth offending teams have focused on the challenge of cutting youth crime. Police are involved in what is an inter-agency approach. Again, I have no objection to that approach being renewed and refreshed, but I urge Ministers not to abandon a strategy that is working. We need police engagement in the work of reducing youth crime, rather than having them always chasing after the offenders.</p>
	<p pid="a.728.5/6">My third example is about police community support officers. I commend the Welsh Assembly Government who have just come to office for putting in place additional PCSOs to support the work of the police in Wales. That is essential for truly effective policing because we must connect with local communities if we are to be successful.</p>
	<p pid="a.728.5/7">My final example is to do with internet-related crime. This is a growth area, but the police will never have the resources to keep on chasing around the whole of the internet. The work of the Internet Watch Foundation and the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre show what can be done. They have succeeded in tackling child abuse over the last few years. It is important that business too is linked in and works in partnership on internet-related crime. I commend to Ministers the example of e-Crime Wales, driven by a partnership between the Welsh Assembly Government and the police in Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.728.5/8">We need the police to do all the heavy lifting of detective work, making arrests, being visible, engaging the public and policing our town and city centres. The Minister is well aware of the challenges that our success in building up Cardiff as a real capital has presented to the police in terms of policing successive activities, but as the Justice Committee report on justice reinvestment showed, most of the services and resources that make a difference in cutting crime, and therefore in protecting victims, are outside the criminal justice system. Partnership is therefore not just an extra; it is not an option that can be dropped if time is short and the pressure is on. It is crucial and central to enabling the police to be successful in their work, and I hope Ministers will encourage the continuation and growth of partnership working.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-23a.730.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40531" speakername="Philip Davies" colnum="730"  time="021:03:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110523/debtext/110523-0004.htm#11052336000159">
	<p pid="a.730.0/1">I want to talk predominantly about closed circuit television and DNA, because I still feel that, despite the Home Secretary&#8217;s best efforts, the Government are going in the wrong direction on these issues. I want to make it clear that I am not talking about what I believe to be the misuse of CCTV, such as for local authorities to snoop on what people put in their bins; I am talking about the use of CCTV for the detection of crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.730.0/2">A Scotland Yard study of the effectiveness of surveillance cameras revealed that almost every Scotland Yard murder inquiry uses their footage as evidence. In 90 murder cases over a one-year period, CCTV was used in 86 investigations. Officers said it helped to solve 65 cases by capturing the murder itself on film, or tracking the movements of the suspects before or after an attack. The recent case in my constituency of the &#8220;crossbow cannibal&#8221;, who was convicted of murdering three prostitutes and dumping their bodies in the river, provides a good example, as he was caught only because there was CCTV in the block of flats where he was committing his crimes.</p>
	<p pid="a.730.0/3">CCTV evidence is not only a valuable tool for the police. It is invaluable in courts on two levels: to convict the perpetrators of crimes, and to acquit those who have not committed a crime. CCTV footage provides conclusive and unbiased evidence, devoid of anyone&#8217;s spin or recollection bias, which not only saves courts time and money, but prevents witnesses from having to go through the often stressful and unpleasant ordeal of giving evidence in court. Equally, CCTV can prove that someone is being wrongly accused of committing a crime, as was the case with Edmond Taylor. His conviction for dangerous driving was quashed on appeal when CCTV footage showed that a white man had actually committed the offence&#8212;Mr Taylor is black.</p>
	<p pid="a.730.0/4">Another useful tool that we should be promoting is automatic number plate recognition. It was through the use of ANPR, and that alone, that PC Sharon Beshenivsky&#8217;s killers were caught. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-18">18 November 2005</phrase>, Sharon Beshenivsky was shot and killed during a robbery in Bradford. The CCTV network was linked into an ANPR system and was able to identify the getaway car and track its movements, leading to the arrest of six suspects. The chief superintendant of West Yorkshire police called the ANPR system a</p>
	<p pid="a.730.0/5">&#8220;revolutionary tool in detecting crime.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.730.0/6">When a 2005 Home Office report on public attitudes towards CCTV asked what people thought of the statement &#8220;Overall the advantages of CCTV outweigh the disadvantages&#8221;, 82% of those surveyed either agreed or strongly agreed.</p>
	<p pid="a.730.0/7">People use &#8220;civil liberties&#8221; as an argument to support the case for reducing such technology. What I fail to understand is how footage of someone taken by CCTV cameras on a public street in the public domain invades their privacy or civil liberties. If someone has chosen to walk down the street, people can see them doing it whether they are recording it on a phone, observing what they are doing or watching it through a CCTV camera. Those actions are clearly not private.</p>
	<p pid="a.730.0/8">These civil liberties arguments seem to be used against the DNA database too. I believe in real freedoms, and the fact that someone&#8217;s DNA is on a database does not prevent that person from going about their daily lawful business and it does not impinge on their freedoms in any way whatsoever. During the application for judicial review of the retention of DNA in the divisional court, the now Lord Justice Leveson stated that</p>
	<p pid="a.730.0/9">&#8220;the material stored says nothing about the physical makeup, characteristics or life of the person to whom they belong.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.730.0/10">These civil liberties arguments about DNA and CCTV are bogus.</p>
	<p pid="a.730.0/11">As a result of the Government&#8217;s proposals, murderers such as Ronald Castree would be free to roam the streets and potentially kill again. Castree stabbed 11-year-old Lesley Molseed in 1975 when she was on the way to the shop to buy bread for her mother. Stefan Kiszko was wrongly convicted and was jailed for 16 years for the murder until 2005 when Castree&#8217;s DNA was taken after he was arrested but not charged over another sexual attack.</p>
	<p pid="a.730.0/12">It is a fact that many violent criminals have been jailed only because their DNA was taken when they committed a minor offence. These criminals include Dennis Fitzgerald, who was sentenced to eight years&#8217; imprisonment for the rape of a woman in November 1987, and Nasser Mohammed who was jailed in 2008 for raping a woman in 2002 after his DNA was taken when he was picked up for a minor offence. Often, a DNA match is the only thing that finally brings people to justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.730.0/13">Figures from the National Policing Improvement Agency state that in 2008-09, 32,209 crimes were detected in which a DNA match was available or played a part, and the latest annual report on the national DNA database concluded that six in 10 crime scene profiles loaded up to the database were matched to a subject profile. In addition, 147,852 crime scene sample profiles could be solved if we had a national DNA database&#8212;these are instances where a sample has been taken at the crime scene but there is, as yet, no match.</p>
	<p pid="a.730.0/14">The DNA database can also be used to acquit the innocent. The very first murder conviction using DNA evidence, in 1988, proved the innocence of a suspect. Richard Buckland was suspected of separately assaulting and murdering two schoolgirls in 1983 and 1986, but when his DNA sample was compared with DNA found on the bodies of the two victims it proved that he was not the killer. Colin Pitchfork was later arrested, having been one of the villagers who had their DNA taken and a match was found.</p>
	<p pid="a.730.0/15">Unless the Government change their stance on DNA and CCTV, they will be doing a huge disservice to people in this country. Their approach will lead to more unnecessary victims of crime and will further tarnish our reputation in the field of law and order.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-23a.734.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40081" speakername="Jack Dromey" colnum="734"  time="021:20:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110523/debtext/110523-0004.htm#11052336000164">
	<p pid="a.734.0/1">The Home Secretary was good enough to meet six police officers from the west midlands&#8212;six outstanding officers whom I know well. They included Tim Kennedy, described</p>
	<p pid="a.734.0/2">by one of his colleagues as one of the most brilliant forensic detectives anywhere in Britain, with an outstanding track record of detection; Sergeant Dave Hewitt, an outstanding community police sergeant, with a team of police officers with a first-class track record of keeping their community safe; and Detective Constable Tony Fisher, a man who specialises in the detection of serious crime, ranging from detecting the individual who was robbing pensioners at knifepoint at cash points and putting him away for 13 years, to the action that he took to track down somebody who was responsible for leading a gang carrying out robberies with a machete, putting him away for 17 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.734.0/3">There was also Martin Heard, a police constable and an outstanding community police officer in Wolverhampton. As his community said on ITV only last week, &#8220;He was always there for us when we needed him. Now there&#8217;s no one there in his place.&#8221; He was forced out as one of the A19 officers. To add insult to injury, he then received a letter asking, &#8220;Do you want to come back as an unpaid special constable?&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.734.0/4">Even in some of the most sensitive areas of policing, we are seeing cuts. In the west midlands 16 counter-terrorism officers are being forced out under regulation A19&#8212;nine constables, three sergeants, two inspectors and a superintendent. This is madness. It is the abrogation by Government of their first duty, which is to ensure the safety and security of our communities, and it is utterly indefensible, yet the Government seek to mount two defences.</p>
	<p pid="a.734.0/5">The first defence is the &#8220;Not me, guv&#8221; defence that blames the police. The Home Secretary cuts the police, then blames the police for the cuts, in circumstances where, by the scale and speed of the cuts that she has offered up to the Chancellor, she leaves chief constables in an impossible position. The second defence is the assertion that there are only 11% of police on the front line at any one time. That simplistic nonsense fails to understand the nature of modern policing.</p>
	<p pid="a.734.0/6">Inspector Mark Stokes, one of the police officers whom the Home Secretary met, is an expert in designing out crime. At the 4 Towers estate, crime fell by 98% as a consequence of his work on the front line, but also in the middle office. Typically, the great bulk of the work to detect individuals guilty of domestic violence is done by way of a multi-agency approach, the multi-agency risk assessment conference, not on the front line, and it is devastatingly effective in protecting women against assault.</p>
	<p pid="a.734.0/7">Offender managers work through the multi-agency public protection arrangements, managing offenders on the basis of risk&#8212;sex offenders, for example, such as the case in the west midlands of an individual who had served 28 months in prison because he had assaulted young children. He came out, applied to become a referee, became a referee, but was detected as a consequence of detailed work not on the front line, but intelligence work that discovered what was happening, moved against him and raised the matter with the Football Association, leading to a sex offender order and that individual no longer having any access to young children. I could go on. So much of the work of intelligence and surveillance officers, for example, is not done on the front line, but it is absolutely key to successful policing.</p>
	<p pid="a.734.0/8">What we are seeing is a devastating reversal of the progress made over the past 13 years. What we saw over those years was on the one hand our police learning the</p>
	<p pid="a.734.0/9">painful lessons from the mistakes of history, and on the other hand massive investment by a Labour Government, leading to 17,000 more police officers, 16,000 police community support officers, a 43% fall in crime and a model of community policing that is held in high regard worldwide and valued by our communities. Now in the west midlands we are seeing crime rising: 2,200 more vehicle crimes, 2,500 more burglaries and robbery up by 25%.</p>
	<p pid="a.734.0/10">In conclusion, the Home Secretary spoke earlier about policing by consent, and I agree with her, but there is no consent in my constituency for what she is doing. There is dismay because no politician now on the Government Benches went to the people last May and said, &#8220;Vote for me and I will cut the police.&#8221; There is dismay because 2,400 will go from the West Midlands police service, and because those brave men and women with 30 years&#8217; service, some of them 48 or 49 years old, are being forced out just when the community needs them most. The Home Secretary must realise that the Government have got it wrong and that they have to think again.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-23a.736.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40105" speakername="Tobias Ellwood" colnum="736"  time="021:27:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110523/debtext/110523-0004.htm#11052336000165">
	<p pid="a.736.0/1">This has been an illuminating and important debate for understanding the policy differences between the coalition Government and the Labour party. I would like to make a few observations, but first I will do as other Members have done and pay tribute to the work of the police, both nationally and in my constituency. They serve our communities well and occasionally put themselves in harm&#8217;s way, and we must never forget the demanding environment in which they work. That said, reform is long overdue.</p>
	<p pid="a.736.0/2">I am pleased that the coalition Government are finally grasping the nettle and looking at restructuring, saving police officers&#8217; time, simplifying how crime is recorded and freeing officers to focus on cutting crime. That is in contrast to Labour&#8217;s approach, which can be summarised as shifting power away from communities and back to Whitehall, introducing too many target-based systems and taking officers away from the front line. I listened carefully to the speech made by the shadow Home Secretary, for whom I have a lot of respect, and read the speech she gave to the Police Federation, but I still see no evidence&#8212;perhaps it is too early at this time&#8212;of any concrete ideas for reform.</p>
	<p pid="a.736.0/3">On the subject of the Police Federation, I would like to digress briefly and mention the reception given to the Home Secretary last week, which I thought&#8212;I choose my words carefully&#8212;was unedifying, unfortunate and unnecessary. We are in difficult times and whichever party was in power would have to make some tough decisions. Communication is very important, and we must respect the appointment. There are consequence of showing disrespect when a Secretary of State comes to speak to a federation, whether it relates to education, health or the police. I think that it is important that that relationship is kept strong and that we do not get to the situation, as we see with the Health Secretary, where they decide no longer to speak to the full federation, but to smaller groups instead. I just want to put those points on the record.</p>
	<p pid="a.736.0/4">I have a couple of observations to make on the speech itself. I have made the point about Criminal Records Bureau checks. I am fortunate to come from a</p>
	<p pid="a.736.0/5">family that is full of teachers, who feed me information about their problems and frustrations when trying to organise school events, take trips and provide the children with a bit of exposure beyond the school itself. Their frustration is the result of the red tape that they have to go through and the amount of paperwork required when organising those trips. I gave the example of one teacher in one school requiring a separate set of checks simply because her child went to another school where she wanted to drive a minibus. I am glad to hear that the coalition Government are going to address that issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.736.0/6">Another aspect is antisocial behaviour, and I intervened on that point, but the Opposition did not make it clear whether they will move away from ASBOs or are still proud of what is considered a badge of honour. It is clear that among certain age groups three quarters of ASBOs are broken. They are breached, they do not work and we need a different form of reform which looks into the deep-rooted reasons why such ASBOs are broken.</p>
	<p pid="a.736.0/7">There is also the aspect of late-night drinking. It is fair to say that Bournemouth has a vibrant nightlife, as do most towns nowadays, but one issue that the Home Secretary raised was the importance of the visibility of policing. The visibility of policing in Bournemouth has been tested, because of late-night drinking&#8212;the 24-hour drinking culture that the previous Government introduced. It has placed huge pressure on the police. They are no longer overstretched from 10 o&#8217;clock at night until 1 or 2 in the morning; they have to go until 3, 4, 5 o&#8217;clock in the morning in order to police the streets, because that is when the antisocial behaviour really kicks in.</p>
	<p pid="a.736.0/8">Then, there is the amount of red tape affecting our police officers. In 2009-10, more than 52 guidance documents came from the Home Office, each one averaging 100 pages&#8212;far too much interference from Whitehall. That needs to change. That is why only 15% of any police officer&#8217;s time seems to be spent on the front line. Instead, they are pulled away to do the paperwork that the previous Government promised to tackle.</p>
	<p pid="a.736.0/9">This has been a helpful debate. I am pleased to see that after 13 years we are starting to tackle some of the difficult decisions that face our police forces and our country. We need to reform the police, to reduce the red tape that exists among our forces and finally to grasp the difficult nettle of pay and conditions. I congratulate my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary on taking on those issues&#8212;issues that were sadly ducked during 13 years of Labour.</p>

	<p pid="a.737.0/1">The thin blue line on the Government Benches is pretty thin for fairly obvious reasons: they do not have a decent alibi for making these savage and unnecessary cuts. The alibi that the Home Secretary feebly provides is that it is all the deficit and all Labour&#8217;s fault, but we all know that at least two thirds of that deficit was created by the bankers.</p>
	<p pid="a.737.0/2">The British taxpayer has been robbed by the bankers, and in reality the deficit was the price paid to avoid a depression. If the Labour party and my right hon.</p>
	<p pid="a.737.0/3">Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40348" name="Gordon Brown">the Member for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (Mr Brown)</phrase> had not intervened, we would have been on our knees, and that investment in the banks will be paid back many times over, because the share prices will go up. Admittedly, one third of the deficit was excess investment over income to grow our economy, but there are no apologies for that.</p>
	<p pid="a.737.0/4">Given that there is a deficit that the international financial community created, what should be done about it? Should we go down the Home Secretary&#8217;s path and clear the deficit in just four years, or should we halve it in four years? The other question is, should we get rid of the deficit in four years just through cuts to public services and benefits, or should we use three mechanisms: first, economic growth, such as notably the Germans and the Americans are using; secondly, make the bankers pay their fair share; and thirdly, yes, make manageable savings over time?</p>
	<p pid="a.737.0/5">In the case under discussion, that would mean 12% cuts instead of 20%, the difference between front-line cuts and no front-line cuts. As I said in an intervention, the Government&#8217;s policy is a false economy, because the extra 8 percentage points, which will go purely on man and womanpower, will increase crime and the public will bear the cost in property or in damage to people. There is a clear choice, and the Government&#8217;s policy is the wrong choice.</p>
	<p pid="a.737.0/6">We have seen it all before. Under the Tories last time, crime doubled; under Labour, crime went down 40%. Not only are we seeing the means of tackling crime reduced by cuts in police, DNA services, CCTV and ASBOs, by making sentences easier and by giving the wrong signals to rapists; we are increasing demand by cutting education, cutting jobs and increasing drug-taking essentially&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> The Home Secretary seems bemused, but in reality if there is less education and fewer police, more children will go on to take drugs. That is certainly the testimony that I have heard from the police. The basic economics of the situation are completely absurd.</p>
	<p pid="a.737.0/7">On top of that, we have this structural change costing &#163;200 million&#8212;the introduction of elected commissioners, whose incentive will be to go for votes in middle-class, low-crime, high-voting areas. They will go along and say, &#8220;Yes, we&#8217;ll have some more community policing down here in this middle-class area&#8221;, but they will not do that where there are no votes and higher crime. There will therefore be a direct contradiction between the motivation of the elected commissioner and the operational chief constable who is supposed to be independent. The whole thing is absolutely farcical. What we need, clearly, is a pause. We have seen a number of pauses from this Government, including on the NHS and the woodland fiasco, and it is time to push the pause button again and do a complete reversal. In a nutshell, these changes are unnecessary, unfair and counterproductive.</p>
	<p pid="a.737.0/8">Finally, I want to put in a good word for the Swansea police, particularly Chief Superintendent Mark Mathias. They are doing an absolutely fantastic job. For example, they are meeting up with retail traders to talk about the relationship between antisocial behaviour and economic growth and linking up with communities. However, they are not helped by the fact that one hand is being tied behind their backs and they are not given the support that they require.</p>
	<p pid="a.737.0/9">The view of the police, which is reflected among the public, was shown by the complete silence that met the Home Secretary when she spoke to them. If she does not have the confidence of the police, how can she hope to succeed? These polices do not make sense economically, socially or in terms of crime, and I urge her to think again.</p>

	<p pid="a.741.4/1">We have had a typical debate on policing this evening, in which Government Members have spoken with knowledge about policing in their local areas and offered constructive suggestions on how policing could be improved and, as usual, Labour Members have simply sought to play politics, as they have in every debate that they have called.</p>
	<p pid="a.741.4/2">I begin by mentioning what I believe all of us should agree about&#8212;the value of the police in our country, the contribution that they make and the need for us to support them. I note in particular the tribute that my</p>
	<p pid="a.741.4/3">hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40190" name="Gavin Barwell">the Member for Croydon Central (Gavin Barwell)</phrase> paid to PC Nigel Albuery, who was stabbed on duty last week serving the Metropolitan police. His service, and what he went through, reminds us of the importance of the job that the police do, which we must recognise is frequently difficult and dangerous. Police officers, of course, cannot strike. It is therefore important&#8212;I say this in response to hon. Members on both sides of the House&#8212;that we treat police officers properly and value their service. However, none of that means that the Government do not have to take the difficult decisions that it is necessary to confront at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.741.4/4">I agreed strongly with my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40407" name="David Davies">the Member for Monmouth (David T. C. Davies)</phrase> on criticism of the police, which was levelled, for instance, in relation to the disorder in London in past weeks. He made the point that the police are so often damned if they do and damned if they do not. This Government have sought not to join in with that criticism, but instead, we have offered support for both the leadership of the police and the officers who did their job on the ground in difficult and trying circumstances. Many of those officers were injured, and we believe that criticism should be levelled at, and reserved for, the people who perpetrated that violence. It is simply wrong-headed to criticise the police for the action that they took.</p>
	<p pid="a.741.4/5">I am afraid that Opposition Members continue not to accept the fact that we must deal with the deficit, which means that we must take tough decisions. It is quite clear that Opposition would be simply unwilling to take those decisions&#8212;meaning decisions on the public sector. Do the shadow Home Secretary and the shadow Policing and Criminal Justice Minister really think that it helps to criticise chief constables as they seek to take the inevitable and difficult decisions to protect front-line services and restructure their forces? That does not help those chief constables at all.</p>
	<p pid="a.741.4/6">The Opposition pretend, both to the police and to the public, that their policy would be completely different from ours, but as my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary pointed out, their policy is to cut, this year, &#163;7 of every &#163;8 that we would cut. As the shadow Home Secretary has been forced to admit, the Opposition would cut &#163;1 billion a year from police budgets. She must be the only person in this country who thinks it possible to cut &#163;1 billion from police budgets without any reduction in the work force. How on earth does she think such savings can be realised?</p>
	<p pid="a.741.4/7">Of course, there will be savings from reducing the work force. Her Majesty&#8217;s inspectorate of constabulary was quite clear that cuts would be made across legal and investigation services, and in estates, criminal justice, custody, training, intelligence, business support and community policing. That is where HMIC said savings must be realised. Why do the Opposition believe it possible to reduce spending on the police by &#163;1 billion a year&#8212;their policy&#8212;and yet pretend to police officers and staff that not a single job would be lost? Frankly, in taking that position, they are not being straight to police officers and their staff about what would happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.741.4/8">That is very different to the position taken by the former shadow Chancellor, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40346" name="Alan Johnson">the right hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull West and Hessle (Alan Johnson)</phrase>. When he was Home Secretary, he at least had the honesty to admit that Labour could not maintain numbers. He admitted that, but the current shadow Home Secretary</p>
	<p pid="a.741.4/9">will not admit it. The truth is that she has absolutely no idea how that &#163;1 billion of savings would be achieved. Let me give her an example from the HMIC report. The inspector talks about the importance of making savings from collaboration. He says:</p>
	<p pid="a.741.4/10">&#8220;Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire forces anticipate savings of&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.741.4/11">&#163;1.5 million</p>
	<p pid="a.741.4/12">&#8220;from joint work on scientific support, major crime, firearms, a single dog unit and a single professional standards department.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="a.744.2/2">The Labour party, particularly the shadow Home Secretary, have absolutely no credibility on policing policy, because it has nothing to say about it. What is her position on the Winsor reform proposal that police officers should be paid more for working antisocial hours? Is she in favour of or against that? She will not say. What is her policy on the Winsor proposal that police officers should be rewarded for the skills they show? She does not know, she has not said, and she will not say, because the Opposition have no credible policy on policing issues. What has she said about bureaucracy? Absolutely nothing at all. We know that Labour created it, and we are determined to sweep it away.</p>
	<p pid="a.744.2/3">The Government are determined to fight crime, and we are determined to support the police. We are determined to give the police and others new powers to fight antisocial behaviour. We will create a new national crime agency to strengthen the fight against serious crime. We will cut targets and trust professionals by giving them the freedom to do their job. We will sweep away the bureaucracy that Labour imposed.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-23a.749.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40255" speakername="Eric Joyce" colnum="749"  time="022:16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110523/debtext/110523-0004.htm#11052348000036">
	<p pid="a.749.2/1">I want to speak about corporate governance in the City of London&#8217;s largest companies, the FTSE 100 companies. We all have an interest in them, because all our pensions are invested in them. In particular, I want to speak about what I consider to be a serious failure of corporate governance on the part of one company and the non-executive directors who sit on its board. When preparing my speech, I spoke to a number of FTSE 100 executives and non-executives who were both professional and frank, except those at the single entity which I fear may be the bad apple that infects the rest of the barrel.</p>
	<p pid="a.749.2/2">The City of London is a world leader. Billions of pounds pass through it every week and every month. An average of 600,000 transactions a day have taken place over the last five days, with a turnover ranging from &#163;4.5 billion to &#163;7.4 billion. The United Kingdom Exchequer derives an enormous revenue from the City. It is a huge source of employment and prestige for the UK, and it affects all our constituents in the most profound ways.</p>
	<p pid="a.749.2/3">The City of London is successful because it attracts many of the world&#8217;s best at all levels, be they traders, managers or back-room staff. I think it best, on the whole, to let the wheels of commerce turn and, as a nation, to extract the benefits through corporate taxation, wherever it is levelled and whatever the levy. However, as we have seen recently with the banking crisis, things can go awry. For that reason, the system requires integrity so that people can trust it. Of course no system is perfect and flaws will always exist, but most agree that that essential integrity is best assured by, on one hand, regulatory bodies alongside the professional bodies that regulate the various professions involved in the City, and on the other hand the governance and structures of the individual companies themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.749.2/4">My aim this evening is not to raise the technicalities and structures of City regulation, but to ask the Minister more broadly whether he is concerned about the governance oversight of firms that are controlled by specific individuals from abroad and have no operations in the UK. I do not suggest that it is impossible for such companies to operate with complete dignity, and many do, but I do suggest that when there is good cause to suspect that the standards of governance of a listed company are below those that the public have a right to expect, that should become a matter of deep public concern which should be reflected in the Government&#8217;s stance on such failure.</p>
	<p pid="a.749.2/5">I have a bad apple in mind. At the core of my concern&#8212;because it illustrates perfectly the case that I am making&#8212;is the Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation. I have raised the subject of the company and what I consider to be its ill-advised dealings in the House before, but things have moved on and I think that it is worth raising it again. The commercial entity that is now the ENRC arose from the denationalisation of a Kazakhstan Government asset, or series of assets. It is now dominated by three Kazakhstani billionaires. The Kazakhstan Government retain a substantial share, as does Kazakhmys, another Kazak mining company which is also a member of the FTSE 100.</p>
	<p pid="a.749.2/6">The ENRC was listed in London in 2007 and, given the importance of the mining sector in terms of general values on the exchange, it is a key member of the FTSE 100. It has extensive operations in Kazakhstan, of course, and its regional neighbours Russia and China. Significantly, it has now extended its operations into Brazil, Mali and, last year, the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Before the ENRC&#8217;s entry into the DRC, the company had been the subject of as much speculation as any other FTSE 100 company&#8212;many companies are the subject of speculation, which is up to them and their public affairs people to deal with, and most of them do that perfectly professionally. The ENRC had not generated much general public interest, but that changed when it procured a number of assets in the DRC which had been expropriated by the Government from what I think the markets agree is a perfectly reputable company.</p>
	<p pid="a.749.2/7">That company operated in the DRC and was the largest taxpayer in that country. It had invested about &#163;700 million in a couple of mines, but one in particular. I have mentioned this topic before in this place, so I do not need to keep repeating the details. What assets it invested in is well known. It invested &#163;700 million and employed many thousands of people, and it was a huge taxpayer in the DRC, but, for no good reason, the DRC expropriated its assets. A close friend of the President of the DRC bought the assets at a knock-down price&#8212;about $20 million, which is a bit of a joke. The markets were very sceptical about the legitimacy of bidding for them. The key assets were the licences to operate a couple of mines, but one in particular at a place called Kolwezi. The only company that was really interested in procuring that was the ENRC, and that was its entr&#233;e into the DRC.</p>
	<p pid="a.749.2/8">Many people had concerns, but not, it seems, the executives at the ENRC. I do not think that it is necessarily for the executives to answer every question that people and politicians might have, but I do think that non-executive directors should have sensible oversight and give people confidence that the operations of their company are legitimate. Many questions were raised about where an overnight profit of &#163;160 million went. There were patterns; other deals had been operated in the same way by the same guy, Dan Gertler. He is an Israeli, and apparently a legitimate businessman, who flies across to the Congo to do his business. Many people asked where that &#163;160 million of profit on that one deal had gone. We can be as transparent as we want in respect of international aid, but our Government give &#163;140 million or &#163;150 million to the Congo in a single deal, and that can be wiped out&#8212;it can go anywhere, and we simply do not know. That does rather throw into question the effectiveness of development aid, and scepticism has recently been expressed in certain quarters about such money simply being displaced by &#8220;dodgy deals&#8221; so it does not go where it is intended to go. There are certainly concerns about this particular deal; I and many others who are interested in the region&#8212;and in the City&#8212;were deeply concerned.</p>
	<p pid="a.749.2/9">It is a testament to the integrity of the governance of other FTSE 100 companies that many showed deep concern. Several withdrew their investments, and several reputable investment funds took out their money. One major merchant bank made a public statement that it was very concerned and reluctant to deal with this FTSE 100 company again. The non-executive directors, who I would have expected to be keen to make sure</p>
	<p pid="a.749.2/10">everything was entirely legitimate, were completely unconcerned. Their public statements were completely blas&#233;; they had no concerns whatever. That was remarkable because most people who knew about the market, the company and the deal were very concerned about the circumstances, which was why they had not touched the asset and the ENRC got it at a knock-down price.</p>
	<p pid="a.749.2/11">I am reluctant to bang on about personalities, and I am especially cautious about that given what is happening in other current news stories. However, I shall mention one person who is publicly known to be the senior independent non-executive director of the ENRC: Sir Richard Sykes. I will mention a couple of technicalities about the purpose of governors and non-executive directors in a few moments, but I think it is pertinent to mention him now because he is a good example of a very successful chief executive officer. He was CEO of GlaxoSmithKline for many years, and he was enormously successful and highly regarded. Subsequently he had a bit of a hiccup as principal of Imperial college, London, concerning what some considered to be a slightly ropey back-door deal to try to acquire the land of Wye agricultural college in Kent, which eventually fell through. That may have tainted him a little and perhaps that is why he has taken up this particular non-executive position. It was widely reported in the financial press that he was being paid about three times the normal rate&#8212;about &#163;250,000&#8212;to be a non-executive director at the ENRC. He expressed little concern, as he thought that the deal was entirely legitimate. Indeed, he thought that if the case went to international arbitration and some fault was found, the Government of the DRC would have to pay the money. The case is in international arbitration; the company that previously owned the asset that I am referring to at Kolwezi has taken the case up. To that degree, it is difficult for us to comment on what might happen in future, but what is clear is that the senior independent non-executive director of the ENRC thinks it is perfectly legitimate and fair that the DRC, which is one of the poorest countries in the world, should pick up a bill of &#163;700 million, &#163;800 million or perhaps more&#8212;the case is being spoken about in terms of billions. This seems to be something of a failure of corporate governance.</p>
	<p pid="a.749.2/12">That made me reflect on the purpose of corporate governance. I am not an expert in this area&#8212;many hon. Members have much more expertise on what the defined legal roles of directors, executive directors and non-executive directors are&#8212;but I have done a little reading and I thought that I would just reflect on what corporate governance is supposed to achieve. It is commonly defined&#8212;this is a little dry, but it is perfectly right to mention it&#8212;as the system by which companies are directed and controlled. The board of directors is entrusted with that function, and each member is appointed to uphold all appropriate governance standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.749.2/13">The role of non-executive directors&#8212;this is my primary concern&#8212;within a company&#8217;s governance structure is less clearly defined and, apparently, varies among companies. Non-executive directors are often seen as the guardians of the corporate good and act as buffers between the executive director and the company&#8217;s outside shareholders. They act as chairman, monitoring executive actions and questioning executive decisions. It seems to me that they have a dual role. They clearly have a primary responsibility to the shareholder, but more broadly they have a responsibility to the broad City of</p>
	<p pid="a.749.2/14">London and the whole corporate governance structures of the UK to ensure that people are confident that if our pensions are being invested in FTSE 100 companies, as they are, the non-executives are doing the job that they are supposed to be doing. That job is to have in mind not only the profitability of the company, but the reputation of the company and the brand, and to keep a good eye on what hard-pressed executives are doing to maximise their profits. Those guys are being pushed very hard and are being handsomely rewarded but if, from time to time, someone chooses to cut a corner, it is the job of the corporate governance of the non-executive directors to pick it up.</p>
	<p pid="a.749.2/15">As far as I can see, we trust non-executive directors to a large degree, despite the fact that many people fire lots of, perhaps unfair, criticism at them, saying that they are placemen and so on. Broadly speaking, there is a quite a lot of confidence in corporate governance, as is seen in the case of Glencore, which had an initial public offer&#8212;partial floatation&#8212;last week. There has been enormous discussion about the make-up of its board, and whether or not the board can do its job properly because many of the non-execs are so powerful and wealthy. That is for time to tell, as was said in an excellent column by Miss Sunderland in the <i>Daily Mail </i>a few weeks ago. I have no great concerns about any other immediate companies at the moment, because I do not really know enough about them, but I do know enough about the ENRC to see that non-executive directors do not appear to have done their job. Other significant figures in the City of London have been very clear and open about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.749.2/16">It is also worth mentioning that when politicians approach these companies, whether or not they like it&#8212;they are pretty neutral&#8212;they usually have a pretty professional operation. I found the ENRC to be completely invisible and unapproachable. It has one public relations guy and a spaniel sitting in an office somewhere in London. Its ownership is abroad, as are its operations. As I say, it is owned by people who are largely unaccountable. That is not to say that there has to be wide public ownership of a company for the board to have accountability from the chief executive officers, because there are many cases where families control public companies but the governance is still fine.</p>
	<p pid="a.749.2/17">In this case, it looks as though there is about to be a fight between the Kazakhstani Government and a few billionaires who were beneficiaries when the Kazakhstani Government largely privatised the company, or took it out of nationalisation, who want to take control. The non-executive directors, who I believe have been completely ineffectual, have found lately that their reputation has been badly affected, so they are now trying to argue that there should be greater corporate oversight at the ENRC. The response from the billionaires who sit behind the ENRC has been to try to get enough shares to take overall control, to sack all the non-exec directors in about two weeks&#8217; time at the annual general meeting and effectively to leave the company without any meaningful corporate governance. The company has also been unable to recruit a new CEO after the former CEO left at very short notice a couple of months ago in opaque circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.749.2/18">In conclusion, do the Government have a plan for what happens when a corporate entity, which affects everyone&#8217;s pensions, is sitting in the City of London,</p>
	<p pid="a.749.2/19">potentially infecting the barrel? I am not saying all the other companies are naive fools, but we have a corporate entity in London that has foreign ownership, no effective meaningful shareholder control, operations that are entirely abroad and billionaires who are bragging about how they will take over the company and sack all the non-execs. How will the Government ensure some degree of confidence in the markets that a company like the ENRC will not do the same thing it did with Kolwezi and damage the good reputation of the City of London?</p>
