<p>The report is primarily on the technical aspects of the scheme, but there are also many economic and other issues involved. In particular, the merits of the scheme depend largely, as the authors of the report make clear, on the view taken as to likelihood of a further substantial rise in the price of coal. My hon. Friend will realise that this aspect of the question needs very careful inquiry and an early decision on the barrage scheme is therefore not likely.</p>

<p>My Department is worKin&#x0123; in close collaboration with the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research in regard to the further development of processes for the extraction of oil from coal. Much progress has in fact taken place during the war.

<p>I understand that if an affiliation order is made by a court against a Canadian soldier the Canadian military authorities make such deductions as they deem appropriate from the pay of the soldier concerned for the benefit of the mother.

<p>When a soldier is reported missing the general rule is that missing allowances equivalent to the family or dependants' allowances, allotments of pay, whether qualifying, contributory or voluntary, and war service grants in issue are continued for 26 weeks from the date his relatives are informed he is missing, provided he continues to be recorded as missing. The period is related to the maximum time which experience shows is taken by enemy Governments in communicating the names of missing soldiers who may be prisoners of war in their hands. Missing allowances, broadly on similar lines, are issued in respect of missing officers.</p>

<p>Owing to the extreme delays on the part of the Japanese authorities in notifying the names of prisoners of war in their detention, extensions of the above period have been approved from time to time in the absence of news of the Far East missing.

<p>The position of men missing in other parts of the Far East has recently been carefully reviewed in the light of all available evidence as to their fate. The records show that by far the greater number of those who became missing in the fighting in and around Malaya and the Netherlands East Indies in 1942, and Burma before 1st November, 1942, are now reported as prisoners, either as a result of official notification from- the Japanese or of communications received from the men themselves. The Government have, therefore, been forced to the conclusion that, in view of this position and of the lapse of time since the men were originally reported as missing, it is unhappily now


unlikely that any considerable number of those still missing will be found to be prisoners.</p>

<p>In these circumstances it has been decided that the allowances in issue in respect of those still missing from the campaigns mentioned should cease after 31st July next. For other ranks, allowances will cease at the end of the pay week which includes the 31st July; for officers they will cease with effect from 1st August, 1945. Continuing allowances will then, in accordance with the usual rules, be payable. This change does not mean that the death of the missing man has been presumed or that endeavours to obtain evidence of his fate will cease from that date. In each case where death is officially presumed, a separate communication is made to the next-of-kin. Provision has been made for special continuing allowances to be paid to those families who are necessarily detained in certain areas overseas where expenses are higher than in this country. As regards those missing from operations after 1st November, 1942, missing allowances have already been extended, but at present not beyond 31st July, 1945. These cases will be reviewed before that date. All these arrangements apply equally to Naval and Air Force missing.</p>

<p>My right hon. Friend is not aware that the position is as stated in the first part of the Question.

<p>That is quite true. These despatches have passed away, in many cases, from the sphere of immediate action. Nevertheless, they are an extremely important contribution to the history of the war, and it is certainly the intention of the Government to make them public, but I do not think this is the best time, when our eyes are fixed upon the extremely rapid development of military events. I think it is much better that, in some moment when there are no new facts to be recorded about the progress of our Armies, that should be the period when they should be published.</p>

<p>The despatches are, of course, to His Majesty's Government. There might easily be things in them that would not be suitable for publication. It might give great information to the enemy. We have nothing to fear from any disclosures, I can assure the hon.

<p>The allowances of annual leave to civil servants vary with the many grades, and I am sure the hon.

Temporary civil servants in the administrative and higher executive grades are allowed 24 days; in the junior executive and clerical grades 18 days. During the war, however, the allowance of leave to all grades, permanent and temporary, has until the current leave year been restricted, by agreement with the staff, to not more than 18 days&#x2014;less in some years.

<p>Perhaps I might explain that the position of Ministers is somewhat different&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh"]&#x2014;but I take it that my hon. Friend's Question applies to Members of Parliament as such.</p>

<p>Do we understand from that answer that, so far as personal postage is concerned&#x2014;that is to say, postage which applies to personal matters&#x2014;Ministers have their letters franked? I was never aware that that was so, but is it the case now?</p>

<p>No, that is not the case, but some Ministers, I understand, as a matter of practical convenience, have their constituency correspondence dealt with through their offices and, in that case, their letters are franked.</p>

<p>This appears to be quite a new practice. It was not the case when I was a member of His Majesty's Government, and I wonder whether, if Ministers who receive salaries can have their personal letters franked because it is convenient to join both together, hon. Members can have the same privilege?</p>

<p>It is quite clear that no Minister gets his personal correspondence franked at Government expense, but so far as his constituency correspondence is concerned&#x2014;</p>

<p>&#x2014;the position is, I think, rather different [HON. MEMBERS:

"Why?"]. In the first place, Ministers get no allowance for expenses of any sort against the Income Tax on their salaries, and also by taking office Ministers preclude themselves from other methods of supplementing their income, whether by trade, journalism, or any other profession.</p>

<p>On a point of Order. As this is a matter, Sir, not of party politics, but one which affects hon. Members and the expenses they incur as a result of their ordinary responsibilities, of which not even the Prime Minister seeks to deprive us, and which brings to us a great measure of correspondence, will you, as custodian of the rights of hon. Members, take into account the extraordinary position which has now been revealed, namely, that members of the Government, who receive salaries from the State, do have their constituency correspondence franked, which is not a privilege which is accorded to ordinary private Members?</p>

<p>The House will have heard with deep regret of the passing away, yesterday evening, of one of the best known and most illustrious figures in our public life&#x2014;Earl Lloyd-George of Dwyfor. I do not think we can do any more Business to-day. I believe that that will be the feeling of the House. The precedent I would advise the House to follow is that adopted in the case of Lord Balfour and, therefore, I propose that the Leader of the House shall move the Adjournment when I sit down, and answer any questions on the alteration of Business that may arise, and that when we meet tomorrow, the tributes of the party leaders, and of Members who have personal memories, should begin our work after Questions. The Leader of the House will inform the House of the re-arrangements of Business which are necessary.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That this House do now adjourn."<br/>
If the House will agree with the arrangement which my right hon. Friend has indicated, certain consequential changes will have to be made in our Business. Tomorrow, after we have completed certain formal Business, we propose that the Adjournment shall be moved and that the Debate on Supplies to Liberated Countries, which should have taken place today, shall take place to-morrow and that in order to allow for the time taken up by the tributes which will be paid to the late Earl Lloyd-George there will be an extension of one hour for that Debate. The Committee stage of the Requisitioned Land and War Works Bill, at present down for to-morrow, will be postponed.</p>
