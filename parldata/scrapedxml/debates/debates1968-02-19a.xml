<p>With your permission, Mr. Speaker, and that of the House, I beg to ask leave to present a Petition from the. Borough Council of Saffron Walden in the County of Essex concerning the decision of Her Majesty's Government to site the third London airport at Stansted.<br/>
The Petition sets out that this decision was taken
<q>&#x2026;"notwithstanding the advice and findings of the Inspector appointed by Her Majesty's Government to hold a public local inquiry into local objections to the proposed development of land at Stansted and the weight of local and national opinion against the proposal.</q>
The Petition states that the carrying into effect of these intentions would result in disastrous consequences to the life of the villages in the County of Essex and asks that Her Majesty's Government
<q>&#x2026;may be called upon to examine afresh its policy far national airports, to consider other alternative sites for the third London air-

port and to refrain from granting planning permission for the development of the airport at Stansted until this has been done and a final decision can be taken in the context of an overall national airports policy.</q>
<q>And your Petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever Pray.</q>

<p>I do not know that I am called upon to answer questions about the trucks, but our experience in the past has been that personnel have been absorbed at a fairly rapid rate.

<p>My right hon. Friend has had a number of representations from the N.F.U. including the original request that the Board should be set up in the first place.

<p>Did not the hon. Gentleman say that this figure would be available early in 1968?

<p>While I am very grateful for that answer, can my hon. Friend explain why training facilities were run down so criminally between 1952 and 1964, and does he not agree that some of our present difficulties of shortage of skilled labour in Scotland arose from this fact?</p>

<p>I do not think it either possible or appropriate for me to comment on what happened between 1952 and 1964, but I agree with the second part of the question, which makes clear that many of our difficulties in increasing the amount of Government training and its acceptability to industry would not have been met had it not been for the rundown during those years.</p>

<p>Yes, Sir. I tried to make this clear in answer to Question No. 5. This is one of the things I resent most about it. If lads who may have made a mistake are to be hounded for it throughout the whole of their working lives, it is a very poor tribute to conditions in this country.</p>

<p>Does not my right hon. Friend agree that responsibility in this type of activity rests squarely with employers, and will he say what action he can take to combat the menace?

<p>Last month the management of British United Airways Limited withdrew recognition from the British Airline Pilots' Association with which it had previously negotiated on pay and conditions for pilots. A number of pilots in the company's employment have since accepted individual contracts circulated by the Company without previous consultation with the Association.<br/>
At meetings which I had with the two sides earlier this month, B.A.L.P.A. indicated its willingness to me, if recognition were restored, to give serious and sympathetic consideration to measures necessary to assist the Company at the present time. In the light of this, the Company undertook to me to give further consideration to its decision to withdraw recognition, but has since re-affirmed it.<br/>
In this situation, the National Joint Council for Civil Air Transport met at the end of last week and asked me to make a further approach to the parties, but before I was able to do so, the Pilots' Association decided on Saturday, 17th February, on immediate strike action. I had meetings the same evening with representatives of the Association, the Company and also with the Chairman of the National Joint Council, but these did not result in any change in the situation. I have today invited the company and the Association to a very early joint meeting under my chairmanship.</p>

I ought to say in response to the hon. Gentleman's rather violent suggestions that I deplore the action of B.U.A. It has taken what in my experience has been the unprecedented step of withdrawing recognition from a trade union


with which it has negotiated for years. If it be argued that it has done so because the demands of the union are irresponsible, my reply is that I should soon be in Broadmoor, or somewhere like it, if every employer's association did so. They were irresponsible. While the pilots may have been irresponsible, United Airways may have been unrealistic in its reply. Nevertheless, the withdrawal of recognition from a bona fide trade union is a very serious step. It makes my task almost impossible if British United Airways will not recognise the pilots.

<p>The object of the Amendment is to be both helpful and to probe. The effect of the three Amendments would be to put off for twelve months, from April, 1968, to April, 1969, the coming into force of a further discrimination in the treatment given to development areas and all other areas not being development areas. My right hon. Friends will appreciate that the events of the last week or two mean that we now cannot be concerned simply with discrimination between development and grey areas and that all sorts of areas are now claiming to be grey, for example, East London. I make no comment on that; it simply serves to show the importance of this issue.<br/>
The date proposed for the effective coming into force of the changes proposed by Clause 1, 1st April, is only seven months from the introduction on 4th September, last year, of the regional employment premium. As the objectives of the premium and the selective employment premium, as it will be, are roughly similar, it may be in order to make a number of brief references to the regional employment premium. The principle of that premium was that 30s. per employee per week should be paid to an employer with an establishment in a

development area. The Bill suggests that 7s. 6d. per week per employee should also be given to an employer in a development area, so that the total from the two sources is 37s. 6d.<br/>
In effect, what Clause I does is to amend not so much the Selective Payments Act, 1966, as it does nominally, but the regional employment premium Sections of the Finance Act, 1967. Delaying the putting into operation of these provisions for twelve months would be helpful to the Government for a number of reasons.<br/>
First, having been made aware by some of us of the problems of some parts of the country because of this 30s. subvention, the Government agreed to establish the Hunt Committee to consider them. It is meeting now, although not with any great urgency&#x2014;about once a month, when its Chairman is not out of the country, I believe. Perhaps it will meet more often in future.<br/>
But what will be its job? It has to consider the effects on grey areas of a Government subvention of 30s. a man per week in the development areas, yet, seven months later, that 30s. has been increased to 37s. 6d. This might set the Hunt Committee right back to the beginning, since it will have to consider something new, but then one will want to know what made the Government decide to increase the sum. What is the evidence?<br/>
One of the reasons for the Bill and this new discrimination is that it will save money&#x2014;&#x00A3;75 million a year&#x2014;by means of Clause 1. Is it a saving? I gather that the regional employment premium constituted "spending" but that this Clause involves "saving", because it is concerned with non-development areas. If the selective employment premium is given to employers within development areas, that is "spending" but outside development areas it is not. But unemployment outside may be just as high. I do not understand this and would like an explanation.<br/>
In suggesting this deferment for 12 months, I accept the principle that giving all employers 7s. 6d. per employee in all parts of the country was nonsense. There was never any real justification for it, but we are saying something more if the Amendment is accepted&#x2014;that to dismantle parts of this structure without


dismantling the whole will cause great problems and throw into jeopardy the Hunt Committee's investigations of the difficulties by increasing those difficulties in the middle and so on.<br/>
For this reason, and to inquire into the Government's motivations, I propose the Amendment, because it will help them to sort out in the next 12 months their policy and what they want inducements in development areas to be, as well as giving the Committee proper time to report and allowing whatever other measures may possibly be brought in to come into effect in April, 1969.</p>

<p>I have listened carefully to my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster (Mr. Henig) and I understand his interest in this matter and in those particular problems, which he is well equipped to know, of his own constituency, but he has not set the matter in its full context. What is being proposed here&#x2014;although the results are not very different&#x2014;is not an addition of 7s 6d. to the regional employment premium in development areas but that, as a result of the alteration of the exchange rate, it is no longer necessary to provide in most areas the advantage previously provided.<br/>
That does not mean that it is clear that the advantage is no longer required in development areas. Indeed, we are seeing that it is and continues to be required there. The simple reason is that, in the development areas, broadly, unemployment is approximately twice that of the rest of the country. So if one puts this matter into its proper context, my hon. Friend will agree that there is every reason for not withdrawing an economic advantage to the development areas under S.E.T., because those areas suffer so many economic disadvantages, as is demonstrated by their unused resources and unemployment figures.<br/>
I turn now to the details of my hon. Friend's suggestion. He said that this is a probing Amendment, so I am anxious to give him all the information he wants. He referred to East London and said that that is now claimed to be a grey area. I am not sure whether he had his tongue in his cheek when he said that, but I accept it as a straightforward comment. It is true that areas all over the country are being claimed as grey areas simply

because there is no definition of such an area; the characteristics of what are held to be grey areas vary enormously, including such totally different characteristics as are to be found in the area of East London which he obviously had in mind.<br/>
There is really no such thing as a grey area. What my hon. Friend has in mind are areas of widely differing characteristics, whose unemployment rates are not on average worse than those in the whole country and which therefore are not, on average, as much as half the unemployment rates of the development areas.<br/>
My hon. Friend was concerned about what is and is not a demand on resources and that therefore public expenditure is being incurred by paying selective employment premium but not regional employment premium. It is simply a question of incentive to use unused resources, which applies in the development areas, and as a result of which resources from elsewhere are switched into them. If there is such a switch, there is no demand on resources and vice versa. If money is poured into an area but does not result in a switch from another area, there is an increased demand on resources in the country as a whole. If there is a switch, the demand on the country's resources is not affected. That was made clear when regional employment premium was introduced. I do not say that everyone accepts this philosophy&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."]&#x2014;but that is its basis. Much encouraged though I always am by the interesting comments of distinguished occupants of the Opposition Front Bench, I return to what my hon. Friend said about East London and what is happening in Woolwich. Of course, there, we are seeing the effect of a switch of resources from a non-development area into one which is especially a development area and has special economic incentives, in view of its great difficulties. This, therefore, exemplifies what my hon. Friend was asking and the explanation which I have given.<br/>
I hope that he will agree that, although the change in the exchange rate justifies our claim that it is no longer necessary to help manufacturers in non-development areas to the same extent, it is still true that there are unused resources and, more particularly, unemployed men and


women in the development areas and that we must continue to help them. I know that this is merely a probing Amendment, and I hope that my hon. Friend will understand that, grateful as I am for the opportunity of explaining the Government's point of view, we cannot recommend the Committee to accept it.</p>

<p>The Chief Secretary has not answered the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster (Mr. Henig). It has been made clear that the discrimination between grey areas and development areas has been increased by the fact that the refund of the Selective Employment Tax is still payable in development areas and not in other areas. My right hon. Friend's remarks about what are grey areas are not good enough. I know that they have not an exact definition, but they are well known in the popular mind. They have been called grey areas largely because of what people have seen in these parts of Lancashire and other parts of the country, but particularly in the Lancashire cotton district.<br/>
The position in these areas is very different from the position in Woolwich. If one goes to the areas which my hon. Friend had in mind, one will see empty factories galore, slag heaps and derelict sites. Nothing has been done about them. One will see workers who have become unemployed in industries which have died in the area and which are being set up outside in development areas, with many employees in the fifties and sixties with no hope of seeing employment again. Industry is going out of the area.<br/>
"Existing unemployment" is not a satisfactory definition, because, bad as

unemployment is, it is not worse only because people are moving from the area. A large number of people are leaving Lancashire, as with other areas, which keeps unemployment down, but there is no doubt that there is all the difference in the world between Woolwich and these genuinely grey areas. The discrimination between the development areas and the grey areas has been made worse by the fact that the Selective Employment Tax refund has been withdrawn.</p>

<p>I agree with most of what the hon. Member for Lancaster (Mr. Henig) said about discrimination, but I fear that the Amendment is very much of a mouse. Surely twelve months will not make very much difference to this problem.<br/>
The Government have gone a bit mad over their development area policy; it has been considerably overdone. Industries which are fortunate enough to be established in development areas have had very considerable financial advantages. There are those which are renting premises at an uneconomic rent. Their cash grants are, I think, double those of industries situated in other than development areas. They have very special terms for training their operatives. In addition, there is the 30s. to which the hon. Member for Lancaster referred.<br/>
If hon. Members are to be merely concerned with their own constituency interests, and if when one area has a concession another area clamours for the same concession, we shall have a situation very much like that of the man who decided to take a ginger beer box to a football match. It was not long before everybody took a ginger beer box, with the result that everybody was in the same position. I suspect that, when the situation dawns on the Government, they too will have to redress some of the anomalies which have been created by their extreme generosity to development areas.<br/>
I asked a manufacturer of cloth in my constituency what he considered was the effect of the 37s. 6d. a week&#x2014;7s. 6d. in respect of the S.E.T. premium and 30s. in respect of the regional employment premium&#x2014;on the production of cloth. He assures me that it makes a difference of 6d. on every yard of cloth produced.


This is putting the old-established businesses at a great disadvantage.<br/>
Since addressing the House a week ago, I have heard about a firm of shipbuilders in the south of England. Its trade was divided roughly into two parts. It prod aced a specialty article largely for the export market, and the other half of its business consisted of the "bread and butter" business of repairs in the shipping industry. Because of the tremendous advantages which firms on the Clyde have, it has been deprived entirely of what I call the "bread and butter" part of it; business. In order to allow it to continue the export development of a line in which it was a specialist, as a result of this unfair discrimination, it has lost the "bread and butter" part of its trade, which has had most serious effects on its ability to export the specialty article to Europe and elsewhere.<br/>
The Government have not looked far enough for the implications of a system of this kind. This is the time when they should not seek to increase discrimination between one part of the country and another. Many other parts are suffering unfairly. Something will have to be done. No doubt the Hunt Committee will make recommendations. Industry is disturbed by continuous changes of this kind. The Government have the opportunity to level things up a bit, and they can do it by trying to solve the problem of this 7s. 6d.</p>

<p>I should like to make two points which I hope my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary will bear in mind.<br/>
First, would he issue a directive or something to other Government Ministers' about an embargo on the phrase "grey area". It is an inelegant phrase. It does not describe the districts to which it is supposed to refer. Least of all does it describe the people or the countryside of my constituency and its surrounding areas in North-East Lancashire. I hope that the Government will not refer to "grey areas" in their replies in future.<br/>
Secondly, I wish to reinforce what has been said by my hon. Friends the Member; for Lancaster (Mr. Henig) and Preston, North (Mr. Ronald Atkins). The objection of those of us in areas which surround development areas&#x2014;this is true of North-East Lancashire&#x2014;to the premium is not that it gives an unfair

advantage to development areas, because we appreciate the need for Government assistance in development areas. What we object to, mildly, and in our usual gentlemanly manner, is that it ignores the problems of areas such as North-East Lancashire, which are very near development areas and have similar problems.<br/>
This added inducement we fear will not only encourage new industry which is badly needed in areas like North-East Lancashire to by-pass North-East Lancashire, but, even more important, it will encourage existing industrialists inside to develop outside the area. Despite what my right hon. Friend said about the change in exchange rate, the problems remain the same, even if the exchange rate has changed.</p>

<p>I did not intend to take part in this debate, but I have been tempted to do so by the amazing references to the extreme favouritism given to the development areas established by the Government and to the so-called unfair discrimination.<br/>
I come from a development area. My constituency is a development area. Scotland is a development area. I fail to see how this so-called bias operates in Scotland. In spite of the regional employment premium, Selective Employment Tax refunds, buildings grants and cash grants for equipment, Scotland still has twice the number of unemployed per head of population than England and Wales. In my constituency, and in my part of the County of Lanark, between 5 and 6 per cent. of our insurable population is unemployed, in spite of all that the Government are endeavouring to do. We have reached the stage where we are asking the Government to do more. If anyone suffers from discrimination, we in Scotland suffer from it.<br/>
Coal and gas prices are discriminated against us. Indeed, parts of Scotland now find it cheaper to send their iron to England to be rolled and smelted and to pay the freight than to have it done in Scotland and to pay the coal charges operating there against industrialists. That is indicative that the Government are looking at the situation objectively. They are endeavouring to do what they can within the limits of their purse to try to assist those parts of the country which are suffering more than others.<br/>
I have sympathy for the grey areas&#x2014;we all have&#x2014;but to compare areas of impending unemployment with areas in which there is existing unemployment is not a very fair comparison. The Government must get their priorities right. I have heard my hon. Friends on this side preaching the famous saying of the late Nye Bevan that Socialism is a religion of priorities. Here is a priority for the areas already suffering from unemployment.<br/>
My hon. Friends have spoken about the difficulty of people in the 50s and 60s being able to find jobs because industries have closed down. In Scotland, one is too old at 45 to get a job. That is the policy which has been operated by many employers, both American and indigenous. It is indicative of the serious problem which confronts development areas such as Scotland and the North-East, as well as Wales.<br/>
I hope that my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary will err on the right side, on the side of justice, and that whatever financial assistance we can give will be given to areas with increased or abnormal unemployment figures&#x2014;the areas, for instance, which have more than the national average of unemployment to contend with. Those are the areas which should get the Government's priority and on which the Government should concentrate financial assistance.<br/>
We have reached the stage that we are thinking of asking the Government to set up and operate factories, because, in spite or of all the tempting inducements, industry is still not coming to Scotland as fast or as equitably as it could to give us a fairer share of the employment prospects. I therefore want my right hon. Friend to ensure that whatever he does for the grey areas will not be done at the expense of areas such as Scotland. [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] I am happy to have the agreement of my hon. Friends. That is where we should spend the money.<br/>
By all means take care of the grey areas, but let us first spend the money where the need is urgent and then proceed to spend it in areas where the need is less urgent. All I ask is that whatever my right hon. Friend does for the grey areas&#x2014;and I hope that he will help them&#x2014;he will not do it at the expense

of the financial steps which must be taken if we are to break the back of unemployment in Scotland.</p>

<p>It so happened that a few days ago I spent a couple of hours with the Lancashire and Merseyside Industrial Development Association in Wigan. Whilst I do not represent the County Borough of Wigan in this House, I represent many of the urban and rural areas stretching across Central Lancashire, of which Wigan is their pivotal point. I wish to convey as temperately as I can to my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary, who has already commented on the Amendment, the great apprehensions which exist in the Wigan area, which is a dying coal area, where the mines and many of the cotton mills also are closed.<br/>
It might be refreshing to bring this short debate out of the realm of general statement and to quote a few figures. I think it was Bertrand Russell who said that any man who could think acutely enough could reduce any abstract idea to figures if only he thought sufficiently about it.<br/>
4.15 p.m.<br/>
My right hon. Friend this afternoon said that the South Lancashire area and the areas to which my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster (Mr. Henig) referred have only about the national average of unemployment. Like other massive generalisations, that is only partly true. It so happens that in January, which is the latest month for which figures are available from the Ministry of Labour, the number of totally unemployed in Great Britain as a whole averaged 2&#x0037;7 per cent. and in the North-West as a whole 2.&#x0037;6 per cent. When, however, those figures are broken down for Central Lancashire&#x2014;although I do not want to be parochial about it&#x2014;for the old cotton and coal areas, where the traditional sources of employment have dried up. in January, only a month ago. the number of totally unemployed in South Lancashire was 3.034 of, whom a very high percentage2.948&#x2013;2,948&#x2014;were totally unemployed males. the highest number of male unemployed in any month since May, 1963.<br/>
Therefore, when we consider male employment, which is the key employment for the traditional breadwinner of the


family, we find that the rate of unemployment in South Lancashire for males alone in January was 3&#x0037;2 per cent. against 2&#x0037;7 nationally and 3&#x0037;3 per cent. in the Merseyside development area, which is the highest figure in that area for some months, marginally higher than it has been.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster referred to the problem in East Lancashire, where there are what I might almost describe as dying communities, if that is not too depressing an adjective to use, where the old cotton towns have a reduced population and large numbers of empty houses, which cannot be let because the people have gone away. It may comfort some of my right hon. Friends and hon. Friends to point to relatively low unemployment figures, but the truth of the situation is that if the people who have been forced to leave their home towns and go elsewhere had not done so, the figures would have been much higher.<br/>
Without labouring the point too much, I should try to impress upon my right hon. Friends in the Government that the figure of 3&#x0037;2 per cent. wholly unemployed male workers in the Wigan area is totally unacceptable to us. I am constantly told by industrialists and others whom I meet it the ordinary course of my journeyings about the county, part of which I represent, that the discrimination represented by 37s. 6d. premium and the Selective Employment Tax rebate of 7s. 6d.. plus the capital grant of 45 per cent. which is available in the development areas as against 25 per cent. outside those areas, is an impossible situation.<br/>
My right hon. Friend the Minister of State, Board of Trade, who is present on the Front Bench, understands the problem very well. I have often discussed it with him. I have tried my best to brainwash him. People try to brainwash me, so why should I not get a bit of my own back occasionally?<br/>
Here we have a situation in which areas which have been stripped of their traditional employment are so placed that neighbouring areas obtain the premium payments plus the 20 per cent. advantage in capital grants and it is quite impossible to get my development of industry on the perimeter, for example, of the Skelmersdalf new town. Industrialists tell me that they cannot hold engineering

labour, for example, in some places. I do not want to sound alarmist or to be unfair to my hon. Friends who have a difficult problem on their hands.<br/>
It is time some of us in this House joined those who have said on other occasions that they regard the Selective Employment Tax and what has flowed from it as complete nonsense&#x2014;complete nonsense. Let it be on the record. I have always been concerned about these devices which very often appeal to the academic mind. I am not anti-intellectual&#x2014;I am rather the opposite, if it comes to that&#x2014;but I am shocked that some of these boffins can sell these ideas to a Government with a radical, Socialist background.</p>

<p>Let us be fair. I am trying to be fair to everybody. I do not want to be offensive to anybody. But this is an extremely difficult problem. The general proposition of the development areas, of trying to spread out industry where it is most needed, is sound in principle, and the Government have no power to direct industry except by positive or negative incentives&#x2014;or discriminations, as the case may be. I can understand the argument. Bless my soul, I have been arguing this since I entered the House 17 years ago.<br/>
There is still a great deal of tidying up to do. Whatever the Hunt Committee may say when it reports, the fact is that there are still strips of Lancashire which are desparately short of employment because of the collapse in the cotton and coal industries. We want a different outlook on this, and I hope that the Government will give further consideration to the grey areas&#x2014;as they are often wrongly called, for I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Accrington (Mr. Arthur Davidson) that we ought not to call them grey, and the people in them are very cheerful. However, we ought to reduce the gap which exists between the conditions in those areas and others, and the problems of the grey areas are manifest to everybody who has lived with the situation. We want to get a good deal of liberalisation in these policies so that we do not get into the difficulties of discrimination, which already exists.</p>

<p>I think someone on this side of the Committee should rise immediately to thank the hon. Member for Westhoughton (Mr. J. T. Price) for his speech. It is not the first time in this Session I have had occasion to do this, and I would like very sincerely and warmly, without, I hope, embarrassing him, to praise his common sense and his sense of realism.<br/>
I would wish him well, but I think he was a little optimistic in suggesting that he might successfully undertake the task of brainwashing Treasury Ministers. We know very well how impossible that is. Treasury Ministers are already under the influence of the boffins to whom the hon. Gentleman alluded. I would exclude the ordinary Treasury officials from this, but the hon. Gentleman went on to ask how these boffins sell such ideas to Ministers and said that he could not understand their success. The hon. Gentleman must really remember that this Government bought this absolute tomfoolery and bought it very readily. It has taken them and some hon. Members a very long time to catch up with the rest of the country in the conviction which started after the mad idea which never had any sense in it of this Selective Employment Tax. I absolutely share the hon. Gentleman's sense of shock that anyone so intelligent as the Chief Secretary should ever find himself in the position of being able to defend such monstrosities as those in the Selective Employment Tax.<br/>
The one point I want to make&#x2014;it in some way echoes points which have been made by hon. Gentlemen opposite&#x2014;is that the idea of development areas was all very well when it started a long time ago, but really so many things have happened since, even under the present Government, who do not really change, except when they occasionally produce a monster such as the Selective Employment Tax. What they have done is to spread the development area idea far too thin, so that really very few people get any conspicuous benefit from it, and there are many areas which also need this help and are denied it simply because they do not qualify under the rule. If the Committee will forgive me for mentioning the West Country, why should it not share widely in the advantages of being a development area? But it does not do so. I personally believe that a far

more modern and up-to-date approach is needed for areas with special problems, and for goodness sake let us accept as a start that one point at which the Government can always help is that of the infrastructure of a community, rather than bribing industry to go to places, so that they can become commercially and economically profitable.<br/>
I do not wish to detain the Committee any more, except to finish as I began, by thanking the hon. Gentleman the Member for Westhoughton for a very welcome outburst of common sense from those benches, an outburst in which he eloquently and with conviction condemned a really monstrous and silly proposition.</p>

<p>I apologise to the Committee for taking up more time, but in answer to my probe my right hon. Friend, although, with his customary courtesy, he dealt with some of the points I made, did not, I think go far enough. May I, therefore, probe this a little bit deeper?<br/>
I should like to make it quite clear to my hon. Friend the Member for Coat-bridge and Airdrie (Mr. Dempsey) that nobody who has spoken in favour of this Amendment, so far as I am aware, would begrudge for one minute any help whatsoever going to areas like Scotland which have suffered so appallingly in the past. The only point we want to make is this: are the Government really sold on the idea that the only way to give help and to alleviate suffering in Scotland is by causing it somewhere else? If this is the proposition then I am perfectly prepared to consider it, prepared to consider Lancashire and London and other places which may have had no share in the past and say, "Let us share out the suffering more equitably", but I would hope that my right hon. Friend, who is so subtle and sophisticated in these matters, would not want to offer that particular argument to the Committee this afternoon.<br/>
Right at the beginning of my right hon. Friend's reply he said that it was not quite the same thing as increasing the regional employment premium to introduce this selective employment premium differentiated between different areas of the country at 7s. 6d. Could he explain this? Where is there any difference between 37s. 6d. under one piece of


legislation, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, 30s. under one piece and 7s. 6d. under the other? Does 30s. plus 7s. 6d. net equal 37s. 6d.? Would he explain this? I can understand the administrative reasons why my right hon. Friend needs to do it this way, but I do not see what is the virtue of it.<br/>
He referred, secondly, to the change in the exchange rate of sterling, implying that it meant that areas outside the development areas no longer needed 7s. 6d. I never fully understood, I must confess, how the premium was supposed to help exports when given to all sorts of people who have never done any exporting in their lives. That is, I suppose, the old argument which we cannot enter into now, but I would like to assure my right hon. Friend of this, that there are many areas of the country which still need help despite the change in the exchange rate, which is somewhat incidental.<br/>
My right hon. Friend suggested that there were unused resources in the development areas. This is simply not true. There are many unused resources in many other parts of the country. Something was said about employment, and I made a quick check, and I find that in tae last five years the total number of people registered as employed and unemployed in the area of Lancaster has dropped by 1,000. Why? Because they have gone elsewhere.<br/>
There are other places outside the development areas where there are unused resources. This means that, if we are to continue to pay 7s. 6d. per week per employee in these areas, where there are no unused resources, we shall not be spending. It would appear to follow that ceasing to pay 7s. 6d. would similarly not be a real saving. In other words, the saving of&#x00A3;75 million seems to me to be completely mythical. Could my right hon. Friend explain that one? The hon. Member said I had produced a mouse. I hope that he will realise that there are certain difficulties in framing an Amendment which will be in order so that we can have a debate of the kind that we have had.<br/>
I have mentioned the problem which the Clause will create for my constituents. I do not like the idea of each of us asking, "What about my constituency? What will the Government do about

that?" But I want to hear from the Front Bench how the Government consider that this kind of measure and Clause will solve the real problems. Why was the premium 30s. before, and why is it 37s. 6d. now? When will it be 45s.?<br/>
4.30 p.m.<br/>
I return to the basic question. The Hunt Committee has been established to consider the problem of the grey areas and has been working on it for six months. In three months' time, before it is due to report, there will be a complete change in the discrimination between grey areas and development areas. Has my hon. Friend contacted the Hunt Committee to see how this will affect its work? Will it have to start again on the basis of the extra 7s. 6d.? Was it informed in advance that this would come? What evidence is there that the 30s. premium has failed, making it necessary to have a premium of 37s. 6d.?</p>

<p>I support the Clause. I understand that the Government are resisting the Amendment and are seeking to carry on with their comparatively new policy of seeking to assist certain areas. It may be that some of the provisions are not ideal, but we must recognise that we do not devise ideal measures right away. We grope towards better and better methods of dealing with certain problems.<br/>
Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have paid lip-service to the existence of the problem arising from the fact that, left to itself, industry drains away from certain parts of the country. It does this not just because certain parts are superior to others but for a variety of other reasons. Perhaps because large centres of population can provide more amenities, and so forth, industry has tended to drain towards those centres, and other parts of the country have been left at an increasing disadvantage. It had become increasingly apparent to many of us that unless the Government intervened in a massive, sustained and systematic way, this process of draining away to areas representing, perhaps, only one-third of our total area, would continue.<br/>
Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have urged the Government to take steps to rectify this maldistribution of industry and have put forward


strong views on those lines. I hope that the Government will continue with this kind of Measure. I am not arguing that, at this stage, the provisions in the Bill are necessarily the best; I am prepared to see other methods being sought. But at this stage the Bill offers one of the best solutions.<br/>
So long as it does not affect my hon. Friends they are apparently prepared to pay lip service to this method, but immediately it appears to begin to bite and to affect their own areas they raise an outcry against it. I am not opposed to this kind of provision. Industry has drained away from my part of the country, and youngsters who are unable to find jobs in their own areas have had to go to London. Sometimes they have been almost children, who have had to leave their own areas because there were no jobs for them there.<br/>
It would seem to me that hon. Members representing not merely areas in Scotland but any peripheral areas in this quite small island ought to be encouraged by the measures that the Government are putting forward. They should welcome them. It may be that in some instances they can be refined, but at a time when they are just beginning to work I am opposed to hon. Members representing areas which have had it all their own way for so long bringing pressure to bear on the Government to scrap their proposals.</p>

<p>How can my hon. Friend say that areas such as Lancashire have had it all their own way for years and years?

<p>Thank you, Sir Eric. This is a theme about which I have spoken for many years. I know it very well. I am talking about central areas which, over the years, have attracted industry. I am aware that some are more fortunate than others. Some may be described as grey areas. I am prepared to see methods brought forward to help them. But the kind of campaign that is being mounted in this case seems to me to be designed to stop any measures from effectively biting.</p>

<p>I have every sympathy with the problems of Scotland. In my Amendment, or in any other action I may take, I am not attempting to reduce the amount of help that is already being given to areas such as Scotland and the development areas. I am concerned with the extra 7s. 6d. which is now proposed because I believe that it will have a deleterious effect on other areas.</p>

<p>I accept what my hon. Friend says, in part, but I come back to the fact that just at a time when these measures appear to be beginning to bite an outcry is raised which in some cases has taken the form of saying, "Surely, in order to help Scotland and other areas, those areas which are nearer to the centre ought not to be penalised." If, as a result of recent reorganisations, it is necessary that certain factories should be closed down it would seem to me more desirable for those factories to be closed in areas where there is relatively more alternative employment rather than much less alternative.<br/>
If the result of this extra 7s. 6d. on top of the regional employment premium, as it has been operating, is an important factor in deciding whether a factory will close or remain open, it would seem to me that the proposals in the Bill will perform a very useful job.

<p>I am sure that the Committee wishes me to reply shortly to the additional points which have been made since I last spoke. I apologise for having replied at that stage, but it did not then seem that any other hon. Member wished to speak on the Amendment.<br/>
I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Motherwell (Mr. Lawson) for his very moving speech and I am also grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie (Mr. Dmpsey). Development areas have been suffering greater unemployment than the rest of the country for so long that they have come almost to accept it as part of their lot. I do not accept it for one minute. A Labour Government must intervene in the economic affairs of the country so as to create greater justice. This is a fundamental way of doing it&#x2014;of encouraging industry to move into the development areas so as to achieve nearer to a balance of economic activity in terms of full employment by comparison with that which other areas have enjoyed.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Motherwell is quite right. The attacks which have been made on the Selective Employment Tax and the regional employment premium have been based on the allegation that they do not work. Now, when we see them beginning to work, it is obviously the duty of hon. Members whose constituents are prejudicially affected to draw that fact to the attention of the Committee. I well understand that. But we must recognise that the function of these two Acts taken together&#x2014;and that is why we are resisting the Amendment&#x2014;is to encourage the movement of industry into the development areas so that when a greater level of activity has been achieved generally, then that greater level of activity can be enjoyed in the development areas, too.<br/>
This has been prevented in the past because in areas of full employment there has been what I can only describe as overheating, boiling over in terms of economic activity, while in other areas of. the country there have still been freezing conditions, economically. The way to enable a higher level of economic activity to be achieved is to secure a greater equality of activity between different area, particularly in terms of employment or in the absence of unemployment.<br/>
This is a marked differential. The hon. Member for Pudsey (Mr. Hiley) made an interesting speech on Second Reading&#x2014;and he referred to the matter again today&#x2014;in which he said that in terms of cloth manufacture, the differential was excess ive He said that it is having a marked

effect on certain orders which might have gone to some of his constituents but which, in fact, will go to manufacturers in development areas.<br/>
We have to recognise that this is what it is all about. This is why we have the differential. My hon. Friend must share the view so well expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie that whatever we do we should not take away from the development areas. If we all accept that premise, then the question put to me is: what are the Government doing to help areas which I may not describe by the colour of the sky but which I may perhaps describe as intermediate areas?<br/>
We have recognised that in the intermediate areas there is a problem which needs special investigation. The level of unemployment in the intermediate areas as a whole is broadly the same as the level throughout the country, but it varies enormously from area to area. Indeed, the level of unemployment varies in the development areas, too. It is no good comparing the level of unemployment in one part of a constituency or one part of an area with the general level of unemployment in the development areas because certain parts of the development areas have a very high and acute level of unemployment.<br/>
In answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster (Mr. Henig), I would point out that that was why we set up the Hunt Committee. They are doing their job. They are aware of the changes which are taking place and conscious of everything which is going on. I am sure that they read my hon. Friend's speeches with great care, because they are relevant to the points which the Hunt Committee are considering. They will note what he said about the speed with which they are carrying on their difficult task. It is for them to decide how fast they can usefully go in carrying out their important task. As a Government we, naturally, are anxious to hear the results of their inquiry when they are available.</p>

<p>I do not think that my right hon. Friend follows the point which I made. I appreciate that the Hunt Committee have been set up and that they will make their recommendations. But I cannot understand&#x2014;it must be my fault


&#x2014;how one can first set up a Committee to inquire into what positively needs to be done to help the intermediate areas and then, a few months later, do something which positively injures the grey areas once more. How was that decision taken? What is the point of having a Committee sitting on this subject if in the middle of it something is done which changes the whole basis of their study?</p>

<p>My hon. Friend misconceives the position. The division is between the development areas and the rest of the country. We are preparing to save in a full year&#x00A3;100 million of public expenditure by withdrawing the S.E.T. additional payments from manufacturers outside the development area. No distinction is drawn between the intermediate areas&#x2014;my hon. Friend does not like them called the grey areas&#x2014;and the rest of the country, other than the development areas. I therefore cannot accept that we are taking deliberate steps to prejudice the intermediate areas. That is far from the case. We are proposing to continue to help the development areas. The evidence is that the help continues to be needed. The Amendment would go against that, and therefore I must recommend the Committee that we should not accept it.</p>

<p>Does my right hon.

<p>I think that I have answered my hon. Friend's question on more than one occasion but I am anxious, if possible, to satisfy him. I will therefore repeat that we are proposing to save&#x00A3;100 million of public expenditure, which is very relevant in our present considerations and extremely relevant in terms of increasing economic activity in the country as a whole, including Lancaster. We propose to do that by removing the additional selective employment payments from areas other than development areas. We are not proposing to withdraw them from the development areas because, in spite of

everything which we are doing for those areas, we are not satisfied that they can at present withstand such a withdrawal of assistance and of incentives.</p>

<p>As you say, Sir Eric, there are three consequential Amendments to the Clause.<br/>
I am not particularly devoted to the Amendment, unlike some to which we shall come on Clause 2, and it is most unlikely that I shall invite my hon. and right hon. Friends to divide on it. But I should be grateful if the Chief Secretary would clear up one issue. The Clause withdraws part of the Selective Employment payments outside the development areas and it refers to the Selective Employment Payments Act, 1966. For our immediate purposes that Act is not relevant because it applied to the whole country whether the area was a development area or not. The question whether an area was wholly in or wholly out, or partly in or partly out, was therefore not particularly relevant. One has to look then at the regional employment premium which was finally embodied in Clause 26(1) of the Finance Act of 1967. There the word "wholly" is used.<br/>
My point is quite simple. Leaving aside altogether the merits of S.E.T.&#x2014;and here I agree very much with what was said by the hon. Member for Westhoughton (Mr. J. T. Price) and with the comment of my hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil (Mr. Peyton)&#x2014;one had to find a fairly rough and ready method of classifying establishments. With all its faults, the only means available was the Industrial Classification, for which I think I was myself responsible when Minister of Labour about 10 years ago.<br/>
The problem that can or may arise in this case is where the development area cuts through part of an establishment. Normally, if I have it right, an establishment consists of activities carried on at the same address, and the Minister of Labour has, on the whole, been extremely sensible in deciding the many difficult problems of location that arise from that definition.<br/>
Does the Chief Secretary need the words
<q>&#x2026;wholly within a development area&#x2026;</q>
repeated four times? May there not be cases in which that has the undesirable effect of withholding a payment from an establishment which is mainly&#x2014;or, indeed, almost entirely&#x2014;within a development area, but may have one small part&#x2014;an accounts department, say&#x2014;down the road geographically but, in the curious way we have our boundaries, very conceivably in a different county or county borough, as the case may be? There must be illustrations of this, and I should have thought that they would have come to the notice of the Minister of Labour or the right hon. Gentleman.<br/>
I have paid tribute before to the way in which the Minister of Labour has coped with the difficult questions of definition that arise, but as I looked through the Bill from the point of view of Amendments in Committee, I was struck with this word. It occurs to me&#x2014;the point is obvious, and I need not labour it&#x2014;that although the establishment may be almost entirely within a development area, one part&#x2014;perhaps an unimportant part&#x2014;may lie outside and, according to the way I read the Bill, that fact might disqualify the whole of the establishment from receiving the premium. I should be grateful to have the Chief Secretary's comment.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Enfield, West (Mr. Iain Macleod) for raising this point, because it needs to be made clear. He refers to the possibility of an establishment being mainly within a development area but having, for example, an accounts department in a separate office down the road. He has asked me whether we have had examples of works straddling the two areas. Furthermore, he asks what principle we are applying.<br/>
We require the word "wholly". We are applying the principle that is behind the word. We have had only one example, and it has not presented any problem because the geography has been very much of the kind that the right hon. Gentleman has just mentioned. The right hon. Gentleman was good enough to say that the Ministry of Labour has acted wisely in these matters, and he knows that the Minister has a discretion with regard to the defining of "establishment."<br/>
In the case that has occurred&#x2014;and in the case of the theoretical accounts department to which the right hon. Gentleman referred&#x2014;the Ministry of Labour has regarded&#x2014;or, in the right hon. Gentleman's case, would regard&#x2014;the main establishment which is wholly within the development area as one establishment which would rank for the additional sum, and any smaller, separate office on the other side of the road&#x2014;the "road" being the boundary; and, in the right hon. Gentleman's case, the office being the accounts department&#x2014;as being a separate establishment which, being wholly outside the development area, would not rank. Therefore, the firm in question is not prejudiced at all, because the main part of its establishment which is in the development area ranks for the additional payment.<br/>
Having dealt with the one example and with the method of dealing with the right hon. Gentleman's example, let me now turn to the theory. The right hon. Gentleman is much more experienced in these matters than I am, and he knows that wherever one draws a line one has difficulty. In theory, the question is: is it right to exclude those firms which might exist&#x2014;though only one has con_ to notice, and that has not presented a problem&#x2014;which have their main establishment in a development area, but have, as it were, put their toe into the non-development area and, because of the word "wholly" lose the total advantage?<br/>
Perhaps I might put it the other way round. Equally, one has the problem of the firm which is mainly in a non-development area and could, without these words, seek to gain advantage for the whole of its establishment in the non-development area by putting its toe, as it were, into the development area and


seeking to get classification as one establishment&#x2014;putting an office on one side of the road, building a bridge across the road, and then saying, "We are one establishment." As I say, one always has difficulty with a dividing line and this dividing line is consistent with all the other relevant dividing lines.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman mentioned the regional employment premium&#x2014;that is the dividing line used there, and it is also the dividing line used with regard to Board of Trade legislation in helping development areas. That being so, and having regard to the need for consistency and the fact that only one example has come to notice and that that example in practice has presented no real problem, I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will feel his Amendment has served the very useful purpose of clarifying the situation but need not be pressed further.</p>

<p>The whole Committee will be grateful to the Chief Secretary for the trouble he has taken, but I should like to make just one or two points. Leaving aside the fact that I am against S.E.T. and all its work, and abominate it, it seems to me to be most undesirable that because of the accident of yards, a very small measurement being involved, one firm suffering from the same disadvantages of terrain, bad transport conditions, out-dated industry, and so on, could be very severely prejudiced as against its competitors facing the same conditions and obstacles.<br/>
My second point is a slight refinement of the first. One firm might be able to cure itself of its disadvantages by selling off a quite unnecessary or not vital part of its establishment, and thereby putting itself wholly within a development area. On the other hand, a similar cure might not be available to its neighbour who, as
I say, is suffering from the same problem.<br/>
5.0 p.m.<br/>
I raise a serious point arising out of the right hon. Gentleman's answer to what was said by my right hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, West (Mr. Iain Macleod). The Chief Secretary justifiably commended the Ministry of Labour for its immensely detailed and careful work in dealing with these difficulties. I agree with and endorse that commendation very strongly, but we have to face the

fact that the Chief Secretary appeared to be saying that there was vested in the Department a discretion to disregard words in an Act of Parliament. That is a very serious matter. Parliament should not be so sloppy in its legislative habits as to say, as apparently we shall say, that in this Clause there is something that we do not completely mean.<br/>
I wonder whether we are setting a dangerous precedent. It is all very well if only one firm is involved, but one knows from experience of these things that problems and complaints are likely to come some time afterwards. To put it politely, people are slow to appreciate the extent of legislative folly in which we sometimes indulge, and only when they meet the impact do they realise, dumbfounded and amazed, that Parliament has done an incredible thing. They do not always lightly forgive Members of Parliament who have done so at the behest of an Administration which has got itself tied by the heels with a stupid proposal such as Selective Employment Tax.<br/>
Bearing in mind that the Chief Secretary could not give an undertaking that there will not be other firms in this position, I ask him to address his mind to the question whether it is wise for a Minister to say that although we have the words "wholly within a development area", nevertheless a kindly and benign Administration, through the Ministry of Labour, would easily be able to overcome a difficulty such as that by a sensible and generous exercise of a discretion which we have not written into the Bill.</p>

<p>I gladly reply to the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Peyton), although very shortly. He has referred to a discretion which is embodied in the Selective Employment Payments Act, 1966, in Section 10(3), which says:
<q>The Minister by whom any register of establishments is maintained&#x2026; may if he thinks fit on the application of an employer&#x2014;</q>
<q>(a)treat different parts of premises occupied for the purposes of his business by that employer as constituting the sites of different establishments; or</q>
<q>(b)treat different premises so occupied as constituting the site of a single establishment.</q>
I recognise the democratic spirit behind what the hon. Member said and the fact that we do not want too much


power vested in Ministers who in turn have to delegate that power to others, but this matter was fully discussed at the time. He will realise as a practical man that it is quite impossible to provide in legislation exactly how we should divide different workshops and offices of innumerable kinds which constitute a problem. The sensible way, therefore, is to achieve justice as far as we can by giving an element of discretion to the Minister who is answerable to Parliament. I am glad that the hon. Member and his right hon. Friend feel that the Minister is exercising his discretion wisely.</p>

<p>The two points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil (Mr. Peyton) are of great importance, but I am afraid that neither of them can be met under the Selective Employment Tax as we have it. That is an additional reason for getting rid of the tax. The difficulty about an establishment is that it might be only a few yards from a development area, but it might be 100 yards away or half a mile away and so on. It is true that we agreed to a certain discretion a year ago. Although I am wholly sympathetic in principle to what my hon. Friend said and he and I believe that a tax like this is a nonsense, it makes it less of a nonsense if a certain amount of common sense can be injected into its interpretation by the Minister of Labour.<br/>
I am grateful to the Chief Secretary for having explained this matter. I think that on balance he needs the word "wholly". We shall have to rely in the odd case which will crop up on the discretion which we hope and believe the Minister of Labour will exercise wisely. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</p>

<p>I wish to make one or two brief points, partly because some of the reservations expressed earlier in the debate and on Second Reading have never been adequately met. This Bill falls into two parts. Clause 1 is quite self-contained, and Clauses 2 and 3 are quite self-contained, even though the latter contain two things. The rest of the Bill could continue if Clause I disappeared,

which I would think no very bad thing.<br/>
The object of Clause 1 is to make an increase in the amount of economic help given to some parts of the country as against others. I do not think anyone would deny this. A question remains which has not been answered by my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary. If he cannot answer it, I hope he will say so, but if he can answer it I hope he will give us the answer. How was it that the previous amount of help could be held to be insufficient so soon, necessitating that it be increased? When was it known that 30s. was inadequate? How was it established that 37s. 6d. is adequate, and have we a firm pledge that in a few months my right hon. Friend will not come back to us asking that it should be made 45s.?<br/>
This Measure was announced originally last November as part of the savings consequent on devaluation. In fact, there was a muddle and we were told that we no longer needed the S.E.T. premium for three-quarters of the country because with devaluation our exporting problems would be solved. It was held that the S.E.T. premium was somehow or other a help to exports&#x2014;an argument which I never followed. It was therefore removed. The second thing which seems to have been confused is that this is part of the savings which have been effected. If the areas in which the premium was given&#x2014;the regional employment premium or S.E.T. premium&#x2014;were those in which there were no unused resources, then this was spending, but if there were unused resources this meant a lot of saving. Perhaps my right hon. Friend will admit that the savings which this proposal is supposed to yield amount to a figure very much more apparent than real.<br/>
On my reservation about Clause 1 I part company with hon. Members opposite. The Clause seems to me S.E.T. and regional employment premium legislation in a worse mess than ever before. I understand that the Opposition support the Clause because they think that it removes some of the anomalies. I believe that it creates far more anomalies than it removes.<br/>
Help is given to development areas and to people in those areas under two separate Measures&#x2014;30s. in one case, and a less significant but still substantial


amount of 7s. 6d. under the Bill. The brunt of this is being borne by service industries outside development areas. There is the ludicrous position that in a development area manufacturing industry benefits at the expense of service industries, so that hotels in the Highlands may be subsidising industry for the Highlands. This may be logical, but the logic escapes me.<br/>
I ask my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary to recognise that, the Government having taken decisions for specific purposes at specific times, there is now a certain amount of legislation on the Statute Book which, together with the Clause, makes up the regional employment premium/S.E.T. legislation. I want my right hon. Friend to recognise that there is no logic in this and to agree that the Government will look at the whole thing again and consider whether perhaps, after all, they have not committed under every conceivable circumstance the country to paying regional employment premium for seven years. I ask them to look at the matter again, to study how it will affect people, and to agree that this will be the last occasion on which they come to Parliament to tamper with a little more of the R.E.P./S.E.T. structure, until the day comes when they have a brand new plan to replace it.<br/>
I have the gravest reservations about the Clause, but if my right hon. Friend can go some way to alleviating my concern on this point I have no doubt that, like other hon. Members, I shall accept it.</p>

<p>It has been demonstrated that many hon. Members believe that development areas enjoy an unfair advantage over other areas which are not so fortunately placed. The Chief Secretary referred to the speech I made last week. The points I made in that speech were not dealt with by the Government spokesman when he wound up in that debate. I feel even more strongly on this issue than I do over the general consideration of which areas should be designated as development areas.<br/>
I want to refer to industries which have been established for a long time and which quite fortuitously find themselves in an area which is now designated as a development area. I concede that

people who start from scratch in a development area incur many risks and high costs in establishing themselves in a new area where there is probably no industrial tradition and which is probably the sort of area which most of us used to envisage as a development area. I have in mind places where there is probably a coalmine or two but no experience in manufacturing work. I concede that those who go into development areas on that basis, require, and rightly receive some consideration.<br/>
This does not apply to industries which have been established for a very long time. Probably the trouble here is, not only that the Government have been too lavish in their aid to development areas, but that they have been too haphazard in their selection of development areas. It is manifestly unfair to take a whole country such as Scotland, which contains all sorts of long-established industries, and give those industries all these advantages at the expense of their competitors in other parts of the United Kingdom.<br/>
I have tabled an Amendment which, unfortunately, has not been called. I should like guidance as to how best to appeal to the Chief Secretary to give some consideration as a special case to industries which have been long-established. The seven years for the regional employment premium may be considered sufficiently long for such industries to enjoy these advantages. I would not mind if it were 10 years, or even 15, because the people to whom I have been referring have been established for far longer than that.<br/>
This is a great injustice to those firms and it will be accentuated by the addition of this 7s. 6d. I am not speaking on a purely constituency basis. This refers to the whole of the non-development areas, in which many people will be seriously affected. It is wrong that an additional burden of 7s. 6d. per week should be put upon them. I hope that I have impressed upon the Chief Secretary the injustice which is being done in this case.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Pudsey (Mr. Hiley) drew attention to some of the unfair competition which can result from this donation. I would have no objection if it could be conclusively shown that this was an incentive rather


than a donation. For it to be an incentive it is not sufficient that it be given to a firm which at present employs a certain number of workers. It must be given to a firm which, because of this incentive, will increase the number of workers it employs. This is the whole purpose of the Selective Employment Tax refund, as I understand it, and of the regional employment premium.<br/>
The difficulty is that nobody has any real conviction that this will go for the whole time required to enable people to plan ahead and create the factories and jobs necessary to take advantage of this commitment. As my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary said earlier, there is no commitment as to the future of the Selective Employment Tax refund, and therefore there is no future as to its incentive effects on people to try to increase the numbers they employ to take advantage of this. To enable people to make the plans, to lay in materials, etc., a number of years is needed. This was clearly accepted in the case of the regional employment premium. Therefore, this 7s. 6d. which is being given to manufacturers in development areas is virtually a donation.<br/>
It can be said that this will result in an extra profit to the manufacturers. Those who are not against all kinds of profits might accept that this is not necessarily a bad thing, but it is clearly wrong for the Government to increase or main. tam taxation to provide this kind of indiscriminate dole. We are becoming utterly confused between the incentive effects of increasing employment in the regions, which is wholly admirable, and giving a donation to manufacturers in development areas, which is not admirable.<br/>
I only hope that the donation has, at any rate, been reduced by the Clause in that we have reduced the areas in which it is to be given. I hope that this is a halt on the way to its ultimate abolition.</p>

<p>It is not always&#x2014;indeed, it is not very frequent&#x2014;that I find myself in sympathy with Treasury Ministers. I: has not happened in recent years. Yet, when the Chief Secretary was being addressed by the hon. Member for Lancaster (Mr. Henig) I found myself more and more sympathetic to the right hon. Gentleman, warmhearted towards him,

sorry for him in the difficult r&#x00F4;le he has to perform, and almost embarrassingly on his side.<br/>
The hon. Member for Lancaster lectured both his right hon. Friend and the Committee on the evils of this proposal and of the Clause. The hon. Gentleman announced, to my great relief and satisfaction, that he parted company with this side of the Committee even more emphatically than he parted company from the Chief Secretary. Although I wish nothing good to the hon. Gentleman, nevertheless I rather dread the day when I find myself in serious agreement with him on a problem of this kind, because I shall then be not only suspicious but wholly certain that I am in the wrong.<br/>
I very much agree with what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Pudsey (Mr. Hiley) about the benefits of development area circumstances being denied to many who would not only like them very much but might benefit from them considerably. One of my objections to the whole of this system is that it is administered by a Government machine which is slow-moving and ponderous, which is immensely convinced that it is always right and most reluctant to change the pattern of the past in any way, the consequences of this sort of process being disastrous for the country as a whole and highly prejudicial to that dynamism which the Prime Minister, in his days of credit, once prophesied he would bring to this country.<br/>
To take an example&#x2014;again, I am not making a constituency point here&#x2014;there are serious needs in the West Country. I do not suggest that these would be met by the main development area scheme, but what we badly want there, as elsewhere, is a considerable improvement in the infrastructure of the whole community. If the Government would only do the things which no one else can do, provide the roads and the training facilities and improve transport instead of making a muck of it, we should be very glad. But we fear this pattern from the past which is imposed and sometimes extended as misfortune strikes one area so that the development area system is spread, and with that spread the prejudice against other areas not covered is increased. The time has come to undertake a careful review of the whole system.<br/>
I agree with what my hon. Friend the Member for Pudsey said about our continuing advantages for ever to concerns which may not necessarily deserve them. I am sorry that the Amendment which he put down has not been selected for discussion because I think that it enshrines an important principle, although it may not be strictly relevant to this Bill. I am sorry that the Committee did not have a chance to pursue the point which my hon. Friend raised. What I fear here is the danger of giving subsidies to bad concerns and to concerns which are really just kept afloat by them and not helped to develop as they should.<br/>
The hon. Member for Ashton-under-Lyne (Mr. Sheldon) referred with great innocence and frankness to the disastrous confusion between incentive and donation. I warmly agree. We can see the pathos of it as hon. Members opposite begin to understand the confusions to which their claim to omniscience has led. They told us that they would plan this and organise that, but they made what is only a human mistake&#x2014;</p>

<p>If I may say so, the speech of the hon. Member for Pudsey (Mr. Hiley) answered the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster (Mr. Henig). If my hon. Friend fails to understand my answers, oft repeated in my humble way, he may understand more readily the answer given by the hon. Member for Pudsey. The hon. Member for Pudsey referred to what he called the unfair advantage over other less advantageously placed areas which the development areas enjoy. He returned to the same theme several times. It is his belief that those old-established firms which have been carrying on a satisfactory business now find themselves against a new competition engendered by the help given to development areas.</p>

<p>I am sorry. I was misled by some of the speeches into thinking that constituency matters were uppermost in some minds. I now understand that the hon. Gentleman was referring to an additional advantage enjoyed by firms in development areas. The point is exactly the same, and it answers the question put to me by my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster. My hon. Friend asked why it is that the regional employment premium, that is to say, an incentive which enables a manufacturer only in a development area to have an advantage over others elsewhere, does not create a demand upon resources whereas an incentive which takes the form of a payment or subsidy to every manufacturer in all areas does.<br/>
The hon. Member for Pudsey has given the answer. He does not like firms in development areas having advantages as a result of which firms in non-development areas tend to move or tend to expand in development areas at the expense


of expansion elsewhere or tend to withdraw their factories and their employment from regions, as my hon. Friend made clear, in South London, in order to move into highly difficult&#x2014;difficult in economic terms, that is&#x2014;development areas. This is the answer. It is a switch of resources. If my hon. Friend would be good enough occasionally to pay attention to what I say, he would see the point. I am sorry to put it so simply, but I have tried to answer him with my usual patience and, I hope, my usual courtesy. If, for example, he would read what I said in reply on Second Reading, or if he would read tomorrow what I have said several times today, he would see that I have endeavoured very hard to answer the question and make the matter perfectly clear.</p>

<p>The point I am making&#x2014;I am not the only one who makes it&#x2014;is this. What is the difference between the Government giving this 7s. 6d., or the whole 37s. 6d. for that matter, to areas in Lancashire which, massively, have unused resources and giving it to development areas which have unused resources? Why is one classified as spending and the other not? I see no difference.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend makes it difficult for himself by using terms which do not describe the facts. Let us return to the facts, and let me repeat what I have already said three times. In the non-development areas, the intermediate areas to which my hon. Friend refers, the level of unemployment as a whole is the same as the level of unemployment in the country as a whole. If, therefore, my hon. Friend picks out a particular intermediate area where there is a high level of unemployment, he must contrast that with a particular area in a development area where there is an extremely high level of unemployment. He must compare like with like.<br/>
My answer to my hon. Friend, if he will stick to the facts of the case, is that

giving an incentive which results in unemployed human resources being used in development areas and therefore results in a switch of demand from one area to another is a different proposition from giving an incentive over the country as a whole for manufacturers. That is why we are continuing with the policy of assisting development areas. The Clause does not detract from the benefit to development areas. The only speeches I heard which were not in favour of the Clause were in aid of removing the benefit from development areas, and I am sure that is not the wish of the Committee. Therefore, I hope that the Committee will be good enough to allow the Clause to stand part of the Bill.</p>

<p>I am sorry but I must return to the point. My right hon. Friend keeps making out that the purpose of the Clause is to continue the aid already given to development areas. Will he now at least be honest enough to admit that what the Clause does is to increase that aid? Also, will he answer, or admit that he is incapable of answering, the question that has been put to him many times: When and how did the Government reach the conclusion that 30s. was inadequate aid; why have they decided that 37s. 6d. is the right level; and for how long is it to remain the right level?</p>

<p>I think that it would be for the convenience of the Committee, Dr. Broughton, if we took these Amendments together, though the actual connection between them is perhaps rather tenuous. The first Amendment is concerned with


whether or not the export rebate withdrawal should not apply to contracts which are both written and oral, and Amendment No. 11 is concerned rather with the period of notices which those who think they are entitled to the export rebate are required to give before they are considered by the Board of Trade. Therefore, while I think there is some connection between the Amendments, it would be helpful if I divided my remarks in two.<br/>
The essence of the first Amendment is to ensure that in cases where a genuine contract has been made with regard to an export order though the contract has not been expressed in written form, the firm concerned should still get the export rebate, whereas if the Bill were passed in its present form it would be excluded from doing so. I think this a legitimate Amendment. We shall listen with interest to what the Minister of State has to say. This is a matter of considerable concern to a number of exporters who, following the exhortations of the Government about exports, find themselves in the post-devaluation period hit not only by the effect of the Government's other measures but also by the effect of the removal of the export rebate. I stressed on Second Reading that the Government had created a considerable amount of uncertainty about the whole question. We seek in the Amendment to clarify the position.<br/>
I think it true to say that the matter was partly explained in the speech by the Financial Secretary on 8th February. when he said, scpeaking about oral agreements:
<q>So far as the Government are concerned, it is our earnest wish to include as far as we can within the rules of practicability and proof required to protect public funds, all contracts whether oral or written where there is written evidence of the contract in existence before devaluation date. We have not yet found a solution to a widening of the Clause that would give complete effect to our wishes in this regard. We shall continue independently to seek such a solution."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 8th February, 1968; Vol. 758, c. 781.]</q>
We also have continued independently to seek such a solution, and the result is our simple Amendment.<br/>
Our essential point here is twofold. First, the right hon. Gentleman will be well aware from his high office of the

very large number of commercial transactions which are not normally expressed in written form until some time after the agreement between the two parties has taken place. This has been exemplified in a number of our institutions, particularly those in the City of London, where the expression "Our word is our bond" is taken as the whole basis of business by those engaged in commercial transactions.<br/>
It is necessary to stress that this is not simply a question of mere business morality. It is also backed up by a very real sanction. Any of those who break their word on an agreement even though it has not been expressed in writing may well find it very difficult, if not impossible, to go on doing business with the same customers or with other customers in the market who may hear of their action. Therefore, it is highly undesirable for those in the City of London and elsewhere who engage in contracts agreed originally on an oral basis to find themselves, because of action by the Government, placed in a position where their day-to-day affairs are jeopardised. I think it is common ground between both sides of the Committee that whenever possible we should go to very great lengths to ensure that people in this position do not have the Government participating in such a way that their ordinary commercial contracts deteriorate.<br/>
Secondly, we are by no means clear from the Clause itself why the export rebate has been withdrawn. 'The right hon. Gentleman will be well aware that the original intention of the rebate&#x2014;it came out clearly in the debates in 1964 and 1965&#x2014;was simply to offset certain indirect taxes, particularly fuel oil taxes, the Road Fund and so on, which exporters had incurred. It was in no sense&#x2014;I shall return to this point on later Amendments&#x2014;regarded as a protective device. Therefore, it would be wrong if some oral agreement were invalidated because the Government suddenly withdrew the offset which they had previously given. It would be a shame if ordinary commercial relationships were jeopardised because the Government had changed their policy rather than been forced to change their policy. This is something that we ought to consider. The Government have said that


the export rebate is no longer necessary. As I say, I think they have changed their ground to a considerable extent.<br/>
Also, the Clause is far too restrictive as it is now worded. If we accept the Bill as it stands, the Government are able to consider cases only where there has been oral agreement, and even if reasonable proof were produced of the existence of such an agreement, if the Bill is not amended in the form we suggest the Board of Trade will not be allowed to give the firm the export rebate. Perhaps the Minister of State can confirm Whether that is so or not.<br/>
In particular, we need to clarify the meaning of "written agreement" within the terms of the contract. Clause 2 says:
<q>if the relevant transaction (for cases within paragraph (a) as well as cases within (b) in brackets&#x2026;is a written contract of sale".</q>
I hope that the Minister of State will make clear exactly what is meant by:
<q>a written contract of sale, or a sale in pursuance o a written contract of sale".</q>
While he and hon. Members may well understand what is meant, the ordinary exporter, particularly the small exporter, may not. This is particularly pertinent because of the Financial Secretary's statement to which I have referred:
<q>&#x2026;all contracts whether oral or written where there is written evidence of the contract in existence before devaluation date.</q>
It may well be that there is written evidence but that within the legal terminology it is not a written contract. We shall have to consider the Minister's reply before we decide what action we should take about voting on that Amendment.<br/>
Amendment No. 11 is concerned with the period of notice to be given by a firm when applying for an export rebate which it believes falls before the very early and arbitrary deadline of 31st March which the Government have now announced. Three or four points arise on this.<br/>
First, many small exporters, perhaps preoccupied with their ordinary business interests, particularly if they are taking advantage of devaluation, may not be aware of the exact conditions under which the export rebate has been withdrawn until they suddenly find the effect of the withdrawal turning up in their accounts. The withdrawal has not had enormous publicity in the popular Press

so far, and a particular exporter may well not become aware of it until there is some positive action in a case affecting his firm. How long is it likely to be before someone who is entitled to the rebate, and who should perhaps put in a claim under the Clause, will know that the export rebate has been withdrawn on an order for which he thought it would be given.<br/>
Second, it may well be that the exporter will find himself at the peak of his business in the coming months. It very much depends on what trade he is engaged in. if he is exporting to New Zealand, his exports boom may be about September, because of the Christmas trade, but there are other trades where the peak period is in March, April or May. The documentation is very complex and even if the exporter knows about the need to claim for the rebate the last thing he wants to do&#x2014;or the Government want him to do&#x2014;is to spend time in the middle of his peak period sending off a vast number of forms, having them duplicated, taking up his secretary's time and so on. On these grounds as well there is a case for extending the tight time limit imposed.<br/>
Third, I understand that the Government are finding difficulty in administering the claims for export rebate through the normal machinery. I understand that they are normally administered through the Customs and Excise but that the claims for the non-withdrawal of the rebate are being dealt with by the Board of Trade. That presumably means that the Board of Trade must either take on extra staff or allocate people from one Department to another to help. Surely, rather than have a rush, with a whole pile of applications snowing the Department concerned under, it would be better if they were spread over a time, with the more convenient period we suggest.<br/>
On all three grounds there is no reasonable basis on which the Government could reject Amendment No. 11, and I hope that they will accept all three.</p>

<p>I warmly agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins). I find this kind of legislation unpleasant, if not odious, and I should want to be completely satisfied on the points my hon. Friend made.<br/>
Are the Government just anxious to secure the position by there being adequate written evidence of a contract? If so, are they satisfied that the courts will so construe the Bill? If they are not, they are taking a great deal too much for granted. The fact that they require
<q>&#x2026;a written contract of sale, or a sale in pursuance of a written contract of sale,&#x2026;</q>
makes it seem to me that they may be demanding formalities which will not ordinarily have been observed by many small firms. It may well be that a practice has grown up which was originally derived from documents. There may be a well-established commercial practice between two concerns. A perfectly legitimate and well-authorised sale may have taken place on the telephone which will not qualify under the Bill for a rebate, as it should. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will be able to allay the anxieties, because the Government are very often a little bit unrealistic in their conceptions of commercial practice, and they judge a good deal too much by their own way of running offices.<br/>
On the question of the time within which a claim must be made, Government Departments would do well to learn something from their practice, because there is not always spontaneity of reaction when one is communicating with them. Many people who write to the Ministry of Transport today do not find themselves embarrassed by an immediate reply. The Ministry is overflowing with complaints. There are often times when Government Departments do not respond with quite that speed which either their correspondents or Ministers would wish. Therefore, the Amendment asking for three months instead of one is very fair and well within the limits of the Government's understanding. I very much hope that the right hon. Gentleman will not only accept the Amendments but will make it absolutely clear that an informal contract based on a long period of practice would not be disqualified from a rebate to which it should, in equity, be entitled.</p>

<p>I am not quite sure about the position of Telex messages; I wonder if they would constitute a written contract of sale. A large number of firms now receive many contracts by Telex, confirming them subsequently.

Such is the confidence reposed in the Telex messages that some of the written and signed contracts do not appear until long afterwards, or, to an increasing extent, not at all.<br/>
It is also fairly clear that there is scope for much abuse, because anybody can sit down at a teleprinter and produce a contract months afterwards. Such is the custom, and such has been the way in which this very advantageous method of placing orders has been used to an increasing extent, that a fairly great area of hardship could be involved here.</p>

<p>I hope that I shall be able to give the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Peyton) some of the assurances he is asking for, but I ask him to excuse me, for the time being at any rate, a dissertation on the law of contract. I have to give it later and I must stick to the legal brief given to me for it, otherwise the Committee will be in trouble. I do not want to make observations about it off the cuff.<br/>
It is not, of course, for a Minister to try to make distinctions between Departments of the Government, but we at the Board of Trade are becoming slightly embarrassed by the number of messages we have received about the speed with which we deal with our business, and naturally I hope that this will continue.<br/>
I thank the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) for agreeing to take these Amendments together because it means that I can hope to get away with one speech instead of two. In relation to the first two Amendments, I agree that the exclusion of oral contracts&#x2014;or their apparent exclusion&#x2014;has caused some concern among certain groups of traders in the City and elsewhere because the Bill as it stands is confined to written contracts. But I think that I can give the hon. Gentleman the assurance he seeks about what we mean by contracts of sale and how this will apply.<br/>
It has been rightly pointed out, both on Second Reading and again today, that many trading contracts are made between firms here and overseas without any written contract at all and are scrupulously observed. The trader's word is enough. Those who deal with him know without dubiety that his word is his bond. They know that he will


honour the contract. Britain's reputation for honest dealing stands high in the world and I fully agree that we should cause grave damage to that enviable reputation if we even faintly suggest that Government and Parliament did not accept that the British trader's word was his bond, that he was not to be trusted and that we should insist on written contracts. That would be wrong and it is not the Government's intention.<br/>
We do, however, face a difficult issue here, as the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Enfield, West (Mr. lain Macleod) pointed out on Second Reading, when he put it very clearly. He said the Clause
<q>&#x2026;deals&#x2026;with written contracts but as the House knows, a great deal of the business of this country is done in the first instance by a verbal agreement. Hon. Members will recall the phrase on which so much of the City of London works&#x2014;'My word is my bond'&#x2014;and although I absolutely recognise that, in a matter where public money is involved, one must have special standards of proof&#x2014;that is not in dispute between us&#x2014;I suggest that if, say, the President of the Board of Trade was satisfied that a contract was an absolutely genuine one which might be enforceable, so to speak, in honour, though not necessarily in accordance with Clause 2. it would be right for the Government to consider an Amendment to that effect&#x2026;".&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 8th February, 1968; Vol. 758, c. 679.]</q>
I fully agree with the right hon. Gentleman's approach, but he begs the question that we have been asked to solve&#x2014;how is the President of the Board of Trade to satisfy himself that the oral contract was an absolutely genuine one which might be enforceable in honour? If we accepted the first two Amendments in this group, all oral contracts as well as written contracts would get a Board of Trade certificate if they satisfied the general conditions in terms of the Clause. In other words, all contracts, oral and written, would have to be examined by the Board of Trade.<br/>
This is where we come up against the legal and administrative difficulties. How does one examine an oral contract? We want to be helpful as far as it is practicable to be in a rather difficult case like this. Our officials and Customs and Excise officials, as the right hon. Gentleman will agree after his earlier remarks about Ministry of Labour officials, are skilled in solving problems of administration. They have examined this matter

thoroughly but they cannot find a way of carrying out the right hon. Gentleman's qualification that, in a matter where public money is involved, there must be special standards of proof.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to the Treasury dealt with this point on Second Reading. I shall not quote him fully but I must repeat one sentence he said:
<q>We cannot have an exclusively oral constract decided upon in this way."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 8th February, 1968; Vol. 758, c. 781.]</q>
I shall not go into detail but the Board of Trade is not equipped to conduct a series of oral examinations of innumerable exporters in order to decide who are to be believed when they say that they have entered into oral contracts and who are not to be believed. As I have said, we have tried to find a way out and I think that hon. Members must bear in mind that the Customs Department, under existing law, requires evidence of eligibility for the rebate. It has to see shipping documents, bills of lading and so forth, but does not necessarily have to see an individual contract and has no machinery for examination of trading contracts. Under this Clause, the job of examining contracts will fall upon the Board of Trade, and we have not the machinery for that either, because there has never been any need to examine them.<br/>
For the reasons I have given, we cannot take on the almost impossible task of examining and verifying oral contracts. It is inescapable that we must have some sort of written evidence that a contract is genuine, and we will go as far as we can to meet the arguments. But in practical terms, by and large, we shall be dealing with oral contracts and I hope and suppose that those contracts will be by firms which are well known and have impeccable reputations for honest dealing so that we can, therefore, accept, in most cases, correspondence acknowledging a contract made orally or a written acknowledgement of an order. That should cover most oral contracts because some kind of written evidence about an oral contract must appear at some time.<br/>
This we are prepared to do and do not need any Amendment to allow us to do it. I do not think that we can go any further. Indeed, I do not think that this Committee, with its keen scrutiny of public expenditure, would allow us to go any


further. As my hon. Friend the Member for Heywood and Royton (Mr. Barnett) said on Second Reading:
<q>There are opportunities for evasion in all sorts of legislation dealing with extracting money from taxpayers or giving money away."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL. REPORT, 8th February, 1968; Vol. 758, c. 690.]</q>
My hon. Friend went on to explain the difficulties of providing for oral contracts in this matter without written evidence.<br/>
I hope that, on the assurance I have just given, the Amendment will be withdrawn. I repeat that we will accept in most cases where we know the firms concerned correspondence or a written acknowledgment of an order as evidence, as it were, of a genuine contract. I do not think that we can say that in all circumstances&#x2014;and I do not think that right hon. and hon. Members opposite would ask us to do so&#x2014;oral contracts will be accepted because, obviously, we would land ourselves in difficulties in trying to keep the spending of public money properly under control. The opportunities for evasion under the Amendments would be such that we suggest that they should not be accepted.</p>

<p>I know that the right hon. Gentleman is trying to be helpful, and both sides of the Committee are trying to find an answer. There are two things which I do not understand at this stage. First, the right hon. Gentleman said that he can do this, as it were, by administrative arrangement, but is he not bound by the words in the Clause as it stands, which always refer to a written contract of sale? Secondly&#x2014;and this is a matter which gives some concern&#x2014;would it not be wiser in that case for the right hon. Gentleman to accept not necessarily our Amendment, for we are not set on the wording by any means, but some Amendment which will satisfy people that the Government are trying to meet this difficulty?</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman will agree that the second question is what matters. We have carried out the undertaking of my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary as far as we have been able, but we have not been able to find a form of words, or any way out of the difficulty which would still bring us

properly within the law of contract. This is the point which was made by the hon. Member for Yeovil and I shall have to deal with it later.<br/>
We are in difficulty because an oral contract can be enforceable in the courts without written evidence, which is something which we must take into consideration, but I am advised that in these circumstances we cannot take an oral contract, which could be and should be enforceable in the courts, and tell the Board of Trade that it must act in a judicial capacity and that it and not a court must decide whether it is a genuine contract. That is an impossible administrative task to give to a Government Department.<br/>
Earlier, the hon. Member for Yeovil was talking about discretion being given to Government Departments and spoke against giving unlimited discretion. In this instance he is asking a Department to make decisions which are clearly judicial and which a Government Department ought not to have to decide. We have come up against this problem in law with which I shall have to deal later. However, I am advised by our legal advisers that the Amendment is unworkable, that we cannot give the Board of Trade discretion to exercise in administration what is now a legal judgment, because no Government Department could decide whether an oral contract was a genuine contract. This is something to be decided only in the courts. If anybody, even at this late stage, can suggest a way round&#x2014;obviously, the Opposition have not been able to do so up to now&#x2014;we would consider such representations.</p>

<p>Although there may not have been a written contract of sale and although there may not have been a sale in pursuit of a written contract, there might still be a document which would be evidence of a sale having taken place. As the Clause is drafted, that writing, which at least would be evidence of a sale, would not be admissible.</p>

<p>We would accept that as evidence of a contract of sale in the circumstances which I have been describing&#x2014;if it were a genuine contract. If there is no contract, we have no problem, because nobody will have bought or sold anything. There would be either


an oral or a written contract of some kind, or at least a document backing up a genuine oral contract and if there were we would accept it as evidence in the circumstances when we knew the firms and knew that the operations were justified and so on.</p>

<p>If the issue goes to the courts and is a matter of interpretation, the courts must surely say that if no written contract of sale exists, there is no contract. I do not see how the Board of Trade could take evidence of a contract sale as making the sale eligible under the Bill as drafted. To do so would seem to be contrary to the wording of the Bill. I understand that the right hon. Gentleman is trying to help, but, however I read the provision, I cannot see how the Board of Trade would be allowed to take evidence of a contract of sale as being eligible.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1968-02-19a.89.1" hansard_membership_id="3174" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29470" speakername="Mr. Darling" colnum="89" time="">
<p>But that is what we are proposing to do. Generally speaking, the oral contract will be a genuine contract in these circumstances. The opportunities for evasion are clear, for anybody could say, "We made this oral contract some time ago and we are therefore entitled to the export rebate, although we have no evidence". There must be some kind of evidence. Whether we are getting foul of the law is something with which our legal advisers will have to deal, but we are prepared to accept correspondence between those concerned, the buyer and the seller, or some evidence of an order for the goods to be supplied, as evidence of a genuine oral contract. In other words, we now apply tine definition of a written contract to this sort of arrangement.<br/>
If there is some dispute, which means that some legal action is involved, it is for the courts and not the Board of Trade to decide and the Board of Trade will rave to take account of any judgment given in the courts. I do not know whether hon. Members with more experience of these matters than I have can imagine any circumstances in which this sort of issue would arise over a genuine contract which the Board of Trade had accepted as a genuine oral contract.</p>

<p>This is an important and highly complex matter. Let us suppose that no correspondence between the supplier in

this country and the recipient exists, or existed at the time the Bill was produced, but, as a result of the Clause, a letter can be produced from the recipient abroad, correspondence after that date, confirming that there was an oral contract before hand; would that be acceptable?</p>

<p>I am assured that a Telex reply to a Telex message is a written contract, so my hon. Friend need not worry any further.<br/>
We think that the period of one month from the date of the Royal Assent as being the time in which firms may apply for their pre-devaluation contracts to be certified is sufficient for the purpose. We discussed this with the C.B.I. which said that industry should have one month from the Royal Assent. In point of fact, it will have longer than one month in which to apply, because paragraph 3(2) of the Schedule permits the Board of Trade once the Bill is law to entertain applications made since the publication of the Bill. Public interest has already led more than 2,000 firms to approach us about contracts and more than 50,000 application forms have been made available to firms concerned. The Customs had already written to 23,000 firms about the Bill a few weeks ago. This means that any applications will be examined and also&#x2014;I do not know when the Bill will be on the Statute Book&#x2014;that the one month plus the previous period will give firms time to make applications.<br/>
Until the Bill is law&#x2014;I can see the right hon. and learned Member for Hertfordshire, East (Sir D. Walker-Smith) listening intently: perhaps this is the point that he was going to make&#x2014;the forms are not statutory, but I am sure that he would agree that their availability gives firms much more time than if we had not adopted this procedure. The hon. Member for Worthing said that we were asking


firms to work to a tight time limit, but if the Amendment were accepted, the practical difficulty is that some applications for certificates would not reach us until, perhaps, the end of May and such certificates would probably not be available in time for the Customs to deal promptly with the payment in June of rebate on exports made in April.<br/>
The reason is that the Customs deal with payment of rebate three months after the exports and this has been generally accepted as a good arrangement. The Board of Trade will have enough difficulty, as it is, in issuing certificates quickly if the period of application is no later than one month after Royal Assent. Firms will not be happy if we alter the arrangement for paying rebate. This explanation is an invitation to firms to apply now. It does not matter whether the firms or the small exporters are doubtful about whether their contracts satisfy the terms of the Bill: they can make their applications and we will have some time to sort them out.<br/>
I will consider again the question of publicity with our officials to see whether, in addition to the correspondence which the Customs have had with these firms, we should do something more to draw attention to the time limits. We can consider this&#x2014;</p>

<p>I am trying to follow the right hon. Gentleman's argument closely. I can see the case for the rebate being paid as quickly as possible and not over a longer period than in the past, but I do not see why this would be affected by the fact that a particular exporter who thought that he was entitled to the rebate should be allowed to put in his claim after three months rather than one.</p>

<p>We should get into administrative difficulties, because we have been working on this arrangement up to now. We have gone very carefully into this, and neither the Customs nor the Board of Trade wants to alter the arrangements, but we want to meet the hon. Gentleman's point, which is to give the applicants sufficient time. He says that one month is not enough, but the arrangements which we have been making in fact allow more than one month. I am sure that the course which we follow is appre

ciated by those concerned and would be welcomed by hon. Members opposite. To go further, however, would involve us in administrative difficulties which would not help the firms whose interests the hon. Gentleman is looking after.</p>

<p>I listened to the right hon. Gentleman with interest, I am sure that he is trying to help, but we find it impossible, try as we might, to accept his explanation. On oral agreements, the Clause will be extremely restrictive, unamended, and will mean that the Government will rely on written contracts of sale. Although we know that the Board of Trade will consider sympathetically any oral agreements which may have been made in good faith by firms of high repute, this is a matter of sufficient importance to justify our insisting on the Amendment. This matter may affect particular firms considerably and have repercussions on their permanent relations with their customers.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives (Mr. Nott) was justified in saying that he could not understand how the Government could extend their scope and grant rebates to people who had made oral agreements if the Bill were passed as it is. I would have thought that the right hon. Gentleman would have accepted the Amendment, given that, later in the same paragraph, the Board of Trade still has a right to consider the matter and decide, since it has to be satisfied that a genuine agreement has been made and that the export had taken place within the terms of the Clause otherwise.<br/>
So, this is not opening a floodgate but merely giving the Board of Trade greater scope to decide whether an agreement is genuine and whether it should be satisfied that the arrangement is reasonable. We still accept what my right hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, West (Mr. Iain Macleod) said on Second Reading, in the passage which the right hon. Gentleman quoted, but we cannot see that this is prejudiced by the acceptance of the Amendment. On a matter of this importance, when the Government have taken an arbitrary action in reciding to withdraw the export rebate on a date of which exporters had very little notice, it is up to them to formulate an acceptable Amendment and be rather more


lenient in these cases. We must adhere to the view in the Amendment given, that there are precautions against abuse.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman's argument about three months was a non sequitur. I say that with respect, because I always listen to his arguments with interest, but he argued clearly that, because the Board of Trade and the Customs and Excise normally pay the rebate after a given period which, accidentally, also is three months&#x2014;it would somehow completely disorganise matters if the people applying were to be given a little longer, namely, an extra two months. This does not follow at all. If they liked to apply earlier&#x2014;some could, if the contracts took place some time before&#x2014;there is no reason why the Government should not pay them the rebate as early as possible.<br/>
If that is not so, why should they not be allowed greater scope? This would probably relieve the pressure on Government staff. Given the arbitrary nature of the Government's decision, the important thing is not merely whether the Customs or the Board of Trade is happy, but whether the exporters find a longer period convenient. It may be that they are in the middle of a seasonal rush. It may be&#x2014;and one hopes that this would be the case&#x2014;that they are getting many extra orders in the post-devaluation period. If they are receiving extra orders, and if their staff for dealing with this kind of paper work is stretched, it is unfortunate that the Government should put an additional load on them. If there is a time limit on the basis suggested in the Bill, the natural tendency will be for the firm to say, "We must give priority to claiming the rebate on an export we made some while ago rather than to additional export orders".<br/>
There is clearly a case for giving greater scope in the Bill. I understand that we are to have separate divisions. I hope my hon. Friends will support the Amendments.</p>

<p>I should like to deal with two points which the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) has made about oral contracts. The phrase "written contract" covers all contracts which are evidenced in writing, including contracts by correspondence. I understand that this has been legally established and that we need not worry more about it. We can entertain oral contracts which are

the subject of written confirmation. The written confirmation creates a written contract for sale or hire as long as it complies with the relevant conditions of the Clause. I cannot agree that acceptance of the two Amendments on oral contracts would not open the door to evasion which could not be detected.</p>

<p>Would it not be better for the Minister to see whether the drafting of the Clause would be more suitably and better expressed by referring to "contracts evidenced in writing" as well as to "written contracts"? Every neophyte at the Bar has drawn statements of claim containing the words "by contract, partly oral and partly in writing. In so far as it was oral, it was made in such and such conversations; in so far as it was in writing, it was contained in such and such documents."<br/>
Under British law, the sale of goods is governed by the Sale of Goods Act, which makes it necessary for there either to be some form of acceptance or part performance, or for there to be some note or memorandum in writing of the contract made and signed by the party to be charged or his agent in that behalf. That is the evidence of the contract in writing rather than the contract originally existing in writing.<br/>
It may well be that the words "written contract" will be construed to cover all forms of contract, whether they be originally oral and evidenced in writing or whether they be a contract which, as originally made, is an agreement in writing. There may not be a great deal of practical importance in this because I cannot envisage many cases in which contracts are made for the export of goods without there being a sufficient memorandum in writing binding the parties and making the contract enforceable.<br/>
It might be as well if the Minister were to look at the drafting of the Clause and ensure that it is correct in the sense, not only that it will be construed as he says but that it will be so understood from the start and save the necessity of argument when the Bill has become law.</p>

<p>My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Hertfordshire, East (Sir D. Walker-Smith) made a very good point. There is a distinction between confirmation of an oral contract


which may constitute a contract and a contract which arises during correspondence and what the Minister referred to, which was evidence produced to the Board of Trade of an oral contract. Evidence produced to the Board of Trade of an oral contract is quite different from confirmation of a contract or a contract entered into in correspondence. Evidence to the Board of Trade of an oral contract does not, according to the Clause, allow the Board of Trade to give the export rebate.<br/>
I think that we on this side of the Committee are right. I do not see why the text is sacred. We are only in Committee.</p>

<p>I am only a layman, but I cannot see any legal difference between the contract evidenced in writing and a written contract.

<p>Amendment No. 12, is consequential on Amendment No. 13, and I am sure it is for the convenience of the Committee that these two at any rate should go together, and probably Amendment No. 21 as well.<br/>
The purpose of the Amendment is a fairly clear one and can be summed up like this&#x2014;where there is a contract which concluded before the statutory date, in dollars or other currencies, so that devaluation leaves the exporter in precisely


the same position as if he had contracted in sterling. The rebate should stand.<br/>
Although the right hon. Gentleman was unable, in spite of his efforts, to satisfy us on this side on the last group of important Amendments, I earnestly hope he will be able to do so on this one. I say that with some cause for he has put down an Amendment which appears to me, if I understand it correctly, to go a long way, if not the whole way, towards meeting this case.<br/>
Although I have tried to assess the extent of the coverage of trade covered by this Amendment that, nevertheless, the case which I have particularly in mind is one in which my own company is engaged, and, therefore, I have an interest there. It is an important contract for no fewer than 165 light aircraft in the American market where pricing is extremely keen. The total value over the years could be some&#x00A3;14 million. So it is no mean point in terms of export earnings. Like everybody else in our business, we have to take advantage of every kind of crumb of assistance like the export rebate, and naturally, it would make a severe difference to our prices if things went wrong.<br/>
Amendment No. 13 is reasonably simple, and it is presented as a straight additional condition, or superimposition on the conditions laid down in the Clause for acceptance by the Board of Trade for a certificate.<br/>
We now come to the right hon. Gentleman's Amendment No. 21, which I feel sure is designed to go some way to meet the same point, but I have to tell him that although I had read it several times I have not come to any precise conclusion as to what it means, particularly subsections (2A) and (2B). I think the depth of suspicion in the mind of the Parliamentary draftsmen must be virtually diabolical in assessing what firms will get up to in this connection; by contrast Machiavelli would have blushed for his innocence. I had hoped that my own rather less ambitious draft would have met the case.<br/>
No doubt the Minister will enlighten us about subsection (2A). I turn to subsection (2B). This persuades me that we are on the same point, for it reads:
<q>.. that the price is not payable in sterling and the contract provided for the price to be

reduced on a change in the exchange rate of sterling with the currency in which the price is expressed.</q>
There is only one word on which I would take issue with the right hon. Gentleman. It is not within the context of the contract which I have in mind but is a more general point. With respect to those who work so hard to produce these drafts, it would be more appropriate if we used the word "adjusted" instead of "reduced". A reduction takes account only of a downward adjustment. But, for example, if the Germans upvalued the mark&#x2014;and there has been talk of it&#x2014;an upward adjustment would occur. Then it looks as though the Board of Trade considers it likely that exporters will write the export rebate into their contracts as a proportion of the price which they are quoting, but I cannot see how any exporter would be brought to do such a thing.<br/>
The case which I have mentioned is by no means uncommon. The dollar contract was at the distributor's wish. It frequently happens in those circumstances in which one is distributing through Americans to the American market. In view of the speed with which this Measure was introduced, it is not surprising that the point escaped the notice of those concerned. I submit that the firm involved in this contract&#x2014;and I believe others in similar circumstances&#x2014;would be harshly treated if they suffered simply because the currency selected was other than sterling. I beg to move.</p>

<p>It would be most convenient if the right hon. Gentleman dealt with the Government Amendments but, in particular, will he tell us the extent to which they are the same as the Amendment in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Bedfordshire (Mr. Hastings) and the extent to which they are either broader or narrower?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1968-02-19a.105.1" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. Dading" colnum="105" time="">
<p>I will not do it quite in that way<br/>
We are in close contact with British industrialists, large and small, and we are always willing quickly to respond to useful arguments and representations made to us. After the Bill had been published we received representations, such as those rightly put to us by the hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire. I will no: discuss his Amendment in detail. He is suggesting an Amendment which would remove anomalies in the Clause and which would widen the concessions for pre-devaluation contracts. Although he is not clear whether the wording of the Government Amendments goes as far as he wishes, in fact 'they go much further, and his own Amendments are too narrow and do not widen the concessions enough. I will explain that when I speak about the Government's Amendments.<br/>
There are also some technical defects in the hon. Member's Amendment, as usually is the case when hon. Members, without the assistance of Parliamentary draftsmen, are trying to do a difficult operation. Any discussion of his Amendment would be unprofitable. I will, therefore, come to the Government's Amendments and explain what we hope, expect and believe they will achieve.<br/>
The object of these Amendments is to allow rebate on those pre-devaluation contracts whose terms deny the exporter any benefit from devaluation. Subsection (2,<i>b</i>) as drafted is both too narrow and too wide in imposing the condition, for this purpose, that the contract price must be payable in sterling. By itself, the condition denies rebate on a contract priced at&#x00A3;100 but payable in dollars, where before devaluation the exporter would have received 280 dollars but will now receive only 240 dollars and in terms of the sterling equivalent is no

better off by reason of devaluation. However, the existing condition allows rebate on a contract priced at 280 dollars but payable in sterling, where before devaluation the exporter would have received&#x00A3;100 but will now receive nearly&#x00A3;120. Amendments Nos. 20 and 21 remove that anomaly by catering for the various different combinations of the currencies of price and of payment, where no benefit accrues from the devaluation of sterling. I will explain, with some brief examples, how the Amendments will work in practice.<br/>
Take a contract priced at&#x00A3;100 in sterling. If provision exists in the contract to alter the price on a change in exchange rates or on withdrawal of rebate, then the supplier is protected against loss whether his contract is payable in sterling or, for example, in dollars. But if no such provisions exist and the price is payable in sterling, the supplier will receive only&#x00A3;100 and will suffer from withdrawal of the rebate. He accordingly, therefore, receives the concession which we propose&#x2014;in order to get rid of this anomaly&#x2014;under subsection (2A) of the Amendment. If the price is payable only in dollars, however, and there is provision for converting the sterling price into dollars at the pre-devaluation rate which would yield payment of 280 dollars, that would now be worth nearly&#x00A3;120. The supplier has thereby benefited from devaluation and will not suffer from withdrawal of the rebate. But if the sterling price under the contract was subject to conversion into dollars at the current rate, the supplier receives only 240 dollars, the present rate after devaluation, and would suffer on withdrawal of the rebate. He accordingly receives the concession proposed under subsection (2A) of the Amendment.<br/>
7.0 p.m.<br/>
There are reverse sorts of combinations of currencies and prices payable. These are dealt with under subsection (2B). For example, a contract is priced not in sterling but at 280 dollars. If that price is payable in sterling and no provision exists to convert the price into sterling at the pre-devaluation rate the supplier will receive nearly&#x00A3;120 instead of the&#x00A3;100 that he would have received formerly. The withdrawal of the rebate will, therefore, not cause him any hardship


and he therefore receives no concession. But if this 280 dollars price has to be converted into sterling payment at the pre-devaluation rate, he will receive only&#x00A3;100 and will, therefore, suffer from the withdrawal of rebate in the absence of any contractual provision for it. He therefore receives the concession.<br/>
On the other hand, if a contract priced at 280 dollars is payable in dollars, this would normally reap the supplier a gain on devaluation in terms of the new sterling equivalent of the dollar payment, but it' such a contract priced and payable in dollars provides that the price payable is to be reduced on a change in the sterling exchange rate, the gain will be eliminated. The supplier gets no gain. If the contract does not also cater for the withdrawal of the rebate, the supplier would therefore suffer unless he receives the concession we provide for in subsection (2B).<br/>
The Government Amendments therefore represent an attempt to extend the concession so that it relieves cases of hardship which have arisen and are not embraced as the Clause stands at present. In this respect the Government Amendments go further than the case covered by the Amendment put forward by the hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire.<br/>
At the same time, the Government Amendments remove an anomaly that at present arises under the Clause&#x2014;an anomaly which the hon. Member's Amendment would not remove&#x2014;whereby some cases that benefit from devaluation would remain eligible for rebate.<br/>
I am told that this represents only a small area of activities, and we have put that right. Most important, we have covered the issue raised by th hon. Member and in putting down our own Amendments we have sought this opportunity to meet many cases which have been brought to our attention. We are, therefore, carrying the concession further than is proposed by the hon. Member.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1968-02-19a.107.0" hansard_membership_id="6067" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/31177" speakername="Mr. Higgins" colnum="107" time="">
<p>The Committee is most grateful to the Minister for the extremely lucid way in which he has explained the Amendments. We also thank my hon. Friend for the great trouble he has taken in putting down his Amendment. In terms of comprehensibility, my hon.

Friend's Amendment seems preferable to those of the Government. Perhaps we may probe a little further in order to see whether that is the case. The Minister says that my hon. Friend's Amendment would widen the concessions for pre-devaluation contracts, and then says that the Government Amendments would widen them even more.<br/>
I want to run quickly over the ground that has been covered. The Minister identified four cases&#x2014;first, the case where a firm does not gain from devaluation in terms of pounds, in which case people should still get the rebate; secondly, the case where a firm does gain from devaluation, in which case the firm should not gain; then, thirdly, there are the reversals of the release, so that if the gain is eliminated the firm gets the rebate and, fourthly, if the gain is not eliminated it does not get the rebate.<br/>
This raises a rather important point of principle. As I understand it, the question whether a company does or does not get a rebate is to be determined by the outcome in the post-devaluation period, not on the basis of when the contract was made&#x2014;which is the criterion laid down in the rest of the Bill&#x2014;but on the date the money was converted. That is a different principle and it is questionable whether it is a right one.<br/>
Should not we be concerned, as we are in other parts of the Bill, with the question when the contract was made, whether it was a firm one in writing, and so on&#x2014;rather than the question whether, after the devaluation period, the company should or should not have a rebate, depending on what it got in pounds sterling? All these were contracts entered into in good faith before the date of devaluation as well as following it. Perhaps the Minister will comment on this point. It is a complicated matter, and I should be glad to be told what principles the Government are applying.<br/>
Secondly, my hon. Friend pointed out that there were two distinctions between the Government Amendments and his. The first was that the Government Amendments apply only in the case of a reduction in the amount payable in sterling, when the contract should be expressed in that way. We can understand, for the reason that we have been discussing, why the Government want to


do it that way, but is it not conceivable that a contract may not have been expressed in that way? It may have been expressed either in terms of gain or of loss. The Government say that everything is all right, but a contract may have given a two-way option, and if the contract was expressed in that way the Government Amendment will not cover the case.<br/>
Thirdly, as the right hon. Gentleman defined it, the Government Amendments refer to contracts stipulating that there is no prevision for the alteration of the terms of the contract on the withdrawal of the export rebate, whereas my hon. Friend's Amendment makes no reference to export rebates. We are not clear why the Government should specify that. I should be very surprised if any such contract existed. I would not have thought that anyone would have entered into such a contract, even with the greatest foresight. Has the Minister any experience of any such contracts having been made?<br/>
Finally, I want to raise a relatively simple question. The right hon. Gentleman says that the Government Amendments go far wider than my hon. Friend's Amendment. Are there any respects in which my hon. Friend's Amendment goes wider than the Government Amendments?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1968-02-19a.109.0" hansard_membership_id="3174" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29470" speakername="Mr. Darling" colnum="109" time="">
<p>On the last point, I do not think that the hon. Gentleman's Amendment goes further than the Government Amendment in any respect. That is the best answer I can give, off the cuff, after some examination and discussion of the matter.<br/>
As for the date of conversion, that date governs whichever rate applies whether pre-devaluation or post-devaluation. This, in turn, governs the question whether the benefit accrues from devaluation. If it does the exporter does not need the rebate for his gain, more than to offset loss of such a rebate. Therefore, it depends on the terms of the contract whether the date of the conversion of the currencies is pre-devaluation or post-devaluation.<br/>
In the question of a contract providing for the two-way option the hon. Gentleman asked whether I knew from experience of any contracts that did not contain Provision for the elimination of the

rebate. Offhand, I cannot answer that question. I do not know of any contracts that would provide for the two-way option, but before the end of the debate I shall try to answer that question and the hon. Gentleman's reference to the export rebate.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for his considerable exposition of a most complicated matter, and to my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) for probing further, and bringing out one or two important and substantial points that I had not myself mentioned. I am inclined to accept the Minister's assurance that his Amendment covers the point I have in mind, which turns out to be only one of several aspects&#x2014;and that his Amendment does in some respects go further than mine. Naturally, I also accept the fact that there may be defects of drafting in my Amendment which are not apparent.<br/>
Perhaps I should also add a certain apology that in my ignorance I had felt the first half of the right hon. Gentleman's Amendment was due to suspicion in the Board of Trade about what exporters might be up to, instead of making constructive proposals for carrying my own Amendment further.<br/>
In those circumstances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</p>

<p>I beg to move Amendment No. 14, in page 3, line 25:
<q>Provided that subsection (1) above shall not apply if the Board of Trade are satisfied that the relevant transaction arises out of an irrevocable bid or tender submitted before 19th November 1967 and that the terms of such bid or tender could not be renegotiated.</q>
I regard this as the most important Amendment of those we are discussing. It deals with the question of irrevocable bids and tenders which, together with the question of oral contracts, was referred to by myself in the Second Reading debate on 8th February. The reply given by the Financial Secretary could scarcely have been more favourable. Part of it


has been quoted already, but at the end he said:
<q>We shall continue independently to seek such a solution. It is gratifying that the right hon. Gentleman will attempt such a solution. We shall certainly look on any Amendment put forward and will not turn them aside too lightly.</q>
<q>The same point goes to irrevocable tenders as to oral agreements. The question of contracts which are in honour binding on a British firm will be looked at too because we are not anxious to quibble or make pedantic objections to exclude these contracts."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 8th February, 1968; Vol. 758, c. 781.]</q>
Personally, I was delighted, and I think the House was, to hear those words and we expected that in regard both to the oral contract and the irrevocable bid and tender, suitable Government Amendments would be tabled.<br/>
In fact, neither of such Amendments has appeared. We have dealt with the question of an oral contract. The right hon. Gentleman said that he was very sympathetic, as he always is, but that the Government could not find a way of achieving what they wanted to achieve in the form of an Amendment, but that much of what we wanted could be done by the Bill as it is. I think that that is a fair summary of his argument.<br/>
7.15 p.m.<br/>
We did not find it satisfactory, for the reasons given by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Hertford-shire, East (Sir D. Walker-Smith), and we divided the Committee. We shall certainly do that again unless the Minister is prepared on the irrevocable bid or tender, not to give us some assurance that the administration will be sympathetic&#x2014;I am sure that it will be&#x2014;but to write into the Bill something that will bring some comfort to those who find themselves in a difficult position as a result of devaluation and the various actions that have stemmed from it.<br/>
If I may say so&#x2014;and I do not in the slightest way intend to be patronising to the right hon. Gentleman&#x2014;when a guarantee, as I regard it, is given by the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, the right thing for the Minister to do is to write a short minute to his Department saying, "This is a good point and we must meet it. Tell me how." And that will always be done. But if one has an

elaborate argument for and against, all sorts of considerations&#x2014;including pride of authorship in the Bill&#x2014;come into play, and one is apt to land up with what I would call the sort of unhappy answer we had on the last point.<br/>
I say that by way of introduction: the point itself I can put fairly briefly. It arises out of the length of time that often occurs between a bid and the time that a contract comes to fruition. I take as my first example an extract from a letter sent to one of my colleagues from the Leeds Incorporated Chamber of Commerce. It states:
<q>&#x2026;I have before me a tender of an approximate value of&#x00A3;750,000 to an overseas Government which was dated 7th June, 1966. It was accepted by cable dated 9th August, 1967, confirmed by letter dated 13th October, 1967. Further correspondence and cables followed to finalise details&#x2026;</q>
and a letter
<q>offered 'further help in drawing up the final Agreement to reflect this Contract.' This was sent on 10th November.</q>
It may be that the right hon. Gentleman will answer&#x2014;and, of course, he can have details of the case if he wishes&#x2014;that this case is one in which the President of the Board of Trade could accept, in spite of the strict wording of the Measure, the clear intention of the overseas client and the person putting the tender in this country, but there are a number of other possibilities which perhaps it would be as well to bring forward.<br/>
The second type of transaction is that which relates to a tender submitted before 19th November, 1967 but accepted after that date. The written contract of sale will come later and, indeed, may not yet have arrived. It is important to realise in this case that these difficulties often arise out of the tactics of the overseas purchaser, with which the bidder in this country, if he wants to get the order, simply has to comply. It is not a voluntary move on the part of the British exporter: if he wishes to obtain the order, he has very little alternative.<br/>
I give a third example. Let us suppose that a firm puts in a bid for an overseas order and that the period of the bid is, say, two months. Subsequently&#x2014;and this happens very frequently&#x2014;the prospective purchaser says that he needs a little longer&#x2014;perhaps another month&#x2014;to make up his mind and pays a sum&#x2014;it may be quite small; say&#x00A3;100&#x2014;to keep


the tender open. My understanding of the law is that if that sum is accepted it binds both parties to the terms of the tender and the British exporter's bid for it. He is therefore bound, not just in honour but by a contract that can be enforced, to a bid which has taken into account such matters as the export rebate which may well not be able to figure in his final calculations.<br/>
I am assured that in Scottish law all tenders could be held to be binding without any consideration whatever, but I do not invite the right hon. Gentleman to go into the complications of Scottish law. I do not understand it myself; I have enough to do trying to sort out what we think English law may be in relation to irrevocable bids and tenders. Frequently these matters arise from the tactics of the overseas purchaser. As we read the Bill, unless an Amendment of some sort&#x2014;as usual, one is not wedded to the particular words on the Notice Paper&#x2014;is inserted, there may well be considerable difficulty in a firm in this country obtaining the export rebate.<br/>
I have just been given an illustration of the firm of Stothert and Pitt, crane makers of Bath, who lodged a firm and <i>bone fide</i> tender with a Brazilian public authority for the supply of five cranes. The value of the tender was about&#x00A3;750,000. The firm holds a letter of intent issued by the Brazilian authority within the validity of the tender, although no formal contract has yet been signed, and the export rebate would have been about 2 per cent. of the f.o.b. value at the time of the shipment. I dare say hon. Members on both sides of the Committee could multiply examples of this kind, but I do not think that is necessary: I think I have said enough to show that a problem does exist. It is common ground between us that we want to find an answer, but so it was last time, and this time we must press the right hon. Gentleman to go a little further and to put something into the Bill. If he cannot do that now because there may not be a Report stage, it could be done in another place.<br/>
According to our reading of the law and of the Bill&#x2014;the Financial Secretary did not dissent from this&#x2014;irrevocable bids and tenders are not covered by Clause 2. Yet these bids are often for very large sums of money and the period

it takes to bring the contract to fruition is often measured in years rather than in months. This is a situation which both sides of the Committee want to improve. We feel strongly that it should be met by an Amendment to the Bill.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1968-02-19a.114.0" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Darling" colnum="114" time="">
<p>This is where I proceed to stumble through the jungle of the law of contract without the guidance of the Financial Secretary who is unable to be here today and whose presence I would wish to have. I have discussed the whole matter with our legal advisers and I hope that I can reply sensibly to the right hon. Gentleman. I say at once that the undertakings given by the Financial Secretary were carried out. We have tried to find a way out, as I think the right hon. Gentleman will appreciate when I pursue the arguments before me.<br/>
Let us be clear that we are discussing an Amendment which says that the conditions we have laid down to get the concessions and so on will apply&#x2014;
<q>Provided that subsection (1) above shall not apply if the Board of Trade are satisfied that the relevant transaction arises out of an irrevocable bid or tender submitted before 19th November 1967 and that the terms of such bid or tender could not be renegotiated.</q>
The effect of the Amendment would be to allow rebate to be payable on exports made after 31st March under contracts entered into at any time after devaluation, as long as the contracts in question were the subject of irrevocable pre-devaluation bids or tenders in terms which could not be renegotiated. We have obviously to stick to the words of the Amendment. Such a widening of the scope of the concession would not only render rebate payable for an indeterminate period on an indeterminate number of transactions, depending when and how many of the bids and tenders in question resulted in firm business: it would also be extremely difficult&#x2014;in fact impossible&#x2014;to administer, since the onus of deciding whether the bids and tenders were irrevocable and whether they could not be renegotiated would fall on the Board of Trade.<br/>
I hope that the right hon. and learned Member for Hertfordshire, East (Sir D. Walker-Smith) agrees that whether a bid or tender is irrevocable is a question of law, not of evident fact, and is only to be determined with certainty by the courts. By no means all irrevocable bids


and tenders are accompanied by a financial bond as a warranty of intent, so that could not be used as a distinguishing mark an irrevocable contract in all cases. In attempting to make a distinction, the Board of Trade would be drawn into a most complex field of contract law, where administrative decisions have no proper place.<br/>
If, in order to avoid this problem, the Bill were to be widened still further so that all bids and tenders were eligible without regard to whether they could be revoked or not, the door would be wide open to every sort of negotiation current at devaluation&#x2014;and the provision would thereby be open to every sort of abuse, since evidence of negotiation would be as easy to manufacture as it would be impossible to refute.<br/>
We have given a great deal of serious consideration to the possibility of devising some provision to deal with the problem for which the right hon. Gentleman seeks to cater. The conclusion is inescapable, however, that it is impossible to devise a practical solution. In the half dozen or so cases of bids, tenders, offers, letters of intent and so forth which have so far come to light, the question of irrevocability has been far from clear-cut.<br/>
In the normal course, an offer or a tender with a specified time limit in which it may be accepted is not irrevocable; it may be withdrawn at any time during its currency. Even when the offer or tender has become the subject of a letter of intent by the buyer, it is far from certain whether, simply by that token a legally binding contract exists. Usually, the contract itself has still to be negotiated in detail&#x2014;a process which often takes many months after a letter of intent has been issued. It is certainly not unknown, moreover, for a buyer who has issued a letter of intent to a bidder, to fail to conclude the subsequent contract. The buyer may simply not pursue the business at all, or he may place it with a supplier other than the one to whom he issued the letter of intent. If the buyer can withdraw in this way, so, too, can the supplier, whatever they may have said to each other in letters of intent and whatever tenders may have been submitted.

7.30 p.m.<br/>
Throughout the whole of this area of contract&#x2014;I do not have sufficient practical experience to enable me to pretend that I am an expert&#x2014;the legal nature, I am advised, of whatever commitment may have been entered into, short of a fully-fledged contract of sale, can be determined with finality only by a court of law. The Board of Trade can clearly not afford to apply the concession to anything less than a commitment which, in law, is a contract binding both parties without qualification. As I have said, if the concession were so applied in circumstances where the would-be supplier could in law withdraw, all firms with any sort of negotiation on hand before devaluation, would also be entitled to the benefit of rebate. It is, therefore, vital to draw the line at contracts of sale made before devaluation.<br/>
This in itself is already a substantial concession, since changes of policy in fiscal matters do not normally make exception for business currently in hand. Thus, for example, when the rebate was first introduced, firms with business on hand benefited from it immediately and will now also receive the benefits of the concession on eligible pre-devaluation contracts.<br/>
Under the subsection as drafted, where the goods are exported pursuant to a written contract the Board of Trade's function is confined to certifying the matters specified in the subsection&#x2014;that is, that the contract was made before 19th November, 1967, that the price for the goods was payable in sterling, and that it was not subject to alteration on a change in the exchange rate of sterling. Admittedly, before the Board can certify those matters it must be reasonably satisfied that there is a contract, and for that purpose it will have to look at all the documents which the exporter produces with his application.<br/>
It will not always be an easy task to be absolutely certain that there is a contract and, where the contract is by correspondence, there may be doubtful cases, but these will be on the borderline. It should be reasonably practicable in the generality of cases to reach a broad conclusion as to the existence of a contract and to distinguish those cases


in which the basic elements of offer and acceptance of the essential terms are missing.<br/>
In those cases where the Board cannot accept that there is a contract, the exporter is entitled in the last resort to appeal to the courts, and if the courts take a different view the Board will have to look at the matter again and consider whether it can certify in accordance with the subsection.<br/>
The view that I am advised to give to the Committee is that to extend the subsection to take in irrevocable bids or tenders the terms of which could not be re negotiated would be impose upon the Board an impracticable function which is clearly one which can be properly discharged only by the courts. The Amendment does not seek to define what is an irrevocable bid or tender and it would leave the Board to determine in all the difficult circumstances of cases such as these whether on the known facts the bids or tenders could or could not be renegotiated. We believe that this is a task for an expert tribunal possessing all the necessary qualifications of skill and experience. Moreover, whereas in the case of contracts the difficulties of construction will arise only on the borderline and in relatively few cases, in the case of irrevocable bids and tenders the difficulties must in the nature of things arise in every case.<br/>
It is regrettable that in our endeavour to soften the blow to transactions in the pipeline on devaluation we cannot go beyond written contracts or the contracts we spoke about when we discussed oral contracts. If there are to be concessions, we have to accept that the machinery must be administrative and not judicial. For the reasons which I have already given, if we try to impose on the administrative machinery a task which can be discharged only by a judicial tribunal, that machinery must break down and make the operation of these concessions impracticable.<br/>
Far these reasons, I must advise the Committee to reject the Amendment.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman has made his case on the basis of the administrative difficulties and has suggested that, if the Amendment were incorporated into the Bill, the

Board of Trade would have to in effect discharge functions that properly rest with the courts. The right hon. Gentleman was good enough to say that he hoped that I would agree that the interpretation of these matters was a matter of law. That is so. The construction of documents is a matter of law and is for the courts.<br/>
When the right hon. Gentleman developed his argument, he was obliged to concede that the Bill already puts upon the Board of Trade the duty of deciding whether certain agreements are in fact enforceable contracts in law. This is also a function for the courts, but it is one that the right hon. Gentleman has accepted for the Board of Trade in the context of the Bill. He seeks to get out of that dilemma by saying, "But in the case of contracts most of them would be fairly clear and it would not arise very often". That is a good classic defence of the housemaid's baby type brought into these contractual considerations.<br/>
Although I am not wedded to the wording of the Amendment, as my right hon. Friend is not, I still find difficulty in understanding why the principle should be unacceptable. If a tender is made without any qualification as to time, it is revocable at any time before there is a sufficient acceptance by the purchaser of the offer. As I understand it, the Amendment is directed to the case where there is included in the invitation to tender a condition that the tender, once made, shall be, as it were, left on the table and not be open to amendment for a given period. If such a condition is expressed in the invitation to tender, the tender is made subject to that condition and an acceptance can be made at any time within that defined time limit and such acceptance means that a contract is formally concluded between the parties. That is my understanding of what my right hon. Friend means by an irrevocable tender.<br/>
It is true that the purchaser is not bound to the individual tenderer during that period, because a condition is put by the purchaser into the invitation to tender to secure his own position. The fact that he is not bound does not mean that he is not able to bind the tenderer by an acceptance of his tender within the unconditional time limit which is contained in the invitation to tender. As


I understand it, that is the case which my right hon. Friend puts forward. It seems to be a valid case. I cannot see why there should be this great difficulty in construing the documents to see whether there is such a time limit making the tender irrevocable within that period. It may have to go to the courts for final determination by them, but so may the contracts which already figure in the Bill. Therefore, the principle of the Amendment is valid and not to be negatived by any argument so far put forward.<br/>
I am not very happy about the final words of the Amendment, "could not be renegotiated". Anything can be renegotiated subject to the agreement of the parties. Therefore, I think that the words as they stand are not apt to express what I imagine my right hon. Friend's meaning to be. What I understand to be intended here is that there can be no unilateral right to renegotiate, that is, to make an amendment of the tender by the tenderer without the agreement of the purchaser. But these are matters which, as my right hon. Friend fairly said, can always be taken care of by the undoubted skill of Parliamentary draftsmen.<br/>
I do not know whether the Minister of State has brought conviction to my right hon. Friend's mind. He has not done so to my mind. He has made the matter out to be more difficult and complex than it would need to be, and I hope, therefore, that his reply is not the Government's final view on the Amendment.</p>

<p>I very much agree with what my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Hertfordshire, East (Sir D. Walker-Smith) has said. The righ thon. Gentleman has made this matter appear more difficult than it is, and I hope that he will think again. We shall vote in this House, but there is another place in which he can have second and, if I may say so, more courteous thoughts in relation to the House of Commons. I do not say that in any sense as a reflection on the speech which the right hon. Gentleman delivered. As usual, he went out of his way to be extremely sympathetic, but I must remind him of

the origin of this Amendment and of our debate upon it.<br/>
It is common that a member of the Government says, "There can be no commitment, but we shall look at this at the next stage of the Bill". One realises that they will look at it, but we have very little chance, if any, of getting what we propose. The Financial Secretary to the Treasury, however, went very much further. The hon. Gentleman said:
<q>So far as the Government are concerned, it is our earnest wish to include"&#x2014;</q>
and so on&#x2014;
<q>We shall continue independently to seek such a solution&#x2026;We shall certainly look on any Amendment put forward and will not turn them aside too lightly&#x2026;The question of contracts which are in honour binding on a British firm will be looked at too because we are not anxious to quibble or make pedantic objections to exclude these contracts."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 8th February, 1968; Vol. 758, c. 781&#x2013;2.]</q>
Any Parliamentarian listening to those words would unquestionably come to the conclusion that this point would be met. There is no other way in which the Financial Secretary's observations to the House of Commons could be honoured save by meeting the point.<br/>
It was not as though the Financial Secretary was responding off the cuff. I spoke at the beginning of the debate, and he made the final speech just before 10 o'clock. This was almost the last point he made at a minute or two before 10 o'clock. He had had the whole day, and I cannot believe that there was no consultation between the Treasury and the Board of Trade. Neither can I believe that those words of the Financial Secretary to the Treasury represent a view which the Board of Trade finds impossible to meet.<br/>
The Minister of State today spent a lot of his time&#x2014;one always does this when one has a bad case&#x2014;in criticising the drafting of the Amendment. This is absolutely irrelevant. The drafting of an Amendment put forward by the Opposition is a peg, an excuse, on which the House or its Committee debates these matters. This is well understood. It is understood also that, if the Government have the faintest intention of taking the point, they will apply their own incomprehensible words&#x2014;all Governments do this&#x2014;to what looks a comparatively simple matter. That is the way these


matters are dealt with. It has no relevance whatever to the important question of the irrevocable bid or tender to criticise or dogmatise about the actual wording proposed.<br/>
This is why my right hon. and learned Friend was entirely right in his general observations and in saying that the Government are making much too heavy weather of this. The right hon. Gentleman said that if my words were accepted&#x2014;for the reasons I have given, the words themselves are not important&#x2014;they would&#x2014;I think that these were exactly his words&#x2014;extend the Clause to put an impracticable function on the Board of Trade. Very well. If that is so as a matter of drafting, it becomes the right hon. Gentleman's business, in view of the undertaking&#x2014;I can almost call it a promise&#x2014;given by the Financial Secretary, to find words which would within the law put a practicable burden upon the Board of Trade. That is his job. It is what draftsmen and officials are there for and, above all, it is what Ministers are there for. This is why we find his answer so disappointing.<br/>
7.45 p.m.<br/>
We shall certainly vote now, but there is another place in which the Minister can have second and wiser thoughts. There is&#x2014;I put it bluntly to him&#x2014;an obligation upon the Government, in view of the words used by the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, to meet this point by devising an ideal method of drafting or as near ideal as his legal advisers can contrive. I very much hope that we have not heard the last word on the subject, even if it be the last word in this House.</p>

<p>First, may I reply to the question which the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) raised? We know of many contracts with provisions for a change in terms on a change in exchange rates, but we have not yet encountered any with provision for the withdrawal of rebate. They may exist. They probably do. But it is our view that they should not attract the concession.<br/>
In reply to the right hon. Member for Enfield, West (Mr. Iain Macleod) I say at once that I have never from this side of the House attacked the drafting of Opposition Amendments. I have always

dealt with them as I dealt earlier today with the Amendment put forward by the hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire (Mr. Hastings), accepting that the drafting of Amendments, as I know from my own bitter experience on the Opposition side, is a difficult operation.<br/>
My comment about the drafting of this Amendment was that it was clear. It is a short and clear Amendment:
<q>Provided that subsection (1) above shall not apply if the Board of Trade are satisfied that the relevant transaction arises out of an irrevocable bid or tender submitted before 19th November 1967 and that the terms of such bid or tender could not be renegotiated.</q>
There is nothing wrong with the drafting. I take it to express the purposes and views of the right hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman attacked my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary for, in his view, giving a specific assurance that Amendments would be put forward to cover this question of irrevocable bids which cannot he renegotiated. But the right hon. Gentleman did not quote the full passage. What my hon. Friend said was:
<q>The next question is, will we extend the benefit given to written contracts entered into before devaluation to irrevocable dates and tenders? I should like to make clear to the House that the only considerations we have had in dealing with this matter are the necessity for proof of the contract having been entered into before the devaluation date and practicability in administering public funds. That is to say, we have to have some means whereby we can check whether or not a contract qualifies.</q>
He said a little later:
<q>The question of contracts which are in honour binding on a British firm will be looked at too because we are not anxious to quibble or make pedantic objections to exclude these contracts."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 8th February, 1968; Vol. 758, c. 718&#x2013;2]</q>
They have been looked at. Just as the right hon. Gentleman asks us to be forthcoming in trying to carry out our apparent undertakings, I ask him to accept that when we give undertakings of that kind we try to carry them out. That undertaking has been carried out. We have examined the contracts and looked into the question very carefully and have come to the conclusion that, to quote right hon. Gentleman's own words, we cannot find words within the law which carry out these wishes; we have come to the conclusion that these


matters can be determined only in a court of law. They cannot be determined by administrative action by the Board of Trade.<br/>
The right hon. and learned Member for Hertfordshire, East (Sir W. Walker-Smith) said that we are accepting the administrative responsibility, if I may put it in that way, for somewhat similar legal matters, which I say should be determined in a court of law. I think that the answer is that it is not quite like turning the baby out with the bath water because it is only a little one. The matters to which I referred before are matters where, with the facts before one, one can determine whether there is evidence of an undertaking that leads to a written contract. There will be very few borderline cases. Anybody who</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1968-02-19a.124.0" colnum="124" time="">
<p>disputes the Board of Trade's decision can go to law to decide whether the Board of Trade is right or wrong. We are not preventing them from doing that. But every single one of these cases would be in the category where, in our view, the determination of whether the tenders or bids are associated with a written contract must be decided in a court of law.</p>

<p>That would be convenient, Mt.. Jennings.<br/>
It is a piece of almost Pavlovian cruelty that the Minister of State, having spent the whole afternoon going through the severance agonies of the termination of the export rebate, should now have to extol the virtues of providing for its reintroduction. These two Clauses, containing the power simultaneously to terminate and to reintroduce the export rebate, surely constitute one of the weirdest conjunctions in Government legislation ever. It reminds me of the extraordinary instrument which the fabulous Dr. Strabismus, who invented a silent motor horn with the object of warning traffic without noise or disturbance. It was singularly ineffective and contradictory and that really reflects the juxtaposition of Clauses 2 and 3 of this Bill.<br/>
The difficulty is that we on this side have some doubt about the principle of the export rebate as such but, accepting the circumstances we are in today as being of a particular character. we believe that to sever it is a particularly ill-judged and ill-timed expendient. We know that the Government have done many things to counteract the effect of the alleged

bonus to come from devaluation&#x2014;the extra vehicle charges they are imposing, the higher import costs of materials which go into our exports, and so forth&#x2014;while the Six are introducing a value-added tax. In our opinion, therefore, the introduction of this Measure amounts to counting our chickens before they are hatched.<br/>
If the Government expect there to be a huge surge of exports they had better wait until that surge comes before they begin taking away benefits which exporters felt they had through the rebate. In practice, though not in principle perhaps, this is a foolish time to withdraw the export rebate. But having done that, to compound the folly by taking discretionary measures selectively to reintroduce it is to produce the worst of all worlds. It is bound to make enemies everywhere.<br/>
Because it is selective, it is bound to leave most British exporters unrequited because, in the nature of things, it will leave a lot of them out. At the same time, it will succeed in imposing a general statutory threat to all foreigners which they will all feel to be pointing specifically at them, as most people do when these rather dark provisions of a threatening character are imposed in legislation.<br/>
But to us the really bizarre aspect of the provision lies in the way in which the selectivity would work out. It is in the light of this and of the damage we think that this Measure will do to the spirit and letter of the G.AT.T. that we ask the Committee to reject Clause 3 as it stands and accept our Amendments in the absence of any further assurance from the right hon. Gentleman.<br/>
8.15 p.m.<br/>
I want to draw attention to some of the peculiar repercussions of the selectivity feature of Clause 3. Power selectively to bestow an advantage on a certain


country seems to be within subsection (3,<i>c</i>). If that is so, the provision is surely meaningless. If the country on which a selective benefit is bestowed is a signatory to the G.A.T.T. then. under the G.A.T.T., that selective benefit must be applied right across the board. In that case, what is the purpose of taking selective powers which must then be applied universally?<br/>
If the country concerned is not a signatory of the G.A.T.T., what is the point of applying unilateral benefits to a country from which there is no written-in reciprocity? This would only scandalise our co-signatories in the G.A.T.T. and to that extent lose an advantage in that selected country. Looking at the list of non-signatory countries, one wonders whether there is anything in this for us. It is a diverting pastime. Apart from the Eastern European countries, with which we must make special arrangements because it is impossible to tell whether they are discriminating unfairly or not, we find ourselves involved in possibly bestowing unilateral or one-sided or limited selective agreements with such small countries as Afghanistan, Costa Rica, even Lichtenstein and, most bizarre of all. the Vatican.<br/>
What purpose is there in taking special powers to enter into special beneficiary arrangements outside G.A.T.T. with the Vatican, probably annoying many other people in the process?<br/>
This sort of thing will arise under the selective provisions of the Clause. I suspect that attempting to bestow a selected advantage is not the purpose behind the Government's drafting. We have the evidence not only of the Prime Minister, but of the Chief Secretary from the way in which he handled this matter when he introduced the Bill. I suspect that the real purpose of this selectivity is not as an instrument to provide selected concessions to small non-members of G.A.T.T., but to be a form of tariff rearmament, and we object strongly to that. We believe that the Chief Secretary was much nearer the mark when on Second Reading he warned us of the dangers of any measures which smacked at all of tariff restriction, when he suggested that even the rebate was liable to do us more damage than good. Yet if

the Clause is a defence mechanism, a form of rearmament, a kind of self-defence against measures taken by other States, it is totally unsatisfactory.<br/>
I remind the Minister of State that it is completely against, if not the letter, then the spirit of G.A.T.T. to take unto ourselves power to reintroduce an export rebate, across the board or even selectively against certain members of G.A.T.T., as an instrument of retaliation. This is where the selectivity is so bizarre and inexplicable, because if it is a form of retaliation, it must be applied to all G.A.T.T. countries if it is in any sense to pass the test of whether it is a form of tariff discrimination. It must be applied universally. If it is to escape the charge of being simply a discriminatory tariff, a defence weapon, it must occupy the position which it at present occupies, namely, what the Government consider to be a legitimate kind of domestic instrument which is non-discriminatory and not against the rules of G.A.T.T. But if they propose to reintroduce it as a weapon of defence, they will run into all sorts of difficulties with G.A.T.T.<br/>
Is it proposed simply to introduce it as a weapon of selective defence against countries which are not signatories of G.A.T.T., which is the impression which we gained from the Financial Secretary? In a rather light-hearted aside, he observed that one very obvious example of the way in which the reintroduction of the export rebate would not be against G.A.T.T. would be its reimposition
<q>&#x2026;selectively in relation to countries which are not themselves subscribers to the G.A.T.T.&#x2026;"&#x2014;[OFFIcint, RFPORT, 8th February, 1968; Vol. 758, c. 781.]</q>
If that is the purpose, it is a ludicrous situation.<br/>
Either the Government are correct in saying that the export rebate has a marginal effect on exporters and is therefore quite unimportant, in which case its selective reimposition as an offset to some act of discrimination by third countries, not members of G.A.T.T., will have no effect at all, because, by definition, it is an instrument which has no effect on exporters, or it is conceded, as it must be in logic from what the Government are doing in the Clause, that the export rebate will have an effect in offsetting some sort of discriminating or tariff restrictionist act by


a third country. Then the only effect of its reimposition, with a corresponding relief to exporters in respect of third countries, is to distort and divert trade precisely in the direction of the country against which it is aimed, because exporters will have a built-in incentive to claim the export rebate and to redouble their export efforts precisely in the direction of those countries which are discriminating against us.<br/>
The idea of the Government solemnly writing into our legislation, because they believe the export rebate to be an effective weapon of retaliation, a built-in incentive for this country to maximise its trade with countries such as Afghanistan, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Lichtenstein, Andorra and the Vatican precisely because those are third countries, non-signatories of G.A.T.T., which might enter into some sort of tariff restriction is too ludicrous to contemplate, and yet this is precisely the muddle into which the Government get with this kind of selectivity.<br/>
Either it is a non-discriminating non-tariff weapon to be universally applied in all circumstances, or it should be abandoned in total. To try to face both ways, to have a kind of Push-me-pull-you, to quote from the current "Dr. Dolittle" hit, to try to march in two different directions at the same time, will get the Government into a hopeless muddle. We hope that the Minister of State will give these Amendments the rational support which they deserve. Otherwise, we shall have to divide the Committee.</p>

<p>There has been something thoroughly obnoxious about the way in which the Government have handled the whole of this affair. There is plenty of evidence to suggest that in the talks before the devaluation of the&#x00A3;pressure was put on this country within the Group of Ten, probably from the United States and France, to abolish the export rebate in return for the acceptance by the Group of Ten of the rate of devaluation which we were proposing. There is evidence, too, that pressure came from the United States and France for the abolition of the rebate on condition that financial support to go with devaluation could be agreed. Certainly on my trips to the Continent when I have spoken about devaluation people in central banking have said quite

openly that pressure was put on this country to abolish this rebate for these reasons.<br/>
Having devalued and having got our financial support, which came to us from the Group of Ten and many countries who had long supported us in all the difficulties which we had faced over the previous 18 months, having had that co-operation, the Government, with thoroughly bad public relations, indicated that they were proposing to take powers to reimpose the rebate by means of an Order. Following devaluation, there was a wave of speculation against the dollar, and none of us in this country or anywhere else have anything to gain from that type of speculation. Understandably&#x2014;indeed, it was overdue and badly needed&#x2014;the U.S. Administration were forced to take measures to put right their balance of payments, and they imposed additional restrictions.<br/>
8.30 p.m.<br/>
At the same time, the United States became concerned about the value-added tax which the E.E.C. countries were about to introduce, and its export rebate element. Pressure was undoubtedly put on those countries not to go ahead with an export rebate and it was said that the United States might introduce some export rebate itself to correct the position which would arise. At that moment, I believe, there were indications that the British Government would take powers to reimpose the rebate by Order and it looked to me as though the Government were ganging up with the E.E.C. to ensure that the United States did not get its way with the Six. My understanding of this may be wrong&#x2014;I speak completely off the cuff&#x2014;but it smacks to me of an obnoxious way of handling matters. I cannot think why the Government should abolish this rebate and take these strange powers to reimpose it by Order.<br/>
A process of disintegration is going on throughout the world, with the United States forced to contract and impose restrictions. This is becoming increasingly dangerous and the type of Order suggested&#x2014;which looks like a threat to other countries, particularly to the United States, although I hope that we may hear that this is not the case&#x2014;implies that we will be with the E.E.C. countries and against the United States on this dispute which has arisen.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Barkston Ash (Mr. Alison) put forward a well-argued case against our proposal, but I remember debates in which we both took part in which complaints were made by hon. Members opposite about the lack of flexibility in Government legislation. It is generally admitted that doing something worth while creates unexpected difficulties, but he has in Committee criticised our legislation as too rigid and not flexible enough. We are here simply asking for powers to deal sensibly, flexibly and selectively with any difficulties in future in this respect and, inconsistently, the hon. Member is now castigating me. It is terribly unfair.<br/>
The Amendments would deny the Treasury the power, in reintroducing the rebate by Order, to select the countries to which eligible exports would be sent. The power to reintroduce the rebate by Order could then be invoked only for all exports eligible under Section 7 of the Finance Act, 1964. There is a slight addition to this in the Finance Act of 1966, which makes an exemption for exports to certain E.F.T.A. countries. Leaving that on one side, however, that would be its effect.<br/>
The provision for specifying countries of destination is discretionary and not mandatory, and is intended to give the maximum flexibility in catering for unforeseeable circumstances. Both hon. Members went beyond the Amendments&#x2014;I do not criticise them for this&#x2014;and attacked the whole idea of our taking powers to reintroduce the rebate.<br/>
That issue was disposed of on Second Reading, but some concern was expressed then by hon. Members who wanted to know whether the selective reintroduction of rebate would be contrary to the "most favoured nation" provision of the General Agreement. Whether or not selective application of rebate would be held contrary to G.A.T.T. must depend on the prevailing circumstances. The General Agreement does not prohibit selective defensive or retaliatory measures, like anti-dumping duties, nor would the restoration of rebates, selectively or otherwise, necessarily be the most appropriate measure in response, say, to the introduction of a rebate by another country.<br/>
I am strongly advised that to take power to reintroduce rebates selectively

could not be contrary to the General Agreement. The Financial Secretary made it clear on Second Reading that the Government, in seeking such power, have no intention of breaching their G.A.T.T. obligations. The Government have made it clear that the rebate would not be reintroduced automatically but would have to be subject to very special consideration in the event of moves in that direction by other countries.<br/>
The mere assumption of powers to restore the export rebate on the basis which we suggest in the Bill could not be a breach of the General Agreement, but the question must be faced whether the exercise of the powers on a discriminatory basis could be reconciled with the "most favoured nation" requirement. Our view is that it could be so reconciled, but a definitive judgment on this point would have to rest ultimately with the contracting parties to the General Agreement.<br/>
Article I.1 of the General Agreement reads:
<q>With respect to customs duties and charges of any kind imposed on or in connection with importation or exportation or imposed on the international transfer of payments for imports or exports, and with respect to the method of levying such duties and charges. and with respect to all rules and formalities in connection with importation and exportation&#x2026;</q>
I do not wish to quote the rest as it gets complicated. But surely rebates could not properly be described as customs duties or charges in connection with importation or exportation. The issue, if any issue arises, would therefore fall within the phrase "rules and formalities". We would claim that they were neither, being in the nature of a discretionary privilege available to exporters on application but not something they were required to accept. We could not be certain that this interpretation would be accepted in any G.A.T.T. consideration of the question.<br/>
It may be noted, however, that the G.A.T.T. in resolving disputes traditionally adopts a common-sense and non-doctrinaire attitude, concerning itself less with the rights and wrongs and much more with finding equitable solutions. It is unlikely, therefore, that a measure of the kind proposed would attract the kind of outright condemnation which the hon. Member for Barkston Ash was sure it


would if it were introduced in the circumstances of a reaction to a measure by some other country which was itself doubtfully in accordance with the General Agreement.<br/>
The Financial Secretary made clear in the debate on Second Reading that the Government had no intention of breaching their obligations under the G.A.T.T. in taking the present powers for selective reintroduction of rebate. That power is in any case only permissive under subsection (2).</p>

<p>The intention of this Amendment will be quite clear. It relates to paragraph 5, which deals with the right of any officer or person authorised by the Board of Trade to obtain documentation to determine whether there


should be certification&#x2014;if that is the right expression&#x2014;of a claim for an export rebate.<br/>
The fact that we have tabled these Amendments clearly indicates that we are of the opinion that the powers sought by the Government under the Bill are too extensive. We want to enable people to obtain an export rebate&#x2014;if they are entitled to it&#x2014;on a transaction that is covered by the Bill. This is common ground among hon. Members on both sides of the Committee. At the same time, however, this needs to be checked and verified by the officers of the Board of Trade or Customs and Excise, and it is not unreasonable that they should have powers to call for the appropriate documentation.<br/>
Paragraph 5(1) provides that a person claiming a rebate shall furnish
<q>within such time as that officer or person may require, such information as may be reasonably necessary to enable the Board of Trade to determine whether a certificate should be issued in respect of that contract, or whether any certificate so issued should be cancelled under paragraph 6 below&#x2026;</q>
That is not objectionable, because the words "may reasonably be necessary" are included. But instead of stopping there, as we suggest, the Clause goes on as follows:
<q>and to produce any books or accounts or other document of whatever nature relating to the contract, or to those goods, for inspection by that officer or person at such time and place as he may require.</q>
That is a remarkably wide provision. We feel that it is too wide. It is reasonable to require the production of the relevant documents, but why should
<q>any books or accounts or other document of whatever nature</q>
relating to the transaction be revealed to the officer concerned? All that is required to be produced is the documentation that we have been discussing on the earlier Clauses, namely, such as will show that a contract of a firm sort has been entered into and that the exporter was committed irrevocably to carrying out that contract. Yet suddenly we find these provisions at the tail end of the paragraph.<br/>
I need not weary the Committee by going into the matter in greater detail. I can only assume that the Government feel that they must take these wide powers simply to cover themselves in any con

ceivable contingency&#x2014;but if that is the case I hope to hear what kind of contingency the Minister has in mind.<br/>
The other Amendment is not dissimilar. Paragraph 5(2) of the Schedule reads:
<q>Any such officer or person shall be entitled to take extracts from or make copies of any document produced to him under subparagraph (1) above.</q>
This is surely not necessary. We feel rather doubtful whether it is required even in respect of the actual information necessary to enable the Board of Trade to determine whether a certificate should be issued or cancelled. That is a point on which we might be persuaded, but that these officers should have the power to copy and take extracts from any document of any sort with regard to a contract we think to be highly undesirable. I should have thought that the Minister of State would also think it highly undesirable and would therefore feel that these tidying up Amendments were not unreasonable and ought to be accepted.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1968-02-19a.142.0" hansard_membership_id="3174" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29470" speakername="Mr. Darling" colnum="142" time="">
<p>This issue arises on most Board of Trade legislation. Although this is a financial Bill this Schedule refers to Board of Trade legislation. Several hon. Members opposite will remember that they raised this specific issue, and that we had long discussions about it&#x2014;very useful discussions; I am not complaining&#x2014;in Committee on the Companies Bill, and that we also debated it on the Industrial Development Bill, and so on.<br/>
The powers which we are giving to Board of Trade officials are very wide indeed. Anyone looking at them would inquire why we needed such wide powers. The difficulty arises if we accept the argument and try to define clearly and in all circumstances the limits of the information for which the Board of Trade officials should ask.<br/>
The point which worries the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins), and which also worried some of his hon. Friends in previous legislation, concerns confidentiality. It should be all right if I could prove&#x2014;as I am sure that I shall be able to prove&#x2014;that we cannot limit in a Statute the area of information for which the Board of Trade should ask; and then could prove that there will be no breach of confidentiality, that the


Board of Trade inspectors or officials will ask only for the information which they will need in a particular case and that, whatever information is given, this will never, in any circumstances, be revealed to anybody else. If I can do that, I think that the fears of hon. Members will be put at rest.<br/>
When we discussed the matter in the Companies Act and in the Bill which provided for investment grants I succeeded in assuring hon. Members that all Board of Trade officials who deal with this kind of information&#x2014;which goes much wider than the Bill&#x2014;have the Official Secrets Act drawn to their attention and, as it were, operate under that Act. No hon. Member can give me any case in the course of investment grants or dealing with insurance companies or dealing with company law in which there has ever been any disclosure of information by the Board of Trade. The staff deserve a tribute for the fact that the way in which they operate makes it clear that in no circumstances would any confidential information ever be disclosed to anybody but the officials concerned with the case which they are investigating.<br/>
The hon. Member for Worthing was on the right track when he agreed that the Amendment would deny the Board of Trade power to require applicants for a certificate to produce books, accounts and other documents relating to the contracts which have come into question. The contracts would need to be examined by the Board of Trade to make sure that they conformed to the conditions laid down in the Bill. The Board of Trade, however, would be denied power to take extracts or copies of such documents. If the Board of Trade were denied those powers they would be unable to satisfy themselves about the terms of the contract because they would not have the information and would be denied the right to obtain it. They would therefore be unable to issue a certificate. The hon. Member himself said that unless they got the information which satisfied them that it was a valid contract and that it conformed to the terms and conditions of the Bill, they would be unable to issue a certificate.</p>

<p>That is covered by the earlier phrase,

<q>such information as may be reasonably necessary to enable the Board of Trade to determine".</q>
If the right hon. Member wishes to go wider, then one part of the "reasonably necessary" ought to be deleted and the other part retained. He cannot have it both ways.</p>

There might be a greater risk, if the hon. Gentleman is right, of certificates being issued wrongly against an incomplete or misleading disclosure of information. We must have full information in order to decide these matters. That risk could be very real in transactions in which the relevant contracts of sale consisted of exchanges of correspondence in contrast to the formal legal documents, when the withholding of a relevant document or information might not be so noticeable.<br/>
Another important aspect of the need for this full provision, without Amendment, is that the Board of Trade also has power to cancel a certificate once issued if indications emerge that the certificate has been issued against incomplete or false information. Therefore, the Board of Trade must have power to look at the books, take copies of documents, and so on.</p>

<p>I am quite sure that it would not, but I will check that point before we finish this part of the debate. I am quite sure that the guarantees would apply that I gave on a similar question&#x2014;asked, I think, by the hon. Gentleman&#x2014;about information being given to other Government Departments. It was then the problem of the Board of Trade investigation of breaches of exchange control. I do not think that sort of thing would arise here.<br/>
I do not know to what extent I have to qualify that assurance in the same way that I had previously to qualify the assurance covering breaches of exchange


control, but unless something like that happens&#x2014;and I am obviously asking for the assurance to be given to me&#x2014;there is no need to show the documents to other people, because the purpose of the exercise is to satisfy the Board of Trade that the contract conforms to the conditions laid down. The power to call for documents in all the circumstances that I have tried to describe might well be absolutely essential to enable the Board of Trade to check the information on which the certificate was issued, and to call 'or further information which may have been withheld.<br/>
I am sure that the point of the Amendment lies in concern about the need for the disclosure of confidential information. I must press that point about the scope of the information required. This kind of investigation does not arise regularly, but only in cases where full information has not been given to the Board of Trade in the first place.<br/>
The Department's officials go along in a perfectly friendly and by no means objectionable manner, and say, "We have not got the full information&#x2014;will you please give it to us?" If the firm says, "We have had enough of these requests to provide information for the Board of Trade," we reply that we have power to ask for the information, and from that poi it onwards it usually happens that the powers do not need to be used. There is no further pressure. I would hope that in all these cases we would have very little pressure indeed, but the fact remains that we are dealing with public funds and we must have the information. We cannot prescribe in the terms of the Bill any limitation of information for this purpose.<br/>
If that point is accepted, as I am sure it must be, what is concerning hon. Members on both sides is this disclosure of confidential information or documents&#x2014;documents that may be held, for example, by third parties such as solicitors or bank managers. I can give the Committee an absolute assurance that, as in all other Measures where the Board of Trade has this kind of power to require documents to he disclosed, no information will be given to any other people unless an issue like exchange control comes up. We do not need to write anything into the Bill, because it

is our practice to follow what the Monopolies Act says:
<q>Nothing in this section shall be taken to require any person who has acted as a counsel or solicitor for any person to disclose any privileged communication made to him in that capacity.</q>
We never ask for that kind of information to be disclosed, or we try to avoid asking for it, and I repeat the assurance that in all the Measures the Board of Trade looks after we shall obey this rule about confidentiality that we have imposed upon ourselves.</p>

<p>I beg to move Amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 11, at end insert:
<q>(3) For the financial year ending on 31st March 1969 and each subsequent financial year the Treasury shall prepare and lay before the Commons House of Parliament before the beginning of the financial year a statement specifying the purposes and the estimated amount for each purpose of payments to be made out of the National Loans Fund.</q>
I agree that this Amendment and Amendments Nos. 2, 4, 5 and 11 all hang together and that it would be convenient to have one debate on them. These are important, although I hope non-controversial Amendments. When the present Home Secretary introduced his last Budget, he presented the new form of accounts rather on the lines of this Bill, and went on to say:
<q>I have also been considering whether the time is coming to consider changes of substance&#x2026;I have therefore put a review in hand."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 11th April, 1967; Vol. 744, cc. 998&#x2013;999.]</q>
On 7th November, when he was speaking in the debate on the Address in reply to the Gracious Speech and referring to this Bill which had been mentioned in the Gracious Speech, he said:
<q>First, it will make for greater clarity in presenting the Government's financial transactions,&#x2026; Secondly, the size of the Government's borrowing and lending, not for this alone but for other bodies&#x2014;local authorities, nationalised industries, and so on&#x2014;is now so great in its own right and the significance of these lending transactions in relation to the Government's total borrowing requirements is so large that the issues should be dealt with separately from the revenue and expenditure transactions of the Government."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 7th November, 1967; Vol. 753, c. 865&#x2013;6.]</q>
I feel rather like one does when in a desert seeing a mirage a long way off. It looks very large and attractive, but, as one gets nearer, it become less large and eventually it disappears. This is what I feel about the present Home Secretary's description of the Bill, because on Second Reading the Chief Secretary said that the Bill deals merely with accountancy arrangements. "Changes of substance" had disappeared. In Committee the Financial Secretary said that the Bill was only "an accountancy exercise".<br/>
What is needed is proper parliamentary control of the Government's borrowing

and lending. Just as the Commons receives each year from the Chancellor an estimate of his revenue and expenditure and approves the Estimates so, too, the House should receive each year a budget on capital account, or a budget on the National Loans Fund, which it can debate separately and approve.<br/>
It is clear from what the Financial Secretary said in Committee that it is the Chancellor's intention to present the financial statement in the new form adopted by the present Home Secretary last year. If so, it should be a separate debate on the Government's capital account and it should require the approval of the House. This is the object of the first two Amendments.<br/>
After all, this is an important matter. The net borrowing requirement has risen from&#x00A3;355 million in 1964&#x2013;65&#x2014;I agree that it may have a different meaning, because in that financial statement the old form of calculation was used&#x2014;to&#x00A3;726 million in 1966&#x2013;67 on the new definition, and it will rise to&#x00A3;1,115 million in 1967&#x2013;68. This is a great part of our troubles. This huge borrowing requirement is not financed by genuine borrowing or saving but by the creation of new money to an extent which causes the serious inflation from which the country is now suffering.<br/>
In support of this belief, I quote words used on 18th March, 1966, at the end of his term of office, by Lord Cromer, then Governor of the Bank of England. Referring to 1964&#x2013;65, when the Chancellor said that the net borrowing requirement was&#x00A3;355 million, Lord Cromer said this:
<q>This surely is one of our basic problems. For the last year our money supply increased by some 7&#x00BD; per cent. against our increase in the real national product of about 2 per cent.</q>
I ask the House to study these words well:
<q>We unfortunately have a system under which Exchequer financing can, and does, lead to the creation of money quasi-automatically to the extent that the requirements of the Exchequer are not met by general savings or taxation".</q>
The first two Amendments seek to give the House proper control over and information about the Government's capital account. I understand from what was said in the Committee and by the Chief Secretary on Second Reading that the House will have the information in the new form, but it has not, as the Bill


is drafted, proper control. Amendment No. 2, therefore, would provide that, before the Comptroller and Auditor General approves grants under the subsection, he will be restricted to those grants which have been approved by the House, in other words, to the capital budget statement made by the Chancellor which will have to be approved by the House.<br/>
9.15 p.m.<br/>
Amendment No. 4 deals with local loans, probably the least satisfactory part of our financing and the part where there should be far more effective Parliamentary control than there is at present. Under the Bill as drafted, not only is there no improvement in Parliamentary control but the present Parliamentary control is reduced. There would be less opportunity for the Commons to scrutinise the capital expenditure involved in local loans. At present, we have an annual review of local authority lending when the Public Works Loans Bills are brought before the House each year. Under this Bill, however, there will be no opportunity for the House to review local loans annually. The only opportunity the House will have under Clause 4 will come when the limit of&#x00A3;1,000 million in the local loans part of the National Loans Fund has been exhausted and the Chancellor has to bring forward not a Bill but a Statutory Instrument to make further provision for local loans.<br/>
There are, therefore, two points here. As the limit of&#x00A3;1,000 million is taken, and the present expenditure on local loans is somewhere in the region of&#x00A3;600 million a year, there are likely to be intervals of 18 months to two years between the time; when the House has an opportunity to look at lending for local authorities. Second, it will not be by a Bill. Although it is unusual to amend or seek to amend a Public Works Loans Bill, it has a stage at which we may take that course if we wish to do so. But it will not now be by a Bill with three stages; it will be merely a Statutory Instrument requiring an affirmative Resolution, without amendment. Motions for an affirmative Resolution are apt to be taken not at what. I hope, is regarded as a normal hour of business but very late at night. Therefore, Parliamentary control over local loans as provided for in the Bill is

worse than it is at present and is far from satisfactory.<br/>
Amendments Nos. 4 and 5, therefore, would insert into the subsection a provision that local lending would be included in the statement of the National Loans Fund, so that the House would each year have an opportunity to examine, criticise and approve that amount of the Chancellor's capital account which dealt with loans to local authorities. That would give proper Parliamentary control over local lending.<br/>
Amendment No. 11 is merely consequential. Under Clause 7(1) which deals with the issues to the Exchange Equalisation Account, there is no limit to the Treasury's discretion in giving directions. In the Amendment we tie this to the approval of the House given in the new subsection (3) to Clause 1 which forms the first Amendment.<br/>
In the group of Amendments we propose to see that control over borrowing and lending requirements is restored to the House. That is especially important at present because under paragraph 10 of the Letter of Intent the Government have given an undertaking on behalf of the House that they will have firm control over the capital account. They have also given an undertaking that their net borrowing requirement will be limited to&#x00A3;1,000 million. Therefore, the House would be failing in its duty if it did not insert into the Bill some way in which it can scrutinise and approve the Government's provisions for lending.<br/>
I do not believe this to be a party issue. It is something much more important and wider. In a booklet entitled "A Programme for National Recovery&#x2014;Research Paper No. 1", published about a fortnight ago, the economists concerned examined what Parliament and the country have been doing in the past six years, covering not only the period in office of the present Government but of the Conservative Government. They found that over the six years from 1961 to 1966 central Government expenditure exceeded income by a net total of&#x00A3;1,840 million, and that of that net deficit there was a&#x00A3;756 million increase in the issue of notes and coins, of which&#x00A3;570 million was added to the currency in circulation with the public, which was thus expanded by 26&#x00B7;1 per cent. over the six years at


an average annual rate of 3&#x00B7;9 per cent. Over the same period, net deposits by United Kingdom residents with the United Kingdom banking sector increased at an average rate of 5&#x00B7;1 per cent. The combined effect was to increase the total money supply&#x2014;by the Bank of England's definition&#x2014;at a rate of 4&#x00B7;7 per cent., when the gross national product at constant prices was increasing at the rate of only 2&#x00B7;9 per cent. It really examines what is wrong with the country and why prices in the shops go up.<br/>
It is not the wage-cost inflation that we are all talking about. It is this inflation of money supplies which is created largely by Government lending. It is the capital account about which at present the House of Commons hears so little and over which under the Bill it will have so little control.<br/>
Taking those six years, 1961&#x2013;66, one finds that there was a surplus between income and expenditure of&#x00A3;3,813 million, but the long-term loans amounted to&#x00A3;5,653 million, giving the deficit figure that I mentioned of&#x00A3;1,840 million. This is why I attach importance to the question of Parliamentary control of the capital account and why I ask the Government to reconsider the parts of the Bill which I am seeking to amend and insert in them proper control by the House of Government lending both to public corporations and to local authorities.</p>

<p>I intervene briefly to support the Amendments put forward by my right hon. Friend the Member for Thirsk and Malton (Mr. Turton). Having lived a long Parliamentary time with the Bill, I realise that it is, as the Financial Secretary described it, an accountancy Measure, and that, much as we should like to get into the Bill the sort of reforms that my right hon. Friend has so eloquently expounded, this is not a Measure that will hold them.<br/>
However, as it is a Measure of clarification and a matter of accountancy, I still think that on the accountancy side it does not do as good or clear a job as it could do. We had long discussions in Committee about the role played by the Exchange Equalisation Account in dis

torting the figure of the next borrowing requirements. I hark back to this because the net borrowing requirements now figure in a State document, the Statement of Intent appearing in columns 649&#x2013;50 of the OFFICIAL REPORT of 30th November last.<br/>
This Letter of Intent to Mr. Pierre-Paul Schweitzer laid great stress on the net borrowing requirement. However, as we expounded in Committee, and as I think the Financial Secretary learnt and accepted, the intervention of the movement of the Exchange Equalisation Account into the calculation of the net borrowing requirement has a distorting and not a clarifying effect that is to say, when there is too much sterling capital at the disposal of the Exchange Equalisation Account, as a result of the need for the Exchange Equalisation Account to support sterling in the markets it makes a repayment and thereby reduces the net borrowing requirement.<br/>
I know that this year all will be well. I am sure that many of us, including the Chief Secretary, read in the <i>Financial Times</i> of 16th February about the advent of the I.M.F. team who are to breathe down the Chancellor's neck to study all the figures which are to be put into his Budget. I should like to quote from the very interesting article in the <i>Financial Times,</i> which has not been contradicted:
<q>&#x2026;the I.M.F. team will produce a list item by item of the promises made in the Letter of Intent and accompanying private documents "&#x2014;</q>
We did not hear much about them&#x2014;
<q>and assess quantitatively as well as qualitatively how each is being carried out.</q>
I do not think that anyone on this side of the House would think that there could be a more satisfactory scrutiny of the Chancellor's intentions and the documents than is liable to be produced by this team of experts, and I am certain that, if we are to have the same sort of inquiry every year, there is no need to amend the Bill. But God forbid that we should be in the position every year of having to have Mr. Good and his experts going through our Budget item by item, scrutinising the promises made in the Letter of Intent and assessing quantitatively and qualitatively how each is being carried out.<br/>
9.30 p.m.<br/>
This is a frightening prospect, and I do not envy the Chancellor and his colleagues in the Treasury what this examination brings, but, regardless of which side of the House we sit, we all hope that this will be a once for all occasion&#x2014;that, after this year, we shall be able to satisfy our creditors that we are keeping our promises. If, as I hope, Mr. Good and his team do not function in the same spirit after 1968, we need the sort of book-keeping suggested in this group of Amendments and we particularly need to get the movements on the Exchange Equalisation Fund out of the net borrowing requirements.<br/>
My right hon. Friend quoted a document of the National Recovery Programme, and I want to quote a sentence which puts in clear language what I have been trying to say:
<q>The large haphazard flows of sterling in arid out of the Exchequer, which now arise automatically out of official borrowing overseas and the working of the Exchange Equalisation Account, must be dealt with separately from the Government's borrowing and lending.</q>
These are unexceptionable sentiments. We all agree with them. I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman agrees with them. But these movements figured in the calculations of the net borrowing requirements and I know that Mr. Schweitzer and his team have not been taken in by them. These men who are breathing down the Chancellor's neck ate too intelligent for that.<br/>
But I put it to the right hon. Gentleman, who has great knowledge of accountancy, that this is not satisfactory in accountancy terms and should be remedied by keeping the Exchange Equalisation Account separate from the net borrowing requirement. In view of that I ask him to accept the Amendments. I hope the right hon. Gentleman will acquit me of discourtesy if I do not hear the end of this debate, since I will have to leave, but I would point out that in Parliamentary terms, I have spent more time than he has on this Measure, although not more time generally, of course.</p>

<p>I should like wholeheartedly to support my right hon. Friend the

Member for Thirsk and Malton (Mr. Turton). I was very interested in his exposition. I confess that my emphasis on the Amendments, particularly on the first two, is rather different from his. The important feature of the Amendments is that concerned with supplying additional clear-cut information to the House and the country.<br/>
I do not believe that we should in any way curtail Government decisions, except that the knowledge on which their decisions are likely to be based should be made public. The decision must remain with the Government. The detailed statement which the Amendments would provide for being brought before the House each year to specify the purpose and estimated amount of each payment out of the National Loans Fund would give a much better appreciation of the financial picture at the beginning of the year of how much was to be spent throughout the year.<br/>
The present difficulty is that the amounts to be spent are largely to be spent out of sums already authorised&#x2014;because every payment out of the National Loans Fund has to be authorised by the House at some time or other. The difficulty is that these authorisations are not given when each detailed amount of expenditure arises, but by authorising limits. So long as those limits are not reached, it is entirely for the Government to decide to make payments out of the Fund as and when they think fit. Those limits are now so large that in any one year the total amount of discretion which the Government have in total payments is very considerable.<br/>
If the Amendments go through, there will be nothing to stop the Government, if they find that they have to pay more than is set out in the original statement, from bringing a further statement before the House during the year. There is no objection to that, because the Government will have to make a clear statement of the purpose and the amount of the money involved.<br/>
When we were discussing the Companies Act, we had long debates about the virtues of complete disclosure. There were long speeches about the evils of hiding information from the public, from the shareholders and from the work-people. If this argument is true, as I


believe it largely to be, many of the arguments used about the disclosure in private industry could be applied to the public sector far more than has been acknowledged.<br/>
If this expert team is to come to this country to look over the shoulder of the Chancellor of the Exchequer at all the secret facts and figures, those facts and figures, or at least their general import, will be known in full measure throughout the knowledgeable world, and I see no reason why they should not be known to the British public. Everything is to be gained. After all, one thing that no one believes nowadays is the monthly figures about our cash position, because in many months they are obviously cooked. If we are to restore meaning to them, people's confidence must be restored through knowing that they are correct.<br/>
Our position is like that of the family with a bathroom. When there is a good supply of hot water, one does not worry about how much one uses and the whole family has a good bath, but if the plumbing is suspect, one does not worry about getting as much as necessary, but takes care to judge how many people want a bath and how much hot water there is in the system. Exactly the same is true of the amount which we should spend on the ventures which would be listed in such a statement. It is not a question only of those who need it but of how much money is available. Both ends must be considered. Unless we know the facts, we cannot properly appreciate the situation, and cannot, as we should, provide a proper check on the Government, whatever their complexion.</p>

<p>support the Amendment for two reasons, the first in the international context. My hon. Friend the Member for Walsall, South (Sir H. d'Avigdor-Goldsmid) drew attention to the report in the <i>Financial Times</i> on Friday of the examination to which the Chancellor will be subjected by the team from the I.M.F. later this week and rightly said that we hope that this procedure will not be necessary in future. But this makes it all the more important that Parliament should be better-informed, as these Amendments suggest, of how the Government see the requirements of the

National Loans Fund over the coming year.<br/>
My hon. Friend also referred to the operations of the Exchange Equalisation Account and I hope that the Chief Secretary will say something on this. I have studied what the Financial Secretary said in Committee and I find it a little worrying. He said:
<q>The I.M.F. is perfectly well aware of the meaning of ' borrowing requirement' which broadly follows the meaning which the hon. Gentleman wants to put upon it.&#x2026;The I.M.F. is certainly not naive on these matters, and is perfectly well aware that the Government can sometimes have flows of money from the E.E.A., which, of course, would appear, if not taken into account, to reduce the borrowing requirement below what it really is."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT. <i>Standing Committee E.</i> 30th January. 1968; c. 134.]</q>
He also said that Mr. Schweitzer cannot have the wool pulled over his eyes. We would accept this, but, in the other years, when the Chancellor, as we hope, is not subjected to this sort of scrutiny, we in this House do not want the wool pulled over our eyes as it can and has been by the operations of the Exchange Equalisation Account. Therefore, the first point is that which my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr. Michael Shaw) made&#x2014;the question of accountability to Parliament. If this information this year must he given to the I.M.F. team, surely in future years it should be given to Parliament so that we can effectively debate these matters in a way which we have not been able to do in the past.<br/>
9.45 p.m.<br/>
The second point is an external point. When I was in Bonn last week, one of the German officials to whom I was speaking said, "Suppose that the scheme for special drawing rights were activated and that under the scheme the British Government were entitled to draw 5 million dollars worth. How do we know that the British Government would not use this credit facility to finance their own deficit spending at home, as they did last year?" This is a very ominous question. The implications behind it are that the activation of a scheme like the S.D.R. scheme, which may be attractive for general purposes, may be postponed or delayed precisely because a foreign Government does not have confidence in the bookkeeping


operations of the British Government. That is what it comes to.<br/>
This is another strong argument in favour of the Amendment. This year, we have the I.M.F. team to do the Chancellor's homework for him&#x2014;to breathe down his neck, as has been said&#x2014;and to keep him in order. My goodness, it will be needed. But it seems reasonable that in future years the House should be given information of a similar nature so that vie can conduct our debates in knowledge of the facts and so that Governments abroad do not have the qualms which evidently they have about the bookkeeping of the Government.<br/>
I hope that the Chief Secretary will look with a kindly eye on the Amendments and, above all, on the thinking behind them.</p>

<p>It is with some diffidence that I support my right hon. Friend the Member for Thirsk and Malton (Mr. Turton), who proposed the Amendment in a manner truly worthy of the Father of the House. It is absolutely right, however, that we should emphasise the very great importance of Parliamentary control over the country's financial affairs.<br/>
Many of my hon. Friends have pointed out that it is very unsatisfactory when we know, and indeed it is widely publicised, that the I.M.F. is looking into international accounts and examining them in detail and the House of Commons does not have the same information laid before it.<br/>
May I quote again from an article in the <i>Economist</i> which I had occasion to quote in another context in Committee. The traditional case for Parliamentary control of the country's finances has been 'frequently set down in its columns. The article states:
<q>Down the 700 years of British Parliamentary history one of the main purposes of 'having a Parliament has been so that the people should be given a clear bill of why authority is imposing taxes upon them.</q>
I do not think that the House should have 'any doubt that the question of the extent of Government loans is every bit as much an imposition of taxes on the people as a:-e direct or indirect taxes, because if the lending and borrowing of the Government are not subject to Parliamentary scrutiny it is very likely that we shall

find ourselves in an inflationary situation which in turn imposes effectively tax on the wealth of the country.<br/>
Therefore, these Amendments are very important. They raise broader questions concerning the quantity theory of money, but my right hon. Friend was right to quote this in support of his case. While it is true that over a period it has become unfashionable with economists, in a series of articles and other studies which have spelt out the assumptions on which the quantity theory of money has been based economists have, on the whole, come very much to the theory that there was rather greater validity in it than was thought five or 10 years ago, although it requires considerable qualifications in a number of respects. None the less, the essence of the theory is undoubtedly right and it is right that my right hon. Friend should have brought it into the argument in favour of his case.<br/>
Throughout the debates on this interesting Bill, we have emphasised the greater need for forecasting in an economic context but we have also emphasised the need for forward estimates. I always have the greatest trouble in carrying the Chief Secretary with me in economic forecasts, and it would be out of order to probe the matter now, but I would say that it was common ground between us that there is a strong case for the Government, in presenting their accounts for the year, to present forward estimates, at least on an accountancy basis, of what they intend to do concerning expenditure and income. If that is so. it is surely wrong that expenditure which is to be financed out of borrowing should not have similar forward estimates.<br/>
We were repeatedly told by the Financial Secretary in Committee that we should in future have as much information in the accounts and estimates presented at Budget time as we had had in the past. With particular regard to Amendment No. 1, however, it is important that we should have an estimate of the Government's likely borrowing requirements and a breakdown of what they expect the composition to be.<br/>
On that there should be common ground between us. Given the general expectations which have been aroused in recent months that the Government would in


future be more forthcoming on their economic analysis, I hope that we might have a sympathetic statement from the Chief Secretary with regard to the forward estimates of borrowing requirements.<br/>
Surely, if it is possible to put a figure in a letter of intent to the I.M.F., it is also possible to give a reasonable breakdown of how the figure has been arrived at. Unless this is done, clearly the figure is extremely suspect. In the debates on the Bill, we have probed consistently to see just how suspect it is. We were absolutely right a few moments ago to point out the crucial r&#x00F4;le played by the Exchange Equalisation Account in fudging. if that is the right expression, the analysis of the borrowing requirement. We hope that the Government will be more explicit about this in the future on the lines suggested by my hon. Friends.<br/>
Amendment No. 2 seeks to impose on top of the forward estimates the specific consideration that
<q>the provisions of a statement</q>
should be
<q>approved by a resolution of the Commons House of Parliament".</q>
This is an important Amendment. It may be that the Government would not feel able to make a specific estimate but would rather wish to give limits beyond which they would not go without applying again for further Parliamentary approval. That should be a good way of carrying out my right hon. Friend's intention that at the beginning of the year the Government should make estimates.<br/>
In order not to impose too rigorous a degree of exactitude upon the figures and to cover the likelihood of margins of error around those figures, the Government might give the figure which they expect to see in the forthcoming year and a margin above it, but anything in excess of that limit should require further Parliamentary approval. In that event, we would have a far better system of Parliamentary control than we have now.<br/>
It is very dangerous that Parliament's role in this matter, particularly with regard to the financing of borrowing and lending, should have declined to the extent that it has. The House will be grateful to my right hon. Friend for his set of Amendments.</p>

<p>We are grateful to the right hon. Member for Thirsk and Malton (Mr. Turton) for drawing attention to these matters. I am particularly grateful because there is nothing I enjoy doing more than removing misapprehensions and misconceptions, and I hope to demonstrate to the right hon. Gentleman that his Amendments, which he has explained so clearly and so well, do not achieve the purpose he has in mind, are unnecessary to achieve the purpose he has in mind in so far as that can be achieved, generally, therefore, would not bring any benefit to us and, in particular, are of such closely controlled and limited a character as to be incapable of being acted upon. If I am able to satisfy the right hon. Gentleman and the House of all those propositions I dare say that the right hon. Gentleman will not wish to press his Amendment to a Division, so I shall seek to direct my remarks straightaway to those propositions.<br/>
First of all, he started by referring to the Second Reading debate and the comments I then made about this being an accountancy exercise, which was not quite a mirage but was a small pool left after the original wide and attractive oasis which the Chancellor described. I hope I satisfied the right hon. Gentleman in my Second Reading speech that we had examined all the concrete and substantial proposals which might properly have been examined. We did examine them very carefully, and came to the conclusion that what was left of them was something less than we had contemplated as possible to us, but nevertheless of benefit, although meriting the description of being only an accountancy exercise. It is difficult, in terms of an accountancy exercise of this kind, to carry out the kind of monetary policy control which the right hon. Gentleman had in mind.<br/>
He is anxious about the amount of additional money supply, and in this he is supported by his own Front Bench in the person of the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins). Let me clear one misconception of fact while we are on that point. The right hon. Gentleman referred to the increase in money supply between 1960 and 1966. I have fortunately been supplied with figures which show that there had been lending to the private sector during that period by the


banks of&#x00A3;3,700 million, and lending to the Government was minus&#x00A3;520 million, so that the net figure of approximately&#x00A3;3,200 million represented lending to the private sector and repayment by the Government of&#x00A3;520 million. I thought I ought just to mention those figures lest the right hon. Gentleman thought that, owing to some lack of Parliamentary control, excessive amounts of money supply had got into the system.<br/>
Now let me come to the essential proposal which the right hon. Gentleman makes for Parliamentary control, and let me try to repeat what I said on Second Reading, but referring it more precisely to the Amendment, as to the lack of need for what the right hon. Gentleman is proposing.<br/>
It is the case that all the receipts into the National Loans Fund are defined by stature. It is the case that all payments out of the National Loans Fund are authorised by this House, and, with one exception, authorised up to the limits&#x2014;I will deal with that one exception later because the right hon. Gentleman, with his usual skill, put his finger on the one exception. If we have Parliamentary authority for everything corning in and Parliamentary authority for everything going out, then Parliament, it ought to be clear, must be in control of the difference. That is a simple proposition of logic. The hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr. Michael Shaw) is shaking his head in a negative fashion, saying that, though there is Parliamentary control over a period of years, Parliament does not necessarily have control each year as to the precise amount.<br/>
10.0 p.m.<br/>
I accept that. There is no major difference between us about it. I shall seek to explain the position and hope to demonstrate that we are doing everything on the lines suggested by the mover of the Amendment. I repeat that the right hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby drew attention to the fact that although what I am saying is absolutely right in respect of a period of years it is riot necessarily right in respect of each individual year. They seek to improve the situation&#x2014;not to create a new one&#x2014;by delimiting and defining it in respect of annual control. What occurs to the

right hon. Gentleman is an annual control similar to that on Estimates.<br/>
I will tell the right hon. Gentleman why that would not work. First, the control of Estimates is needed, because for most items for which Supply expenditure is incurred this is the only authority&#x2014;the Estimates and the approval of the Estimates by this House&#x2014;whereas expenditure out of the National Loans Fund has already been authorised by the various Statutes under which the loans were permitted. That is a major difference<br/>
There is another major difference, in the sense that whereas Supply expenditure is normally recurring expenditure, going on from month to month, week to week and often from day to day, payments out of the National Loans Fund are anything but recurring expenditure. They are made from time to time at irregular intervals, as they must be. They are therefore not susceptible to the same kind of treatment<br/>
The kind of control suggested by the hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby is impossible to accept because it would not permit of a variation in the way that a Supplementary Estimate provides. Perhaps that is a matter of drafting and it is intended that it should permit it; I mention it only in passing. The real point is that with the best will in the world we cannot estimate in this irregular field with the necessary degree of accuracy that we can in respect of Supply expenditure, so as to permit of the Government's being bound as they are by Supply expenditure<br/>
It is not a question of not informing the House. The House can and does have every kind of information. It is a question of accepting, as we do under the Estimates procedure, a binding authority which limits us and makes it necessary to come to the House for a further amount or a variation in it. We cannot forecast with that accuracy. It may be said, "But surely you can forecast to some extent&#x2014;even to the extent that you are not willing to be bound and even having regard to the fact that this expenditure arises intermittently and irregularly."<br/>
The answer is, "Yes, certainly we can." That is why, each year, there is published&#x2014;and there will continue to be


published&#x2014;at Budget time a complete list of what have hitherto been called loans from the Consolidated Fund and what will in future be called loans from the National Loans Fund. It is a complete and detailed list. I have the 196768 list&#x2014;Cmnd. 2343&#x2014;running to 21 pages. It gives all the details of every kind of loan from the Consolidated Fund. It gives summaries, details, the past situation, the aggregation of loans made, the description of the amount authorised to be drawn and the amount remaining within that authority<br/>
That is the way in which the information should be presented to the House. It is made available at the time of the Budget because it is closely linked with the Budget, as the right hon. Gentleman knows. That is the way the information can be given, is given and has been given, and it is the way in which it will continue to be given. It has been given for some years. It was started by a Conservative Government, I believe, in the early 1960s, and it has been continued every year since. We shall continue to give it and it will be tied up with the new provisions<br/>
I suggest to the right hon. Gentleman that the information which can reasonably be required is there but that we cannot go further and tie ourselves, in the binding way in which an Estimate requires us to be tied, because it is not humanly possible to estimate with the same degree of accuracy over one year expenditure which by its nature is intermittent and irregular as is possible with Supply expenditure which, by its nature, is regular and occurring from day to day or month to month.</p>

<p>I accept that, but what we do not get at the moment is a separate debate on capital account, with a separate Resolution on it. That is the defect of the present system. It may well be that it could be done by altering the procedure of the House. It is important that the House should be acquainted with what is the capital account, should debate it and, I believe, approve it.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman is always careful in his choice of words. He said, "What we do not get at the moment". He is. therefore, drawing attention to what in his view is a con

tinuing defect. He is not suggesting that this new accountancy exercise is producing a different situation in respect of control by the House. It is not. It is adding to the information before the House. But I agree with him at once that it is not producing a new situation.<br/>
Perhaps the best way of debating this is in the Budget debate. That will be made the more intelligible in future because of the full information available and because the division between the Consolidated Fund and the National Loan Fund will be before the House and, therefore, each right hon. and hon. Member will be able to be more informed in his speeches. But the information is there, and the matter of control is a continuing matter and not a new matter arising out of the Bill.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman drew attention to the Exchange Equalisation Account. It is true that because of the overwhelming need of those operating the Account not to be inhibited, in the interests of the country, in the amount which they have available and their use of it from time to time. it has been the practice not to put a limit on it. There is authority for it, but the amount is not limited either in one year or over a period. But it is not right to say that because that is the case&#x2014;and I address myself particularly to the hon. Member for Worthing&#x2014;the House has any less information than a team of visiting experts would have. The information on the Exchange Equalisation Account and the working of that Account is available to the Public Accounts Committee. It is true that it is not available to the House. because it is available to the P.A.C. in secret session. The P.A.C. has that information. The account is audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the P.A.C. is a Committee of the House. That has been accepted by the House as the nearest we can get to complete and adequate control of the individual transactions within the E.E.A., and that will continue to be the case.<br/>
What the right hon. Gentleman is asking in terms of annual control within the authorised limits is not open, because a vote of the House. about which he is talking, would be binding in the way that I have indicated, and no Government could estimate with sufficient accuracy to


enable themselves to be so bound. But they do the next best thing, and very nearly the same thing, in putting forward a fully detailed Command Paper each year&#x2014;which is not subject to Resolution of the House, for that very reason&#x2014;giving the best information they can, as we all wish to do.</p>

<p>On the question of the Exchange Equalisation Account, the right hon. Gentleman pointed out that this information was available to the P.A.C. in secret session and, therefore, in effect was available to the House, but today we have all these details gone into at great length by the officials of the International Monetary Fund. If they are given the information, why should not the House have it?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1968-02-19a.165.1" hansard_membership_id="3434" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30098" speakername="Mr. Diamond" colnum="165" time="">
<p>I can see a variety of reasons why we should not depart from a well-established procedure. I do not think that this accountancy exercise provides a suitable or an adequate opportunity for fully debating that matter. There is no reason why it should not be debated, but the House has decided over a number of years that this is the way in which it should be done. I myself think it a reasonable way, and one that effectively gives information&#x2014;information of detailed operations&#x2014;in the best way it can be given to the House.<br/>
I believe it to be in the best interests of the country that it should continue in that way. I would not propose that we should alter that procedure without very full and careful consideration and debate in the House, which, as I say, cannot take place in an accountancy

exercise like this. I was only seeking to make clear that we were not unaware of the need to have this account examined, as it is, by the servant of the House, the Comptroller and Auditor General.<br/>
The control of borrowing which the right hon. Gentleman seeks would not be achieved by his proposals. He is assuming that control of borrowing relates only to the difference between amounts coming into the National Loans Fund and issues from it, but that is not the case at all. It relates also to the difference between revenue and Supply expenditure which, again, is voted on and authorised by the House. The right hon. Gentleman control it&#x2014;not by himself, but with every right hon. and hon. Gentleman: the House has control in approving the Budget Resolutions, and so on. What the right hon. Gentleman now proposes would cover only one of the elements which go into the total borrowing requirement.<br/>
I hope that I have satisfied the right hon. Gentleman that what he proposes would not be a practical way of achieving the kind of control he wants; that it would not be a full method of doing it because other elements enter into the problem, but that information that should be given to the House is being given in all practical respects. I refer in particular to the White Paper Loans from the Consolidated Fund. Having regard to all those matters, I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will feel that his proposal has been given careful consideration but need not necessarily be pressed too far.</p>

<li>(<i>b</i>) all other rates of interest determined from time to time by them in respect of local loans,</li></ol>
to be published in the London and Edinburgh Gazettes as soon as may be after the fixing of those rates.<br/>
In Committee the Opposition moved an Amendment to require publication of the rates of interest on all loans made from the National Loans Fund. This Amendment provides for the publication of the minimum rate of interest on loans from the National Loans Fund, that is to say the rates required to satisfy the conditions of Clause 5. These generally are the rates for lending to nationalised industries and for Public Works Loans Board quota loan to local authorities, and the bulk of the other lending from the Fund. The requirement for the publication of other P.W.L.B. interest rates, for example on the last resort loans, will remain.<br/>
I hope that the House will feel that this is a satisfactory Amendment. It provides information which I think is needed. The Command Paper to which I have made reference gives the fullest possible details of the terms relating to the various loans retrospectively and in this sense I think we are giving Parliament the information it needs.</p>

<p>I wish to speak a word of appreciation to the Chief Secretary for helping us over the proposal we made in Committee, but I wonder if I may probe him a little further on the general question of the lowest rate now that we are using that phrase in the Bill. There are so many different rates of interest in the market at any one time that there is a spectrum of rates of interest.<br/>
I am particularly concerned to establish more clearly how the Chief Secretary will understand the phrase, "the lowest rate" in the light of the I.M.F. Letter of Intent. He will recall the interesting provisions in paragraph 11 in which the Government commit themselves to the following doctrine:
<q>It continues to be the Government's policy to meet its own needs for finance as far as possible by the sale of debt to the non-bank public and interest rate policy will be used to this end.</q>


It is a matter of some interest to determine what is the lowest rate at any given time particularly the lowest rate in terms of the sale of debt to the non-bank public because this is a specific proviso of the Letter of Intent.<br/>
If we have a situation such as prevails today when the Bank Rate the Government have imposed for the time being is at 8 per cent. and therefore borrowing rates in the market are up all round, there seems to be in the mechanics of Government financing a certain possibility to be devious in the way in which they raise money even on the face of things raising it from the non-bank public.<br/>
Let me suggest to the Chief Secretary the sort of problem we have in mind. Suppose it happens to be the Government's need, within a period when the Bank Rate is at 8 per cent., to raise more money to meet part of their budgetary needs or to meet part of the net borrowing requirement. Will the Government in those circumstances issue to the non-bank public a medium- or long-term stock with a coupon related to the current Bank Rate at 8 per cent.? Will not they do something quite different&#x2014;that is, issue a stock in which the non-bank public will not be interested at the sort of coupon it might have, but a stock which will neveretheles3 be taken up by the Departments and sold through the tap at perhaps a very mi.ch later date?</p>

<p>I think that you will perceive, Sir, when I apply the point of this; inquiry that the rate of interest comes very directly into this, because if the Treasury issues a stock which is taken up by the Departments and which is not taken up by the non-bank public, bearing a coupon which is not in any way related to the present Bank Rate, it will in fact meet its necessary borrowing requirement by the use of the floating debt. Will the rate of interest which it has to pay to the money market in fact be a rate of interest which will figure at all&#x2014;</p>

<p>I accept your guidance and your Ruling, Mr. Speaker.

<p>I am overwhelmed, Mr. Speaker. The Amendment to which you so clearly drew our attention, Sir, does, in my view too, with respect, deal with publication of rates of interest. The hon. Member for Barkston Ash (Mr. Alison) has asked what I meant by "the lowest rates" of interest or, as I said earlier, the minimum rates of interest. I tried to anticipate that by saying that it means the rate of interest as laid down in the Clause. The Clause prescribes that
<q>The Treasury shall, on each occasion when they determine or approve any such rate of interest for a loan or class of loans, satisfy themselves that the rate would be at east sufficient to prevent a loss if&#x2014;</q>
<q>(<i>a</i>) the loan&#x2026; was met out of money borrowed by the Treasury at the rate at which the Treasury are for the time being able to borrow money for a comparable period, and on other comparable terms.</q>
The situation is that, where a loan is being made out of the National Loans Fund, regard must be paid to the period and the other terms, and the loan must be lent at not less than the rate of interest
<q>at which the Treasury are for the time being able to borrow money.</q>


That is the minimum rate. That is the rate in which the public is interested. That is the rate which it is proposed to publish in the two <i>Gazettes.</i> I think that that answers the hon. Gentleman's question, if he will consider the matter with his usual care.</p>

<p>I beg to move Amendment No. 10, in page 6, line 11, at end insert:
<q>section 7(4) of the Local Government (Development and Finance) (Scotland) Act 1964.</q>
This Amendment deals with the rate of interest for Public Works Loan Board loans to local authorities fixed by the Treasury under the Public Works Loans Act, 1897, which has often been used as a basis for other interest rates and which has been referred to in a number of Statutes, some general and some local. The repeal of the 1897 provision by the Public Works Loans Act, 1964, and the introduction at that time of a two-tier interest rate for P.W.L.B. lending to local authorities made it necessary to lay down how these references in other Acts were in future to be interpreted.<br/>
The Scottish Local Government Act of 1964 provides that local authorities may advance money in certain circumstances to persons for the erection of buildings, chiefly factories. It was passed after the Public Works Loans Act, 1964, and contains a reference to the lower of the rates fixed under that Act, and it provides that these advances shall carry interest at a rate not less than &#x00BC; per cent. greater than the lower rate fixed by the Treasury under Section 2 of the Public Works Loans Act. The repeal of the 1964 Act means that the provision in the Scottish Act must be altered.<br/>
This Amendment and the Amendment to Schedule 6, to which, perhaps, I may refer at the same time, bring the Act into line with the other Acts listed in the Clause. The Treasury direction under Clause 6 will cover this Act as well as the others and will specify that

the lower P.W.L.B. rate shall apply in respect of this Act.<br/>
I hope that, with that clear and lucid explanation. the House will accept the Amendment.</p>

<q>(2) The assets held in the said Department shall be valued, at market prices, at such limes and in such manner as may be agreed between the Treasury and the Bank of England, hut at least once in each financial year.</q>
This Amendment arises out of a discussion in Standing Committee when the Financial Secretary explained that the Issue Department's portfolio was and would continue to be valued on the basis of market price. My hon.

<p>I become a little worried when the Chief Secretary describes his own speeches as clear and lucid. As he rightly said, this Amendment arises from a debate in Standing Committee on 1st February, reported at column 157 and following of the OFFICIAL REPORT. He will recall that on that occasion we pressed, first, that the figure should be published frequently&#x2014;we thought at least once a year, and we are glad that he has met that point&#x2014;and second, we pressed that valuation should be not as originally prescribed, which left the whole matter open as between various Government bodies, but that it should be a valuation at cost. Our original Amendment suggested that it should read:
<q>&#x2026;on 31st March at both cost and market value and published.</q>
While we welcome the Amendment, I am not entirely clear why we could not have the additional figure as well, that is, a valuation both at cost and market value. That is what we originally asked for and hoped that we might well get.<br/>
Could the Chief Secretary therefore explain why we are not to have both sets of figures? It is very important to know to what extent the National Loans Fund is or is not making a profit on its various transactions. The variations in the values can make a considerable difference to the amount which the Fund and, in turn, the Government must borrow in the market.</p>

<p>I agree that borrowing is affected by the valuation.

<p>The point is simply that it is a question of the cost of the specified asset. We shall apparently have a breakdown of the various assets held.

<p>I beg to move, Amendment No. 13, in page 10, line 21, to leave out from ' raised ' to ' and ' in line 22 and insert:

<q>'only by the creation and issue of securities or as provided in subsections (5), (6) and (7) of this section'.</q>
The Amendment owes its inspiration to my right hon. Friend the Member for Thirsk and Malton (Mr. Turton). I hope that he will be able to elaborate on my few words and further expound its value. It is not unrelated to the earlier series of Amendments, the object of which was to try to tighten up the process of Government financing, or at least the surveillance which the House has over that method of financing.<br/>
The Amendment gives us the opportunity to consider, perhaps in slightly more detail, how vital it is that the whole machinery of Government financing should be tightened, and at the same time it gives us another quick look at some of the extraneous sources of finance which the Government have at their disposal, and over which Parliament has remarkably little power of scrutiny.<br/>
The first reason we feel that we want this tightening up process is the enormous and growing scale of Government expenditure, of which the Chief Secretary must be very well aware. I am not referring simply to the social services expenditure, which in many ways is by no means the one which makes the big inroads. It is the huge volumes of capital raised by the Government, and to be raised in future through the National Loans Fund, for onward transmission to the nationalised industries. When one reflects on how the scale of the financing has grown in the last five or seven years one becomes acutely aware of the need to keep a grip on it.<br/>
The second point is the way in which this juggernaut of Government expenditure has gone on even in periods when the Government have allegedly been imposing a squeeze. One of the most significant episodes we have had under the present Government was surely in the year beginning July, 1966, when the Government imposed a squeeze on the economy allegedly designed to extract&#x00A3;500 million worth of spending power, on demands on goods and services, by means of the tax apparatus, and at the same time increased the expenditure for which the Exchequer was responsible by more than they took out of the system


through taxation&#x2014;about&#x00A3;725 million extra Exchequer expenditure at a time when they were reducing expenditure by the private citizen to the extent of&#x00A3;500 million a year. The case is very formidably argued in "The National Recovery Programme." Perhaps the Chief Secretary will make an allusion to that.<br/>
It is not only the scale of Government expenditure and the tendency for it to increase relentlessly. The real difficulty that we face in the present situation is the corresponding difficulty the Government find in meeting the extra outlay that they have to make by genuine borrowing. This is where the various extraneous sources come into operation which we hope we shall he able to pinpoint and eliminate by our Amendments.<br/>
In considering the Exchequer net deficit, the large gap to be financed outside the tax-paying system, I remind the Chief Secretary that in the quinquennium 1961&#x2013;66 the Government's domestic borrowing&#x2014;the amount they were able to borrow in terms of Government marketable securities, sales of stocks and shares to the buying public&#x2014;was able to be precisely counterbalanced only by the amount that they were able to raise in non-marketable securities. They had to pay more back in terms of market securities&#x2014;short-term, medium-term and long-term bonds sold to the banking and non-banking sector&#x2014;than they could borrow. So the Government were net losers, a serious situation for them. They were able to meet their requirements in terms of actual loans from the public by the various non-marketable obligations which they incurred through the Post Office and Trustee Savings Banks and the rest, but they were net losers to the extent of nearly&#x00A3;500 million on their dealings with marketable securities. The market is glutted.<br/>
Also, in conditions in which inflation is rampant it is not surprising that the public are not interested in medium-term and long-term gilt-edged securities whose capital value is almost bound to depreciate, which is no hedge against inflation. The Government are finding themselves in a progressively worse position, loans to the public on medium- and long-terms by the Government being more and more unacceptable to the public. The whole

tendency is for borrowing to have to switch increasingly into the short end of the market, with all its problems of the increasingly liquid base, the banking system and the general inflationary tendencies in the economy.<br/>
It is because the Government are finding that the market is glutted with the traditional kind of Exchequer instruments&#x2014;the loans and issues of medium-and long-term&#x2014;that they are tending to have recourse to these various extraneous sources. We have touched on one. The right hon. Gentleman was kind enough to make a reference to it and try to give us reassurance. It is the sterling market equalisation account as a result of the gold and dollar currency and corresponding inflow of sterling, which goes on to the Exchequer and helps with its financing problems.<br/>
But it is not enough simply to say that the Public Accounts Committee has access to the way this is managed and engineered and how much the Government get out of this Exchange Equalisation Account. The real problem is that the Government should not be using this once-for-all source of financing. They should not be living on this sort of capital. If there is an outflow of currency and a corresponding inflow of sterling, so that the Government can use this windfall of sterling, the whole situation in which gold and foreign currency is flowing out on a grand scale and making us lush with sterling is one in which the Government should cut back on this juggernaut of expenditure.<br/>
Yet the Chief Secretary says that all is well, that the Public Accounts Committee can have access to it. But that is part of the problem. The Bill does not give a really sound instrument to control Government expenditure in the sense of regulating the basic health of the economy. The same applies in the case of another extraneous source which is not, strictly speaking, mentioned in the Bill&#x2014;the sterling accruing to the Exchange Equalisation Account not through the loss of gold and foreign currency but because the Government are borrowing overseas. If they are borrowing overseas, and the money comes in in the form of gold and dollar currency&#x2014;as naturally it will&#x2014;in short-term expenditure, one has to think of repaying it and getting out of debt as soon as


possible. It creates a surplus of sterling requirements to the E.E.A. which gets back to the Exchequer for financing purposes. This again is a once-for-all source which the Treasury can use for the Government's financing sources. But it is an illegitimate source for the Government's day-to-day financing, and we have no control over this sort of financing.<br/>
There is also the scandalous ability the Government have through the fiduciary issue&#x2014;the issue of notes and coins. I recall the striking passage used in the Radcliffe Report&#x2014;admittedly under a Tory Government&#x2014;when it was said that the Treasury was able to meet the Government's financial needs to the extent of&#x00A3;700 millions over a period of five or six years through the fiduciary issue. This, of course, is tantamount to saying that they printed money. No wonder that sometimes the Directors of the Bank of England include famous newspaper proprietors with excellent access to printing machinery. This seems one of the traditional ways of financing the Government's own deficits.<br/>
Then we have a source which is an item which appears in the <i>pro forma</i> of the accounts which the Financial Secretary gave us&#x2014;interest-free notes, which is a useful source of funds to the Treasury to which the Treasury can have access and which will appear on the National Loans Fund Accounts in future.<br/>
Interest-free notes, I understand, is a situation which arises when the Government have to borrow massively from the I.M.F. and either receive foreign currency from it for bailing out purposes in this country and they correspondingly have to send the I.M.F. sterling equivalent in interest for exchange for foreign currency they receive from the Fund. As I understand this matter of interest-free notes, the I.M.F. lends back to the Government the sterling which they originally exchanged for foreign currency. They have the best of both worlds. They have foreign currency to get them out of a jam, and they use the sterling which they have set apart. This item of interest-free notes is thrown into the kitty for the Government's juggernaut process of huge outlays, with no control over the underlying economic situation which

gives rise to the need for these loans and the outflow of confidence in sterling which the loans represent.<br/>
10.45 p.m.<br/>
All these other sources which my right hon. Friend the Member for Thirsk and Malton is trying to pin down in this Amendment, outside the strict issue of securities, outside the methods specified in subsections (5), (6) and (7), have grave disadvantages. They are not, strictly speaking, susceptible to Parliamentary control in terms of the volume of funds upon which hands can be laid for Government financing purposes. Nearly all of them represent once-for-all sources, which means in effect living on capital&#x2014;the Exchange Equalisation Fund, the interest-free notes and all the rest of it. There is no real discipline imposed upon the Government in their onward march of Government financing. For these reasons we want to pin the Government narrowly down and to turn the tourniquet on these sources in all sorts of different quarters which flow into the Government&#x2014;the I.M.F., loans overseas, the run on sterling and all the rest of it.<br/>
Finally, one should mention this mysterious facility which we know the Government have even when they increase the floating debt, which is a form of issue of securities about which we all know and which is permitted by my right hon. Friend's Amendment. Even when they finance themselves through Treasury bills and the floating debt, there is this mysterious and inflationary technique through the use of the Bank of England of the giving of help, as it is euphemistically called, to the market, under which, when the Government want to borrow from the market and the market has not got the money, the Bank of England dips into the kitty, buys Treasury bills and short-dated or even medium-dated securities in order to get the money to lend back to the Government. So we get this vicious circle of inflationary finance.<br/>
We believe there are real gaps in the financing facilities of the Government over which Parliament has no control, and we want to see this haemorrhage finally healed.</p>

The hon. Gentleman wishes these words to be removed, and it was on that basis that he gave us his interesting and entertaining speech.<br/>
I want to make it absolutely clear straight away, therefore, that what he is proposing is that powers which the Treasury has had in these precise words since 1919 should be withdrawn.</p>

<p>I wonder how many times the hon. Gentleman said that when his party was in power. I am resting myself quite simply on the proposition that these words and these powers were thought right in 1919 when they were first introduced. They were confirmed in the National Loans Act, 1939. They have been there ever since. They have been found right and we propose to continue them. I reject the Amendment.</p>

<p>The Chief Secretary has done no service to the House by rejecting the Amendment with such a cursory argument. He says merely that because it has been the custom since 1919 that the Treasury should, so to speak, "fiddle the books", he does not see why the Treasury should not continue to fiddle the books from now on. This is the root cause of the <i>maladie anglaise.</i> It is this money printing which, the Chief Secretary knows, goes on which is doing our currency in. It is no argument to say that, because the Tories did it, as did the Labour Government before that and the Tories before that, right back to 1919, it should be sacrosanct and that it

is wrong for us to question it, or to suggest in any way that it should be stopped.<br/>
The Amendment would prevent the Treasury from raising money through the National Loans Fund by increasing net indebtedness to the Bank of England Banking Department, or increasing the notes and coins in circulation. Those are two rather sophisticated forms of money printing in which the Treasury is currently engaged.<br/>
I have taken the trouble to arm myself with the figures to see to what extent it is being done. I said earlier that it has been done by Governments of both parties for many years, but what is alarming is the extent to which it has been accelerated by right hon. Gentlemen opposite. The difference between net borrowing requirement and taxation surplus may not be the most important figure, but it is the figure which I have been studying. This is the figure which is made up by borrowing abroad, by borrowing at home, by a reduction in our gold and dollar reserves and by printing money. It may interest the House to see the way in which the figure has suddenly leaped. In 1958. it was&#x00A3;182 million; in 1959,&#x00A3;314 million; in 1960,&#x00A3;394 million; in 1961,&#x00A3;211 million; in 1962,&#x00A3;66 million; in 1963&#x00A3;478 million; in 1964,&#x00A3;386 million; in 1965,&#x00A3;576 million; in 1966,&#x00A3;740 million; and in 1967,&#x00A3;943 million.<br/>
Those are by no means figures of which we can be proud. They show a rapid acceleration and the failure of the Government to borrow the money which they claim to be borrowing. It would not be so bad if this money could be borrowed from the public, but that cannot be done&#x2014;it would be out of order to explain why now. Suffice it to say that we do not borrow this money, but we have funded it. partly by borrowing abroad and partly by printing. We are therefore right to try to write some disciplines into the Bill.<br/>
In Committee the Financial Secretary tried to suggest that it would be wrong of Parliament, myself in particular, to try to write into the Bill anything which would bind future Chancellors of the Exchequer, which would bind future Governments in future years, about how to conduct the nation's financial affairs, because Parliament could never bind itself


for the future. But every other country dos bind itself for the future. West Germany, for example, has a constitutional law which limits what the Government may borrow short, either from the Bundesbank or by the issue of Treasury notes, to&#x00A3;300 million at any one time&#x2014;</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman is wrong. The Amendment would limit the Government by preventing them from using foreign borrowing or increasing their net indebtedness or increasing the fiduciary note issue to finance their schemes and the vast amount of capital which they dish out to their creatures, like the Transport Holding Company and the National Coal Board. It is this vast flow of money, which they call capital, to the nationalised industries, which is bringing our currency into disrepute. The Chief Secretary knows that. At least they should raise it honestly on the market or from the citizens to cover this profligate spending.<br/>
The argument that the House should not know in advance does not hold water. Going on the gold standard and having gold behind one's currency is a discipline. The Germans do it by the law which I mentioned. There are millions of disciplines and now the Government have one, in the form of the I.M.F. string that the net borrowing requirement should not exceed&#x00A3;1,000 million. I would have preferred a limit of&#x00A3;100 million, which would have been a much more realistic straitjacket for the Government and would greatly have benefited them.<br/>
The Amendment is very important. The fact that it is late at night, at the tail end of a Bill which has not aroused a great deal of interest, should not take the House's attention from the fact that my hon. Friend is here proposing a means of limiting the amount of bogus money which the Government can print&#x2014;[<i>Laughter.</i>] It is no good laughing at this. This is not a technicality: this is where the currency is being eroded. For every&#x00A3;100 in a citizen's pocket, a few&#x00A3;s extra is being printed, so his&#x00A3;100 is worth less. It is this constant process, when the Government's credit has evaporated of printing or borrowing

abroad at high rates of interest to make up the borrowing which has destroyed our financial standing and the honesty of our currency.<br/>
I earnestly expect the Amendment to be accepted because it contains Parliament's first serious attempt to put some shackles on this rake's progress. This is not a laughing matter, but a very important point. Everything which my hon. Friend said is true, except that he said it in such a sophisticated and charming way that it might not have been immediately apparent to the Chief Secretary. The Chief Secretary's answer&#x2014;that, because he had been doing it for 50 years he would go on doing it&#x2014;was not worthy of him. I hope that he will reply in detail.</p>

<p>It is curious that, when right hon. Gentlemen get on to the Treasury Bench, they become more and more reactionary the longer that they are there. I am surprised that the Chief Secretary, whom I used to know in the old days as a progressive Member, now has this reactionary tendency, and argues that, because something has been going on since 1919, we cannot change it.<br/>
My hon. Friends have put the case for the Amendment very clearly. What is wrong with this country is, unfortunately, the Treasury quasi-automatically creating money, and it is dealt with in the Clause. I fear that the Amendment does not go nearly far enough to stop the Treasury. At least, it gives them a certain amount of fresh discipline to try to stop what has been going wrong. I do not say ever since 1919, but I certainly say in a period of six years, extending back to the time before the Chief Secretary entered the Government.<br/>
11.0 p.m.<br/>
We are asking why the Treasury should have power to raise money in any way it likes. If it wants that power, let the Government define it in the subsection. We have provided that the Treasury can raise money under subsections (2), (5), (6) and (7). What more does the Treasury want? I know that it is a dangerous way to raise money by Treasury bills. If the Government want another paragraph dealing with some queer transaction through the Exchange Equalisation Account, no doubt that


could be inserted if the right hon. Gentleman will recommit the Bill for that purpose.<br/>
I beg the Government and the right hon. Gentleman to think deeply and clearly on this subject. What has gone wrong has happened not merely with the present Government, although, as my hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Ridley) has said, they have been using the printing machine for creating money to a far greater extent than their predecessors did; but their predecessors did it, too. That is the kernel of the matter.<br/>
It is no good merely trying to cut the social services. What must be done is to stop the inflation of money at the source, which is here. On an earlier Amendment, the right hon. Gentleman said that the Bill was merely an accountancy measure. Clause 12 goes into a different field. It gives the Treasury power to inflate the currency. We ask that that power should be limited. If those outside the House of Commons read the reply given by the Chief Secretary to the Amendment, they will realise the danger from which the country is suffering from him and those who hold office with him.</p>

<p>I rise to respond to the right hon. Member for Thirsk and Mahon (Mr. Turton), who was courteous in his comments, and to assure him that I trust that I have become no more reactionary than I have always been and to make clear to him that if the Amendment dealt for one moment with a limitation of inflationary tendencies, I would be only too happy to respond.<br/>
The Amendment has nothing whatever to do with that, nothing to do with the speech of the hon. Member for Barkston Ash (Mr. Alison) and still less to do with the speech of the hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Ridley). What the hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury wanted to do was to stop the Government having the power to provide the nationalised industries with the means they need, to cut the nationalised industries' throats. That is as plain as a pikestaff.</p>

<p>I will give way later.<br/>
The hon. Member for Barkston Ash revealed his intention to anybody who has the minimum knowledge of psychiatry. He talked about pinning the Government down and turning the tourniquet. That is what he would love to do. Unfortunately, we are talking about means by which the Government borrow&#x2014;not amounts which the Government borrow, not increasing amounts, minimum or excessive amounts, but the means by which the Government borrow. That is what the Amendment refers to.<br/>
All that the right hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends are seeking to say is that whereas since 1919 the Treasury has had power to borrow in the most economic and sensible way, in the interests of the Government and of the country, now, because there is a Labour Government in power and no longer a Conservative Government, the Treasury should be limited in its borrowing facilities so that borrowing should be made more expensive to the Government and, perhaps, more remunerative to the lenders. Who knows?</p>

<p>I will give way later, not now. I want to make the answer clear, because the hon. Member appealed to me to give him an answer. His speech was totally irrelevant to the narrow point of the Amendment, which seeks to deal with borrowing powers and to limit them in a certain way. It limits it in a way which the Treasury has never had it limited, and it would be against the interests of the Treasury, against the interests of the Government, against the interests of the people of this country who have to pay the amounts which borrowing money requires to be paid to service the loans. It would merely be putting a halter round our necks to provide for the political views of the hon. Gentleman who loathes, despises and hates nationalised industries, and of the hon. Member for Barkston Ash who hates this Government and everything to do with them. Having made that moderate and conciliatory speech I will now give way.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the Chief Secretary for giving way. I did not say the nationalised industries ought not to have money. What I did say was that, instead of giving the Government


power to print money to give to the nationalised industries, we should insist that they borrow money from genuine lenders. I hope the right hon. Gentleman will retract the remarks he made about me. If he looks at HANSARD he will find that I did not for one moment say that nationalised industries should not have money lent them, but that they should genuinely borrow from genuine lenders and not have the money printed on the Government's filthy printing presses. I should be grateful if the right hon. Gentleman will deal with that point and not with one which I did not make.</p>

<p>It is a pleasure. I heard what the hon. Gentleman said. I am withdrawing nothing, because I heard the hon. Gentleman use words which described precisely the kind of attitude which I attributed to him.<br/>
I will now deal with the other question which I did not hear the hon. Gentleman raise, but which has been raised, and that is, why did the Conservative Government depart from having the nationalised industries borrow from the market? Why did the Conservative Government suggest that the nationalised industries should borrow from the Government and why have we continued it? The answer has been given many times&#x2014;because it is cheaper. It is a cheaper way of borrowing, and we do not propose that the nationalised industries should be burdened with expensive loans even to conform to the hon. Gentleman's ideas.</p>

<p>I shall not detain the House for more than a few moments, but it is right, given the great deal of scrutiny that the House has rightly given to the Bill, that we should say how much we appreciate the way in which, in Committee, the Financial Secretary produced


a format of accounts which showed the basis on which the accounts are likely to be produced under the Bill, as it stands, when we discuss the Budget. It will be agreed that this year's Budget will be one of the most important in our country's history and it is therefore fortunate that we have been able to scrutinise the exact form of the accounts in advance, and also to implement a number of drafting Amendments.<br/>
As for the present form of the Bill, the Chief Secretary was rather uncertain about my point concerning the difference in the basis of the valuation of assets and the market value. If he will study what was said in column 163 of the Committee proceedings&#x2014;as he has been kind enough to say he would&#x2014;he will appreciate more readily the point that I have in mind.<br/>
Earlier on I loosely confused the National Loans Fund and the profits of the Issue Department. It is important to have both sets of figures. As it stands, under the relevant Clause the Treasury has discretion as to how much of the excess of market value over cost is transferred to the National Loans Fund. If the transfer takes place under the Clause we need to know what percentage of the difference has been transferred, because it affects the overall borrowing requirement.<br/>
This brings me to the only point of technical controversy that has arisen, namely, the definition of the borrowing requirement and, in particular, the borrowing requirement as specified in the letter to the I.M.F. written by the former Chancellor of the Exchequer&#x2014;now the Home Secretary. We are still very unhappy because we feel that the concept which has been given such prominence and importance in the letter to the I.M.F. has not been sufficiently defined in a way to enable the House to appraise the extent to which the Government have achieved the objective which they have declared. This is a difficult question in relation to the effect on the Exchange Equalisation Fund, and I would have hoped that the Bill made this clearer.<br/>
On the overall basis, however, the Bill has made improvements in our accounting procedure. It is fortunate that we have been able to have such constructive debates in Committee and this even

ing. It is a much better Bill than it was on Second Reading, and on that basis we will support it this evening.</p>

<p>The Bill, in respect of the provision of information, is a great advance. I hope that we will use it to make it a more effective measure of Parliamentary control on Government borrowing. It is in the interests of hon. Members on both sides of the House, and the country. It may be that the Bill was never intended to seek out the causes of the inflation that is troubling this country. When the present Home Secretary made his statement in the last Budget many of us thought that he would attack that problem, but to that extent the Bill, with its present content, is a slight disappointment. I believe that this Bill can be used to give us more effective control after we have received this information.<br/>
Apart, perhaps, from a rather foolish little verbal sally by the right hon. Gentleman on the last Amendment, one remark with which I disagreed was that of my hon. Friend the Member for Walsall, South (Sir H. d'AvigdorGoldsmid), who has now left us. He said that as Mr. Pierre-Paul Schweitzer would now be looking at the books we in Parliament had no need to do so. I think there is a very much more need for us to do so, especially when Mr. Pierre-Paul Schweitzer and his team are coming round.<br/>
That is why I hope that the Chief Secretary will convey to his right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer the appeal that in working out the Bill he will so present his Financial Statement that Parliament may have an opportunity to have a separate debate on the net borrowing requirement each year at Budget time. That would be a very great help to Parliament's control of expenditure, because by this means we would be looking at the capital account.<br/>
I welcome the Bill. It is excellent, though limited in its scope.</p>

<p>With the permission of the House, I am grateful for what the hon. Gentleman the Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) and the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Thirsk and


Malton (Mr. Turton) have said in welcoming the Bill. It is limited in concept, and limited for the reason to which I earlier referred, that although my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary did, as the right hon. Gentleman quite rightly describes, refer to the possibilities of considering major change, when this consideration took place it was found that the most we could usefully do, at present at all events, was what has now been described as an accountancy exercise. That is why we do not propose more than is in the Bill; and why it seemed that the discussion would inevitably have to be somewhat limited.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman has said that the Bill gives further information, and it is intended to give further information. I assure him that I am absolutely at one with him in saying that right hon. and hon. Members should have the fullest possible information to enable them to conduct the debate in as informed a manner as is possible. I hope that the Bill will help to that end.<br/>
We are anxious to get the Measure through so as to be able to provide the new form of accounts in the forthcoming Budget which, I am told, is to be expected in due course. With the goodwill of the House, therefore, I think that we should now send it on its way so as to be ready in good time.</p>

<p>Most people are aware that the transport of petroleum spirit in bulk through the cities, towns and along the roads of these islands is strictly regulated under legislation which this House approved 30 years ago. I believe that few people are aware that the transport of substances which in certain circumstances can be equally as dangerous as petroleum spirit takes place in considerable quantities every day along the roads and through towns and cities of these islands without any regulations to control them and subject to no statutory precautions. They are an ever growing hazard to the public and a very real danger to the members of the emergency services, particularly the fire services, who are called in to deal with the effects of the increasing number of accidents involving tanker lorries which are laden with these uncontrolled inflammable and explosive cargoes.<br/>
If few people would credit that statement, I think hon. Members will find it incredible that for nearly 10 years the Home Office has been trying to work out a means of identifying and clearly marking these dangerous tanker lorries but so far have achieved no success, let alone attempting to tackle the job of controlling the use of these lorries. That decade of ineptitude and delay on the part of the Home Office has been punctuated from time to time with assertions by various Ministers that action was about to be taken. Those assertions have usually been followed by long periods of apparent inactivity so that firemen, who are particularly concerned about this matter, have almost abandoned hope that the Home Office will ever succeed in finding a solution to this not very complex problem.<br/>
The years of delay and the unfulfilled promises have now become a bad joke in the fire service. It is a joke which could turn to tragedy. If their luck runs out and firemen are killed because of the Government's failure to give the fire


service the help it needs to deal with these growing dangers, the account I now propose to give the House of the many years of delay will clearly show where the blame must be squarely placed. That luck can run out tonight.<br/>
About ten years ago, it became clear to all concerned that the rapid and continuing growth of transport by road of an ever mounting number of new and dangerously inflammable explosive and corrosive chemicals in uncontrolled quantities in unsupervised tankers and lorries needed some regulation and control. In 1959, therefore the Home Office set up a Working party on Inflammable Substances. So far as I can trace, 1959 was the year of its first and last meeting. It did set up however a committee, another working party, to tackle the job of identifying and making these dangerous road tankers.<br/>
In September 1961, the Scottish fire service was involved in Perth in a serious incident when an unmarked tanker which was filled with about 2,000 gallons of a highly corrosive but, to the firemen, unknown substance led to the Scottish local authorities wanting to know from the Scottish Home Department what was being done to bring under control the hazards which arise from the movement of these highly dangerous cargoes along our roads. According to the Scotsman, a Home Office spokesman was reported to have said that
<q>A scheme for such control has been accepted in principle but has not yet been finalised".</q>
A few months later, in Hereford, an unmarked tanker containing 4,000 gallons of styrene was involved in an accident. There being no marking, the firemen did not know what the substance was with which they had to deal. There were, therefore, urgent public demands made to the Home Office by chief fire officers for some sort of action.<br/>
A few months later, in West Bromwich, a lorry carrying methyl peroxide, again unmarked, blew up, damaging about 16 houses, injuring 30 people, who were admitted to hospital, and doing nearly&#x00A3;100,000 worth of damage. To quote the report of the chief fire officer on that occasion,
<q>Seeing his lorry was on fire, the driver took it to a piece of waste ground. One cannot help wondering what would have been the

casualty list if this explosion had occurred in a busy town centre".</q>
The lorry had just left Walsall and was to travel to Oldbury. Oldbury is in my constituency. If that lorry had blown up in the busy town centre of Oldbury, I cannot imagine, as the chief fire officer says, what the casualty list would have been.<br/>
Again, there was a demand from the fire service, particularly from the Fire Brigades Union, for control and marking of these tankers. In July, 1962, the Home Secretary's Advisory Council for the Fire Service was told by the Home Office that a code of tanker markings had been circulated to local authorities for their observations. I have not been able to trace that code.<br/>
In the following year, members of the emergency services in Cheshire were involved in a dangerous incident when an overturned tanker lorry, again unmarked, turned out to be charged with a highly dangerous compound, a compound of lead oxide. In fact, the men turned yellow, and remained yellow for many days. The compound was so dangerous that, had it been ingested by the men to any degree on that occasion, they could have suffered considerably. So the Cheshire County Council and the Urban District Councils Association approached the Home Office again for action on these poisonous cargoes. They were told that the matter was now with the Ministry of Transport and with the Home Department.<br/>
In 1965, the Lancashire County Council, whose fire brigade is almost weekly engaged in dealing with incidents involving chemical cargoes carried by tankers, because Lancashire is one of the main centres of the chemical industry, approached the Home Office. In April 1965, <i>The Guardian</i> reported a Home Office spokesman as saying,
<q>International agreement on the carriage of dangerous chemicals by road is imminent.</q>
It was so imminent that the following month the Under-Secretary of State, in answer to a Question, said that there was now no hope of getting international agreement and that therefore the working party which had been set up in 1959 was to be disbanded and a new body, called the Standing Committee on


Dangerous Substances, would be established to deal with the whole business urgently.<br/>
Firemen, who have been waiting for years for a simple system of marking dangerous loads so that they could readily know what they were dealing with in the case of fire or accident, might be forgiven if they wondered what all the rigmarole was about international agreement being necessary and then not being obtained. In April, 1966, all chief fire officers were told by the Home Office that it was preparing a set of symbols for use as tanker markings. Later in the year the Under-Secretary of State announced that draft regulations had been settled and would come into effect in 1967. In answer to a Question in April, 1967, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary said that the regulations would be applied soon. Here we are in the early months of 1968 and the fire service is still awaiting them.<br/>
Meanwhile, the list of near-misses mounts up. Sheer mathematics tells us that there is not much time left before we have a disaster. In September, 1966, a tanker and trailer containing about 33&#x00BD;tons of butane were hit by a locomotive and trapped on a level crossing at Harwich. The tanker carried no markings. Last autumn firemen in Yorkshire were called to deal with a tanker marked as carrying formic acid. They later discovered that they were dealing with butane alcohol, which has a flash point just two degrees Fahrenheit above that of petroleum spirit. Last year, a tanker out of control crashed into Dewsbury town hall. Firemen were called by the police to a tanker crash involving butane. The driver was dead. The tanker was in fact loaded with liquid ethylene, one of the most highly explosive materials now being carried on the roads of this country.<br/>
What do firemen want? First, they want a simple system of marking dangerous tankers. With the driver very often unconscious or dead, they want a system whereby they know immediately whether the cargo with which they are dealing is inflammable, explosive, toxic or corrosive. They want to know its chemical base, and whether it should be handled by foam or water and so on.<br/>
Incidentally, if water had been used on liquid ethylene in the Dewsbury case it would have been fatal not only to the users of the water but to anyone within a very considerable radius of the accident.<br/>
Firemen want control of the vehicles in a manner identical to that in which the Petroleum Act controls the passage of petroleum spirit through our towns. They want the same parking regulations as that Act imposes on tankers carrying petroleum spirit. They want limits set to the amount of these dangerous substances that are carried. Above all, they want the Home Department to get a move on. They want an end to the deplorable story of delay and ineffectiveness.<br/>
A chief fire officer writing to me a few weeks ago says:
<q>The lack of any regulation dealing with these dangerous cargoes is an affront to the citizen, who looks to the legislature for protection. It is a crime against a fireman whose duty it is to deal with such substances whenever a mishap occurs.</q>
He adds:
<q>The Home Secretary has repeatedly promised that regulations would be made. I hope they will be made and introduced before there is a tragedy and not as a posthumous gesture to public opinion.</q>
I can tell my hon. Friend that the fire service will study with great care what he has to say tonight.</p>

<p>I am glad that the hon. Gentleman has raised this subject. I only wish there was a better attendance of hon. Members because it is a most important topic. If a lack of international agreement is the cause of the delay, I hope that the Home Office will produce regulations without worrying about international agreements, because we need them here whatever difficulty there is in obtaining them abroad.<br/>
I hope that the anxiety about the future of the Explosives Department of the Home Office is not also the cause of the trouble. I understand that there is a move to transfer part of it to the Ministry of Transport. The Department seems to have worked very well while it has been under the Home Office, and I hope that it will be kept under the Home Department as a united body. I hope that the Under-Secretary will give


an assurance that that possible move, which I know is causing some anxiety, is not the cause of the delay in producing the regulations, which will be vitally important.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend is an expert on this subject, and his long association with the fire service gives him every right to bring it forward, and particularly to do so on behalf of the firemen with whom he has worked for so many years. I cannot rival him in his knowledge and expertise, but I assure him that I share his desire to see that everything possible is done to ensure the safe carriage by road of the many dangerous substances which are essential nowadays to our industrial effort.<br/>
I should first explain to the House, perhaps, that a number of legal controls exist already. The conveyance of explosives is already strictly controlled by regulations made under the Explosives Act, 1875. The main instrument of control for other substances is the Petroleum (Consolidation) Act, 1928, the provisions of which can be extended, by means of an Order in Council, to any substance. This control applies at present to petroleum spirit, petroleum mixtures, carbon disulphide and a few permanent gases when compressed into metal containers. The regulations under both Acts specify such matters as maximum loads, the manner in which the dangerous substances must be packed and loaded, and various other safety requirements. Apart from explosives, my hon. Friend mentioned inflammable materials. There is little doubt that the inflammable material carried on our roads in the greatest quantity is petroleum spirit, and, as I have explained, this, too, together with petroleum mixtures, is already strictly controlled.<br/>
In addition to petroleum spirit, many other inflammable liquids are carried by road, although the quantities are considerably less. But these, too, ought to be regulated. I shall speak of the delay in making appropriate regulations in a moment, but first I wish to remove the impression sometimes created&#x2014;some of my hon. Friend's remarks may have given the impression&#x2014;that just because there are no regulations dangerous substances are always being carried on our roads in

a highly dangerous state. This is not so. In the first place, there are the general requirements of the Motor Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations, 1963.<br/>
Then there are the precautions taken by industry itself. A considerable amount of research is constantly conducted by the chemical industry, on its own initiative, into safety in conveyance, and the Chemical Industries Association has recently issued a valuable code of guidance to its members on the safe conveyance by road of a great many substances. In consultation with us, moreover, the Association proposes to introduce a scheme of chemical information cards. These cards, carried by drivers, will describe in clear language and symbols the risk involved and the action to be taken in the event of an emergency on the roads. They will serve not only to assist in vehicle care but also the emergency services.<br/>
There will always be a few whose less responsible attitude may endanger others, and we have no doubt that regulations are needed, if only to give statutory backing to some practices already adopted in industry as a whole. My hon. Friend mentioned delays in introducing appropriate regulations. I accept the timetable of delay to which he has drawn attention and understand his sense of frustration and that of the firemen on whose behalf he speaks.<br/>
I do not want to go into the history of this matter. He wants to know what we are going to do rather than the causes of difficulty. I assure him that I accept the urgency of the task, and I will tell him our programme. There is no need for him or his friends in the fire service to despair.<br/>
In 1965, the Standing Advisory Committee on Dangerous Substances was set up with comprehensive terms of reference and a balanced and representative membership covering central and local Government and industry. The Committee's function is to advise the Home Secretary on the control of dangerous substances, with particular reference to their storage and carriage by road. In practice, the bulk of the Committee's work is carried out in technical sub-committees, whose meetings are attended by the best available experts in the United Kingdom. There are four at present dealing, respectively, with the packaging and labeling


of dangerous substances carried by road; the operation of vehicles carrying such loads; the construction of the vehicles concerned; and problems connected with the storage of petroleum spirit and related products.<br/>
The Committee decided at its first meeting towards the end of 1965 to give priority to proposals for regulations dealing with four classes of dangerous substances&#x2014;inflammable liquids, corrosives, poisons and organic peroxides. The regulations, apart from certain basic safety requirements, will be confined in the first instance to the marking of vehicles and packages. This is the most pressing need, because the emergency services need to know at once what kind of dangerous substances are being carried on vehicles which may be involved in an accident. The first set of regulations dealing with over 200 inflammable liquids is almost ready and will be laid before Parliament very soon&#x2014;in April, I hope.<br/>
The preparation of these regulations has taken many months, partly because of the technical difficulties involved in identifying the many substances concerned, and partly because of the protracted negotiations with industry which were necessary so as to resovle the practical difficulties created for it by the terms of the new regulations. It is clearly essential to work in close co-operation with industry, because unduly restrictive regulations would not only increase production and marketing costs but would put the United Kingdom at a disadvantage in international markets.<br/>
The need to reach the right balance between the requirements of safety and commercial advantage tend, in practice, to produce many problems. As a result of the experience we have gained, we hope that regulations for the other priority classes I have mentioned will follow more quickly. A considerable amount of spadework has been done on regulations dealing with the labelling of other dangerous substances, namely, corrosives and organic peroxides, during conveyance, and I hope that these will be ready by the end of the year. I hesitate to make any prediction at present about the making of regulations for the labelling of poisons&#x2014;the other class to which the Committee decided to give

priority&#x2014;if only because there is a limit to the amount of work which can be handled simultaneously.<br/>
Once the Committee can turn its attention to poisons, I do not expect the preparation of regulations to take very long. It should not be forgotten that the Poisons Rules, 1966, already provide safeguards for the conveyance of listed poisons relating to packaging and labelling. A number of other tasks still await the Committee's attention&#x2014;for example, packaging, mixed loading and operation and construction of vehicles, although work on the last of these has already begun. The Committee's future programme is very full in respect of the priority classes alone. One other major class remains to be tackled&#x2014;compressed and liquefied gases. This is a matter to which we shall turn our attention as soon as the Home Office Gas Cylinders and Containers Committee has presented its report. My right hon. Friend expects to receive this report in April.<br/>
International negotiations have long been going on in this whole field. These have resulted in the European Agreement on the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road, to which the United Kingdom is a signatory. Attached to the Agreement, which came into force towards the end of last month, are very full technical annexes relating to goods and vehicles and comprising a detailed and comprehensive safety code covering a wide range of dangerous substances. In view of the growing volume of road traffic which crosses international frontiers, it is clearly desirable that domestic regulations should be in accordance with the provisions of these technical annexes, and this has been done as far as is acceptable in the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom throughout has been closely involved in these international negotiations and has strongly influenced the final form of the Agreement.<br/>
The hon. Member for Wembley, South (Sir R. Russell) referred to his concern about the staffing in the Explosives Branch. I can assure him that this is under review. In any case, there has been some slight increase in the staff of the Explosives Branch. This has not been one of the reasons for the delay in bringing forward the regulations to which I have already made reference.


The question whether part of this responsibility should pass to the Ministry of Transport is being examined at the present time and certainly no decision has been taken on this point. It is being looked at between Departments.<br/>
To sum up, explosives, petroleum and some other dangerous substances, when conveyed by road, are already subject to strict control. By April, I hope that over 20C, inflammable liquids will be added to the list of substances controlled, and by December about 135 corrosives and 40 organic peroxides.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1968-02-19a.201.0" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. Homer" colnum="201" time="">
<p>Is it intended that the inflammable liquids shall be controlled in a manner similar to that applying to petroleum spirit?</p>

<p>I cannot at the moment indicate the precise nature of the control, but, as I said, the regulations themselves will be coming forward in April and my hon. Friend will have an opportunity of seeing them then.<br/>
As I said, by December we hope to have about 135 corrosives and 40 organic peroxides controlled by regulations. If we can achieve these targets, we shall go a long way towards meeting the immediate requirements of the emergency services&#x2014;fire, police and ambulance&#x2014;as well as others whose business is the safe conveyance of dangerous substances by road.<br/>
I assure my hon. Friend that 1 share his sense of urgency in this task. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has set a programme of work, accepting as he does that this is a matter of urgency, and it is a matter which has been too long delayed. Matters are well in hand and I think my hon. Friend will be satisfied with the progress report when it comes forward.</p>
