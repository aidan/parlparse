<p>asked the Minister of Labour whether men called up and medically examined, but who have had their posting to the Armed Forces deferred for a period, will be given a further medical examination before having to report for service?</p>

<p>I have given consideration to this question. If re-examination after a specified period were to be prescribed, it would not be administratively practicable to confine it to men about to be called up, and a great amount of trouble and expense would be caused to no purpose. I propose, therefore, to arrange for men who have been medically examined to be informed that they should let the Ministry know if subsequently they think there has been any deterioration in their physical condition, so that a further medical examination may be held in such cases. This arrangement will cover cases that would not be included in a system of automatic re-examination after a fixed period.</p>

<p>Has my right lion. Friend been in touch with the Ministry of Pensions and the Army authorities to safeguard these Departments against the possibility of men being called up who, unknown to themselves, have become unlit? As the right hon. Gentleman knows, the question relates to the opportunity provided for men who are called up to make a further application for postponement on grounds of hardship. How does the Minister propose to provide for them?</p>

<p>On the basis of such information as is available, relating mainly to rates of wages fixed by collective agreements, arbitration awards, or statutory orders, it is estimated that the average rise in the level of weekly full-time rates of wages between 1st September, 1939, and 1st June, 1941, was about 20 per cent. The official cost-of-living index figure rose by 29 per cent. between 1st September, 1939, and 31st May, 1941.</p>

<p>Yes, Sir, I have done that over and over again. I have asked an officer of my Department to take special steps to try and induce the setting-up of this machinery, but the setting-up of machinery by itself, unless there is the will to work it, is no good.</p>

<p>I assume my hon. Friend refers to the statement I made in January, that the reservoir of unemployed male labour was exhausted and that the problem of having to obtain a great recruitment of labour from non-essential occupations and from the unoccupied had to be faced. That was a statement of fact based on a careful analysis of the composition of the register of unemployed men. The fact that on the day of the count in May there were about 109,000 less men registered as wholly unemployed on that day than on the corresponding day in January does not affect the accuracy of my statement. Apart from those not suitable for industrial employment, the great majority on the register on any particular day are not a reservoir of unemployed labour but are merely passing from one job to another. I am sending my hon. Friend a copy of a statement relating to the February figures which demonstrates the position.</p>

<p>I am advised that day baking, which is not a new development though it may lately have increased, cannot be relied upon to obviate the necessity for a considerable amount of night baking, at any rate under war conditions, and I see no reason to depart from the conclusions given in my reply of 1st May to the hon. and learned Member for Greenock (Mr. R.

<p>It is not the case that it has increased during the present year. That is contrary to the facts. If a director of anti-looting measures were appointed, he would be dependent on the police in any case, and I cannot see the point of it.

It is often exceedingly difficult to bring an offender to justice, but I am satisfied that the police are tackling the problem with an increasing measure of success.</p>

<p>There are 273 adults and 77 children under the age of 14. The rental compensation under Section 2 (1) (<i>a</i>) of the Compensation (Defence) Act, 1939, is estimated at &#x00A3;3,040 per annum.

<p>First of all, I do not bring them to London. I would point out that these are evacuees from the Rock of Gibraltar.

<p>asked the Home.

<p>As my hon. Friend is aware, I have given the most careful consideration to this question, and it has been fully discussed at a meeting which my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Undersecretary of State had with representatives of the County Council. The building schemes of the Devon Standing Joint Committee were reviewed after the outbreak of war, and the decision was reached


that with some modifications only the new stations at Torquay and Totnes should be proceeded with. In each case the existing premises are old and inadequate for the increased number of personnel&#x2014;the police war reserve and special constables &#x2014;using them. The conditions in these stations are not, I am advised, conducive to efficient working, and I am satisfied that the proposals as now modified are essential to the efficiency of the police force. The Government, after taking full account of the situation, decided that in the allocation of labour and material for building purposes due provision must be made for essential police buildings.</p>

<p>Because I do not agree with them. Perhaps I may add that this is part of a programme in which a great many things were not done before the war, and I am not aware that similar arguments were raised then. In the case of Totnes, the position is that all the available space is overcrowded. Cells are used as stores, and a narrow cell corridor is used by two clerks as an office, and 'they and their chairs and desks have to be moved before a prisoner can be taken to or from the cells. Senior police officers are scattered at points away from the station, and this interferes considerably with the efficient working of the police. There are somewhat similar problems at Torquay. In time of war it is important, I think, that the police force should have decent conditions under which to do their work efficiently.</p>

<p>asked the Minister of Agriculture, on what grounds Mr. Mason, of Wharram Percy, Malton, was forcibly ejected from his farm at Birds all, on Saturday, 14th June; how much land was in cultivation on this farm; what stock was on the farm; what order made by the war agriculture committee Mr. Mason has not carried out; and to whom the farm has been let, and at what rental?</p>

<p>Mr. Mason was ejected from his holding for failing to comply with an order of the East Riding War Agricultural Executive Committee directing him to give up possession of the holding on 15th May, in consequence of the termination of his tenancy under Regulation 62 of the Defence Regulations. All the land on the holding was under cultivation, but a considerable acreage was unsatisfactory. The stock on the holding, which is 880 acres in extent, comprised about 400 sheep, seven horses, 10 cows and 20 store cattle. Some of these were not Mr. Mason's property. Orders of the committee giving directions to Mr. Mason as to manuring the land were not complied with. The farm has been let to Mr. Lister at a rent of &#x00A3;200 a year rising to &#x00A3;400 a year. I naturally regret the necessity for the action taken in this case, but I am satisfied that in the national interest no other course was open to the East Riding War Agricultural Executive Committee.</p>

<p>I asked the Prime Minister last week to see that an important Bill dealing with Scotland was brought in. This Bill affects people who have been bombed out of their houses. There is no mention of it in the forthcoming Business. It is a terribly important matter for poor people. A Bill has been passed in England in connection with this matter, and the law needs clarification in Scotland. Could we have a statement at an early date as to when the law in Scotland on this matter will be brought up to date?</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page I, line 7, after "may, "to insert:
<q>after consultation with the appropriate trade organisation.</q>
I move this Amendment in the absence of the hon. Member for Frome (Mrs. Tate). Not only do I consider this a most necessary safeguard for traders, particularly before the fixing of maximum prices under this Measure, but I attach special importance to the phrase "appropriate trade organisation." As the President of the Board of Trade is aware, there are trade organisations which cover not only a multitude of sins, but a multitude of trades. While it may be presumed that the trade organisation mentioned in the Amendment might mean, for instance, the National Chamber of Trade or the London and Suburban Traders'

Federation, I hope that it will be interpreted as meaning the actual organisation representing the trade to which a specified Order may refer. For instance, in the case of Orders relating to men's tailoring, there is the Merchant Tailors' Association just as, in the case of women's wear, there would be a particular trade organisation concerned with those goods.<br/>
In many instances where it is a case of officials of a trade organisation being brought into consultation with the Board of Trade, it is usual to consult the chair man or president or secretary of the main organisation or, shall I call it, the parent organisation. I am asking the President of the Board of Trade to particularise in this respect. Sub-section (2) of this Clause emphasises the necessity for this Amendment. It is an elaboration of the proposal which I am now advocating referring as it does to the fact that a parent organisation could not have the technical knowledge which would enable it to differentiate between different classes of the same description of goods. On the other hand, individual associations representing the particular industries referred to and the particular goods specified, can assist those persons who will have to come to decisions, in regard to different classes of the same description of goods. While I am on this Clause may I ask whether Sub-section (3) means that the retailer must notify every sale&#x2014;</p>

<p>I can assure my hon. and gallant Friend that it is the intention of the Board of Trade and of the Central Price Regulation Committee to keep in close touch with the trade organisations and to give the fullest weight to their experience and advice. We could not, however, accept this Amendment which would make it obligatory, in all cases, to consult the traders' organisation. It is


sometimes difficult to know what is the appropriate trade organisation in a particular case and there are cases&#x2014;which will be exceptional&#x2014;in which we should have to take specially rapid action. I can assure my hon. and gallant Friend, however, that it has been the practice in the working of the Prices of Goods Act for the Central Price Regulation Committee to take counsel with the appropriate trade association, where there is such, in every possible case, and in the administration of this Measure the fullest weight will, as I have said, be given to the advice of the organisations concerned where consultation is possible.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 1, line 11, after the second "sell," to insert "expose for sale."<br/>
The purpose of this Amendment is to make it plain that where a seller exposes goods and places on them a ticket bearing a price, and where that price is in excess of the maximum, he shall, thereby, be committing an offence It may seem obvious that in such circumstances he would be committing an offence, but a number of decisions have been given in the courts to the effect that the mere placing of a price-ticket on goods is not to be regarded as an offer of the goods for sale. There is a well-known case in which a coat was displayed in a window bearing a ticket with the price &#x00A3;20. A person went into the shop, put down &#x00A3;20, and said, "I will have that coat." The shopkeeper said, "No, the price of that coat is &#x00A3;100." The prospective purchaser brought an action against the shopkeeper and it was held that the mere affixing of a price-ticket to the coat did not constitute an offer for sale. In the course of present-day dealings, many cases may arise in which shopkeepers will put tickets on coats bearing prices which may be in excess of the maximum price. If the Clause stands as it is now drafted, they cannot be held to be committing an offence. I know many cases in which shopkeepers have been prosecuted but have evaded their responsi-

bility by alleging that they were not offering the goods for sale. I would like to see these words inserted to make it clear that a person offering goods for sale and attaching to them a price in excess of the maximum will be committing an offence. If the Amendment is accepted, as I hope it will be&#x2014;because we are all agreed as to the purpose of the Clause&#x2014;certain consequential Amendments will be necessary in other parts of the Bill to which the same considerations apply.</p>

<p>With the objects of the hon. Member's Amendment I entirely agree, but I am advised that Clause 20 (4) meets the case which he has in mind. There, an "offer to sell" is defined as including the
<q>notification by a person of the price proposed by him for a sale of goods by exposing goods for sale in association with a mark indicating price.</q>
That, I am advised, will achieve the objects which the hon. Member has in view, without the necessity for any such Amendment as that now proposed.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 1, line 13, at the end, to insert:
<q>(2) The Board of Trade shall take into consideration any application for the making of any such order received from any body of persons appearing to the Board to be representative of traders in goods of any description, or, with respect to goods of any description, from the central price-regulation committee.</q>
This Amendment ought to appeal to the Board of Trade. It in no way affects the power of the Board to issue Orders or fix prices. It does not infringe on the Board's authority. The Amendment is calculated to assist the Board, while, at the same time, giving the trading community a sense of responsibility. Honest traders&#x2014;and they are in the majority&#x2014;desire to assist the Government and the consuming public in this national crisis. Their advice should be welcome, because it is based on practical experience. The men behind the counter have a knowledge of the intricacies of trade and the needs of the consuming public which should be


of immense value to the Board of Trade, and I hope the Amendment will be accepted.</p>

<p>The point I wish to make in connection with this Amendment is, that the price regulation committees will also be consulted before these Orders are made. We are exceedingly anxious that there should be consultation with these committees which have done good work in the past. It may be that the point will be covered in one of the succeeding Clauses of the Bill, but I would like to take this opportunity to emphasise the desirability of taking into consideration in the framing of these Orders the experience of the price regulation committees.</p>

<p>I support this Amendment and wish to remind my right hon. Friend of the provisions of the Act which this Bill seeks to improve under which there was power not to fix prices but to set up a permitted price. That power to-day is in the hands of the Board of Trade, but the initiative in that connection under the Act can come from three different parties. I am referring to Section 5 of that Act, in which it can come from the Board of Trade, the Central Price Regulation Committee, or on the application of a body representative of the traders. In the Bill that we have before us&#x2014;and I have regard to the assurance of my right hon. Friend as to matters of consultation&#x2014;in terms at any rate, the initiative is reserved entirely to the Board of Trade. I urge my right hon. Friend to accept either this Amendment or something to the same effect, which would allow the initiative to representative bodies and to the Central Price Regulation Committee. I am not suggesting that the Board of Trade under the direction of my right hon. Friend lack initiative, but I am sure that he would agree that on occasion it can be of considerable assistance to him to see that the wheels are set in motion by representative bodies and by the Central Price Regulation Committee.</p>

<p>I think that this Amendment is unnecessary, because I cannot imagine any instance in which the Board of Trade would not take into consideration an application made by a representative body. It would be a grave dereliction of duty if they did not. I believe that the hon. Member for Carmarthen

(Mr. Hughes) is basing his case on Section 5 (1) of the Prices of Goods Act, which provision had a different purpose. Section 5 was intended to enable the Board of Trade, if asked to do so by traders concerned, to fix the permitted price mainly for the convenience of the particular section of the trade, in order that they could be sure that, if they sold at that permitted price, they would be outside the possibility of prosecution. This is rather a different matter. In so far as the Board of Trade are going to fix maximum prices, it would, in the ordinary course of events, be their duty to take into consideration any representations which were made. I can assure the hon. Member that that will be done. I do not think that the proposed words really help us at all. They really impose no obligation which would not be accepted by almost any prudent Department.</p>

<p>That is just the point that I was trying to explain. Under the original Act this right was given in order that the trader should be able to ask for the permitted price and, the permitted price having been laid down, should be sure, if selling at that price, that he would be free from the danger of prosecution. It is quite a different procedure under this Clause because the maximum price is the only permitted price. In the permitted price there is a number of other factors which come under consideration.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 1, line 19, to leave out "by retail."<br/>
This does not mean that I am in any sense trying to exempt retail traders from the obligation imposed upon them by the Board of Trade to display their prices. The obvious intention of this Sub-section is to protect the public by methods of ticketing or printing upon the articles in order to protect the ultimate buyer. I wholeheartedly agree that the Board of Trade should have power to impose the obligation of ticketing articles or informing in some way or another the ultimate buyer of the price fixed by the Board of Trade under the Act. But my right hon. Friend is well aware&#x2014;he is far better informed than I am in this matter&#x2014;that many catalogues and price lists are not for the public to read but are issued for the benefit of wholesalers, factors and retailers. I cannot understand why the Board of Trade do not seek to take powers in the appropriate cases to compel manufacturers, wholesalers, or distributors to set out in their catalogues, or in proper places, the prices which they would be authorised to charge by the Order of the Board of Trade made under this Bill. I think that in this instance I can call in aid the support of the hon. Member for Balham and Tooting(Mr. Doland). As the Clause now stands, it assumes that the only person who needs to be kept in check from abusing or defying the Order of the Board is the retailer. It is not fair to assume that it is only the retailer. There may also be manufacturers, wholesalers and distributors who may need to be kept in check, and in order that the Board might have sufficient power to impose conditions upon them in appropriate cases similar to the conditions imposed upon retailers, I ask my right hon. Friend to accept this Amendment.</p>

<p>I am prepared to accept this Amendment. I think that as a rule this provision is necessary for the protection of the ultimate consumer, but, owing to the knowledge of the trade, it might be unnecessary for the Order to prescribe similar requirements at other stages.

Nevertheless, we accept the Amendment, because it gives me power to include such provisions in Orders if required.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 2, line 28, at the end, to insert:
<q>Provided that it shall not be a defence where the employer or other specified person alleged to have given such instructions is a body corporate.</q>
My Amendment seeks to provide protection for the man or woman who sells goods behind the counter against whom, in law, if he or she had been engaged in one of these transactions, an action would normally lie. It does not in any way seek to limit the protection which has been given. It will be observed that the defence which is open to the shop assistant in the ordinary case depends upon two conditions. First, is the condition that the assistant should have acted in the course of his employment, and that condition, of course, is satisfied where the assistant is employed by an individual employer, corporation or limited company. The second condition is that in so acting the assistant has acted upon the instructions of his employer or some other specified person. Now in law that word "person" is wide enough to cover limited companies, and I do not desire that this defence should be extended to cases where the defence put up was (<i>a</i>) "I acted in the course of my employment" or (<i>b</i>) "The instructions I received were the instructions from X company."<br/>
As the Clause now stands, that defence would be a valid defence. Then the shop


assistant, quite properly, is exonerated, and the prosecutor will proceed to move against the company. A limited company, a body corporate, has been described as something which has no soul to be saved and no body to be kicked, and I cannot see that impositions upon limited companies will provide the proper sort of sanction that is required to see that these provisions are duly carried out. Further, in the defence as it stands now there exists the possibility of abusing the company law, as it has been on many occasions, by the old device of the one-man company. The man who serves behind the counter may in fact be the company; he may own the shares and control all its affairs. He has only to whisper, and the orders of the company will be carried out. He is, in fact, the person who can lie back and say, "I acted as an employ&#x00E9; of the company, which is a different legal entity altogether. "He can say," I acted on the instructions of the company," which are really his own instructions, and that would satisfy the defence as it is now laid out. I say that if you want to avail yourself of this defence, you have to say "Not only was it in the course of my employment, but my instructions were given to me, not by Company A, but by Mr. A or Mr. B or some other individual who can be pursued."</p>

<p>The effect of this Amendment would be entirely to defeat the object the hon. Member has in mind, because it would differentiate against the employ&#x00E9; of a limited company as opposed to the employ&#x00E9; of a private firm. The instance of a one-man company which the hon. Member gave did not appear to me to take us very far, because a person acting as a company's agent would be pursued as the principal for having committed a breach of the Act. There is nothing we can do to alter the fact that the majority of business transactions in all branches of trade are carried out by limited companies. If they have no souls, they certainly have purses. I think it is doubtful whether a body corporate can give instructions at all. They have to be given by power of delegation through one of the company's officers.</p>

<p>I think it can be admitted that this Bill is concerned only with consumers. We heard little during the Second Reading, and we have heard little up to now, about the safeguards which should be given to the trader. This Clause allows the Board of Trade to fix maximum prices for specified goods which will prevent excessive rises in the charges for those goods. Traders have no quarrel with that. The President of the Board of Trade on the Second Reading of this Bill said these very significant words:
<q>Some rise in prices must be justifiable and inevitable."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 19th June, 1941; col. 852, Vol. 372.]</q>
But there is nothing in this Clause or in any other Clause, so far as I can see, which will safeguard the trading community from being pushed out of business if maximum prices which are made for specified goods are such as will not give the trader a sufficient margin to cover his overheads, let alone give him a small profit.<br/>
When the Bill is passed, traders will have to rely not only on the good will, fairness and honesty of purpose of the Board of Trade, but also on the Central Price Regulation Committee, which will be responsible for making the maximum prices. In the Second Reading Debate, the President of the Board of Trade paid a tribute to the British traders for being patriotic and law-abiding, and for submitting willingly, as a general rule, to restrictions on trade once they are satisfied that those restrictions are being equitably applied. With regard to this Clause, which is the principal Clause of the Bill, we sincerely trust that its provisions will be equitably applied in fixing maximum prices. As there is nothing that I can find in this Clause, or in any other Clause, to give this information to the trader, how does he know that the Central Price Regulation Committee, which I understand is responsible for advising the Board of Trade as to the maximum price for the goods specified, will fix a maximum price within which there will be a sufficient margin, and that that maximum price will be equitably applied? This Clause wholly concerns the consumers. The traders are given no assurance whatever that the maximum prices to be fixed will be such


as to allow them to continue their business. I am most anxious to ascertain whether the small trader will be able to continue in business when this Clause is in operation.<br/>
My right hon. Friend said that the costs which are allowed to be taken into the computation at present may require adjustment, and he mentioned overhead expenses in relation to reduced turnover. My right hon. Friend admits that there must be some increase in prices, but in making the maximum prices, surely he does not suggest that, with traders working under the rationing orders, the turnover of retail establishments will be increased and the overheads consequently reduced? That would be an impossibility to-day. The fact is that traders are rapidly going out of business owing to the rationing order and other similar measures. I consider that my right hon. Friend is a very optimistic man if he thinks that the turnover of any retail establishment will be fixed in such a way that the overheads will come down. Does he intend to allow, in the maximum prices, for that to come about? I repeat that there is great alarm in the trading community lest the maximum price of goods specified is fixed without due regard being had to that diminished turnover which will be the inevitable result. not of causes under the control of traders, but of the Acts and orders passed by the House. When, in the Second Reading Debate, my right hon. Friend spoke of the early bird, the two extreme examples which he gave certainly referred to the vultures of that species and not to the poor little sparrows, the small traders. It is not the small trader who makes these excessive profits out of helmets and vacuum flasks. Unless great care is taken in carrying out this Clause, the small sparrows may be devoured by the-big birds, or by the Board of Trade. I hope my right hon. Friend will give an assurance to traders that the equitable treatment to which he has referred will be meted out to them.</p>

A shop may have sold over 1,000 overcoats in a year, but owing to the exigencies of the war situation, its sale of overcoats may fall to one. Does the hon. Gentleman suggest that the whole of the overheads previously distributed over 1,000 overcoats should be placed on the one overcoat, and that overcoat be sold, not at a low price, but at an extremely prohibitive price?

<p>I should like to say a few words concerning Sub-section (3) of the Clause, which states:
<q>Any such order fixing the maximum price to be charged for goods of any description in the course of a business which includes the selling of the goods by retail may require such steps as may be specified in the order to be taken to bring the said price to the notice of persons to whom the goods are offered for sale by retail in the course of the business.</q>
With regard to bringing the correct price to the notice of the potential buyer, a great deal of trouble has been experienced, particularly by smaller shops, in understanding the provisions of the various orders that have been issued I wonder whether the President of the Board of Trade can provide, in another place, that this notice shall be brought in a special from In the case of packet goods, would it be impossible to provide that the permitted price, or the maximum price, should be stamped on the packet? There are many inspectors going round the country to see whether some poor widow who owns a shop is charging a farthing too much, but it seems to me that the greatest guilt does not lie with the small shopkeeper, but farther back in the production and general distribution. I wonder whether the President of the Board of Trade can give a more concrete and effective form to this provision. It would be of considerable importance, especially to the smaller retailer.</p>

<p>I should like to amplify that point, particularly in regard to drapery goods. In that connection I know something of the methods employed, and I have never dealt with stores which do not give fixed figures. It is well known that there is a varying price, and that the assistants can charge according to what they think the customer is likely to pay. Perhaps the President of the Board of Trade can give us an assurance, when a price is fixed for goods, that the regulated price must be plainly marked. I do not necessarily mean that tickets should be displayed in the windows, because that is generally done; I suggest that prices should be shown in plain figures for the customer to see.</p>

<p>The remarks of the hon. Member for North Aberdeen (Mr. Garro

Jones) are extremely pertinent to this matter. You have to have discretion in the matter, or we should be immediately driven off the whole objects of the Bill. For instance, when we talk about fixing a maximum price which will allow profits to all traders, what does that mean on examination? Suppose a trader has a large mortgage on his premises and has to meet interest charges on those premises before he can make a profit. It would be a very different maximum price for that trader compared with another trader who has no mortgage on his premises. There is no way of administering or achieving the objects we wish, unless there are wide powers. We recognise that, and we try to introduce reasonable safeguards, such as those provided by the Central Price Regulation Committee and the local committees who can be relied on to give sensible advice regarding maximum prices. I cannot see that we can have any more assurances than are already contained in the Bill. It is, I think, generally recognised that the Central Price Regulation Committee has, under the present Act, worked effectively. To begin to give any undertaking that so-and-so's overhead charges and so-and-so's interest on a mortgage will be included in the maximum price, is obviously impossible.<br/>
With regard to the suggestion that packets should have the price stamped on, I would point out that if there were any alteration in the maximum price, the confusion would be worse than if the price were marked separately. The suggestion presupposes that the maximum price will be fixed for a long period and will not be altered; but where a price is altered there will be more confusion among the smaller traders than if they had to put up another label. With regard to the other question, goods displayed at a given price must be sold at that price.</p>

He will know, of course, that it is not uncommon for a customer to know in a rough and ready way what is the price of an article.

There will be hundreds of thousands of such claims any one of which may involve reference to a thousand prices.

I mentioned the subject matter of this Amendment on the Second Reading and suggested that, in view of the necessity for speedy action in regard to Orders to be made by the Board of Trade in varying the Schedule, instead of adopting the procedure laid down in the Bill, by which they would have to come to both Houses for an affirmative Resolution, they should rather adopt the other method by which they could issue their Order, which would become valid unless there were a Resolution to annul. That is common in legislation of this kind. Unfortunately, I was not present, but I read the remarks of the Parliamentary Secretary with care, and I inferred generally from

what he said that he thought the procedure that I suggested was not so much in consonance with Parliamentary control as the procedure laid down in the Bill. I have as much regard to proper control by Parliament as anyone, but I am concerned with speed. The Parliamentary Secretary also seemed to imply that there was some degree of importance which had to be taken into account and that, if the matter were really fundamental and important, this affirmative Resolution was the proper method, while matters of minor moment could go through in the way I suggest of an Order being valid unless annulled. I submit that there is no substance whatever in that implication. I have taken my Amendment from the Factories Acts, where there is provision for the Home Secretary to make Regulations in respect of safety and protection and matters of that kind. If that procedure, giving the Minister power to make Orders subject to subsequent annulment, is good enough to provide for the protection of life and limb of thousands of workpeople, it is certainly good enough to decide Whether or not you will allow certain types of advertising to come into costs.<br/>
My motive is the matter of speed and adaptability. I will mention one factor which makes speed necessary. There is a process now going on for the concentration of production, and, in the course of that process, a number of firms will be closed down and their work handed over to what are described as nucleus concerns, and it will be the duty of the nucleus concern to provide out of the trade which remains to it a part of its profits to the concerns which have been closed down. The right hon. Gentleman ought to have power to move quickly. As things stand now, I do not know how far the obligation to provide payment to close down concerns is entitled to be brought in as a factor in justifying the nucleus concern to raise its prices. That question will arise from time to time in different industries and trades, and the President of the Board of Trade has suggested that in regard to that matter alone he ought to be allowed the opportunity of having in his hands powers which he can exercise at once. Otherwise, it would be easy for obstruction, if it desired to raise its head, to make itself effective. In spite of what the Parliamentary Secretary has said I


urge that this power should be taken, because I am satisfied, and I think the Committee will be satisfied, that only by this method can we get sufficient adaptability and speed to meet circumstances as they change.</p>

<p>I think my hon. Friend has really got the position rather twisted round. There are two points, the first being the difference between this Clause and the other Clauses of the Bill. Under this Clause we are taking powers to alter the words of the principal Statute, while under other Clauses we are taking powers to make Orders. I think he will appreciate that that is a very material difference indeed. The second point he raised concerned expedition if what he called the ugly head of obstruction reared itself. Here I do not think his proposal quite meets the situation. Under it, my right hon. Friend might be kept on tenterhooks, not only for a day or so, but for 40 days, because this Order would lie on the Table for 40 days and, on the 39th day, when he might think he was getting away with it, my hon. Friend or somebody else might come along with a Prayer against it. We want this power for use in urgent cases. I think that, both from the legal point of view and from the point of view of expedition, our way is better, and it is infinitely better from the Parliamentary point of view.</p>

<p>You courteously indicated. Colonel Clifton Brown, that on the Question of the Clause standing part I could raise the matter which I wished to raise earlier. As to the Clause itself, obviously it is a very great improvement upon the provisions in the original Bill. It is obviously an advantage that powers of this kind should reside in the President of the Board of Trade. These costs and charges alter, and if the President

of the Board of Trade cannot watch trends of this kind I feel it is impossible for other people to watch them, and I think the power we are now putting into his hands will be well and truly used. The point I wished to raise earlier concerns people who have to call in a furniture remover to take their furniture from one part of the country to another. It is difficult always to say what the charge for such service should be, and I wonder whether the President would be good enough to indicate the kind of machinery he proposes to set up to see that profiteering does not take place in these cases. As he undoubtedly knows, there is a great deal of feeling in regard to this matter, and although I am not going to press this suggestion I think it might be worth while to consider setting up an office under his Ministry to which a man who had received an estimate for the removal of his goods might take that estimate to ascertain whether it was or was not a fair charge It is obviously difficult to fix a flat rate for removals based upon mileage, because some people's effects include, for example, a great deal of china, which has to be specially packed, whereas other people have only a straightforward lot of furniture to be dealt with. We may get ourselves into difficulties unless we have thought out in advance the machinery which will have to be put into operation. Could not we have an office to which estimates could be taken to be "vetted"? It would follow from that that when the Board of Trade had given a decision that decision would have to be binding upon the furniture remover.</p>

<p>When we discussed this matter some time ago I put forward several cases in which there had been attempts at profiteering. One was a particularly glaring case. Certain people wished to remove from Leigh-on-Sea to Muswell Hill, and the estimates for the removal of their furniture ranged up to &#x00A3;23. In the end a Muswell Hill remover did the work for &#x00A3;6, and thought that was a fair charge. I put the whole case before the Ministry of Transport, but they did not take any action. As a consequence of the steps I took in this matter I have been getting letters from all over the country showing that this profiteering is very widespread, and something ought to be done to prevent it, particularly in cases where people are forced to leave


certain districts owing to bombing or other circumstances.</p>

<p>I agree that there is a serious cause of complaint here. The charges for many of these services have been exorbitant. I feel, however, that to set up an office to which estimates could be submitted would be to deal with the situation in a very cumbersome way. Under this Bill we shall be setting up a body of inspectors throughout the country, and there are already local price regulation committees. Surely it is better for the public to complain either to an inspector or to a local committee than to have to go to some central bureau. In any case it would be almost impossible to administer such a bureau in these difficult times. We hope the machinery which I have described will meet all the needs of the case.</p>

<p>This is one of the operative Clauses of the Bill, and I would ask the right hon. Gentleman one or two questions about it. Inspectors will be able to walk into any shop of which they have suspicion, and if every shop were owned by the person behind the counter, all might be well. The inspector can call for books and other documents. I am thinking of multiple shops with branches all over the Kingdom and of Co-operative societies, and, as one who has worked in a shop himself, I think there is something offensive in calling upon a shop assistant or a branch manager to produce books to an inspector of the Board of Trade when those books are the property of the headquarters of the organisation.<br/>
Suppose the inspector walks into a branch of a Co-operative society and demands of the branch manager to see


the books. Those books do not belong to the branch manager but to the headquarters of the society, the office of which is probably in the same town. Could it not be arranged that, in order that the Clause should work smoothly, the inspector should go to the central premises and ask for the books and other documents relating to the branch? The persons responsible for dealing with such matters are not the branch officers but those at the headquarters. In the case of a firm with headquarters in London and branches all over the country it may be difficult to go to the central premises about the books of a branch which may be 100 miles away, but I feel there is something wrong if a man who is just a servant has to be faced with an inspector demanding from him information which, in the ordinary way, he gives to nobdy but his employers.</p>

<p>I can reassure the hon. Gentleman on both the points he has put. Inspectors have just the very power for which he asks, that of entering any premises occupied for the purpose of the business, and clearly the headquarters premises are just as much occupied for the purpose of the business as are any of the branches. If the inspector thinks there are books or invoices, he can, and most probably will, go to where those books and invoices are kept, so that he may see them and satisfy himself on any matter about which he has doubt.</p>

<p>The Parliamentary Secretary has stated that the inspector will probably go to a certain place; surely it is not expected that a firm will duplicate its invoices 50 times and distribute them among its 50 branches in case the document should be demanded by an inspector. The Parliamentary Secretary should give a more definite assurance than that inspectors, will probably go to the head office, and should say that they must go to the headquarters to obtain information which they desire.</p>

<p>I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary has entirely grasped the point raised by my hon. Friend beside me. The point he had in mind is the very embarrassing position which the shop assistant will be put into if an inspector suddenly turns up at the shop and calls

upon him to produce certain books or documents, or to make statements, in relation to matters over which he has no adequate control, and yet of which he is technically in control at the moment the" inspector arrives. Take, for instance, this illustration. Suppose an inspector comes to a shop and the person in charge of the books, and his second in command, are out for lunch. The inspector may say to an assistant who is present, "You are in charge of this shop for the moment; produce the books and answer certain questions." He may be an employ&#x00E9;who has only been at the shop a few weeks or even days, and he will be put into a position of great difficulty and serious embarrasment if he is called upon to produce books and papers, and answer questions, when in fact such demands ought to be addressed to a person in a much higher position.</p>

<p>Clearly an inspector who goes into a branch shop will not expect to find there invoices which are not normally issued from there. He would find out where the invoices were kept and would go to the office from which they are normally issued. My right hon. Friend the Member for East Edinburgh (Mr. Pethick-Lawrence) raised another point, but I think that that also could be dealt with by the common sense of the inspector. It is laid down in the Bill that inspections are to be made at reasonable times, and I think it would be only fair to assume that it would not be a reasonable time for such an inspection if there were only on office boy in charge.</p>

<p>Clause 13 provides that the Board of Trade may require the seller to furnish an invoice to the buyer. How are we to determine who is the seller? Is it the man who buys the raw material, is it the man who puts it through the first process, the second, third, fourth or fifth? An article may go through a dozen different processes, and how are the Board of Trade to determine which of the persons performing those various processes is the


seller; or has there to be an invoice such as is referred to in this Bill every time the goods change hands? It is well known that merchants can buy and sell more cheaply to the users than the actual manufacturer. This is brought about by the fact that the user buys few and the agent buys many. Who is the seller&#x2014;is it the manufacturer, or is it the agent? I confess that this is most confusing to me and I would like the hon. and gallant Gentleman to clear up the point.</p>

<p>It seems to me that there can be only one buyer and one seller in any particular transaction, although one article may go through a series of processes.

As soon as that point is reached, every transaction between traders which takes place afterwards is covered by this Clause. If the article is sold from a manufacturer to a wholesaler, that is one transaction; from the wholesaler to the retailer is another transaction. In each of these specific transactions it is perfectly clear who is the buyer and who is the seller and, under the provisions of Clause 13, the necessary invoices would have to be furnished.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 12, line 35, at the end, to insert:
<q>(2) Where any person has been found guilty of an offence under this Act or under the principal Act and the Board of Trade is satisfied that the penalty imposed upon such conviction is inadequate (which shall be conclusively shown by a certificate of the President of the Board of Trade directing an appeal) an appeal shall lie against the penalty at the suit of the prosecutor in the proceedings before the court of summary jurisdiction to the appropriate court of Quarter Sessions.</q>
This Amendment is designed to deal with a situation which has caused, I know, considerable concern to the administrators not only of the Act which we are now seeking to amend but of other Acts, Orders and Regulations&#x2014;a concern which arises quite naturally because of the many cases where those guilty of flagrant offences have had derisory penalties meted out to them. In

case after case the penalty imposed has been but a flea-bite in comparison with the profit of the illegal trading. We have been told that prosecutions under the Prices of Goods Act have been few. That points clearly to the fact that we have had manifest difficulties which we are concerned to cure, but we have been given no particulars of those prosecutions, although such particulars were asked for during the Second Reading Debate. I am prepared to say, without any personal knowledge at all of that list of prosecutions, that there will be found on that list, penalties of the kind to which I have already referred. That has had serious effects on the administration of the Act. It has had effect not only upon committees which have to administer it and upon the enthusiasm of the inspectors whom we send round, but it has had effects and repercussions extending right up to the top of the Board of Trade. Imagine the President of the Board of Trade, or my hon. and gallant Friend the Parliamentary Secretary, calling for the returns of prosecutions for the last month and, on looking down the list, finding these little penalties&#x2014; &#x00a3;1 here, 40s. there&#x2014;and turning round and saying to his officials "Why on earth have we engaged in all this expense and bother "&#x2014;because it is expensive and bothersome for the Department to conduct these prosecutions&#x2014;" in order to produce these fiddling results? "<br/>
The result is a complete discouragement of the efforts which ought to be put forward to secure that the provisions of the law are properly carried out. I agree with what was said by my right hon. Friend the President of the Board of Trade on the Second Reading, and was emphasised by the hon. Member for Balham and Tooting (Mr. Doland), that it is only a fringe of traders who are responsible for non-observance of the law. At the same time we must remember that of that fringe, not more than a small percentage is ever caught and the only way to deter the remainder who are not caught is to be certain that the penalty fits the crime. That is all the Amendment is designed to do. I can see that I am up against serious difficulties. There are, as far as I can see, only three ways in which we can see that the penalty is adequate. The first is to impose a minimum penalty. That is not a method which would commend itself in this country. A system of


justice which is not flexible enough to take into account all the necessary variations of liability is not the kind of system we want in this country. There is a second alternative&#x2014;the setting up of special tribunals. Again I do not advocate that kind of Star Chamber method.<br/>
There remains only one other way of doing it. I challenge my hon. and gallant Friend the Parliamentary Secretary to point out any other way but the one I suggest, that is, to give to the Board of Trade, a responsible body, the power, where the penalty is inadequate, to appeal against the deficiency of the penalty. It is a right of appeal which is given to every defendant; he can appeal if he thinks the penalty is too much. In a case like this I think we, as a Committee, ought to grant the President of the Board of Trade the right of appeal when the penalty is not as heavy as it ought to be. It is a restricted right, a limited right, under the control of the President of the Board of Trade and has the safeguard, in that respect, that it would not be indiscriminately exercised. I shall look forward to the reply of my hon. and gallant Friend, and I venture to forecast that the only argument that can be offered against this proposal will be that we cannot have it because it is new and because there is no precedent in our law for this kind of case. I do urge that something should be done to make sure that we do not get these derisory penalties, and to see the law is adequately enforced.</p>

<p>It is not congenial for me to ask that heavier penalties should be imposed on anyone, even those who have done wrong. On the other hand, we do not want to make it possible for people to make a profit out of breaking the law, and that is what is happening in certain cases. I believe that the bulk of traders will not seek to break the law. Once the prices are fixed they will probably abide by them. There are, however, a few who break the law knowing quite well they are doing so and that they may be penalised, but who reckon that even when they take the penalty into account, they can still make a profit. There have been one or two glaring cases of food prosecutions. There was one particular example in the City of Glasgow where someone in respect of the marketing of eggs, was fined

&#x00A3;1,000. It was reckoned that they had made &#x00A3;3,000 or more on the transaction, and were prepared to pay the fine. It is just because there is a small section of traders of this description that we ask, in this Amendment, that where a fine or punishment is inadequate, the Board of Trade should have the right of appeal against the sentence.</p>

<p>The hon. Member who moved this Amendment prophesied as to who would give the answer and what the answer would be. He proved to be a very bad prophet about who would give the answer. I am not sure that he is in any better case about what the answer will be. Of course, one part of the answer is obviously to say that this is a wholly novel procedure that is suggested, without any precedent in our law, to make this very far-reaching alteration in our law giving a right of appeal to a prosecutor, and it cannot be dealt with as a side issue on a Goods and Services (Price Control) Bill. Obviously, if you are going to do any such thing, it ought to be part of a thought-out policy, applying, not only to this Bill, but to all sorts of other Bills as well. In addition, there is, as I see it, another very serious objection to the proposal. One thing we are very insistent upon, and proud of, in this country is the fact that the judiciary are free from interference by the Executive, and are not to be browbeaten by the Executive at all. It seems to me that this proposal would be quite a departure from that principle. Let us assume this case: A local bench of magistrates imposes a fine which is thought to be inadequate. Then my right hon. Friend the President of the Board of Trade has to give a certificate that the justices, in that particular case, imposed what is, in his opinion, too small a fine.</p>

<p>The President gives a certificate directing an appeal, a


certificate which conclusively shows that the penalty imposed is regarded as inadequate, and then the matter goes before the court of quarter sessions. At the court of quarter sessions the scales are indeed weighted against the defendant. Not only is he put in peril twice, but, on the second occasion, the prosecutor comes there waving in his hand a certificate of the President of the Board of Trade, who has applied his mind to the particular case, and saying that in the opinion of the President of the Board of Trade the previous penalty was inadequate. It is quite a proper thing for the Executive to circularise benches of magistrates throughout the country on general topics not relating to a particular case. The other day the Minister of Food did circularise magistrates pointing out how serious to the community, socially, were the consequences of breaches of the food laws. Here, too, it is desirable that some general course might be taken, but I should think it entirely wrong to send what is in effect an instruction, coming with the great authority possessed by my right hon. Friend the President of the Board of Trade, to justices who are hearing a particular case, telling them that in the opinion of the Board of Trade this, that, or the other penalty is inadequate. I must, therefore, resist the proposal, which I consider retrograde, undesirable, and in every way unnecessary.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 19, line 41, column 2, to leave out "Paragraph (<i>a</i>)," and to insert "The whole section."<br/>
I am afraid the Amendment is somewhat technical in character. I was not altogether surprised when someone asked me why I was not dealing with the point that I put on the Second Reading, relating to procedure in Scotland. In fact, this Amendment, in its rather technical terms, is designed to raise that very point. Section 21 of the Act referred to in the

Schedule relates to the application to Scotland. If the whole of Section 21 were repealed, instead of merely paragraph (<i>a</i>), it would get rid of the lengthy procedure to which I made reference on the Second Reading, and would result in a direct application to the Lord Advocate. It is for that purpose that I am moving this Amendment. The point is a very simple one. It is felt in Scotland that the procedure is unnecessarily cumbersome. The local price committee has to go to the Central Price Committee, the Central Price Committee has to go to the Board of Trade, the Board of Trade, presumably after making inquiries, has to go to the Lord Advocate, and the Lord Advocate has then to go to the local price committee before he instructs the Procurator-Fiscal. It has been suggested that that process might be short-circuited, so that the Lord Advocate, who is the initiator of all prosecutions in Scotland, may be approached direct instead of through the Board of Trade. I believe that there is a somewhat technical objection to this Amendment, but I do not think I need say anything further. If the Government cannot accept the Amendment in the form in which it is put down, I hope they will be able to indicate how they propose to short-circuit these proceedings, which in Scotland are unnecessarily long.</p>

<p>It is true that there are several technical objections to this Amendment, but it is quite proper that the principle should be discussed. I think that the Amendment could not possibly achieve the object sought, which, I understand, is to cut out two stages of the present procedure. The first is the recourse to the Central Price Committee; and the second, the recourse to the Board of Trade. In so far as the recourse to the Central Committee is to prevent any measure of hardship or injustice to accused persons, so that the local committee shall not indulge in improper prosecutions&#x2014;as conceivably they might, although they are not likely to&#x2014;that might be met by the Lord Advocate taking the place of the Central Price Committee to judge of the propriety, from the point of view of equity and justice, of the proceedings. Another reason for the recourse to the Central Committee is to obtain uniformity, as far as may be, of policy in this matter, and so that the Central Committee shall be


kept acquainted with the way the Act is being administered in different parts of the country. If you cut out the Central Price Committee you lose that very great advantage. Therefore, I think it desirable that the Central Price Committee should remain.<br/>
As for the recourse to the Board of Trade, it is part of the procedure that in cases of this character the Lord Advocate should consult with the Department before he takes any steps. It is very desirable that that should be so. Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman has omitted to note that there is a short circuit of procedure in the Act at present. When the local price committee does not initiate proceedings, but somebody reports to the Lord Advocate, the Lord Advocate himself takes proceedings. I agree that there have been some cases of considerable delay, but my information is that that delay has not generally been so much in the intermediate stages as in the initial stages, where very careful investigation is necessary. I do not think it desirable to alter the present system merely in order to avoid the possibility of delay in the intermediate stages. There will be inevitable delay in the initial stages, and a little delay in the collection of evidence by the Lord Advocate, though not much; Otherwise there will be very little delay at all, and for these reasons I do not think that the Government can accept the Amendment.</p>

This is an Amendment to delete from the Third Schedule to the Bill a number of items which, not necessarily in the form

in which they stand, but in some form or other, must properly be embodied in a system which seeks to assess differentiations of cost. I do not move the Amendment with the desire of eliminating them altogether, but frankly, I put it forward in order to elicit from my hon. and gallant Friend some indication of the principles that the Board of Trade will seek to pursue in amending the Schedule, as amend it they must. I would like to express my gratitude to my hon. and gallant Friend, and to my right hon. Friend the President of the Board of Trade, for the accommodating way in which they have met the Amendments which my hon. Friends and I have put forward. We have secured two Amendments and extracted two very valuable assurances. I hope that that spirit of accommodation will follow in the expression of the views in the minds of my hon. and gallant Friend, and my right hon. Friend as to the method they are going to pursue with regard to this Schedule.<br/>
The first item I wish to insert deals with the question of the cost of the provision of materials and stock. The two points which arise under that are the cost of the concentration of production and the purchase of quotas which have already been mentioned. I ask my hon. and gallant Friend to say something about it, particularly with regard to quotas. I anticipate that the purchase of quotas is not a matter which they encourage, but, be that as it may, there is, under the Limitation of Supplies Order, a great deal going on with regard to dealing with quotas. As I read the first item in this Schedule, the cost of the purchase of the quota can properly be brought in under the item of the cost of the provision of stocks and goods. I would like to hear the ideas of my hon. and gallant Friend with regard to putting that matter right.<br/>
The second item I would seek to eliminate is that which deals with liability for duties of Customs and Excise, rates, and interest on money borrowed. I will not open the matter now, but I confess that I find it difficult to see how, on any showing whatever, a bare item of interest on money borrowed can properly be brought in as a costing item on the production of a particular article. It may perhaps be that, if the


borrowing is directly and specifically applicable to the turnover of the article, it could be justified. That I do not know, but, as a general item, it cannot be justified, and I would like some explanation with regard to the future policy on that matter.<br/>
The third item of exclusion is that which deals with advertising. What is to be the policy of the Board of Trade with regard to Press advertising? Press advertising was mentioned on the Second Reading, and it can be extended to every kind of advertising. We live to-day in a world which is the sellers' paradise. If you have anything to sell, you can sell it, and I do not think that one-quarter of the advertising that goes on to-day can possibly be justified as an item of cost upon the article. What is the policy going to be? Finally, in the matter of the spreading of overhead expenses, I agree with the hon. Member for Balham and Tooting (Mr. Doland) that, if you take an instance of 100 overcoats and one overcoat, it is going a bit too far, but I think he will agree that it is not going too far to say that there are plenty of cases where turnover has fallen from 100 to 30 or 20, and that that gives one-fifth of the turnover on which to spread the overheads. What is to be the policy of the Board of Trade with regard to that? From the indications that we have had in the course of the Second Reading Debate and on this Committee stage to-day, I gather that at any rate it is not the intention to apply that arithmetically, and they ought not to do so. If they are not going to apply it arithmetically, as is at present justified under this Schedule, it is right that the public and traders should know the principle which is to be applied. I was unable to extract an answer from my right lion, and learned Friend the Lord Advocate, but I hope that by moving the rejection of these four items in the Schedule, I shall be able to extract an answer from my hon. and gallant Friend.</p>

<p>I am afraid that my hon. Friend is going to be unlucky if he expects to have any specific indication of the general principles which we propose to adopt. Clearly we cannot accept the Amendment, and I gather that he did not really expect the Amendment to be accepted. If we were now in a position

to set out our proposals in detail, they would have been included in the Bill, and that would have avoided the necessity for taking powers under this Clause to amend the First Schedule to the Act. There are changing circumstances every week and every month, there are different viewpoints on the various subjects and we have to arm ourselves with the power to alter the items in the First Schedule. The hon. Member raised certain specific points. I understand that it is most unlikely that the purchase of a quota would betaken into consideration in allowing the trader to increase his price. The hon. Member said that he could conceive of no case in which the interest on borrowed money could affect prices. I could imagine a good many cases. If a man borrowed money to build his shop, would it not be reasonable that the interest on that money should be considered as a general expense in the running of the shop and therefore reflected to a greater or less degree in the price of every article he sold in the shop?</p>

<p>These are items which have to be taken into consideration in the general fixing of the cost. It is true that the borrowings may be private ones, but this does temporarily come into the matter of costs. That must go without saying. With reference to the hon. Gentleman's point about the expense of advertising, quite clearly advertising is necessary in many industries. It may be argued equally well that at a time like this there may be some abuse of advertising and that people may prefer to spend a few thousand pounds, or scores of thousands of pounds, in advertising rather than hand it over to my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer in Excess Profits Tax. I think that, human nature being what it is, it is impossible to rule out that consideration completely. On the other hand, the hon. Member would not say for one moment that advertising costs could not be a proper charge in this regard in any particular industry. Again, the matter of overheads is a very vexed question indeed, but if the hon. Gentleman wants a general ruling I think the only general


rule one can give is that the Board of Trade will approach this matter with an endeavour to secure equity through reason. I hope that will satisfy him.</p>

<p>I wish to detain the House for a few minutes to say that as far as retailers are concerned, we have heard of a number of extreme and exaggerated cases of profiteering but I think the height of extravagant statement was reached when the hon. Member for Carmarthen (Mr. M. Hughes) said to-day that there is a "sellers' paradise." Whether he referred to retailers or not I am not sure, but I can assure him that that is far from the case to-day. The President of the Board of Trade spoke of the excellent results of the work of the Central Price Regulation Committee and I agree that they have done splendid work. But I must point out that they had before them for their guidance the standard of prices for goods. If I remember correctly, the standard was pre-war prices, with certain specified additions that were necessary owing to the increase of overhead charges. They have no such standard in this Bill, as I understand it, and I would like to emphasise the urgent necessity, in view of that fact, for very close collaboration with the actual trade organisations and the Central Price Regulation Committee prior to these maximum prices being placed on the Statute Book. While all honest traders welcome this Bill, if it safeguards consumers against the flagrant cases of profiteering, to which the President of the Board of Trade referred on the Second Reading, they hope they will receive equitable treatment whereby they will be enabled to make a living when once the maximum prices are established for specified goods. I thank the President of the Board of Trade and the Parliamentary Secretary for the assurances which have been given to this effect, and I am certain that traders will be very grateful.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."<br/>
This is a very simple Measure which I am sure will be accepted in all parts of the House. It is merely a Bill to enable trustees to insure goods or growing timber against war damage. It may seem odd, but none the less it is the fact, that there is some doubt at the present time whether or not trustees have that power. It is obviously desirable that that doubt should be removed and that trustees should be able to act in the same way as any prudent man would act in regard to his own property and insure, if they think it is a proper case for insurance. It is not compelling them to do anything, but it removes the doubt which has been expressed as to whether they have the right.<br/>
In one small matter we are supplementing the existing law. Members will see that this is a Bill "to remove doubts and supplement the power of trustees" and we have supplemented their power in this very simple way. If trustees have a pool of money in their hands which is derived from the sale of land, this Bill merely provides that they can, if they are so minded, devote money out of that pool to pay the premiums on capital outgoings under the War Damage Act. In that very small way we are supplementing the existing law and I cannot conceive of any objection from any quarter of the House. We are proposing to ask the House to put the Bill through all its stages to-day for the reason that the time in which insurance may be made expired on 15th June, but the Board of Trade has said that they will extend the time for a short period. It is, therefore, desirable to get these powers at once so that trustees who are prompt to take advantage of this removal of doubt under the existing law will have the advantage of the War Damage scheme.</p>

<p>The Solicitor-General has said that this is a small and simple Bill, but, in spite of our friendship, one is naturally doubtful of the right hon. and learned Gentleman when he appears here as a lawyer. I think he said that this Bill enables trustees


to insure growing timber, but there is nothing in the Measure to indicate that this is so, unless it is a case of legislation by reference.

<p>My hon. Friend will, see that Clause 1, Sub-section (1, <i>a</i>) of the Bill deals with
<q>any insurance which the Board of Trade are authorised to undertake under either of the schemes operated under Part II of the War Damage Act, 1941 &#x2026;</q>
The two schemes in Part 2 of the War Damage Act are the Business Scheme, which is compulsory, and the Private Chattels Scheme, which is optional. Trustees need not be authorised to go into the Business Scheme, because they are compelled to do so, and it follows that, being compelled to do a thing, they have a right to do it; but there is one exception, because all growing timber is treated, under Section 62 of the War Damage Act, as part of the Business Scheme, although it Is a voluntary matter. In that one respect the Business Scheme is voluntary, but in all other respects it is compulsory. What we have to do really is to extend the power of trustees in relation to the voluntary scheme. The insurance of growing timber is the only voluntary part of the Business Scheme; it is unnecessary to give trustees power to do that which they are bound to do, and, therefore, it is only necessary to give them power to go into the Business Scheme in regard to this particular matter.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."<br/>
In spite of the somewhat formidable title which this Bill bears, it makes no change in the system of discipline in the Royal Navy, but, as I will show, merely amends the method of administering inquiries into disciplinary offences, to the advantage not only of the Service as a whole, but of the officers charged with offences against the disciplinary code. Hon. Members will be aware that the ordinary method of adjudicating upon such offences is by means of courts-martial, but during the last war a Naval Discipline (Amendment) Act (No. 2) was passed, in 1915, under which the system of disciplinary courts was set up. This amending Act inserted into the Naval Discipline Act, 1866, a new Section, 57a, which gave powers during time of war for the convening of disciplinary courts for the trial of offences of a minor character by officers. The object of that innovation was simply one of convenience. There is no difference whatever between a court-martial and a disciplinary court in so far as procedure is concerned. The difference lies exclusively in the constitution and powers of the court.<br/>
Quite rightly, the setting up of a court-martial has always been, and I hope always will be, a somewhat formal affair. The president of a court-martial under Statute has to be an officer of at least the rank of a captain of the Royal Navy. The selection of officers to serve on a court-martial automatically consists of those officers immediately junior to the


president of the court who are present on that particular station. The court has to consist of a minimum of five officers and a maximum of nine. It has to be held on board ship, except in certain exceptional conditions, and at least two of His Majesty's ships must be present in the place where the court is held. The House will readily see that, in present conditions, that may occasion considerable difficulty and considerable inconvenience. On the other hand, the president of a disciplinary court may be an officer of the rank of commander. The court consists of from three to five officers in number. The other members do not have to be automatically selected from the officers immediately junior in rank to the president. As in the case of a court-martial, they must all be executive officers, but they may be drawn from the Royal Navy, the Royal Naval Reserve, or the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, and this court may sit in any place where it is directed. Therefore, it will be seen that it is a very much more simple matter to set up a disciplinary court than it is to set up a court-martial, and in these days, when the Fleet is distributed over a large number of stations, stations where there may be only a very few of His Majesty's ships present, and where instant readiness for action is becoming increasingly necessary, it would be a great convenience to the Service to be able to deal with the offences with which it is proposed disciplinary courts shall have power to deal, by a less formal method than that occasioned by the setting up of a court-martial.<br/>
Under the amending Act of 1915, it was laid down that a disciplinary court could deal only with certain offences. These offences are enumerated in Sections 17 to 43 of the Naval Discipline Act. They include such offences as disobedience, using violent language to a superior officer, quarrelling, desertion, improperly leaving one's ship or place of duty, absence without leave, drunkenness, swearing and acts prejudicial to naval discipline. For these ofiences the disciplinary courts can award sentences ranging to dismissal from the Service, but such courts cannot pass a sentence of death, penal servitude, dismissal with disgrace, or imprisonment with detention. The change, which it is proposed to introduce as a result of this Bill, is to include

among the offences, which under the present law can be dealt with by a disciplinary court, those offences which fall within Section 9 of the Naval Discipline Act. If hon. Members have a copy of the Act by them, they will see that Section 9 reads as follows:
<q>Every person subject to this Act who shall desert his post or sleep upon his watch or negligently perform his duties shall be dismissed from His Majesty's Service with disgrace &#x2026;</q>
The trial of these particular offences, which to-day cannot be tried by a disciplinary court, we wish to include among the powers of that type of court. The reason for the proposed change is that there have been certain cases during the present war in which small craft, in charge of a junior officer, have been either hazarded, or in some cases lost, through the negligence of their commanding officers. To convene a court-martial as we have to do now in order to deal with these offences, occasions considerable delay which is of advantage neither to the Navy as a whole, nor to the officer who is charged with the offence. Therefore, the opinion is widely held in the Service that this is a departure which should be made forthwith. The question of whether such an offence, or such an officer charged with that offence, should be tried by a court-martial, or by a disciplinary court, would be a matter for the discretion of the commander-in-chief or of the flag officer closely concerned. I think it is obvious that a senior officer of that kind, if he felt that the case was one of a sufficiently serious nature, would at once order that a court-martial should be convened rather than a disciplinary court<br/>
Hon. Members may ask whether the same procedure will apply to cases in which ratings are concerned. This amending Pill will not concern the trial of ratings, because other provisions already exist under Section 56 of the Act to deal summarily with offences by naval ratings, through the powers exercised by the captain of a ship. Here again, if the offence were of a sufficiently serious nature, the officer would see that the offender had the advantage of a trial. As was the case under the Act in 1915, disciplinary courts can be held or set up only in times of war, and, of course, the same applies to the extension of the powers which we are seeking in this Bill. I think I have covered all the ground


which is relevant to this very short amending Bill, but if hon. Members wish to ask any questions I shall be only too happy to reply to them.</p>

<p>There is very little about which one wishes to ask arising out of this Measure. In fact, the only question which occurred to me has already been answered by the Parliamentary Secretary when he said that ratings were excluded from the provisions of the Bill. The Parliamentary Secretary referred to "present conditions," "these days" and so on. I take it that means that this is a war-time Measure which will cease to exist, as and when we return to normal conditions.</p>

<p>Actually the Bill simply seeks to transfer categories of offences now tried by courts-martial to these disciplinary courts. That seems to me to be somewhat invalidated when the Parliamentary Secretary says that it is left with the commanding officer to determine whether or not there shall be a court-martial. I understand that the disciplinary courts can be composed of officers of the Volunteer Reserve, that is to say those who are not regularly attached to the Navy. Does that mean they will have authority to bring to trial commissioned officers who are employed permanently in the Navy? I think it would be worth while if we had an answer on that point.</p>

<p>I think the answer to the last question is that that would be so. I purposely said that whether or not a particular offence should be dealt with by a disciplinary court would be left to the discretion, either of the flag officer in charge, or the commander-in-chief of the command in which the offence took place. I have no doubt whatever, although the offence may, technically, have been a comparatively minor one, that if it seemed to be serious to a responsible officer of that rank he would certainly see that the officer concerned would have the advantage of having his case tried by a court-martial. It has happened that small craft have been lost as a result.

not of any tremendous crime, but perhaps through inexperience and some minor negligence. In this case, it has been thought unnecessary to go through the elaborate procedure of a court-martial, and by this method we shall be able to deal with a case like that expeditiously and with justice both to the service and the individual concerned.</p>

<p>I rise only for the purpose of asking whether this Measure can be regarded as of extreme urgency, because if not, it seems to me undesirable to depart from the usual Parliamentary practice of allowing an interval between the Second Reading and Committee stage which gives hon.

<p>I should like to ask the Solicitor-General one or two questions. There is a certain type of justice who, while he enjoys occupying a position of dignity, does not attend regularly to his duties. There are cases in which they do not attend at all. I should like to know whether it is intended to deal with such cases under this Measure or whether it is intended to deal with them more drastically, as I think they ought to be dealt with, by removing those justices from the list of magistrates. It is difficult to see how they would come within the definition of the words in Clause 1,
<q>by reason of his age or infirmity or other like cause.</q>
I do not know that the negligence of a person who cannot be said to be old, really is "a like cause." I do not know whether this is a matter with which the Lord Chancellor is going to deal in the same way as Lord Hailsham did and whether, after due notice, these magistrates will be informed that they cannot continue to occupy the position of dignity, unless they do their work and that they will be removed from the roll of magistrates. I am referring to cases where a man is on the spot and is perfectly well and "there is nothing to prevent him performing his duty. I should also like an explanation of the words in Subsection (4):
<q>more conveniently designated in some manner other than the entry of their names in the supplemental list.</q>
Does that mean by starring their names or something of that kind?</p>

<p>I understand that the Bill, in effect, recalls from the shelf justices who have been relegated there, even under the order of Lord Hailsham, by reason of age or infirmity, or even for not attending to their duties,

as far as going to court is concerned, and that they are now being called in to perform such minor offices as signing forms, witnessing signatures, taking affidavits and that sort of thing. I imagine that that is really the purpose and intention of the Bill. Also I think there is some difficulty in removing people wholly from the bench. They are allowed to keep their title even after they have ceased to function in the ordinary way. Further, there are differences of procedure in various parts of the country as to the functions that a justice of the peace may be called upon to perform. The duties are not so onerous in London as in the Provinces. A justice does not do much of the ordinary magisterial work, except in petty courts, dealing with such things as rate summonses, education summonses and so forth. The rest of his duties are mainly confined to the licensing bench or to the witnessing of attestation forms. I imagine that this is really a call-back to these minor services, of those justices who may, for the time being, have been set apart because for various reasons they were unfit to perform the full duties appertaining to the office.</p>

<p>A point I wish to bring forward arises under Subsection (3) of Clause 1, by which the Lord Chancellor will have power to remove from the list of acting magistrates those who by reason of age or infirmity or other like cause do not do their duty. There is no ambiguity about age or infirmity, but the words "other like cause" are a little ambiguous. There are many magistrates whose names, we think, should be removed who do not attend for any reason, but there are also other magistrates who would like to attend but who are very busy people and cannot always find time to do so. Therefore, one hopes that a certain amount of discretion will be exercised by the Lord Chancellor and that he will inquire as to the reason for non-attendance. I hope we shall have an assurance from the Solicitor-General that such inquiry will be made before a man is removed from the acting list.</p>

<p>I should like to support what has been said by my hon. Friend opposite. As a solicitor of more years standing than I like to remember I must say that I have known justices of the peace who for 10, 15 or more years have never taken any active part in the duties of a magistrate. They have simply had the designation of justice of the peace. In one case in my own constituency a justice of the peace lives immediately opposite to the police court, but not for 20 years have I seen him in court, nor have I seen his signature upon a summons. As to the point about the ambiguity of the phrasing of Sub-section (3) of Clause 1, perhaps the learned Solicitor-General may be able to give some explanation on the point and, if it is not satisfactory, say whether an Amendment later would be accepted.</p>

<p>I have been asked various questions, and I will do my best to reply to them in the order in which they were asked. First, I was asked by the hon. Member for East Wolverhampton (Mr. Mander) and by other hon. Members to say something about the case of the man who habitually and for no adequate reason neglects his duties and does not attend to them at all. That case does not come within the purview of this Bill. The hon. Member for East Wolverhampton said, and I think said rightly, that you could not say that that class of person is removable by reason of age or infirmity or other like cause. Therefore, he does not come within this Bill, and I confess that I think his case needs a different and more drastic method of treatment. My noble Friend authorises me to say that the course he proposes to take, following precedent, is in proper cases to ask the magistrate to resign from the commission. In that way we shall succeed in ridding the list of what is a mere name and nothing else. If in such a case a magistrate who had been asked to resign refused to do so and neglected to answer the request, then my Noble Friend would have no hesitation in exercising the power which he has to remove the magistrate from the commission altogether.</p>

<p>Would that be removal from the acting list to the non-acting list?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1941-06-26a.1177.3" hansard_membership_id="7096" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/16721" speakername="The Solicitor-General" colnum="1177" time="">
<p>No, that would mean removal from the list altogether.

The only way in which a man can be moved from the one list to the other and yet for him still to remain a magistrate is by way of the powers under this Bill which relate to age, infirmity or other like causes. We wanted to make the phrase wide enough and so the words "other like cause" were introduced with the idea of covering all the cases we want to cover.<br/>
Then an hon. Member asked me the meaning of the words in Subsection (4) about names being "conveniently designated." What has happened in London is really the reason for the action we have taken. A plan was devised, for London which avoided what was thought to be the indignity of a separate list. The names of the magistrates are all on one list, but the names of the acting magistrates have appended to them the name of the division for which they sit. If a magistrate's name on the list has no division appended to it, it means to say that he is not an acting magistrate but is on the supplemental list. London was anxious to retain that procedure, and so long as we get what is in substance and fact the two lists it does not matter in which way it is done, provided there is no ambiguity.<br/>
The hon. Member for North Camber-well (Mr. Ammon) rightly appreciated the scope and object of this Bill. While the Lord Chancellor has, of course, absolute power to remove a man altogether from the commission, and in proper cases would not hesitate to do so, it is very hard to apply that drastic treatment to a man who has for many years rendered yeoman service and now suffers merely from advancing age, or deafness, or something of that sort, which perhaps he himself does not realise. In such a case, if the magistrate is not willing to go on to the supplemental list the Lord Chancellor can put him on. He retains the dignity and status of a justice of the peace and is not put into the category of those who have done something disgraceful, but at the same time he does not have the right to sit in judgment on his fellow citizens.<br/>
The hon. Member for the Ecclesall Division of Sheffield (Sir G. Ellis) asked about the appeals committees. Appeals from the summary courts to Quarter Sessions are now more generally heard by appeals committees, and he asked me whether they are covered. I think they


are, and I am advised that they are, but I would call his attention to the definition in Sub-section (5) where he will see that the expression "court of quarter sessions" includes any committee by which the powers and duties of such a court are exercised by virtue of any Act. I think that to the best of my ability I have now answered the various questions which have been raised.</p>
