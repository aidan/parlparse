<p>My right hon. Friend approved 27 extra police posts for Leicestershire constabulary this year, bringing to 54 the new posts approved under this Government. In addition, 130 police officers have been returned to operational duties as a result of civilianisation and other efficiency measures.<br/>
My right hon. Friend is able to approve a further 1,100 police posts covering provincial forces and the Metropolitan police for 1990&#x2013;91. He will consider the Leicestershire police authority's application for a further 75 police posts in that year with advice from Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary along with applications received from other authorities. My right hon. Friend hopes to announce his decisions as soon as possible and before the end of the year.</p>

<p>I congratulate the Minister on his new appointment and I hope that he will start well by answering yes to my questions. Is he aware of the appallingly high level of crime in the city of Leicester, where violent crime has more than doubled since his party came to power? Is he aware that his predecessor saw fit to make no allocation whatever of additional police officers to Leicestershire in 1988, despite the chief constable's call for more, and last year granted only one third of those requested? Will the Minister now answer yes to my request for a firm assurance that he will listen properly to our chief constable and help us to keep crime off the streets by getting more police on them?</p>

<p>We always listen properly to Leicestershire's chief constable. I am sorry that the hon. and learned Gentleman, to whom I am grateful for his welcome, is so dismissive of the successes of the Leicestershire police. The crime rate in the county is well below the national average and the clear-up rate well above it. Last year total crime in the county fell, falling by 9&#x00B7;3 per cent. for sex offences and by 5&#x00B7;7 per cent. for burglaries. The force has an extra 130 officers because the chief constable also listened to the suggestions of the Home Office and found that he could replace 130 officers and free them to go back on the beat by recruiting civilian staff. The hon. and learned Gentleman is heavy on hyperbole but short on the salient facts.</p>

<p>I, too, warmly welcome my hon. Friend to his new position and wish him well in it. Is he aware that my rural constituents are pleased at the increasing emphasis being placed on rural policing by Chief Constable Hurst and Superintendent John Mousley who has just retired? That is a welcome development, but it will require still more resources. I hope that my hon. Friend will bear that in mind when he considers a new allocation of police.</p>

<p>I join the demand by my two hon. Friends for additional police officers for the Leicestershire constabulary. The Minister should be aware that this week hon. Members representing Leicestershire constituencies received a report by the lesbian and gay organisations in Leicester showing that police officers were being regularly deployed inside public lavatories. Does the Minister agree that a better use of police officers in a constabulary that is under strength would be on the streets catching criminals rather than acting as agents provacateurs in public lavatories harassing people going about their lawful business?</p>

<p>I welcome my hon. Friend's excellent new campaign announced yesterday on practical ways to crack crime. It is essential to reduce violent crime.

<p>I thank my hon. Friend for his kind remarks. Much can be done to prevent crime. Many efforts have been concentrated thus far on the prevention of property-related crimes, domestic burglaries and related acts. We can helpfully use some of the techniques being developed in neighbourhood watch areas to try to begin to deal with the difficult task of preventing violent crime and sexual attacks on women.</p>

<p>Would it not be best if the Government totally supported the police in having far more foot patrols in areas where there is a high level of crime? My mother-in-law, who is 84 years of age, recently had her home broken into. Luckily, she did not wake up; we do not know what would have happened to the old lady if she had woken up when those people broke in. She is a supporter of crime watch in that area. Is it not time that the Government recognised that the real answer is far more foot patrols by police doing what they used to do in the old

days and looking after our people? At present the Government engage in all sorts of propaganda but little real action.</p>

<p>The answer to the hon. Gentleman's question is that we have far more police. The hon. Gentleman is right when he says that we all want to see far more police on foot patrol. At the same time, modern policing with its speed of communications demands that there be people able to deploy others in the event of attacks on people or property. I was extremely sorry to hear of the unfortunate event affecting the hon. Gentleman's mother-in-law. On the next of my regular visits to Liverpool perhaps he will arrange for me to call on her to discuss these matters at first hand.</p>

<p>I thank my hon. Friend for her welcome of our crime prevention publicity campaign. The giving of advice to women or men on how to conduct themselves is sensitive and I dare say that every bit of advice will not suit every person.

<p>I hope that the hon. Gentleman is not confusing the giving of useful public information with glitzy advertising campaigns.

The hon. Gentleman is right to say that at the same time we need to mobilise local authorities, which have an important role to play in crime prevention. That is why we have already consulted the Association of Metropolitan Authorities, the Association of County Councils and the Association of District Councils in preparing a new crime prevention circular, which I hope will be widely welcomed. I hope that the hon. Gentleman does not think that crime prevention is a matter for party politics.</p>

I last met the chief constable of the West Midlands on 5 September, when we discussed a number of policing matters.<br/>
The assistant chief constable of West Yorkshire, Mr. Donald Shaw, was appointed on 14 August to carry out an investigation into the work and practices of the West Midlands serious crime squad, under the supervision of the Police Complaints Authority. His inquiries will concentrate on the period since the beginning of 1986, when complaints about the squad started to emerge. As I said in answer to a question by the hon. Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin) when making my statement last Thursday at column 283, if anything arises from the investigation which causes doubt about the safety of any conviction I would have to consider whether intervention on my part would be justified.</p>

<p>The Home Secretary has said that the inquiry will cover two years. Is not the stark truth that the rot in the West Midlands serious crime squad goes back as far as the inquiry into the Birmingham pub bombings? I ask the right hon. Gentleman to face that fact sooner rather than later. Eventually he or one of his successors will have to do that in the same manner as it was done over the Guildford


Four. I ask him for the sake of police morale, humanity and the good name of British justice to order an urgent and thorough inquiry into all the circumstances surrounding the arrest, conviction and incarceration of six men for the Birmingham pub bombings, whom many of us on both sides of the House believe to be wholly innocent of the charges laid against them.</p>

<p>Mr. Shaw's investigation will concentrate on the cases that gave rise to it. I say for the third time that if the investigation reveals a line of inquiry that leads further into the past I would expect the police to follow it up. The point that the hon. Member for Motherwell, South (Dr. Reid) has omitted is that I did act in the same way in the two cases although at a year's distance. In January 1987, I referred the Birmingham case to the Court of Appeal. There then followed a rigorous police investigation by the Devon and Cornwall police which was comparable with the one that the Avon and Somerset police undertook for the Guildford case. After that investigation, the Court of Appeal spent a month hearing the case again. That hearing took place at the end of 1987. The Court of Appeal came to the conclusion, on the information available to it and after the police inquiry, that the convictions were sound.</p>

<p>Will the Home Secretary not reconsider what he has just told the House? Did he not read the report in <i>The Guardian</i> yesterday that one of the officers concerned saw that the Birmingham Six were beaten up?

<p>I understand that one member of the serious crime squad, which was disbanded in the summer, was involved in the investigation into the Birmingham pub bombing. That is to say, his period of service in the serious crime squad spanned those years.<br/>
The chief constable of the West Midlands set up the investigation by Mr. Shaw because of complaints and doubts about a certain number of recent cases. As the hon. Lady knows, certain procedures and papers were criticised, were not in the right order or were missing altogether. That was the purpose of the inquiry, and it is on that that it is concentrating.<br/>
If that investigation were to lead back, by any means, to an earlier period or to the sorts of confessions to which the hon.

<p>Mr. Shaw's investigation was set in hand not by me but by the chief constable, Mr. Dear, of his own volition.

If the investigation, which was set up because of complaints about recent cases and so rightly and naturally will concentrate on those cases, gave rise to a train of thought or evidence that led to earlier cases, any convictions that arose from those cases would clearly have to be looked at. That is not the position at the moment and I have no reason to suppose that it will be.<br/>

<p>First, I shall deal with the environment. The meeting agreed a statement&#x2014;the Langkawi declaration&#x2014;setting out a Commonwealth programme of action to deal with the main environmental problems facing the world. Particular points to which I would draw attention are the commitment to take more account of environmental considerations in reaching economic decisions, the support expressed for existing international environmental organisations, especially the United Nations environment programme, the endorsement of the United Kingdom's initiative calling for the negotiation of an international framework convention on global climate change and the encouragement given to developing countries to improve the management of their rain forests, which is very important to arrest the increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.<br/>
Our particular concern in the debate on these issues was that any additional resources should not go to creating new bureaucracies, but directly to measures to protect and improve the environment. This concern is fully met in the Commonwealth's statement. The Langkawi declaration is a major achievement for the Commonwealth and particularly for our Malaysian chairman, Dr. Mahathir, on whose initiative it was drafted.<br/>
Secondly, I shall deal with southern Africa. Heads of Government issued a statement entitled "Southern Africa: The Way Ahead", which marks a significant step forward on a number of points from earlier Commonwealth statements. It recognises that important changes are under way in South Africa, that sanctions ought not to be punitive and that, if sufficient political progress is made in South Africa, the process of relaxing some of the international restrictions against South Africa should begin. This is the first time that the entire Commonwealth

has adopted this approach. I am grateful to my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary for the skilful manner in which he negotiated those improvements.<br/>
The Commonwealth statement also contains four main points with which the United Kingdom does not agree and our disagreement is explicitly stated on the face of the document, but without explaining either the view we take or the reasons for it. It was to fill that gap that my right hon. Friend and I decided to issue a separate statement setting out Britain's views on those points. A copy of the statement has been placed in the Library of the House.<br/>
We believe that the approach set out in our document is the more positive and constructive one and takes more account of the significant changes that are actually happening in South Africa, including the decision taken by the South African Government during the Commonwealth meeting that a major African National Congress rally may be held for the first time in 30 years, and addressed by Mr. Sisulu. In the light of this and other recent steps, our aim must surely be to reward progress and encourage South Africa further down the path of reform, rather than to respond with more punitive sanctions.<br/>
We made it clear in our statement that, instead of making a financial contribution to the proposed agency to report on South Africa's international financial links or to the continuing work of the Commonwealth Committee of Foreign Ministers on South Africa, we shall make available an equivalent amount of money for additional help to black South Africans. I would remind the House of the substantial sums that the United Kingdom is already making available for such help, as well as to the front-line states.<br/>
Our statement also announces our willingness to provide financial help to an independent Namibia as well as&#x2014;if asked&#x2014;military training for Namibia's armed forces after independence. We of course give similar help to Zimbabwe, Mozambique and many other Commonwealth countries in Africa.<br/>
Thirdly, Heads of Government had a discussion of the Commonwealth in the 1990s and beyond. They decided to set up a group of Heads of Government&#x2014;of which Britain will be part&#x2014;to identify the enlarged roles that the Commonwealth might need to play. We welcome that.<br/>
Fourthly, we discussed the problem of drugs, recognising the very serious threat that they posed in all our countries and the consequent need for training&#x2014;particularly for smaller states&#x2014;in customs procedures, law enforcement, in methods of detection, in education and in treatment of addicts. I expressed the hope that by the time of our next meeting in 1991 a large number of Commonwealth countries would have concluded bilateral agreements on freezing and confiscating the assets of drug smugglers. Britain has taken a lead both in the Commonwealth and more widely in concluding such agreements. We have now signed 10 of them, the last one of which was in Malaysia.<br/>
Fifthly, the meeting elected Chief Emeka Anyaoku as the new Secretary-General of the Commonwealth. He has lived in Britain for many years and is a great friend of our country. The whole House will wish him well<br/>
I would draw attention to four further points in the final communiqu&#x00E9;. The first, was a most welcome reference to the importance of Hong Kong's continued success, and a commitment to assist in any way possible in promoting


the continued prosperity of Hong Kong. That was a major British objective at the meeting and will, I believe, offer welcome reassurance to Hong Kong's people.<br/>
The second was the reaffirmation of the need for speedy action to deal with the problem of Vietnamese boat people in Hong Kong, including as a matter of priority the return to Vietnam of all those who do not qualify as genuine refugees.<br/>
The third was a recognition of the need to increase aviation security world wide, particularly important in the wake of the Lockerbie disaster&#x2014;<i>[interruption]</i></p>

The fourth was a call on all Commonwealth Governments to accede to or ratify international covenants on human rights, which a surprising number have regrettably not yet done.<br/>
Despite the difference of views on South Africa, this was a valuable and successful meeting and its success owes much to the very skilful chairmanship of Prime Minister Mahathir.<br/>
We have disagreed before on South Africa within the Commonwealth, indeed many times, but this has not damaged our relations with individual Commonwealth countries or the institution itself. The Government will persevere with their present policy on South Africa, because it offers the best prospect of peaceful negotiations and of achieving a new South Africa which will inherit a strong economy.</p>

<p>May I first associate myself fully with the Prime Minister's tribute to Sir Sonny Ramphal and offer my congratulations and good wishes to Chief Emeka Anyaoku on his election as secretary-general? May I also take this opportunity to welcome the whole of the constructive communiqu&#x00E9; from the Heads of Government meeting in Kuala Lumpur and regret that the Prime Minister could not do the same thing?<br/>
The Kuala Lumpur meeting exposed discrepancies in the British Government's approach. On the environment, for instance, is it not clear that the Prime Minister's professions of concern for the global environment have yet again been equalled only by her resistance to backing that concern with practical commitments? On overseas aid, the Prime Minister pledged in the Kuala Lumpur communiqu&#x00E9; to make
<q>renewed commitment and effort to meet the United Nations aid target</q>
of 0&#x00B7;7 per cent. of GNP. How does the Prime Minister reconcile that with the Government's record of cutting overseas aid to 0&#x00B7;3 per cent. of GNP during their time in office?<br/>
I turn now to the issue of sanctions against apartheid. In Kuala Lumpur, the Prime Minister put her signature to a Commonwealth agreement which her Foreign Secretary helped to compile and which she herself proposed for adoption, which states:
<q>this is not the time to consider any relaxation of existing sanctions and pressures &#x2026; all existing sanctions and measures should be maintained.</q>
How can the Prime Minister reconcile that with her action a short time later when she put out a statement, apparently

without reference to her Foreign Secretary, which was hostile to all sanctions and which stated that the effect of such sanctions would be to "increase resistance to change"? Is that not a gross inconsistency? Would it not be more honest if in future the Prime Minister were to sign all international agreements with invisible ink&#x2014;[HON.

<p>With regard first to the right hon. Gentleman's comments about the global environment, he is aware that this Government have done more to protect the environment than any previous Government; that we have committed the sum of &#x00A3;2 billion to get rid of sulphur dioxide in coal in power stations; that this year, for example, we are spending &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;3 billion on improved water and sewerage, whereas the Labour Government cut such expenditure; that we have the best record in Europe on rivers that flow into the North sea, and so on and so forth. We hosted the ozone layer conference. We are committed to reduce substantially the amount of CFCs and to move to a 100 per cent. reduction, provided that the relevant research has produced proper alternative substitutes. It was our proposal to have a global convention on CO<sub>2</sub> and the greenhouse effect&#x2014;a proposal which was taken up by other nations. On the environment, the Labour party cannot touch this Government's record&#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i>&#x2014;and nor can many other people.<br/>
On the right hon. Gentleman's totally inaccurate comments on our document on sanctions, I must advise him that my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary actually wrote part of that document, so for the right hon. Gentleman to say that my right hon. Friend did not even see it is to be just about as plum stupid as anyone can get. That document was in response to the four parts of the original document with which we disagreed on the face of the document. We thought it best to set out the reasons for our disagreement in writing, so that people could not quarrel with them.<br/>
As for the right hon. Gentleman's general proposals on sanctions, I remind him that the Labour party, when in power, said before the United Nations:
<q>We voted against comprehensive sanctions together with France, West Germany, the United States and some other Western countries because we do not agree that the far-reaching economic measures which the resolution calls for would produce the changes in South Africa which we would all like to see.</q>
That was said on 16 January 1978 by the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands), and the


right hon. Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook (Mr. Hattersley). The right hon. Gentleman also said, in the <i>Official Report </i>for 7 July 1976:
<q>I do not believe that a policy of general economic sanctions would be in the interests either of the British people or of South Africa."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 7 July 1976; Vol. 914, c. 1354.]</q>
Moreover, perhaps the right hon. Gentleman should read Archbishop Tutu on sanctions when it was proposed that they should be actively imposed on Panama:
<q>These sanctions have led to the destruction of the country's economy, caused immense suffering on the poorest of the poor, increased unemployment and aggravated social problems. The majority of Panamanians are opposed to sanctions. These sanctions inflict a double oppression on the people of Panama.</q>
Finally, two out of three black South Africans, when asked whether sanctions would cause unemployment and whether they wanted them, said no. It is this Government who are in step with the people of black South Africa, not the right hon. Gentleman.</p>

<p>Is my right hon. Friend aware that early editions of the British newspapers and the communiqu&#x00E9;s on the World Service of the BBC after the communiqu&#x00E9; was issued carried headlines that ran, "Thatcher tightens sanctions"? It was absolutely essential that she and our right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary should have put the matter right in their subsequent communiqu&#x00E9;.<br/>
Would it not also be of interest, given that the Leader of the Opposition protests strongly against the line that my right hon. Friend took&#x2014;with wide popular support in this country&#x2014;to see whether he is prepared to put the matter to the test in a debate in this House?</p>

<p>I am grateful to my right hon. Friend. I have not heard what the BBC said, but what he says gives extra support to the path that we took of making our views absolutely clear in writing. That was much better than giving unattributable briefings, as many other Heads of Government did. Some of them made speeches in public at the opening session of the Commonwealth conference clearly setting out their views. They are therefore not at liberty to criticise us for setting out ours. They must not deny to others the freedom of speech that they adopt for themselves.</p>

But have not Singapore, Canada and Australia all expanded their immigration programmes considerably to help Hong Kong, and is not the United States planning to quadruple theirs? When will the Government end their impotent silence and honour what they have signed in the agreement?<br/>
On South Africa, surely the Prime Minister must realise, whatever her intentions, that the effect of her inept unilateral statement was to give succour to those who would wish to prolong apartheid in South Africa, to undermine the effectiveness of the Commonwealth statement and to bring discredit on the name of Britain?<br/>
Finally, is it just a coincidence that, at every single international meeting that the Prime Minister attends, she ends up as a lonely, discredited, minor, single voice?</p>

<p>I thank the right hon. Gentleman for what he has said about Hong Kong. Singapore has

given about 25,000 certificates to people in Hong Kong. They are not to be taken up immediately but holders may have citizenship of Singapore and not go there for some years. I know that that has been a great comfort to many such people. Some people from Hong Kong have taken houses in Australia and Canada. I think that in the case of Canada people have left Hong Kong to take up residence in cities such as Vancouver. Some reassurance is needed for people in Hong Kong whose residence there is vital for the future prosperity of Hong Kong. They need to be given some assurance that they may leave if things should turn out very badly in order that they may stay there to help Hong Kong to keep its prosperous standing. We hope to bring proposals forward by about the turn of the year.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman is totally and utterly wrong about sanctions. We have made clear our abhorrence of apartheid and did so in the statement. We not only oppose sanctions but give practical help to black South Africans and to the front-line states. For example, we are supporting financially about 1,000 black South Africans on graduate or postgraduate work. We also support black South Africans who wish to purchase houses and special housing for black South Africans. We have given about &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;1 billion to the front-line states so that they may be better able to deal with their economic problems.<br/>
We note that some of those who are most ardent about sanctions do not impose them. I find utterly repugnant the fact that the only way the trade sanctions can work is by being punitive on black South Africans. I gave a specific example of a pineapple canning factory that closed a few days ago; because it no longer had the demand from Canada and the United States it was not able to keep going. That put 40 white South Africans out of work&#x2014;and 1,100 black South Africans. That will please the right hon. Gentleman, but it does not please me.</p>

<p>Since I understand that the other countries would not agree to include in the communiqu&#x00E9; an explanation of the British point of view on the four points on which the communiqu&#x00E9; said that we differed from the rest, was it not absolutely essential for us to find some means of putting on record our point of view?

<p>Yes, I agree with my right hon. Friend. It was absolutely vital for us to put it in writing for everyone to see. My right hon. Friend is also quite right when he says that it set out in detail views that we were not able to have put into the communiqu&#x00E9;. It starts off by saying:
<q>Britain is fully at one with the rest of the Commonwealth in utterly condemning apartheid and wishing to see its total eradication so that all the inhabitants of South Africa can live in dignity and play a full part in the political life of their country.</q>
When South Africa gets its constitution reformed and a new Government, that Government will inherit a strong economy. For that there will be one country in the Commonwealth that it can thank&#x2014;Britain.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman knows full well that it would be very difficult to blackmail this Government or me in particular, and all my colleagues. We are not likely to be blackmailed in any way. I should add that before the Commonwealth conference ended&#x2014;and it ended very amicably, as one would expect&#x2014;barely was the ink dry on the communiqu&#x00E9; than I received a letter from a Head of Government of an African country saying that if the financial sanctions that the rest of them had agreed actually worked, it would be very tough on his country and would make things much worse, and could he please have extra aid to deal with it. I said no. People must suffer the consequences of that which they put their hand to.</p>

<p>Does my right hon. Friend agree that, since we had made an explicit reserve about our attitude towards sanctions in the communiqu&#x00E9;, nothing could have been more normal than that we should either explain that reserve or continue to advocate the policies that seemed sensible to us? Therefore, will she dismiss the synthetic indignation on this subject as the cant that it is? My right hon. Friend enjoys the strongest support in this country for the robust line that she took in the face of the hypocritical pressure on sanctions. Will she tell some of her colleagues in the Commonwealth that if the Commonwealth desires to turn itself into an international tribunal of human rights, there are a great many better targets, from China to Peru and including one or two in the Commonwealth, which might better repay their attention?</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend. One of two things happens with economic sanctions. If they do not work, it is because other countries take up the trade. To some extent, that has already happened in South Africa. Our share of the trade in South Africa is less than it was, and Germany and Japan have taken up that trade. If they do work, they work by punishing the most vulnerable&#x2014;as Archbishop Tutu said about Panama&#x2014;and making them suffer poverty and even starvation in a country with no social security.<br/>
I find it repugnant that people at the Commonwealth conference should sit round a table, having been entertained in excellent hotels with excellent facilities, and decide who will suffer poverty and starvation in another country. We support Operation Hunger, which is aimed at relieving poverty in South Africa. It is absurd that other people in the Commonwealth are trying to magnify what we are trying to relieve.</p>

<p>In reiterating the statement on substantial aid to the front-line states, will the Prime Minister take into account that, since 1979, aid has decreased to only 83 per cent. of what it was when we left office, representing in 1985 prices a reduction of &#x00A3;20 million? Therefore, when does she intend to increase aid to the front-line states? Will she deal with a point raised by my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition? How is it that she can sign a communiqu&#x00E9; pledging herself to the GNP target of 0&#x00B7;7 per cent. of aid for the Third world when aid has, until last year, been steadily reducing under this Government?</p>

<p>Since 1980, we have spent the considerable sum of &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;1 billion on aid to the front-line states, in assisting them to create new transport routes so

that they do not have to go through South Africa. In addition, we are providing military training in Zimbabwe. When I went there recently, there was an unusual occasion when I went to the eastern highlands and, with President Mugabe on one side and President Chissano on the other, watched British military officers training the Zimbabwean army and the Mozambican army. That is considerable extra help.<br/>
Few countries have reached the target of 0&#x00B7;7 per cent. of aid. However, the amount of private investment from this country to other Commonwealth countries is considerable, and one of the highest. It would be higher still if some were to take off some of the central planning and control that prevents a good deal of investment from going to their countries.</p>

I suggest that when the agenda for the next Commonwealth conference is prepared, my right hon. Friend suggests to the new secretary-general that he places three documents before all the delegates.

Finally, may he lay before all the delegates the wonderful speech which was made by Burke in this place just over 200 years ago when he reminded the House that there was no way known to him in which one could "condemn an whole people"?</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who has made his own points extremely effectively. I am grateful to him for the confirmation that he gives that our approach of alleviating problems of black South Africans is one of practical help and not of posturing. I notice that many of the states in Africa that demand comprehensive sanctions do not apply them themselves. There are, for example, no airlines flying from the United States directly to South Africa, but they fly to the capitals in black Africa, from where the passengers are then promptly flown down to Johannesburg. That hardly seems to be doing what they are preaching.</p>

<p>Following the Prime Minister's unhappy exchanges with President Mugabe of Zimbabwe, when he called the right hon. Lady "despicable" and she called him "ritualistic", what was the point of her comment that he was only too happy to accept British aid? Was this not a patronising and insulting way of telling him that freedom of speech was the payment for any economic assistance from Britain?</p>

<p>Mr. Mugabe said some things about our attitude to apartheid which he knew were entirely untrue, and which were shown to be untrue on the face of the document which we ourselves issued, which stated that Britain is fully at one with the rest of the Commonwealth in utterly condemning apartheid. We have been very generous, and will continue to be, in

helping Zimbabwe&#x2014;I made that perfectly clear&#x2014;both with military training and with aid. I do wish sometimes that people would not use some of the language that they do, which tempts one to reply in the same coin. I did not, in fact.<br/>
At the same time I expressed to President Mugabe considerable sympathy with the difficulties that he is in over the ivory ban. There are far too many elephants in Zimbabwe, and they have to cull them, which they do very well. They finance that operation by selling the ivory from the elephants which are properly culled. President Mugabe does not lack support from me in the things which I agree he is doing extremely well.</p>

<p>Is it not the case that, when the draft agreement was presented to the Heads of Government, some Prime Ministers sought to make changes to it but the right hon. Lady insisted that it could not be changed because it was an agreed document, so the document was proposed in its entirety? Therefore, are not her protestations that she has been exercising free speech and clarification quite preposterous?<br/>
Is the right hon. Lady aware that her demeanour at the Dispatch Box today absolutely confirms that her intention in producing that statement an hour later was to repudiate the part that related to sanctions? That is quite clear. Is not the reason for all that the fact that she has a secret agenda with de Klerk, and that her part of that agenda is to prevent change taking place? She makes so much noise about people losing their jobs, but is she aware that people in South Africa are afraid of losing their lives&#x2014;or perhaps that is what she prefers?</p>

<p>The main parts of that document are agreed and were a compromise agreement. If anyone wished to change those parts of the document, we also would have wished to change them. We agreed to leave them precisely as they were. The four main parts of the document were disagreed, and it states, "with the exception of Britain" or "Britain disagrees". It is on those parts that we issued an especially clear statement.<br/>
Our view on apartheid is clear and our practical help for South Africa is clear, as is our hatred of economic sanctions. The hon. Gentleman is one of those who wish to impose punitive economic sanctions&#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i>Economic sanctions are punitive. That is the only way in which they can work. If the hon.

favour of that, he must be very glad that our way prevailed and that black South Africans will not suffer from punitive economic sanctions.</p>

<p>Yes. Some people were arguing that perhaps we needed to have a new role for the Commonwealth. I do not necessarily envisage a new role, but the Commonwealth exists on the basis of principles set down in the Singapore declaration in 1971, and those are the principles of freedom under a rule of law and democracy. The 48 and 49 of us co-operate closely on many matters, especially those mentioned by my hon. Friend such as scientific and technical co-operation and the advice upon education and other matters that we give. We also girdle the world and so have an instant way of seeking local views on any matter which may arise anywhere in the world.<br/>
One of the most impressive things about the Commonwealth conference is that it is the only big international conference that I attend which requires no translation or interpretation of any kind, making the debate active, without rancour and very clear. Such an organisation has a great future ahead.</p>

<p>South Africa exists. It has the strongest economy in Africa. Many people vote with their

feet and go to work in South Africa in order to get a better living there and they remit a good deal of their earnings to the front-line states. If the economy of South Africa were to collapse, the economies of the front-line states would quickly follow. It is important to keep that economy strong and not to cause more poverty. Britain relieves the people who are being fed under Operation Hunger at a cost of &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;3 million and tries to reduce the hardship there; other people seem to wish to increase it.</p>

<p>Further to the reply that the Leader of the House gave to my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson), will he be more specific about when a debate could be held on the innocence of the Guildford Four and the Guildford and Woolwich pub bombings, on the methods that the police used to obtain confessional evidence on which the convictions were made, why that information was not made available to defence lawyers or anybody else during the past 15 years, and the practice of the police investigating the police when malpractice appears?<br/>
We should also discuss the operation of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1974, bearing in mind that my constituent Paul Hill has just been released after serving 15 years for a crime that he did not commit and that he was the first person to be accused under that Act. Does the Leader of the House agree that a debate on these matters is urgent and important in view of the miscarriages of justice that have taken place?</p>

<p>I am not able to offer any conclusion about a proposal for a Government debate of that kind. It is clearly a matter that could he considered by the official Opposition as a topic for debate if they so wish. I shall draw the hon. Gentleman's point to the attention of the Home Secretary.</p>

<p>Will the Leader of the House press the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry to make a statement next week on the Department's response to the Silberston report on the multi-fibre arrangement? The Government do not seem to be sufficiently seized of the serious nature of this report, which affects the clothing and textile industry which employs almost 500,000 people. In Bradford that industry employs about 14,000 people in wool and textile mills. The phasing out of the multi-fibre arrangement, which has been suggested by Professor Silberston, would put their jobs in jeopardy. The report suggests the loss of about 33,000 jobs and it is causing a good deal of concern among workers who have been most helpful and co-operative for many years in the development of the industry. I hope that the Leader of the House will press the Department for a statement so that we can ask questions about it.</p>

<p>The hon. Member understands that Professor Silberston's report on the implications of the multi-fibre arrangement for the United Kingdom economy represents the professor's own view. That does not mean that it is not helpful to the Government and others when they are considering this issue. However, I cannot undertake to find Government time for consideration of the report before the House prorogues. I have little doubt that there will be a chance to consider it once we return.</p>

As the right hon. and learned Gentleman probably now knows, the Government have to have 100 people in the Chamber to close a debate. The Leader of the House had to come and pick up the pieces.<br/>

<p>Earlier this afternoon the Home Secretary was invited to apologise for the gross miscarriage of justice experienced by the Guildford Four.

My point of order is that the Guildford Four are in the process of submitting claims for compensation for the miscarriage of justice that they have suffered, and the view that was expressed this afternoon on their conviction may influence the amount of compensation awarded.</p>

<p>11. In this Order "allotted day", in relation to the Companies Bill <i>[Lords]</i> or the Children Bill <i>[Lords]</i> means any day on which that Bill is put down as first Government Order of the day, provided that a Motion for allotting time to the proceedings on the Bill to be taken on that day either has been agreed on a previous day, or is set down for consideration on that day.<br/>
The House does not need me to remind it that it is fundamental to the way in which the House operates that the elected Government are entitled, on reasonable terms, to look to the House for the passage of their business. That does not mean that we do not have a responsibility to listen to the points made by hon. Members of all parties. In the case of these two Bills, we have been listening with great


care, and that has been reflected in many amendments designed to improve and clarify the two measures. We also have a responsibility to respect the right of hon. Members of all parties, including, of course, the official Opposition, to debate and challenge the Government's legislation.<br/>
In the case of the Companies Bill and the Children Bill, it cannot be argued that the Opposition, or indeed the whole House, have not been given that chance. We have almost completed consideration of both measures and it would be most unwelcome to many outside the House if the Government were to allow the Bills to be put at risk at this late stage, when they have been successfully piloted to this stage with the agreement of the House at each stage.<br/>
At about this time last year, the House agreed to a somewhat similar approach by my predecessor, when a timetable was put on the last stages of the School Boards (Scotland) Bill and the Housing (Scotland) Bill to ensure that those important measures would be allowed to complete their passage. My motion today is in no sense unprecedented and it is even more justified in light of the way in which progress on these Bills has been delayed.</p>

<p>Will the Leader of the House tell us how many amendments there were to the Bills that he has just cited as precedents? Were there more than the 1,000 Government amendments on the Companies Bill or the 400 amendments on the Children Bill? Surely it is the weight of Government amendments that has caused the difficulties. The Government have not provided adequate time for scrutinising the many, often complicated, amendments to two complicated Bills.</p>

<p>That is not the substance of the matter. In the case of the Children Bill, the overwhelming majority of the amendments were tabled, as my hon. and learned Friend the Minister of State pointed out in the course of the debate earlier this week, in response to representations made by organisations outside the House and by the Opposition. During the period when the matter was proceeding normally, amendments were considered and disposed of by the hundred and dozens were dealt with each hour. That was no obstacle to progress and was a sensible way to handle matters in response to the wishes of the House. It is a matter of particular regret that we have been unable to make the good progress that was not merely expected but actually being achieved on the Children Bill.<br/>
The Children Bill is the most comprehensive and far-reaching reform of this branch of the law ever introduced. It meets a long-felt need for a comprehensive and integrated statutory framework to ensure the welfare of children. The establishment of a new statutory scheme to protect children in emergencies is particularly important and it was introduced in response to the Cleveland and other tragedies involving child abuse. Nobody doubts that and it has been made clear by Opposition speakers that, although there are disagreements on points of detail, the Bill commands wide support in the House. That was made apparent in Committee, when my hon. and learned Friend the Minister of State, a man who is not always given to high exhilaration, described his time in Committee as a "happy experience" and hon. Members will know that that cannot be said of all Committees. In 16 Committee sittings which considered 439 amendments, the Committee

divided only seven times. Many amendments made were designed to ensure that the Bill continued to command an overwhelming measure of cross-party support.<br/>
When the Bill returned to the Floor of the House on Monday, the House was content to consider 290 amendments in eight and a half hours with only one Division. In the first 23 minutes, we completed consideration of the first 53 clauses and in that time only two Opposition Members spoke. Until that point, proceedings on the Bill had been characterised by a mass of common sense.<br/>
The question is why it was then thought necessary to divide at the first opportunity on Tuesday night&#x2014;a Division in which 183 hon. Members voted in favour and none against. The House knows why that Division took place and the hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) was kind enough to put it on record for the House. The Division was obviously not related to opposition to the clause because the hon. Member for Monklands. West said:
<q>The Front Benches have endeavoured to co-operate to ensure that the Bill reaches the statute book."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 24 October 1989; Vol. 158, c. 806.]</q>
He went on to explain that other hon. Members representing mining areas felt it necessary to demonstrate because of their feelings that they had a grievance. It was not related to the Children Bill which, as he said, every hon. Member, including the Opposition Front Bench, supported.<br/>
The hon. Member for Monklands, West was kind enough to observe that I was a "reasonable man" and I am content to accept that description for the purposes of this presentation. However, I could not easily sustain that reputation if I were to tell the public and the organisations that have devoted thousands of hours to working for and improving this measure that the Bill was to be lost as a result of a grievance quite unrelated to this necessary and widely expected Bill.<br/>
We have already spent 12&#x00BD; hours this week on Report, as well as five and a half hours on Second Reading debate and 39 hours in Committee. It would be a tragedy for the Bill to be lost at this stage after so much hard work and, above all, after such a welcome measure of co-operation.</p>

<p>As an hon. Member who was here on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning and was, with other hon. Members, eagerly awaiting the passage of the Children Bill, which we widely support, may I ask the Leader of the House to explain why, at 1.30 am, it was the Minister of State who moved the adjournment of consideration of the Bill, which was then debated for half an hour? There was a Division at 1.55 am in which 110 Conservative Members voted to adjourn the business while 22 hon. Members&#x2014;all Labour&#x2014;voted against adjourning the business. We were perfectly happy, as we made clear several times, to stay here all night and through the next morning to ensure that the Bill was carried. The protests of the Leader of the House ring extremely hollow. This is the most cosmetic controversy that the House has known for a considerable time.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman is not quite so simple as he sounds. He knows the background to those events perfectly well. The whole House, in line with the agreements and understandings made through the usual channels, was expecting to proceed to a conclusion on the matter that night. The hon. Member for Monklands, West


was as startled and dismayed as every other hon. Member by what happened. It was wholly sensible, and made more sensible by the events the hon. Member for Bradford, West (Mr. Madden) has described, to move to next business at that stage so that we could get to the stage that we have now reached.<br/>
The Companies Bill, as the House knows, is aimed primarily at creating an up-to-date framework of company law within which enterprise can flourish and it also provides the necessary safeguards for investors and creditors. It contains provisions to implement European Community directives on consolidated accounts and the regulation of orders, both of which have to be implemented by the end of this calendar year, and it also includes certain reforms to ease the statutory requirements on companies. The Bill also contains a number of other less important but significant provisions.<br/>
In this case, some of the provisions are undeniably politically controversial, in contrast to those in the Children Bill. Others, as always with companies legislation, are technical. Even so, good steady progress was made in Committee, when about 600 amendments were considered over 15 sessions. Four hundred amendments were accepted by the Government, the level of debate was generally constructive and there was no evidence of what might be called obstructive tactics. In other words, the Bill was duly and carefully considered, sensible amendments were made and it came back to us for those changes to be confirmed. Sadly, last night we moved into a wholly different story.<br/>
Until 9 pm we had had three lively but well-contested debates on the areas of prime political controversy in the Bill. That was entirely as expected and reflected the interest of hon. Members on both sides in such matters as political donations. What followed was less edifying and, in some respects, rather strange. Only three of the remaining groups of amendments were considered during the next two hours simply because Divisions were forced by Opposition Members on each and every amendment as it came before the House.<br/>
That those Divisions were scarcely motivated by any consideration of the substance or merit of the amendments was demonstrated not just by the lack of any debate, but by the nature of some of those which attracted such unexplained opposition. That conduct was extremely strange, especially as two of the amendments, nos. 13 and 14, on which Opposition Members forced Divisions were tabled to fulfil pledges specifically given to the Opposition in Committee. I commend to the House the view that that underlies the conclusion that the Opposition Front Bench has now entirely lost control of its ability to co-operate in managing the business of the House. It is difficult to see more convincing evidence of that than that provided by the Divisions on those amendments.<br/>
In the face of those circumstances, the motion will allow more time for consideration of the remaining amendments than was in prospect under earlier arrangements that Opposition Members failed to deliver.</p>

<p>It is for the hon. Gentleman to explain that remarkable proposition. There will be ample time for further explanation to be forthcoming as the timetable motion has been carefully drafted to allow sufficient time for the Opposition to make their points&#x2014;even points as important as the difference between "part" and "section"&#x2014;provided that they do so with a normal degree of reason and restraint. There is the opportunity to spend additional time on the Companies Bill if we finish this debate in less than three hours.<br/>
I am sure that many hon. Members would agree that the time would be better spent on further consideration of the Bill than on debating the merits of this unarguably sensible and necessary measure. The amount of time available will increase for every minute that can be shaved off the debate on the motion. If the Opposition are truly interested in debating the Companies Bill, they will save their powder for later. I urge them to do so and I commend the motion to the House.</p>

<p>What a mess the Government are in.<br/>
The speech we have just heard is nothing more than a confession of failure and an acknowledgement that the Government have totally mismanaged their business. The Government have an overall majority of almost 100 and they have a majority of almost 150 over Labour. Now they are reduced, however, to having to introduce more guillotines in one Session than at any time in the history of parliamentary Government.<br/>
What a sad spectacle the Leader of the House presents today. When he took up his present job he told a BBC audience:
<q>I think the Government as a whole needs the support of somebody of my experience, particularly when we are facing a new round of problems on the home front".</q>
The right hon. and learned Gentleman was putting himself over as a sort of philosopher king in Hush Puppies. Later briefings to newspapers suggested that, relieved of the pressing demands of the Foreign Office, he would abandon his usual abrasive image and would be able to stand back from the day-to-day hurly-burly to take a strategic overview and to steer the SS Thatcher to calmer waters by his characteristic delicate touch on the tiller. What went wrong? What happened to the long view? What has happened to all that wisdom and experience? As soon as we have a few votes late at night and a few demoralised Tory Back Benchers refuse to stay up to do their duly, blind panic sets in.<br/>
Last night, as we awaited the chimes at midnight, the deputy Prime Minister shuffled into the Chamber&#x2014;or so I am told, as I was in the Tea Room at the time&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>I was contemplating the advice given in Hamlet:
<q>It has now struck 12; get thee to bed Francisco</q>
I thought that we would all be better off in bed apart from those enthusiastic people who wanted to discuss the Bill. The deputy Prime Minister, however, shuffled into the Chamber to announce that the Government would guillotine the Children Bill and the Companies Bill. Such was their panic that the Government business managers could not even find time to follow the convention of this


place by warning the Opposition that they intended to change the business. To be fair, the Leader of the House apologised for that in business questions today. I thank him, and accept his apology.<br/>
I am not sure what will happen now the Prime Minister has got home. If she complains that she has come back to a legislative shambles, I suggest that the right hon. and learned Gentleman should tell her not to pick on him as that shambles only imitates the shambles in Kuala Lumpur and the general shambles in Nos. 10 and 11 Downing street.<br/>
It is unfair to blame the new Leader of the House for much of this. He inherited this fine mess from his predecessor and from the Government Chief Whip, who appears to be absent at the moment. The Leader of the House must be rather daunted as he gradually discovers just how badly the Government business has been managed since the election. In case his colleagues have not entirely come clean, I shall spell out the facts.<br/>
The Government have an overall majority of almost 100. After the 1987 general election, the first Session of Parliament stretched from June 1987 until November 1988, a total of 218 sitting days&#x2014;the fourth longest this century. With that majority and all that time, the Government got through just 49 Government Bills. The average for the first Session of a Parliament is 70, and the record is 104. For the Government even to achieve that measly total of 49 meant that they had to guillotine six Bills&#x2014;one more than in any Session in this century.<br/>
The Government preach efficiency and improved output to everyone else, but, this year, their productivity has been even worse. This Session is likely to last for about 175 days, yet the number of Government Bills is likely to total just 37 and that will be the lowest number of Bills passed in an ordinary Session in an ordinary year since the second world war.&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] The shirkers on the Conservative Benches are cheering their own incapacity. To make things absolutely clear, those 37 Bills include four consolidation measures which usually go through on the nod. I say usually, as there is one in the House of Lords at the moment.</p>

<speech hansard_id="666777" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1989-10-26a.1079.0" hansard_membership_id="388" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/16360" speakername="Sir Geoffrey Howe" colnum="1079" time="17:02:00">
<p>The hon. Gentleman might like to swap a quotation from Hamlet with a quotation from Tacitus, who prudently said that his society, whereas it formerly suffered from crimes, had come to suffer from laws. That is why the Government believe in less law and not more.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="666778" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1989-10-26a.1079.1" hansard_membership_id="3408" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2650" speakername="Mr. Dobson" colnum="1079" time="17:02:00">
<p>I am sure that everyone will recognise that the Government is led by a sub-Tacitus. She believes that we do not have a society. We certainly have more crime, but, apparently, in response to that we shall have fewer laws.<br/>
The Leader of the House should get things sorted out because, until fairly recently, Mr. Bernard Ingham and people from the right hon. and learned Gentleman's predecessor's office were constantly briefing the press&#x2014;people who are not easily misled&#x2014;about the massive load of legislation that they were pushing through. That was done in an effort to convince Tory Members that they should turn up at night and vote occasionally.</p>

<p>Although the boasts of the Leader of the House about the reduction in the amount of legislation

passed reverberate through our deliberations with such dynamism, will my hon. Friend bear in mind that the number of statutory instruments which the Government are pouring out has increased year by year? This is the Government who threatened to take legislation off our backs. They are simply using the Chamber to hand over power to Ministers so that they can oppress us even more.</p>

<p>What my hon. Friend says is certainly true. He has had rather more experience of this than most hon. Members, because he chairs two Committees on Statutory Instruments. Indeed, my hon. Friend is, rightly, so concerned about this problem that he has been involved in organising an international conference so that hon. Members from this House can meet people from other legislatures to see what we can do about improving our scrutiny of statutory instruments. That should be a good development. I only hope that we learn a little from other members of the Commonwealth at the conference with which my hon. Friend is involved, even if we cannot learn in Kuala Lumpur.<br/>
The Government have already used a guillotine on six Bills. Even before today, they had repeated the record total. However, they now propose to guillotine two more Bills, setting a new record of eight guillotined Bills in one Session. The Prime Minister sometimes says, "Winston did this; Winston did that," so I have been checking what Winston did. In this one Session of Parliament, the Government will have used guillotines on more Bills than the Churchill and Eden Governments used in total, in the period of their combined Prime Ministerships. Turning to a slightly more up-to-date Tory Government, the Heath Government used a total of only five guillotines in four years.<br/>
So what about the guillotines that are proposed today? One applies to the Children Bill, which, as the Leader of the House pointed out, has all-party support for most but not all of its provisions. Probably the most important point that I can make about the Children Bill is that, on Tuesday night, after the Division to which the Leader of the House referred, we had a debate from just before 11 pm to 1.18 am on proposals covering the registration and regulation of day care facilities. As my hon. Friend the Member for Durham, North-West (Ms. Armstrong) said, that matter is central to the protection of children. That was a serious and well-argued debate in which hon. Members of all parties participated, at the end of which the Minister did not criticise what any hon. Member had said&#x2014;nor did he suggest that any hon. Member had wasted time.<br/>
There was then a vote, in which other Opposition parties, apart from the Labour party, joined Labour Members to try to put that important new clause on the statute book. The Government&#x2014;as they are entitled to do&#x2014;voted it down. However, as soon as the Division on that important matter was over&#x2014;at the end of that careful and well argued debate&#x2014;the Minister of State jumped up and said that he wanted the House to adjourn, and used the Government's majority to push through the adjournment. The Government adjourned their own business.</p>

<p>I served on the Standing Committee on the Children Bill and spoke at 2 o'clock this morning to pay tribute to the work of the Minster of State, Department of Health. I pointed out that


hon. Members of all parties wished to proceed with the Bill in a spirit of all-party agreement because it is very much a consensus Bill.<br/>
Early on Tuesday morning, my hon. Friend the Member for Middlesbrough (Mr. Bell) and I pressed the Minister to continue with the debate in that sitting. We said that we did not feel it appropriate that the sitting should be adjourned, and were happy to stay on to complete our consideration of the outstanding matters in the Bill, such as those relating to grandparents' rights and wardship. We did so because we felt that those issues were important and we wanted to retain the consensus felt about the Bill. We did not want our consideration of it to end in this squalid way.</p>

<p>I believe that the Minister of State intends to reply to this debate, so perhaps he will explain his activities. However, I should explain that adjourning our consideration then means that 232 new clauses and amendments remain to be dealt with. Since that point, the Government have not approached the Opposition to ask us to agree to any informal timetable so that we can get the remaining parts of this important Bill through the House. Instead, they have insisted on this guillotine motion which, at most, provides 180 minutes to debate those 232 new clauses and amendments. That works out at about 46 seconds for each provision. The Government's actions are treating the Children Bill with contempt. I am not suggesting that the Minister of State who has been pursuing the Bill through Committee is party to all this, because I suspect that he is embarrassed by it.<br/>
I turn now to the Companies Bill. When the Bill was first presented, it was put before the House as the sort of measure that could be commended on Second Reading&#x2014;as I recall, it had its Second Reading late at night&#x2014;and as a worthwhile measure that should be passed and made company law. However, since then, over 1,000 amendments have been tabled, mainly by the Government. About 250 of them remain to be considered, of which all but four are Government amendments, for which the Government's guillotine provides about four and a half hours. According to my calculations, that works out at about 64 seconds per amendment, which is marginally better than the Government are providing for the remaining amendments to the Children Bill.<br/>
However, that does not provide much time for us to scrutinise carefully the important aspects of a Bill that covers exployees' rights, mergers and the technicalities of company accounts. God knows, nearly all the fraud in the City takes place because the present legislation was not carefully enough drafted or scrutinised. We should ensure that the stuff we are considering now is up to the task. Those are the restrictions that the guillotine motion will impose. It is symbolic that more time will be provided for the completion of the Companies Bill than for the completion of the Children Bill.<br/>
Most of the Government's problems spring from their arrogance. They are arrogant not only abroad but at home. They have certainly displayed arrogance over their legislative programme. Generally speaking&#x2014;I exclude the Children Bill from this description&#x2014;the genesis of the Government's legislative programme goes something like this. They come up with some half-baked idea from a Right-wing think tank. The idea gets a standing ovation at the Tory party conference. It is then brought back from Blackpool or Brighton and goes to Whitehall, where some

hapless parliamentary draftsman is expected to turn lunacy into workable law. A Bill is produced. It is inevitably full of contradictions and riddled with inconsistencies and is incapable of reflecting what happens in the real world. Comments are then made about it by practical people in the real world and points are raised in Committee by my assiduous hon. Friends, and even by some Conservative Members. At that point, Ministers realise that they need to amend the Bill&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>One of that series of amendments was designed to deal with the crookedness of the City and the casino economy. As my hon. Friend knows only too well, because his constituency is close to the City, crookedness in the City is growing rapidly. Every time the Government introduce such a Bill, they have to amend it substantially. This latest Bill is an attempt to keep the legislation in line with the present crookedness of Lloyd's and others. Hence the tabling of several, if not scores of, Government amendments. A number of things are happening at Lloyd's&#x2014;money is being lost by so-called "names" and there are prospective losses. The Government are trying to tighten things up because some of the accountants whom the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) represents have not been doing their jobs properly. Ferranti is a good example.</p>

<p>I quite agree. As ever, my hon. Friend puts it in a nutshell. These shoddily drafted Bills are brought before the House, and then hundreds of amendments are produced in Committee and on Report, here and in the House of Lords. As I have said, more than a thousand were tabled to the Companies Bill.<br/>
For some reason that I cannot understand, the Government purport to be surprised&#x2014;and they certainly panic&#x2014;when hon. Members insist on doing their job properly and on scrutinising the legislation. Some amendments are politically contentious, others are not. For instance, I assume that Conservative Members want to catch the fraudsters&#x2014;we certainly do&#x2014;so it would be as well if the technicalities of the Bill permitted them to be caught, prosecuted and gaoled on the basis of proper evidence, not of confessions.<br/>
Some amendments are not politically contentious but are produced in response to points made by the Opposition, and we welcome that. The Minister responsible for the Children Bill has responded to many points made by outside organisations and hon. Members in the Committee to try to improve the Bill. However, the fact that he has produced amendments does not guarantee that they will achieve what they are intended to achieve. All of them need to be examined carefully to ensure that they are soundly worded.<br/>
This applies with equal or even greater force to Bills such as the Children Bill, the aspirations behind which we all support. All hon. Members want the time and opportunity to do this part of the job that we were elected to do. The Government have failed to provide the time, partly because no conceivable amount of time can compensate for the sloppy drafting and the multitude of amendments made in Committee and in the House&#x2014;in some cases only a matter of hours before they are to be debated.</p>

<p>We had a serious debate yesterday on business contributions to the Conservative party. The Conservative Members all stood up blocking our new clause and wasting time, but our case was first class and we were doing our job as an Opposition&#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I hope that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) will listen to me, because I am responsible to the Chair, not to him.<br/>
The new clause would have done a first-class job on behalf of a community that is crying out for it. The Government have told the trade unions to hold ballots on raising money for a political levy to give to the Labour party, but when we suggested that companies should consult shareholders with a ballot on whether they wanted the business to contribute to Conservative party funds they turned down the idea. Conservative Members went into the Lobby and voted against it. They were filibustering nearly all night and they should be ashamed of themselves.</p>

<p>In his usual mild-mannered and persuasive way, my hon. Friend has put his finger on the Government's double standards where contributions to the Labour party by trade unions are concerned. Trade unions must set up a separate fund and conduct ballots of all their members, and if they decide to set up such a fund

and ask their members to make contributions every one of them can opt out. Last night the Tories stuck by their position, as ever, that there should not be a ballot, a separate fund or opting out for companies.<br/>
As the point made by hon. Friend the Member for Ashfield (Mr. Haynes) shows, there are other double standards. We put forward a new clause; Conservative Members can speak against it at considerable length and then vote against it. Such debates are legitimate, as are such votes, but when we want to debate and vote on amendments that the Government table they do not want us to. Apparently we are breaking their rules. The rule of this arrogant Government is, "We tell everyone what to do, including the House." But as a distinguished former Cabinet colleague of the Leader of the House told me yesterday, the Government have forgotten one iron rule: in the part of the Session coming up to July, the Government have the Commons over a barrel; in the spill-over period, the Commons have the Government over a barrel. So the Government would be wise to run their business so as not to expose themselves as badly as they have done on this occasion by their incompetence.</p>

<p>I shall not give way now&#x2014;I am sure that we shall hear the hon. and learned Gentleman's point later.<br/>
These guillotines will make matters worse. They will prevent the House from doing justice to either of these important Bills. Forty-six seconds per new clause or amendment for the Children Bill cannot be right. Tonight we shall vote, not against the Children Bill, but against the guillotine that imposes those 46 seconds.</p>

<p>I rise to support the motion, but with somewhat mixed feelings. One of those feelings is relief that my right hon. and learned Friend the Leader of the House has stepped in to save the Children Bill, progress on which was being followed anxiously by many organisations. There seemed to be a real danger that the Bill could he wrecked by a handful of hon. Members who may claim to represent the interests of the miners but are clearly not concerned with the interests of children in this country.<br/>
My other feeling is one of sadness. In 15 years in the House I cannot recall a Bill for which a timetable motion was less appropriate. The Bill is the product of years of inquiries. White Papers, campaigns and representations by people and organisations. It was given detailed scrutiny in both Houses in a non-partisan atmosphere. That we should have been expected to complete the final stages of such an important Bill in the small hours of the morning merely because the Opposition insisted on inserting into our business a debate on the economy was regrettable. That we are now obliged to complete the Bill as the second business on a Friday and subject to a timetable is to be deplored.<br/>
I know the frustrations of being in opposition. I sat on the Opposition Benches for five years. Happily, in our system we do not engage in fisticuffs or worse, and even the use of strong language is somewhat circumscribed. I can therefore well understand why some people feel that they want to demonstrate their annoyance and, sometimes, their sense of outrage at some of the things that the Government of the day are doing.<br/>
To use parliamentary procedural tactics to delay and upset Government business is perfectly legitimate. When we were in opposition we did that individually and collectively, but such tactics need to be employed with discretion. It is one thing for the Opposition to use all the available means to impede a measure which is clearly contrary to their political philosophy, but it is quite another to do so in respect of legislation which is not subject to party political differences and is supported in all parts of the country. There can he no better example of that than the Children Bill.<br/>
We should have been able to finish consideration of the Bill on Tuesday night. Some Opposition Members would no doubt argue that we could have done so. The evidence that I heard and saw suggested that we could well have spent a long and unproductive night and possibly part of the morning. We saw that pattern beginning to emerge last night. I do not suggest that Oppossition Front Bench Members or their colleagues with an interest in the Bill would have been party to any such tactics, but we all know that a small number of hon. Members can frustrate progress.<br/>
We also know that agreements and understandings, however well meant, do not always work. The shadow Leader of the House, the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson), made the plea that nobody had approached him to come to some understanding about how the Bill should be handled. However, I am afraid that we have learned that such understandings are worthless. We have seen that the Opposition simply cannot control their Members. In the circumstances, the Government's business managers had no alternative but to introduce a timetable motion. Its term allow three hours, which should be adequate to consider the amendments. Despite all the statistics expounded by the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, the hon. Gentleman knows perfectly well that many of the amendments are purely technical and that many of them meet points made in Committee.</p>

<p>I agree with the hon. Gentleman that many of the amendments are technical. Does he agree that there is considerable evidence that many of them are technically faulty and incorrect and need to be improved if the Bill is to work properly? I am rather fortified in my view about that by a former Tory Cabinet Minister who is now a Member of the House of Lords. He sought me out and told me how much he agreed with what I had said during a debate on a previous guillotine motion when I talked about this very aspect.</p>

<p>I have seen few amendments to amendments tabled by the Opposition. If they have spotted faults they should have drawn attention to them in that manner.<br/>
The three hours proposed in the motion will give us more time to discuss the Bill than the time allowed in the original understanding between the two sides. I have no great complaint about the three hours, but it is unfortunate&#x2014;to put it no higher&#x2014;that we shall have to discuss these matters tomorrow under some pressure of time. That is a sad end to the proceedings on the Children Bill which up to now had shown Parliament at its best. It is a turn of events which discredits the Labour party&#x2014;a matter which does not distress me particularly&#x2014;but it also discredits the House, which distresses me considerably.</p>

<p>It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Chislehurst (Mr. Sims) because I know how hard he has worked on the Children Bill for many years. He was right when he said that its history goes back several years through a variety of law commissions and reviews of the law. It also had the impetus of the Cleveland child abuse crisis. I do not agree with the views that he expressed in the latter part of his speech because they contradict some of his earlier statements when he said that the guillotine had been used by previous Governments.<br/>
The tactics that we have seen this week were used in the past by the Conservatives. When the deputy Leader of the House referred to the Churchill-Eden era, he reminded me of my first visit to the House of Commons. I was in the Strangers' Gallery and listened to Sydney Silverman advancing an argument during a debate on a guillotine motion not dissimilar to that advanced by the hon. Member for Chislehurst. He said that there are times when the guillotine is appropriate and times when it is not.<br/>
Without wishing to incur the wrath of Conservative Members I can say that I think that the guillotine was appropriate in 1976 when we had to push the shipbuilding and dockyard nationalisation schemes through. We had to do that because of the tactics used by the Conservative Opposition at that time. They did everything that they could legitimately and within parliamentary means to prevent a Labour Government with a mandate putting on the statute book two vital elements of their legislative programme. The guillotine was used at that time by the then Leader of the House, my right hon. Friend the Member for Blaenau Gwent (Mr. Foot). In 1968 he and Enoch Powell frustrated the will of a Labour Government about the reform of the House of Lords and they used parliamentary tactics to do that.<br/>
We all know that the guillotine goes back to the time when Irish Members frustrated the business of the House to such an extent that it had to be used to make progress. The Children Bill was at the heart of the speech by the hon. Member for Chislehurst. That Bill reflects what the Lord Chancellor said, that the upbringing of children is the fundamental responsibility of parents. The object of the Bill is to establish rights for children and parents and to look at the erosion of parental rights. It looks at the means by which we can protect children such as Doreen Mason, about whom the hon. Member for Chislehurst spoke, and Kimberley Carlile, about whom I have spoken in the past.<br/>
We all know that children are at risk in society, and that we must protect them while not intruding in family life as we understand it. That is the balance that we sought to strike in Committee. The Bill was non-political and the Minister of State and the Solicitor-General took us through it on a non-political basis. My hon. Friend the Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) took us through it carefully. We had long discussions and amendments proposed by Back Benchers were considered by the Government and by civil servants. After careful consideration we came up with a Bill which we hope, with foresight rather than hindsight, will protect children and will do so without unnecessary intrusions. In Committee we saw the abolition of the place of safety order which was used extensively in Cleveland and we created an emergency


protection order and child assessment orders for the protection of children. We had legitimate debate on all those matters.<br/>
The shenanigans on Tuesday evening which prevented us from moving forward were in a sense a parliamentary occasion. I have often looked upon my hon. Friends the Members for Bolsover (Mr. Skinner) and for Bradford, South (Mr. Cryer) as being rather like Blucher at the battle of Waterloo. They plough in from the side, change the nature of our business, make their point and then go across and shake the hand of the Duke of Wellington and a great victory has been won. We are all more aware today of the Associated Ports (No. 2) Bill than we were two days ago.<br/>
I gave a commitment to the National Union of Mineworkers in Durham that I would support them in their efforts to prevent a coal terminal coming to Middlesbrough. I did that as part of the strategy to have proper planning for all our energy requirements and to keep the Durham coal field, with its 10,000 miners, going. Therefore, I was not particularly enamoured of any technique on the Floor of the House to try to prevent the Children Bill going through.<br/>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East (Mr. Vaz) said, at 1.30 in the morning we were prepared to stay here throughout the night. In the six years that I have been in Parliament, there have been many occasions when the Opposition have taken the Government through the night, through to 1.30 the following day, and the Government have lost the business of the House for that day. We had assurances from those who were wishing to make a point on the Associated British Ports (No. 2) Bill that they would not prevent the Children Bill from reaching its remaining stages by the close of business.<br/>
The Government had their quorum in place. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, East (Mr. Madden) said, there were aye votes of 101 and 102 at 1.30 in the morning. The Opposition were prepared to go through the night, and if we had done so the Children Bill would have gone through its remaining stages in this House. My hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East made that proposition to the Minister, but other decisions had been made, and the Government moved the adjournment of the House. Until tonight, when the Leader of the House referred to discussions with the usual channels, I had thought that there had been discussions through the usual channels and that we could reach a reasonable agreement on the remaining stages of the Bill that would have allowed us the proper amount of time to discuss it.</p>

<p>As the hon. Gentleman knows, I hold him in great respect generally, and particularly on the issue of children. He has had the grace to acknowledge that a group of Members with no great interest in the Children Bill took action because they wanted to make a point. Does the hon. Gentleman really think that it would be in the right spirit of the debate on the Bill that had otherwise proceeded so sensibly that we should have to run the gauntlet of people ready to have a Division on matters of no substance in order to make a point? In those circumstances, is it not better to get back to a framework of discipline, within which we can take a common-sense approach to the Bill?</p>

<p>I understand the point that the Minister is making, because there is no doubt that we would have had a disruptive evening, with votes on a variety of amendments. However, our view is that it was up to the House of Commons to force a passage through such obstacles and to discuss the amendments as best we could. All the Opposition Members who had served on the Committee were in their place. For example, my hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore (Mr. Powell), who had tabled new clause 10 dealing with the rights of grandparents, was there, as were those who supported him. I agree with the Minister that we would have had to run the gauntlet, but we were prepared to be here and to have that discussion over and above what was happening on the sidelines, with Blucher coming in from the wings.<br/>
As the hon. Member for Chislehurst and my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) have said, we are now left with 46 seconds for each amendment. Many of them are technical amendments, but we have lost control over the remaining stages of the Children Bill, and we shall not be able to cover those final amendments in the way that we would have done if we had had a proper Report stage. If we had a proper debate, we could pick up, even at this late stage, the rucks in the texture, as Lord Denning once described parliamentary evasion or lack of clarity. In the final stages of the Bill, we have lost the opportunity to exercise foresight, rather than hindsight.<br/>
The guillotine represents the power of the Executive over the Legislature and the Opposition must submit to that power because we do not have a majority. However that power should be used sparingly and wisely. It ought not to be used simply because the quorum of Conservative Members who had to be in the Palace of Westminster for the duration of the business wanted to get home early. The time of 1.30 in the morning may seem late to members of the public, but hon. Members on both sides of the House know that it is not late in parliamentary terms. The power to guillotine was used unwisely on this occasion. I can only hope that, in the final stages of the Bill, the other place will look carefully at the amendments that we have not been able to go through properly so that when the Bill reaches the statute book and is used to protect children and parents in the best possible way it will be as good as if it had left the House of Commons without being guillotined.</p>

<p>I am particularly angry at the guillotine motion because, along with others who are here tonight, I served on the Standing Committee on the Children Bill and both sides of the Committee played a constructive part in bringing forward progressive helpful and long-overdue legislation. I am angry about the way in which the Government have tried to deflect responsibility for the shambles that has occurred in their business management. They have had plenty of opportunities to allow time for the Bill to be properly considered at a sensible time of day rather than in the middle of the night. Now we have just 46 seconds for each amendment.<br/>
I am worried about that because a number of important amendments have still to be discussed. I accept that many of the amendments are technical, so there will possibly be no debate on them and they will be nodded through. However, a number deal with detailed concerns. For


example, new clause 10 deals with grandparents. Like many other hon. Members, I have constituents who are grandparents and who feel deeply aggrieved at the way in which the law affects them and their relationship with their grandchildren. The granddaughter of a woman who lives near to me has recently been adopted, and the grandmother no longer has contact with the child whom she raised for the first six years of the child's life. I feel strongly about that and I know that both the child and the grandmother also do. This is a deeply emotional issue for many people. Many other hon. Members have similar cases, and some that are even more heart rending.<br/>
I am concerned about the rights of children in care, which are affected by a number of amendments that remain to be discussed. I have experience in social work and I have seen how children get into care and how our treatment of those children negates basic human rights. I am particularly concerned about care-leavers because, as a result of the way in which the Government have changed the rules in social security, vast numbers of young people are left vulnerable to exploitation when they leave care. I hope to raise this issue when we debate tomorrow two of the amendments that I have tabled. However, I suspect that they will be dealt with only briefly. Only yesterday I was talking to a probation officer who told me of the way in which the Government's changes in social security legislation, which have changed single payments to a loan, have resulted in one client, a young girl who had left care, going out as a prostitute to get some furniture for her flat. That is happening directly as a result of the Government's policy.<br/>
I respect the hon. Member for Chislehurst (Mr. Sims), who made an important contribution to the Bill. However, he seems to see the legislation in narrow terms. He sees it as being the answer to problems, but wider issues, many related to the Government's policies, should be addressed.<br/>
I know that there is concern about the exclusion orders, or ouster orders. I have experience of social security work, and I mentioned this case in Committee at some length. I had to remove a girl whose sister had made allegations about sexual interference by the mother's boyfriend. It was an awful experience. I had to take police officers to surround the house, get hold of the 12-year-old girl who had just come out of hospital after having her appendix removed, and take her into care. The law is wrong in such cases. The person who should be removed is the perpetrator of the abuse, not the child who was the victim. We have to do someting about that, and we cannot do it on the nod. It is criminal to allow only 46 seconds to discuss such serious issues and I am appalled at what democracy has come down to.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend will recall that, a week ago, in discussions with the Minister of State, hon. Members on both sides of the House said that they were concerned that we would not get the full two days that we were promised to discuss the provisions of the Bill. Clearly, we shall not get those days.

<p>I shall deal with that argument in a few minutes. There is a clear connection between what happens to the economy of our society and what happens to children in that society. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Chislehurst fails to recognise that connection.<br/>
It has been alleged that time has been wasted during oar consideration of the Bill. When the Minister replies, I challenge him to produce one example of time wasting in Committee. I attended virtually every sitting when the Bill was being considered in Committee and I do not recall an irrelevant speech being made from either side of the Committee. The debate which took place on the Floor of the House the other night on day care, for example, was extremely interesting. Some valuable comments were made by hon. Members who had not hitherto been involved in the Bill. I read the report of the debate in <i>Hansard</i> and I could not find one area of it that was not directly relevant to the issues that were before us.</p>

<p>Although the hon. Gentleman and I have disagreed about certain parts of the Bill, and although we can always argue about how long it should take to formulate a point, I am not criticising him or any of his hon. Friends who served in Committee for advancing their arguments. Our consideration of the Bill in Committee remains for me one of the more pleasurable experiences of my time in this place. If the hon. Gentleman is being fair, and I know that he wants to be, he must explain why it was that at the beginning of the second day of our consideration of the Bill on Report an entirely uncontroversial amendment was made the subject of a Division. The Division was called by two hon. Members who had played no previous part in our consideration of the Bill. It was clear, as the hon. Member for Middlesbrough (Mr. Bell) has conceded today, and as the hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) conceded on Tuesday night, that that was part of a tactic that would have continued and would have had the effect of souring the atmosphere. The hon. Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) cannot delude us about that. However sincere he and his hon. Friends who were members of the Committee which considered the Bill may be, others were determined to make a monkey of the business of the House, and that is a fact.</p>

<p>I am happy to tackle head-on the issue of the private Bill to which the Minister has referred obliquely. There is a direct connection between the implications of that Bill and the welfare of children. I shall come to that. The Minister is seeking to dodge the reality that the Government have their priorities wrong. Bearing in mind the time that they have had and the issues that we have debated&#x2014;many of them have been far less serious


than those raised by the Children Bill&#x2014;there has been sufficient time for the Bill to be considered fully at a normal time of day. It is the Government, not the Opposition, who have their priorities wrong.<br/>
The hon. Member for Chislehurst referred to the debate on the economy which took place yesterday. It is not the Opposition's fault that there is a slight problem with the balance of trade. It is not our fault that there is a trade deficit, that inflation is increasing and that interest rates are going through the roof. Equally, it is not our fault that people are having to go on council house waiting lists because they cannot meet mortgage repayments. All these factors have a direct bearing on children. There are families in my constituency who will become homeless because their houses are being repossessed because they cannot afford the huge repayments which are the result of increased interest rates. If Conservative Members&#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i>It seems that some hon. Members wish me to name names. If they wish to see some of the details, I shall be happy to supply them. I shall certainly do so if the people concerned are prepared to have their names put forward. I shall be quite happy to take Conservative Members to see these people. I do not make up these stories. Some of us have surgeries every week&#x2014;in some instances, several times a week&#x2014;and we meet the people. We are aware of the day-to-day realities in our constituencies as a result of the Government's actions. There is a direct connection between the economy and the welfare of children, and it angers my hon. Friends and me that that is not recognised by the Government.</p>

<p>I took the hon. Gentleman's word that he wanted seriously to explore the matters which lie behind the Children Bill. I put the argument to him again. How can he explain the decision taken at the beginning of the second day of consideration of the Bill on Report by two of his hon. Friends, who had hitherto taken no part in the consideration of the Bill, to call a Division on a purely technical amendment? Does he not know as well as I do that it was common currency and discussion around the House that his two hon. Friends intended to call Divisions throughout the night if we had gone on with our consideration of the Bill? That was the truth of the matter.</p>

<p>To be fair, following the Minister's previous intervention I said that I would deal with that matter. It is something about which I feel strongly. I happen to understand and sympathise with the actions of my hon. Friends the Members for Doncaster, North (Mr. Welsh) and for Bolsover (Mr. Skinner). I suspect that my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, North, who called the Division to which the Minister has referred, was not fully aware of the issues raised by the clause. When he was made aware of them, he did not vote against the clause, and nor did anyone else. No one wished to see that clause defeated. My hon. Friends and I continued to support it. There would have been Divisions only on issues that were contested, and there were a number of those. There are serious issues which separate the two sides of the House.</p>

<p>Perhaps my hon. Friend will care to put to the Minister that the debate which we were due to have on the evening of Tuesday following the Division to which he has referred was on new clause 10, which concerned grandparents.

There would have been no rogue vote on that new clause. Hon. Members had come to the Chamber ready to debate the new clause. We were no later reaching it than we expected earlier. It was clear, however, that the Government would not be able to keep their troops in the House. The Government were concerned and they brought the consideration of the Bill to an end. There would have been no rogue votes. The debate on grandparents would have taken place whatever the circumstances and whatever the attitude of my hon. Friends to any other measure.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend is correct. My hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, North, who called what has been described as the rogue vote, is a grandfather. I know that he feels deeply about the issues that we were to debate and the surrounding issues. I have no doubt that he would have contributed to the debate, as he did to the debate on day care.<br/>
The central issue is that the Children Bill deals with the needs of the most disadvantaged in our society. Unfortunately, the Government are attaching less priority to it than to numerous other measures that are designed further to advantage the advantaged. Privatisation measures are designed to allow those who have plenty to have even more. That is the kernel of the debate. Under this Government Bills which deal with human need, such as the Children Bill, take second place to Bills which deal with human greed.<br/>
I shall give an example. We learnt today that next Wednesday we are to be faced with a squalid little measure, the Associated British Ports (No. 2) Bill. Can anyone explain why that private Bill is being given prime time?</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I know that the House is discussing the effects of our proceedings last night and the fact that the Government are now in a complete shambles, but I want the Government spokesman to tell us when the Government will make a statement about the resignation of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, which has just been announced on the tapes. Why is it that in the middle of a debate, which has been brought about because of the


shambles within the Government, there is no spokesperson available to tell us about the dramatic resignation of the Chancellor? Why is not the Prime Minister in the Chamber to tell the House why that has happened? Has the Chancellor been driven out by Sir Alan Walters? Who will succeed the Chancellor? Those are very important questions<br/>
I know that the debate is important and that my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) is doing a fair splash job on the question of the guillotine, but the resignation of the Chancellor is a most important matter. Obviously there has been a dramatic confrontation between the Prime Minister and the Chancellor during the past few hours, which has reached its untimely conclusion with the resignation of the Chancellor. Why is there no one on the Government Front Bench ready to explain what has happened? They have a duty to explain to this House why the Chancellor has resigned.</p>

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Surely you have a responsibility if a request is made by the Government to make a statement about the Chancellor's resignation. You would have to consider whether and how to fit in an emergency statement with the business of the day. The question would then arise whether any statement would come out of guillotine motion time because we have recently resolved to have a three-hour debate. Not only would there need to be consideration of whether a statement on this important economic matter should be allowed, but on what effect it would have on this three-hour debate. I seek your guidance, Mr. Deputy Speaker. It is a time of great economic crisis and I wish to know whether the Prime Minister has sought leave to come to the House to make a statement on what appears to be the biggest crisis of this Parliament.</p>

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. The Leader of the House was swift to come to the Chamber at midnight to make a statement. He is here now, and I wonder whether he has approached you and confirmed what is now being reported on the tapes and on BBC television news&#x2014;that the Chancellor has resigned in the middle of one of the most profound economic crises that this country has faced. It is right and proper that a Government Minister, and preferably the Prime Minister&#x2014;who is First Lord of the Treasury&#x2014;should come to the House and explain what is happening.</p>

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. It is clear that we are trapped in the procedures of the House. The debate is due to continue for a set time, yet decisions will be taken at the end of that time that will pre-determine what happens tomorrow. I do not wish further to venture into the seriousness of the present situation, but it is clear that the House will wish to have an opportunity to question and to discuss the matter. Either there must be a statement this evening or there must be one early tomorrow.<br/>
In order to ensure that this debate can proceed in a sensible manner, would it not make sense to have a brief Adjournment of the House while the usual channels discuss the way in which we can deal both with the business before us and with the problems that we all wish to address?</p>

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Although I understand your position, the Opposition sat through Prime Minister's questions this afternoon when the right hon. Lady gave her backing to the Chancellor. The question is whether, when the right hon. Lady made that statement, she knew of the pending resignation and whether she was deceiving the House. We have a right to know whether she made that statement in the full knowledge of the facts or whether she was unaware of the facts.<br/>
It is for the Government of the day to control the business of the House and to make the necessary statement at this time. We sympathise with our hon. Friends who are trying to discuss the guillotine motion, but in the national interest it is right that the Prime Minister should make a statement now, especially in the light of the probable impact on interest rates. The Prime Minister said today that the Chancellor had her full support and that the civil servant at No. 10 did not have that same support. It is therefore right and proper not only that there should be a statement, but that that statement should be made by the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. May I press on you the suggestion made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Swansea, West (Mr. Williams) that there should be a short adjournment of the House so that the matter can be dealt with sensibly and reasonably? It is extremely unsatisfactory for the House not to be told the full facts. A proper statement must be made at the earliest opportunity. There would be little point in continuing to raise points of order and to force the Government to make a statement. It would be simple for the Leader of the House to stand up and ask for an adjournment, which would enable the Prime Minister to come to the House and make a clear statement about what has happened. It is the right hon. Lady's duty to report to the House before making statements outside.</p>

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Good news does, indeed, move quickly. As the Leader of the House and the Chief Whip are both here, it is right to ask them for a statement. The implications of the Chancellor&#x2014;even this Chancellor&#x2014;resigning will be profound upon the stock market and on international confidence in the pound. I assure you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that many of my constituents will be worried about their gold stocks, their shares and all the other assets that they have managed to accumulate during the past 10 years. In those circumstances&#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I note, Sir, that I have your close and undivided attention.<br/>
I suggest that there is a statement because I, for one, am becoming rather concerned about the fate of the Chancellor. He is not the most lovable person, but if he jumped from No. 11 Downing street there would now be a very large hole in the road, which could be catastrophic for the Prime Minister as she rushes back in her bullet-proof chauffeured limousine. It is because we feel such great concern for the Chancellor that we must know exactly what has happened to the poor fellow. He must be having a very rough time.</p>

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Is it not opportune to remind the Leader of the House that less than three hours


ago the Leader of the Opposition asked a specific question about the Chancellor and about part-time advisers&#x2014;<i>[Interruption]</i> We are completely in the dark. The Prime Minister gave no sign of what was to happen. It is a crucial time, yet we have absolutely no idea of who is now to marshal the economic resources of this country. However, a few moments ago I did notice that my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Monklands, East (Mr. Smith) had been called from the Chamber, so perhaps interesting developments are taking place. Because this matter was discussed no more than three hours ago and because of the grave implications for the stock market and the economy, we are in order to demand a statement to the House.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I am grateful to you for calling me as I have a genuine point of order&#x2014;as, indeed, has every Opposition Member. There has been a suggestion that the House should adjourn while we consider the economic crisis that is engulfing the country because of the incompetence of the Government's conduct of affairs, the resignation of the Chancellor and the issues arising from the guillotine motion that is currently before the House.<br/>
My right hon.Friend the Member for Swansea, West (Mr. Williams) requested an adjournment of the House, and I wonder whether that would be treated as a dilatory motion or whether it would be accepted. If it were to be treated as a dilatory motion under the terms of the guillotine, it could be moved only by a Government spokesman. It is incumbent upon the Government to rearrange the proceedings of the House and to make a statement. It is outrageous that such events can happen and that the arguing and bickering between No. 10 and No. 11 about Professor Walters can result in the resignation of the Chancellor, with the information being given to television and radio but not to this House. We are the accountable body.</p>

I seek your advice, Mr. Deputy Speaker. If we are to ensure that the opportunity arises within the rules of order for a statement to be made, would it not be necessary for us to pass the guillotine motion? As I understand it, that would then foreclose the proceedings for the rest of the day. I hope that either by your ruling, or by discussions through the usual channels, we can ensure that the most senior member of the Government has the opportunity to come to the Chamber to explain what has happened and why, in the middle of an economic crisis, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has resigned. That is a most important matter to the British people and to people abroad. It will affect markets and it must be cleared up. It will not be satisfactory to hon. Members on either side of the House for the situation to be explained and clarified by Mr. Bernard Ingham.

<p>Further to the points of order in which Opposition Members have expressed some interest, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I would suggest two things. First, the resignation, or proffered resignation, of a member of the Government does not normally lead to the making of a statement, and so it does not follow that that should happen as a matter of course. Secondly, it would certainly not follow that there should be any deflection of the business before the House for a variety of reasons, including those referred to by the shadow Leader of the House. I suggest that the business of the House, the debate now taking place and that which is to follow, should proceed. I shall see whether I can consider through the usual channels the possibilities that have been suggested, but I do not want to imply that the business would be interrupted or any presumption of a statement on the matter. However, I can show my willingness to listen.</p>

I am advised that whatever happens, at 7.46 pm, when the three hours provided for the guillotine motion expire, the Question must be put, notwithstanding the seriousness of other matters that have intervened. I am sure that the House will wish to consider whether it would like to have a view from the Front Bench spokesmen before the House is required to make its decision on the guillotine motion.

May we have a clear ruling on whether, if the guillotine motion were to be passed, the Government could interrupt the then guillotined business in order to make a statement? We should not proceed with the discussion on the guillotine motion until we know that.</p>

<p>Let me respond to that immediately. I have made it clear to the House that the


time available for the guillotine motion will expire at 7&#x00B7;46 pm and at that time, if not before, the Chair will be required to put the Question. If the hon. Gentleman is asking what might be the situation if there were a request for a statement to be made at a time after that, doubtless, as in the past, arrangements can be made for a subsequent statement to be made.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Can you confirm that under normal circumstances any hon. Member wishing to make an application under Standing Order No. 20 would have had to have submitted an application to Mr. Speaker before 12 o'clock today unless circumstances arose after that time which, in the view of the Chair, were sufficiently urgent to allow a later application? Must not the Chancellor's resignation, and hence the collapse of the Government's direction of economic policy, be the one occasion in this Session when an application under Standing Order No. 20 from me or from one of my hon. Friends should be accepted by the Chair and the business of the day set aside for a debate, if for no other reason than to find out whether the deputy Prime Minister is going to get his house back?</p>

<p>Our Standing Orders rule out any application under Standing Order No. 20 being made in the course of this day's sitting. Equally, an application for an emergency debate under Standing Order No. 20 cannot be made on a Friday. If there were a request for a statement to be made and the Chair conceded that a statement should be made after the conclusion of the motion that is before the House and before the first guillotine falls, it would take time out of that provided in the motion before the House.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Can you give us some guidance? We are not sure who is running the country or who is speaking for the Government. Yesterday, we were assured by Ministers, and it was confirmed by the Prime Minister today, that advisers advise but Ministers decide. Now the Minister has resigned, so what credence can we give to the guarantees that have been given to us? The House of Commons needs to know who is running the Government. Is it the advisers or is it the Ministers? Are other Ministers going to resign? I want a clear statement in the House of Commons on the present position.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Further complications have arisen during the past two or three minutes which make the passage of the guillotine motion on the Companies and Children Bills more problematical.<br/>
The Foreign Secretary has now been given the Chancellor's job. That being so, it could well be that the Leader of the House is going back to the Foreign Secretary's job. If that is the case, we have not got a Leader of the House to carry the guillotine through.<br/>
I believe that the House needs to adjourn, because while this pack of dominoes is falling we are not sure which Minister is in what charge of which Department. I think it imperative at this point, as the Leader of the House has now left the Chamber&#x2014;presumably to get the Foreign Secretary's job, his own job, back&#x2014;for us to adjourn for the matter to be resolved.</p>

If the matter is to be dealt with properly, I think that the sitting should be briefly suspended to give the Government the opportunity to sort out who is going to make the statement, and then deal with this in a proper and seemly manner; otherwise, there is no possibility of the current debate continuing in any sensible way.<br/>

<p>I was making the point&#x2014;it now seems quite pertinent&#x2014;that there is clearly a direct connection between the economic circumstances affecting many families, which are the direct consequences of the Government's policies, and the need to pursue some of the legal provisions that are contained within the Children Bill.<br/>
I wish to express my concern at the narrow view held by many Conservative Members concerning the way in which the legislation affects children. Clearly, we need to look at the reasons why young people are abused or have to be removed from home. It is clearly connected with the Government's policies on poverty, homelessness, the economy and unemployment. That is where my view differs from that of hon. Members who have criticised some of my hon. Friends from the miners group who, quite rightly, have been fighting valiantly the various ports Bills.<br/>
The issue concerning hon. Members&#x2014;including myself&#x2014;and others representing coalfield areas is how unemployment affects children, families and communities. In my area, communities have been wiped out as a direct result of the Government's policies on the coal industry. When the Government took office in 1979, within the Wakefield district 17,000 people were employed in 20 pits. That figure has now been reduced to some 3,000 employed at five pits. Fourteen thousand jobs have been wiped out, and that has a direct bearing on the prosperity of families, children and the lives that people lead. Therefore, I hope that hon. Members can see why some of my hon. Friends are concerned about the way in which children will be affected by the Bill coming before the House next week.<br/>
My constituency has been affected directly by pit closures. In addition, there has been a knock-on effect in the mining-engineering industry where 1,000 jobs have gone since 1979 in companies within my constituency supplying materials to the coal mining industry. It is important that we make the point that the ports Bills have a direct bearing on the worsening of the problems. I am deeply concerned about the impact those Bills will have on many coalfield communities in my area, the wider parts of Yorkshire and the midlands. The coalfield communities campaign said that if imports went ahead at projected levels 36 more pits would close.</p>

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker. I want to make sure that my hon.

When the Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Prime Minister comes in here, we know what his game is. He is doing two things. He is saying to the Government Back Benchers, "This is the line.

<p>The second point, which is very important, concerns what happens in future. If the Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Prime Minister says to Conservative Back Benchers. "Say what I say and what the Prime Minister says", they do so, hoping to get a job in the reshuffle. There will be a number of jobs available in that reshuffle, so instead of listening to my hon.

<p>I fully appreciate the points that have been made. I am concerned that there is a clear connection between the impact that the ports Bills will have on the coalfield communities in Yorkshire, north Derbyshire, the midlands and across the country, and the lives of families and children. I see a clear connection between what is contained in the Children Bill about the welfare of children and the action that has been taken by some of my hon. Friends to draw attention to the way in which the ports Bills will have a direct effect on people's lives in their constituencies.<br/>
If the ports Bill that we are to discuss next week in time that should have been accorded to the Children Bill and other Bills about the welfare of individuals goes ahead, 36 more pits will close and 51,000 jobs will go. Those jobs directly affect the lives of children for whom we are legislating in the Children Bill.<br/>
We differ in our views on child welfare in that Opposition Members believe that child abuse is not just about nasty people. It is about marital stress, marital problems, isolation, deprivation, poverty and, above all, unemployment.

<p>My voice is going, so I will conclude my remarks.<br/>
My central point is that the Government take a very narrow view of child protection. Child protection is not just about legal measures but involves wider social and economic policies. It is about poverty, inequality and unemployment. I urge the House not just to look at the


symptoms that have been dealt with by the legislation, but at the causes. Some of those causes are sitting on the Government Benches tonight</p>

<p>The House should pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe), who began the discussion on the Children Bill and whose speech was interrupted by the suspension of the sitting. As many hon. Members on both sides of the House have said&#x2014;and as the hon. Member for Chislehurst (Mr. Sims) said in his speech&#x2014;the Children Bill was an all-party Bill. Indeed, if the former Chancellor of the Exchequer were here today, he would he supporting the measure. One of the features of the Children Bill is the fact that it has been a consensus Bill.<br/>
As we all know, it was introduced last November by the Lord Chancellor and received Second Reading in the House of Lords. At that stage it was clear that hon. Members on both sides of the House who were to take part in its deliberations would do so in a constructive and positive way. They would ensure that constructive comments were made concerning the improvement of the Bill. I am delighted to say that when the Bill was considered in the House of Lords and in Standing Committee the response of the lead Ministers both here and in the House of Lords has been remarkably fair.<br/>
I hope that it will not damage the hon. and learned Gentleman's career if I pay tribute to the Minister of State at the Department of Health, the hon. and learned Member for Putney (Mr. Mellor), for the way in which he has conducted himself during the passage of the Bill. He has been fair and reasonable. As a relatively new Member of the House, I have occasionally discussed with other more senior colleagues the way in which the Minister has approached the Bill. They were very surprised when I told them that the Minister adjourned the Committee over a crucial aspect of policy in the Bill&#x2014;the rights of social workers to take emergency action to remove children during periods of stress. He adjourned the Committee and offered us his officials&#x2014;Rupert and other people who have assisted in the passage of the Bill. We had a long discussion on ways in which we could improve the Bill.<br/>
Unfortunately, the Minister could not accept the amendment in my name and that of other hon. Members, which sought to introduce the child production notice. However, he listened to our comments, and came back during the recess and at the start of the new session with constructive suggestions. Until last Wednesday and Thursday he was prepared to discuss with us at great length the circumstances surrounding the child assessment orders. Indeed, he was so reasonable that when he had a visitor from America, the actor Charlton Heston, he was able to bring along Mr. Heston, who has played God in the movies on a number of occasions, and introduce him to members of the Committee. I was disappointed that the all-party nature of the Bill was broken when Charlton Heston was introduced to Conservative Members and not to the Opposition. However, despite that minor circumstance, the Committee proceeded in an all-party fashion.<br/>
When the matter was brought before the House last Monday, it was agreed that Members on both sides of the House should co-operate as best as they could in deciding on the many Government amendments. Some people may

regard the fact that the Government tabled more than 400 amendments as a sign of weakness. I do not believe that that was the case. I think that it was a sign that those who drafted the Bill and were responsible for the conduct of the Bill were concerned to ensure that the Bill was perfect, simply because we have waited more than 100 years for this radical piece of legislation. The last time that child care law was reviewed to such an extent was more than 100 years ago.<br/>
The Bill is a radical measure. It seeks to repeal completely six existing statutes including landmark legislation such as the Children Act 1975. It amends 30 other pieces of legislation&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>Yes, it is. My hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East (Mr. Vaz) is more interested than many others in the Children Bill, as he has demonstrated several times during the consideration of the Bill. Because he has reservations about the Bill&#x2014;we have discussed it&#x2014;he wants to know who is to pilot it through its latter stages. We all want to know. If the Secretary of State for Health has been shifted, there may be consequential changes for those who have piloted the Children Bill. I want to know from the Secretary of State for Health whether he is still in charge.</p>

<p>Will the Secretary of State for Health nod from a sedentary position to indicate whether the Minister for Health will remain in charge of the Bill? I am inviting him to intervene, but he does not wish to do so. I see that he is giggling. The Secretary of State is such a charming person. He was described by my hon. Friend the Member


for Monklands,West (Mr. Clarke) as "Mr. Nice"&#x2014;or was it "Mr. Nasty"? I cannot remember the description. I assume that the hon. and learned Gentleman will remain in charge of the Bill.<br/>
The Bill was designed radically to reform the law on child care. It aims to replace six statutes and amend 30 others.<br/>
One of the features of the Bill when it was introduced by the Lord Chancellor in another place was the desire to ensure that it is enacted on a fixed date&#x2014;1 April 1991. Those involved with child care matters were concerned about the large amount of legislation which had been passed by the House, some of it on an all-party basis, but which had not been brought into effect. Many of the provisions of the Children Act 1975, which was regarded as landmark legislation, have never been brought into effect, and because of the Children Bill they will never be brought into effect. It is important to remember the Lord Chancellor's explanation that when the Bill becomes law it should take effect immediately.<br/>
Last week, we had meetings with the Minister for Health and his officials to discuss the crucial rights of social workers to intervene in child care proceedings. With the assistance of the Family Rights Group&#x2014;I place on record my gratitude for its assistance&#x2014;I drafted new clause 5, which aimed to change the way in which social workers notify parents of their concerns. My proposal for a child production notice and the Minister's proposal for a child assessment order were discussed at half-past nine last Wednesday in the Cathedral room at the Department of Health. Twenty four hours later, in keeping with the way in which the Minister had approached the Bill, we again discussed with officials the possibility of limiting the amount of time for which the child assessment order should continue. The Minister was prepared to reduce the period of the child assessment order from 14 days to seven.<br/>
At that stage, hon. Members registered their first concerns that we were not to be given the full two days to discuss the Bill. One of the reasons why I and other Labour Members who served on the Committee were so co-operative with the Minister and did not speak unnecessarily in Committee was the promise that we would have much time to discuss the Bill on Report.<br/>
In Committee,we had lengthy discussions on a new clause moved by the hon. Member for Stockton, South (Mr. Devlin), who is not present, which introduced proposals for a family court. I was pleased to second the proposal because I believed that it was an all-party issue. We took an entire sitting of the Committee to discuss it. We did not press it to a Division because we wanted to consider on Report whether we had had sufficient time to convince the Government of the need for family courts. That is why, when we discussed the allocation of time with the Minister last week, we wanted the two full days that we were promised.<br/>
The hon. Member for Batley and Spen (Mrs. Peacock) said that she did not believe that it was right for the two days to be curtailed. At that stage&#x2014;looking back, it was probably appropriate&#x2014;the Opposition decided to hold a debate on the economy. Although hon. Members believed that it was necessary to discuss the Children Bill for a full day on Monday and a full day on Tuesday, we accepted the need to discuss the economy. Therefore, we did not

dissent from the fact that a large chunk of Tuesday would be spent discussing the economy, and as a result of the resignation of the Chancellor today that seems to have been an appropriate decision.<br/>
We were told that the second discussion on the Children Bill would begin at 10 o'clock on Tuesday evening and continue until 2 am on Wednesday. We were happy to agree to that. Indeed, when I spoke to new clause 1 on Monday evening, I ensured that I kept my remarks to a minimum to enable other clauses to be debated at length. I further ensured that there was no dispute about the way in which we proceeded.<br/>
Labour Membersdid not oppose the proposal for child assessment orders, although there were differences among us about how best to proceed, because we did not believe that it would be helpful to do so. I could have pressed a vote on new clause 5. Indeed, I raised a point of order with Mr. Speaker and asked him to call a Division on new clause 5. He said that he did not feel that that was appropriate because the matter had been dealt with by the House agreeing to new clause 13. I did not press the matter to a vote because we had to discuss the 400 amendments introduced by the Government and because it was necessary to prepare for the debate, which was ably and eloquently dealt with by my hon. Friend the Member for Durham, North-West (Ms. Armstrong).<br/>
Other hon.Members came into the Chamber to take part in the debate. My hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) raised the issue of transracial adoptions and gave us the benefit of his personal experience. Other hon. Members took part in the debate and raised issues which concerned them. My hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore (Mr. Powell) and others were concerned about grandparents' rights, which is an important issue. Grandparents were left out when representations and rights were allocated under the Children Act 1975.<br/>
Before I became an hon. Member, I worked as a senior solicitor for the London borough of Islington. My entire case-load was concerned with child care work. One of the reasons why we decided not to institute proceedings in the juvenile court under the Child Care Act 1980 or the Children and Young Persons Act 1969 but instead to ward children who came within those categories in Islington was that we believed that it was extremely important for grandparents&#x2014;as interested parties concerned about their grandchildren, and who in many cases looked after them and gave them parental support&#x2014;to be able to appear before the High Court in wardship proceedings, declare their interests and submit affidavit evidence. That is why I and so many other solicitors in local authorities in London and throughout the country decided to ward. We believed that the High Court was a much better and safer venue to deal with such cases.<br/>
Many of my concerns about wardship were met by the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore. I was ready late on Tuesday night to debate grandparents' rights. Labour Members decided to place the arguments before the Minister in the hope that he would take on board our constructive comments and continue in the same spirit in which he began the Bill&#x2014;a spirit of compromise and reasonableness. We were not able to do that.<br/>
In an intervention during the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield, the Minister raised his concerns about the activities of the miners group, or


whatever it is called. The Children Bill was so important that we were prepared to sit all night on Tuesday and into the early hours of Wednesday to resolve the matter. My hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, West (Mr. Madden), who has an interest in grandparents' rights, raised this issue. I have re-read his contribution on Second Reading in April this year. The issue was one of the first matters that he raised with the Minister of State.</p>

<p>Does my hon. Friend agree that it would have been necessary for us to sit all through the night to provide the time for debate that was originally agreed&#x2014;the second of two days? It was only the intervention of an important economic debate, which we initiated and which appears even more important now in the light of present circumstances, that produced a debate on the Children Bill after 10 o'clock, which by virtue of two Divisions meant 10.30 pm. In effect, the Government curtailed debate shortly after the second day of consideration had begun. If we had started at the usual time of half-past 4 or 5 o'clock, that action would have been equivalent to the Government curtailing the debate at, say, 7 or 7.30, which is patently absurd.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend is right. We were prepared to discuss this important measure. Many hon. Members had decided to drive into Westminster that evening. My hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, South-East (Mr. Nellist) told me that he did so because he wanted to raise a number of points. It was no secret that our deliberations were to start at 10 o'clock and go on until 2 o'clock in the morning.<br/>
I was surprised when the Minister of State rose in his place and moved that the House should adjourn. I do not think that he wanted to do that. Judging by his handling of the Bill, I believe that he would have liked to proceed. It was not a matter of the hon. Gentleman wanting to get back home. I have lived in Richmond, which adjoins Putney. It takes about 20 minutes to get to Richmond, and I am sure that it takes the hon. Gentleman a similar time to return to his constituency. I believe that he would have liked to continue the discussion, but he is not responsible. He is not yet Leader of the House, although he may be by the end of my speech, so he is not responsible for the way in which the business of the House is managed. The Opposition do not hold him responsible for what happened.<br/>
The Opposition were prepared to continue the debate because of the amendments that had been tabled. The House should know about the contribution of the voluntary sector to the passage of the Children Bill. We want it to reach the statute book. I wish that the Minister had accepted my amendment rather than proceeded with the child assessment order, but I accept the decision of the House. As one who has practised law, I feel that it is vital to codify child care law and that, instead of the piecemeal law which has existed for more than a century, there should be one definitive statute to which we and parents can go to find out what the law is. We have a legal duty and a moral responsibility to ensure that the Bill reaches the statute book. We were prepared to sit throughout Tuesday night, into the early hours of Wednesday morning, through lunchtime and into the afternoon to ensure that the Bill was saved. The voluntary sector believed that that was necessary.<br/>
As Ministers know, ever since the Lord Chancellor introduced the Bill in the other place, voluntary

organisations have been writing to him, his officials and members of the Committee about the operation of child care law.</p>

<p>I appreciate what my hon. Friend says about the Minister's co-operation on the whole Bill. Were any reasons given to my hon. Friend or other members of the Committee as to why the Government wanted to pull stumps at that time in the morning, when the Opposition had offered to debate the whole Bill? The 400-odd Government amendments and other issues which we wanted to raise could have been given a full, open debate. Instead, the Government are trying through the guillotine motion to curtail discussions on certain items on which most of us would like to contribute if there is time.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend was here. I paid tribute to him for his work on the grandparent amendments. The Minister of State gave no reason why the debate had to be adjourned. In his intervention during the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield, he said that he did not feel that it was proper for the debate on the Children Bill to proceed while many Divisions were being forced on largely technical amendments. The hon. Gentleman may not have felt that that was an appropriate way to proceed, but the way in which the Government are proceeding now is much worse. What a squalid way to end this landmark piece of legislation. What an appalling way to treat such an important statute. This is not the proper way to proceed on a measure on which there is consensus and to which many people have been waiting many years to contribute.<br/>
Before every Committee sitting we met representatives of the voluntary sector, including the Family Rights Group, the Children's Legal Centre, the British Agencies for Adoption and Fostering and the British Association of Social Workers. The Minister and his officials made a great effort and took much time to ensure that they had the support of the Association of Directors of Social Services and the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children before introducing the new clause on the child assessment order.<br/>
I vividly remember the Minister coming before the Committee in the middle of a sitting with a piece of paper and stating that at last the war between the ADSS and the NSPCC about the idea of a child assessment order was over and they were happy with it. Those organisations&#x2014;two of the most powerful agencies dealing with child work&#x2014;wrote to us saying that a compromise had been reached. Because of that news, the sitting was adjourned.<br/>
Groups such as the well-respected Family Rights Group, which is located in Islington, and the Children's Legal Centre, which had prepared an enormous amount of work through briefing materials and amendments, need to be carried with us. If they know, as the country now knows, that the Government wish to proceed on this historic measure in this squalid way, they will be bitterly disappointed that, after all the concessions and co-operation achieved in the past, this is how it ends.<br/>
The hon. Member for Stockton, South (Mr. Devlin) has joined us. I do not know whether during his absence he has issued another press release. During my speech, he made some comments from a sedentary position.</p>

<p>I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way, because I always enjoy interrupting his speeches. He has said that this is a squalid way to conduct matters. If a guillotine were not imposed on the Bill now, would not the legislation fall at the end of the Session? When I was here last night, the hon. Gentleman said that he was prepared for this important legislation to be carried over into the new Session. He knows as well as I know that many voluntary bodies which have been briefing him and me during the Bill's passage in Committee have been anxious to ensure that the Bill reaches the statute book and is implemented as soon as possible. It is a sad turnaround that the Labour party is prepared to sell this Bill down the river in pursuit of narrow mining interests.</p>

<p>That is the ultimate cheek, coming from the hon. Member for Stockton, South who was not present during the second, late sitting on the Children Bill. The hon. Member told me that he stayed for the Division on child registration fees and then went home because he did not believe that there was anything of importance left to discuss, despite the fact that we have all these amendments to consider. It is a cheek to come to this House, having issued a press release which received a lot of coverage in <i>The Times</i> criticising the Labour Opposition for what they had done.<br/>
I am sorry if this is beginning to sound like a mutual admiration society&#x2014;I assure the House that it will last only for the duration of the Children Bill&#x2014;but I must again commend the Minister, who was brave enough to repudiate the words of the hon. Member for Stockton, South and issue a denial that any Opposition member of the Committee was responsible for the delay.</p>

<p>It is clear from <i>Hansard</i> that, during that evening's proceedings, an agreement that had been reached was broken. It had not been intended that there would be any further Divisions that evening. That was accepted on both sides of the House. Then a group of Labour Members came to the House, forced a Division in which no Labour Member voted, and subsequently claimed that they had not spoken and had had nothing to do with it. Yet it was quite clear from the atmosphere in the House at the time that that group of hon. Members intended to continue to force Divisions on matters which, until that time, had not been in any way controversial.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Stockton, South must have bionic sight as he talks about the mood of the House at 1.30 am on Wednesday, when he was not even here but in bed at the Barbican, or wherever his flat is. He could not possibly know the mood of the House. It is no wonder that his colleagues refer to him as the Peter Bruinvels of the current Session. He is not able to be present for the debate but apparently he has no need to take part to judge the mood. What an extraordinary person he must be&#x2014;although he is away from the House he knows its mood and what agreements have been reached.<br/>
Yes, there was an agreement that this issue should be dealt with by 2 am this morning, but because of the passionate debates which had occurred earlier, and because the debate on registration charges went on a little longer than anticipated, the debates proceeded more slowly than had been intended.<br/>
The hon. Member cited the support of the voluntary sector. Of course the voluntary sector wants the Bill to become law. Of course we want it on the statute hook. If the hon. Gentleman had been here at the start of my speech he would have known what I said&#x2014;that we want the Bill to become law as soon as possible. If the hon. Member for Stockton, South has read the Bill&#x2014;perhaps that is what he is doing now&#x2014;he will know that the date for its implementation is 1 April 1991, so it will make no difference if it is introduced in the new Session. Members have come to the House to confuse the public by talking about the new Session as though it were 100 years away. As far as I know, prorogation is between 15 and 22 November, which is only a week. If the Government believe that the Bill needs to be considered carefully, it is important that we should take time to ensure that we discuss the amendments in detail.</p>

Members went into the Division Lobby to ensure that the House did not adjourn. I was happy to stay late last night because I had a petition to present and therefore had to be here.<br/>
The hon. Member for Stockton, South talked about the wishes of the voluntary sector. I believe that the voluntary sector wants us to get this Bill right and to take a great deal of time debating and analysing the amendments which have been put forward, quite properly, by the Minister. The voluntary sector believes that it will be a long time before Parliament will find the time and political will to debate these issues again, because we have waited until the very end of this Government's term of office to consider legislation covering children. It is a sign of the fact that it is not given a high priority. If it were, we should have been discussing it in 1979, rather than at this stage.<br/>
A Labour Government will clearly be elected at the next general election and will wish to ensure that time is made available, but I am worried that there will be so many other pieces of legislation that we shall have to implement that the children issue and the area of social policy concerning children may not come back again. I assure the Minister that when we come back to new clause 13 the new Labour Government will amend that provision fairly swiftly.<br/>
The voluntary sector wants to ensure that the Bill is a good Bill and that all the technical difficulties have been sorted out. A short delay at the final stage would not go amiss. As the hon. Member for Stockton, South knows, the Minister of State was in negotiation with Labour Members and others in Committee. His officials had emergency meetings with the Association of Directors of

Social Services and the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children last Thursday evening to get through the provision on the child assessment order. Had we waited another week, the period of seven days for child assessment orders might have come down to three days as a result of the negotiations taking place. A short delay might well have been in order.<br/>
The hon. Member for Stockton, South says that the House will have to introduce a carry-over motion. I do not know what a carry-over motion is, but I accept that the hon. Gentleman has read the necessary documents. I am sure that the Leader of the House and the shadow Leader of the House, my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson), could come to some arrangement to enable us to agree a carry-over motion so that the Bill could be dealt with after the new Session begins.<br/>
We must bear in mind our long wait for the Bill and the fact that it will not even come into effect until 1 April 1991, because many of its provisions need to be the subject of scrutiny by local authorities and many of the provisions concerning legal proceedings and the amendments introduced by the Solicitor-General require rules of court. It is not possible to implement the Children Bill unless the rules of court have been sorted out.<br/>
The hon. Member for Stockton, South, as a lawyer, will remember that those points were raised in Committee when we discussed the need to have the Government's proposals brought before the Committee so that we could discuss issues such as the time necessary for the local authority to serve a notice on parents. We had a discussion on time limits. When I pressed the Minister in Committee on why he had suggested a period of 72 hours as the necessary time for a parent to challenge an emergency protection order, he said that he had to come to some decision on time. He had decided on 72 hours because it was a reasonable time and he believed that it gave parents a reasonable chance to challenge the order that was to be made. He then went on to promise me and the other members of the Committee that rules of court would be made. That shows that there is plenty of time to decide on the necessary rules of court and plenty of time in which to conduct negotiations on the most appropriate time available.</p>

<p>It is important to clear up this matter. As I understand it, there is no way in which there could be a carry-over motion. There is no question of the Bill being able to go into the next Session. If we do not get it now, we shall not get it at all. I think that you, Madam Deputy Speaker, can confirm that no carry-over motion is possible. Either we get the Bill this Session, or it is lost.</p>

<p>That is the case. I refer the House to the proposal for suspending or resuming Bills.

There is no mechanism by which there can be a carry-over motion for a public Bill. It is up to the Government to get their Bill through during this Session.</p>

<p>I am grateful for the facts that you have given, Madam Deputy Speaker, and to the Clerk for researching the point. In view of that, I urge the Government to look at the business of the House until 15 November. We now know when the Queen's Speech will be, so we can decide on our priorities. If the Children Bill is a priority, as I believe it is, it is necesary to remove some of the other pieces of legislation proposed for the next three weeks. I suggest the Football Spectators Bill, for example. I was a member of the Committee on that Bill and I believe that if the Minister spoke to his hon. Friend the Minister for Sport and suggested that the Bill should wait until the new Session, when we have the Taylor report, the Children Bill could be debated for the whole of Friday, which would give us sufficient time.<br/>
It is important that we hear the Minister's response. However, I want to mention one point that will be discussed tomorrow because, unfortunately, I shall not be able to be in the House tomorrow afternoon to make the point then. We need a discussion on wardship. The Minister of State has said often that he accepts the advice given by the NSPCC. Its advice at present is that clause 84 should be amended and that the Government should delay the implementation of the wardship provisions. The Opposition, the NSPCC and other voluntary organisations do not believe that wardship should be curtailed. I urge the Minister to consider that point.<br/>
This is a squalid way to end a Bill of such importance, but there is a way out. I accept the guidance that you have given, Madam Deputy Speaker, and I ask the Government and the Minister, in all honesty, to find the extra time that we need next week to discuss the Children Bill. It is a very important piece of legislation and it is unlikely that we shall return to consider this area of law for many decades to come.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) in his opening speech this afternoon described the situation as a shambles. Subsequent events perhaps have rather dwarfed this debate and given it an element of anticlimax, but they do not alter the fact that we are discussing the chaotic position of the Government's legislation. I would wager that what the Prime Minister said at Kuala Lumpur

was a model of diplomacy compared with what she said to her Leader of the House and her Chief Whip when she returned to London yesterday.<br/>
I recall an item in, of all newspapers, one much liked by Conservative Members&#x2014;<i>The Sun</i>&#x2014;which said five years ago:
<q>Come home, Maggie. Rarely can any bunch of Government Ministers have presented such a spectacle of bungling, pathetic incompetence as was unveiled at Westminster yesterday.</q>
<q>At the centre of this comedy of errors&#x2014;or, more accurately, tragedy of errors&#x2014;was the hapless Sir Geoffrey Howe&#x2026;Has someone stolen his political judgment, or his political instincts?</q>
Although that was written five years ago, it could have been rerun this morning and it would have been absolutely relevant.<br/>
But what happened last night at midnight? The Leader of the House recovered his diplomatic touch. He crept in here when he thought that no one would notice and at a stroke destroyed the links and the channels between the Opposition and the Government. He abandoned them unilaterally and arbitrarily. He came with a statement about which he had not warned us and he introduced not one but two guillotines about which he had not told us. All that was done without warning and without discussion. His actions were arbitrary and unilateral&#x2014;exactly the same as those that he pursued at GCHQ when he tore up existing agreements.<br/>
The right hon. and learned Gentleman skulked in here and launched on the House his double-bladed guillotine. His timing was superlative. We are in the final two weeks of the Session and the date for the one state opening of Parliament has been set. This is the time that the Government most need the co-operation of the Opposition, but the right hon. and learned Gentleman managed to destroy it. If we now echoed what he did to us last night, the Government would already be dismantling the arrangements for the State opening of Parliament.<br/>
The Prime Minister must dread going away&#x2014;that is even more apposite in view of today's events. I have a cartoon with me from the <i>Sunday Express</i> which appeared five years ago at the same time as the quote that I read from <i>The Sun.</i> It shows two monks carrying candles in some vaults peering into a barrel and saying:
<q>You can't hide here for long, Sir Geoffrey. She'll get you sooner or later now she's back".</q>
She got him just before midnight last night and we are now debating the consequences. At least we should give the man credit. He has beeen in the job for three months and he is already in the record books. In this one Session of Parliament eight guillotines have been introduced. Today, when we complained about lack of time, the right hon. and learned Gentleman had the impudence to suggest that we should guillotine the two guillotines by not taking the full three hours to debate the motion.<br/>
I do not blame the Minister for Health. I have been impressed by the good will he has engendered on our Benches. The biggest obstacle to both Bills has been the Government, not the Opposition. The problem is not just the number of amendments tabled, but their sheer complexity and intricacy. The Children Bill attracted 38 pages of amendments and the Companies Bill 99 pages. The Government then complain that we wasted 15 minutes on what they considered an unnecessary vote.<br/>
By the time we finished at 11.26 pm on Monday, we had dealt with 293 amendments and new clauses to the


Children Bill&#x2014;288 of which had been tabled by the Government. The following night, however, at 1.30 am, well before any agreed deadline, the Minister moved the adjournment of the debate. We voted against that and a study of the vote shows that only 110 Tory Members voted, among whom there were only 19 Ministers or Whips. The debate was adjourned because the Leader of the House and the Chief Whip panicked. They were afraid that they would not be able to muster 100 Tory Members to vote and, despite our willingness to continue, they ended the debate. The sole excuse that they could offer was that we had dared to have one vote&#x2014;there were not attendant speeches&#x2014;which took up 15 minutes on an item which the Government considered did not warrant a vote. That is a measure of the indictment against us.</p>

<p>I have little time available to me. The hon. Gentleman has already made his speech. Earlier, I wondered whether I should interject in his interjection.<br/>
The Government have also complained about the Companies Bill, but who came here with a statement that lasted an hour and a quarter before we started our deliberations on that Bill? We did not do that&#x2014;they did. Who tabled 300 amendments on the day of the debate? Not us. The Government should not pretend that the Opposition are responsible for the chaos, as they made the Bill up as they went along. On the last day of our deliberations in Committee, the Minister tabled 15 new clauses. In effect, those new clauses represented a new Financial Services Bill, but the Opposition were not given time to debate them. The Companies Bill is such a masterpiece of the draftsman's art that the Government have moved 1,100 amendments altogether&#x2014;400 in the Lords, 400 in Committee and 300 yesterday. Now 700 of those amendments must go back to the Lords, so we shall start the process all over again. It is the Government, not the Opposition, who have sabotaged the Bill. They have drowned it in amendments.<br/>
I accept that much of the responsibility rests with the Chief Whip and perhaps with Ministers rather than with the Leader of the House. When the Prime Minister appointed the right hon. and learned Gentleman, she might have felt that she now had a winning team in charge of Government business. I am afraid that she must have a poor memory. What a Session the next one promises to be if the right hon. and learned Gentleman remains in post.<br/>
The right hon. and learned Gentleman's credentials are exciting and, five years ago, they were noted by the newspapers. The <i>Daily Telegraph,</i> no great supporter of us, ran the headline:
<q>Howe centre of Tory disarray</q>
<i>The Guardian</i> carried the headline:
<q>The disaster zone around Geoffrey Howe".</q>
<i>The Sun</i> noted:
<q>Fury as Howe slips up again".</q>
The Daily Mirror ran the headline, "Howe blunder", the <i>Sunday Mirror</i> spoke of a "Whitehall farce" and the main headline in <i>The Times</i>read, "Embarrassed Howe". My favourite headline is one that appeared on the front page of the <i>Daily Mirror.</i> It showed a photograph of the right hon. and learned Gentleman as though standing on his head and the headline ran:
<q>Dear Sir Geoffrey&#x2026;Have you ever had one of those weeks when nothing goes right?</q>

That takes us back to where we started when I quoted from <i>The Sun.</i> The <i>Daily Mirror</i> should rerun that headline tomorrow as it is every bit as relevant today as it was five years ago.<br/>
We do not yet know what the right hon. and learned Gentleman will be doing in the next Session, but let us remember that the man who helped to create this mess is the man who sank the economy in one Budget. He is the man who bungled the GCHQ sackings so badly that he gave the Government the worst three days of headlines that they have ever had&#x2014;until, I suspect, the three days that are about to come. This is the man who will be in charge of the business of the House&#x2014;we think&#x2014;for the next 12 months. It promises to be an exciting year for me.<br/>
Last night, the right hon. and learned Gentleman demonstrated his fine touch. I look forward to the new Session, assuming that the right hon. and learned Gentleman is not in charge of a nuclear power station in the Outer Hebrides.</p>

<p>If a week is a long time in politics, I have found that three hours is equally long. I appreciate that some of the interest in this debate may have dissipated during its course. I congratulate all of those who, notwithstanding the eruptions around them, nevertheless sought to keep their eye on the ball. I shall seek to follow in that noble tradition, although I shall not criticise the House if, on this occasion, hon. Members find other matters more compelling than my oratory to talk about. I shall do my best to play out elegantly the time remaining in the debate.<br/>
We agree about a lot of things this evening, not least that it is important that the Children Bill should go on the statute book. Far too much work has been done on the Bill for it to be lost. I am grateful that the co-operation across the Chamber on this Bill has been recognised. Such recognition is always the first thing to go out of the window when things get tough. There has been genuine co-operation on the Bill. I have no complaint against the hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) or the hon. Member for Durham, North-West (Ms. Armstrong), who have worked extremely hard on the Bill. They were supported by an able team in Committee. I believe that the Bill, as it emerged from Committee, is stronger for the careful consideration it was given during 17 sittings.<br/>
I believe, however, that there was something missing from the speech of the right hon. Member for Swansea, West (Mr. Williams). He did not recognise the new factor that entered into our discussions at 10.30 pm on Tuesday. We had arranged for the Children Bill to pass into law. However, an unnecessary Division was called by two hon. Members. Whatever other involvements they have in this House&#x2014;and both are active hon. Members&#x2014;neither had been active in our deliberations on the Children Bill. They were plainly activated by a grievance other than any objections to the inoffensive technical amendment under consideration. Both the hon. Members for Monklands, West and for Middlesbrough (Mr. Bell) candidly acknowledged that the dispute was about the Associated British Ports Bill and said that it was likely that several Divisions would be called&#x2014;not because of any objections to what was being proposed by the Government, but simply to advance that grievance.<br/>
That is a parliamentary tactic for which there are precedents. However, one parliamentary tactic may be met by another kind of parliamentary tactic and the tactic now being deployed is that of confining the debate. It is being done for three reasons. Once we move from the necessary battle lines that have to be drawn in the artificial huff and puff that has characterised the past three hours&#x2014;fun though it has been for all kinds of reasons&#x2014;I imagine that we can agree about those three things.<br/>
First, the Bill is necessary. It has been a good thing that, in the course of a busy Session, it has proved possible to find the time for a Bill that could easily have been squeezed out by other more contentious measures. As the hon. Member for Leicester, East (Mr. Vaz) eloquently said, we will not have the chance to return to this issue for quite some time, and we cannot afford to lose the Bill. It must become law.<br/>
Secondly, we have to acknowledge the price that has had to be paid. First, there is the care and skill that the parliamentary draftsmen have brought to bear on the legislation. Secondly, as changes have been made in deference to the wishes of the House, the Bill needs to be further considered in the Lords. It is therefore necessary that the Bill is delivered to the other place in good time to allow that consideration to take place. It cannot be left hanging around any more than can the Companies Bill.<br/>
Thirdly&#x2014;this point is highly relevant&#x2014;there was an arrangement through the usual channels that the Bill must be completed, notwithstanding the amount of time that had been eaten into as a result of the emergency motion on the economy on Tuesday. Perhaps Friday should have been chosen for that debate, but there we are, it happened on Tuesday. Indeed, we know that the Bill's passage could have been completed already if common sense had prevailed among hon. Members throughout the House.<br/>
Notwithstanding the fact that it has been necessary to curtail our debate on the Bill, we still have three hours of debate tomorrow. That is actually more than the time that it was originally envisaged that the Bill would take to complete once the last contentious piece of business had been disposed of. There would also have been plenty of time for the Companies Bill to be further considered tonight if it had not been for the point that was argued at length in the House yesterday evening, which in itself was not contentious.<br/>
It has been suggested that there was some doubt about whether it would have been possible for us to complete our progress on the Children Bill. There was also some doubt about whether the Government could move as they did. Any doubt that might have existed about whether progress was possible must surely have been washed away by what happened in the House last night when some of the following exchanges took place&#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i></p>

<p>I know that the House remains riveted by the problems of the Companies Bill. I remind hon. Members that at the bottom of page 4 clause 2 contains the words.
<q>in the case of a company incorporated after the commencement of that Part, the last day of the month in which the anniversary of its incorporation falls.</q>
A deeply radical and searching amendment of the utmost controversy was tabled in which it was suggested that the

word "Part" should be removed and the word "Section" be inserted. One might have assumed that that would pass relatively unnoticed, but no. It caused a Division that took 20 minutes of parliamentary time. Then, lo and behold, if we move on to clause 4(2), we find that it states:
<q>Schedule 4 to the Companies Act 1985&#x2026;is amended in accordance with Schedule 1.</q>
Again, a deeply damaging amendment was tabled by the Government that would have added the words "to this Act" to the end of that sentence, yet notwithstanding the relative inoffensiveness of those words a Division was forced.<br/>
It was perfectly obvious that, whatever else was motivating hon. Members last night. it was not a deep concern about improving the Companies Bill. That was made abundantly clear by the fact that the Tellers for those Divisions were not the official Opposition Tellers, but were from the group concerned about the Associated British Ports Bill.<br/>
There are many precedents for guillotines in the House. Indeed, on one famous occasion the right hon. Member for Blaenau Gwent (Mr. Foot) managed to bring five guillotines to the House in one evening. When pressed about that in a debate last year, he said:
<q>Those five guillotines were introduced on 20 July. That is quite late in the Session. If we had not had the guillotine motions, all those five measures would have been destroyed. There is not the slightest doubt about that."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 22 February 1988; Vol. 128, c. 39.]</q>
From that impeccable parliamentary source has come the reason for tonight's guillotine.</p>

<p>With permission, Mr. Speaker, I wish to make a brief statement to the House. As the House will be aware, my right hon. Friend the Member for Blaby (Mr. Lawson) has resigned as Chancellor of the Exchequer. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister learned of his intention to resign just before 2.30, immediately before she went over to the House to prepare for Questions and her statement on the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting. In the course of a subsequent conversation between them following her return to No. 10 Downing street, the Prime Minister was unable to dissuade my right hon. Friend. The decision was therefore announced at about 6 pm and the letters that have been exchanged have since been published.<br/>
My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has decided to appoint my right hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Major) as Chancellor of the Exchequer, my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Hurd) as Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Waddington) as Secretary of State for the Home Department. There is no change in the successful economic policies&#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i>&#x2014;that the Government have pursued in the past and will continue to pursue in the future. In due course the House will no doubt wish to return to the business on which we have just been voting.</p>

<p>I thank the deputy Prime Minister for his statement. The Chancellor's resignation clearly resulted from the Prime

Minister's high-handed, intolerable and disloyal treatment of Cabinet colleagues. Her subsequent decision to shift the newly appointed Foreign Secretary to be the new Chancellor showed a great office of state being cast off and passed around like an old coat. It undermines confidence in the Prime Minister's claim to be fit to conduct the nation's affairs. More important, it may undermine confidence in our economy, our currency and our country.<br/>
The underlying problems of the economy cannot swiftly be resolved, but changes in the personalities involved will not restore confidence. Changes in policy are required. It is imperative that, at the earliest opportunity, the Government put before the House their proposals to deal with the deepening economic crisis which they have ignored for far too long. The Government must answer to the House. In so doing, they will answer to the people of this country. Tonight, our people, all our people, must wonder what lies ahead for their homes, their jobs, their families and their future. They have already paid too high a price for the consequences of public squabbles between the highest in the land. The Prime Minister must accept responsibility for what has happened. She must answer to the House and to the country, and she must answer soon.</p>

<p>Will my right hon. and learned Friend take it from me that we on this side of the House very much regret the resignation of the Chancellor of the Exchequer? May I press my right hon. and learned Friend to take no notice of the obvious glee with which the Opposition received that news, culminating in the singing of "The Red Flag"? Does he agree that the basic economy of the country is still sound despite the resignation? We welcome my right hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Major) to his job as the new Chancellor of the Exchequer, because we know that the sound policies that the Government have pursued over the years will continue. Consequently, there is no necessity for the City or the markets to get panicky.</p>

<p>I join my hon. Friend in paying tribute to the long and magnificent service to the Government and the country given by our right hon. Friend the Member for Blaby. I join him also in expressing confidence in his successor, our right hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon. I shall respond to the shadow Leader of the House by saying that the reasons for the changes are exactly as stated in the letters of integrity exchanged between my right hon. Friends. The economic policies of the Government will remain unchanged, effective and sensible, exactly as set out by my hon. Friend. The one thing that will enable the people of the country to continue to sleep soundly is the certainty that there is no prospect of our economic policies being replaced by those of the Opposition.</p>

<p>I suspect that many hon. Members feel a good deal of sympathy for the right hon. Member for Blaby (Mr. Lawson) whose job has been made impossible, whose position has been made untenable and who has taken the only honourable course open to him. Does the Leader of the House not realise that what is at stake is not the position of the Chancellor of the Exchequer but the integrity of the Government and of a Prime Minister who has shown herself to be arrogant, dictatorial and isolated? We have been told for the last 10 years that there is no alternative. There is an alternative. She must go.</p>

<p>Does my right hon. and learned Friend accept that, in what might have been for him the difficult moment of making his statement, he had the great advantage of the hon.

Will he take it from the House, from all of us I believe, that we wish my right hon. Friend the Member for Blaby (Mr. Lawson) well in whatever activities he engages in ? <i>[Interruption.]</i> At least we on this side of the House appreciate the work that he has done. Will my right hon. and learned Friend also convey our best wishes to those who have now taken over the heavy burdens of high office that he listed in his statement?

<p>As is clear from the statement that I have made, my right hon.

There will be ample opportunities for discussion of these matters in the days, weeks and months ahead-opportunities that the Opposition have available to them in the ordinary way.

Secondly, given the sequence of events, can he confirm that, as Sir Alan Walters resigned out of "shock" on hearing of the resignation of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and despite the Chancellor of the Exchequer's threat of resignation and its effect on the pound, Sir Alan was never asked for his advice, consulted or informed before the Chancellor of the Exchequer was allowed to go?

Only two of them were prepared to turn up to hear him.<br/>
There is no doubt that the Prime Minister has been wanting the Chancellor of the Exchequer's job and that at the same time the Chancellor of the Exchequer wanted to get out from under because of the economic mess that he and others had created.

I am grateful that we can now proceed with the Companies Bill.

Clause 6 of the Bill includes a provision re-enacting existing exemptions from disclosure of the names of certain subsidiaries and related undertakings that date back to the Companies Act 1967 introduced by the then Labour Administration.<br/>
This amendment would require a company to disclose in its accounts the fact that it had taken advantage of those exemptions from disclosure.

<p>Clause 12 introduces procedures for the revision of defective accounts. This largely replaces the present criminal offence of non-compliance with the accounting requirements of the Act. It also implements one of the recommendations of the Dearing report.<br/>
New sections 245B and 245C enable the Secretary of State, or any person to whom the Secretary of State delegates his powers, to apply to the court for an order requiring the directors of a company to prepare revised accounts. It is envisaged that this power would in practice be delegated to the review panel, a body to be set up to implement another recommendation of the Dearing report. It might also be delegated to other bodies, such as the stock exchange.<br/>
In the view of the combined consultative accounting bodies, however, if responsibility for action is divided among more than one body, there will inevitably be buck passing and inaction. For enforcement to be effective, it has to be the responsibility of only one person or body. This must be the Secretary of State. We discussed this matter at reasonable length both on Second Reading and

in Committee. Amendments Nos. 3 and 6 would ensure that the Secretary of State takes full responsibility by removing the possibility of any delegation of his powers.<br/>
New section 245B(4) enables the court to require directors who approve defective accounts to meet the cost of preparing revised accounts. Whether accounts are defective may well be a matter of opinion. Directors could find that they prepare the accounts in good faith, but that the court takes a different view from them of how the accounts should have been prepared. The costs that they would have to meet in such a case might be substantial. This would be unjust if the directors have indeed been acting in good faith.<br/>
Amendment No. 285 provides a remedy for this injustice by requiring the court, whenever it makes an order against directors to pay costs, to have regard to whether the directors involved knew or ought to have known that the accounts did not comply with the requirements of the Act. In this way, innocent non-compliance will not be punished unduly.<br/>
Amendments Nos. 3 and 6 should be dealt with together, with amendment No. 285 being dealt with separately. I should be grateful to my hon. Friend if he would respond to my points.</p>

<speech hansard_id="667056" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1989-10-26a.1134.0" hansard_membership_id="4743" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/15176" speakername="Mr. John Garrett" colnum="1134" time="20:30:00">
<p>As the hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley) explained, these amendments seek to restrict power to the Secretary of State to take a company to court to have its accounts revised if they are defective. We discussed this matter in Committee and the Opposition supported that general concept.<br/>
The Bill implements the Dearing proposals and introduces a new statutory power under civil law for certain authorised bodies or the Secretary of State to apply to the courts for an order requiring revision of accounts that do not appear to show a true and fair view.<br/>
The Dearing report suggested that the authorised bodies should be the review panel of the proposed Financial Reporting Council and the stock exchange. However, we believe that the possible exercise of such a power should be restricted to the Secretary of State. In Committee we adduced two main arguments in favour of that. First, if more than one body is responsible for applying to the courts to seek the revision of accounts there could be an argument about who is ultimately responsible for bringing such a case. The hon. Gentleman referred to that as buck passing. We think that such an arrangement makes for confusion about whose responsibility it properly is to bring such a case and it would lead to uncertainty as to which of the various bodies have the power, authority and will to require the revision of a defective set of accounts.<br/>
As was also pointed out in Committee, bringing a case against a company for the revision of its defective accounts could prove to be very expensive, especially if the director's of the company took the case to the House of Lords&#x2014;which is what happened in the Lonrho case. The review panel's finances are likely to be limited. The stock exchange might also feel that its funds were limited in the light of its cool response to the Dearing proposals. Therefore, it is more appropriate for the Secretary of State and the Department to take upon themselves the responsibility for bringing such matters to proper redress. The chance of defective accounts would be lessened if it was known by the directors, who might otherwise let


defective accounts be published, that the Secretary of State had this power and was known to be willing to use it. In general, the hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes has the right approach to the matter.</p>

<speech hansard_id="667057" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1989-10-26a.1135.0" hansard_membership_id="168" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/3209" speakername="Mr. Redwood" colnum="1135" time="20:30:00">
<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley) and to the hon. Member for Norwich, South (Mr. Garrett) for the way in which they have put forward their ideas. I recommend that we accept amendment No. 285. There is a problem which that amendment tackles well.<br/>
On amendments Nos. 3 and 6 I have more difficulties. I understand the arguments that have been put forward by hon. Members on both sides of the House but I am afraid that I am not persuaded by them. I am unconvinced that giving more power to more than one person will prove a recipe for buck passing and inaction. It is likely in practice that the Financial Reporting Council and the proposed review panel under it will be concerned only with large companies. In other cases, where the public interest dictates, it will be for the Secretary of State to take action.<br/>
The point has been made that the cost of bringing such actions will prove too great for the FRC review panel. I recognise that the financing arrangements for the new arrangements for accounting standards will need to provide adequate resources for that purpose. That will emerge in due course as Sir Ronald Dearing carries out his work.<br/>
Let me conclude by saying why the Bill is correct in its present form on those points.<br/>
For large companies the likelihood is that the review panel will be in the lead in enforcing accounting standards. A power to apply to the courts strengthens the panel's position and adds weight to its powers of persuasion.<br/>
In a wide sense we do not seek legislation to require everything to be funnelled through the Secretary of State. That would be unwelcome in the overall balance of the Dearing proposals.<br/>
Above all, it must be right at this stage, when the new institutional arrangements are not yet in place, to keep the options open. The provision in the Bill is permissive; it does not require other bodies to be authorised for this purpose.<br/>
Therefore, I ask the House to reject amendments Nos. 3 and 6.</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister for accepting amendment No. 285. In the light of his statement, I shall withdraw amendments Nos. 3 and 6. That is a vote of confidence in Sir Ronald Dearing's appointment yesterday. It would be right to allow Sir Ronald to tackle the job. A person is now in place to look at the issue. Therefore, I ask my hon. Friend to consider carefully the funding arrangements of the exercise as they are crucial to the success of the accounting standards programme.<br/>
During the recess we heard that the CBI disagreed with the funding arrangements. The accounting profession feels that they are not the right way forward. It has already been said in Committee that a levy on all companies might be a more sensible and equitable way forward. Therefore, I hope that my hon. Friend will discuss with Sir Ronald the funding arrangements in due course. In the meantime, I beg to ask leave to withdraw amendment No. 3.</p>

<p>This group of amendments concerns the consequential amendments which will have to be made to other enactments when section 389 of the Companies Act has been repealed and replaced by the provisions in part II of the Bill. Some of the amendments which need to be made are presently set down in schedule 15 to the Bill, but there is a considerable number of others. The amendments replace that schedule with a power to make all the necessary consequential amendments by regulations.<br/>
There are a number of reasons for this change in approach. As hon. Members will know, part II of the Bill will for the first time permit bodies corporate or partnerships which do not have separate legal personality to be appointed as company auditors. However, a number of the other enactments which make provision for the appointment of auditors proceed on the assumption that only individuals or partnerships with separate legal personality will be appointed. This reflects the present position under the Companies Act. In some cases, catering for the possibility that the auditors may be a body corporate or a partnership of this type will involve lengthy, if wholly technical, adjustment to the present provisions. We think this task will be better done at more leisure in the form of regulations which we will lay before the House in due course.<br/>
8.45 pm<br/>
Another reason is that we are not in a position to say definitively which other enactments need amendment. References in public Acts to section 389 and to the accountancy bodies specified in that section may of course be picked up by a computer search. But we know that there are some references in local and private Acts. Since these Acts have not been placed on a database, we cannot be sure of picking all of them up at this stage. The ability to make regulations will enable us to make the necessary provision for any references which only later come to light.<br/>
The third reason I would commend this approach to consequential amendments is that it will allow for some flexibility in later years in specifying which accountants a re to be eligible to carry out the auditing functions in other enactments. The effect of part II will be that the number of persons eligible in law to audit companies will fall. It may well also be that company auditing will become an even more specialised branch of the accountancy tree than it is at present. If that happens, one might wish not to follow the standard provision and restrict some of the functions to company auditors alone. One might wish to add certain other qualified accountants. This amendment will allow for that possibility.<br/>
I ought to mention one other amendment in this group, new clause 18. If a recognised supervisory body or one of the bodies presently recognised under section 389 were to change its name or merge with another body or otherwise be affected by a transfer of engagements, the Secretary of State would have discretion to recognise the new body. But he would not always be able to use the regulation-making power in new clause 17 to deal with the position under


other enactments since that may only be used where a consequential amendment is necessary or the provision is concerned with auditing, and not with some of the other functions with which other enactments are concerned. New clause 18 therefore enables the Secretary of State to make by regulations such amendments of enactments as appear to him to be necessary or expedient in consequence of a change of name, merger or transfer of engagement affecting accountancy bodies recognised under enactments. I should mention that this new clause is supported by the Institute of Chartered Accountants, which had expressed concern about the legal position should one of them merge with another body.</p>

<p>Will the Minister confirm that new clauses 17 and 18 are items of secondary legislation which can be enacted by negative resolution?

<p>The hon. Gentleman may well be teasing me and the House slightly. I suggest that he knows the answer to the question, but I shall give it to him again. The ground was covered in Committee, but there is no reason why it should not be covered again on Report.<br/>
In this area we are dealing with complex matters which are not yet fully resolved and may not even be fully seen yet. Therefore, the only practical way forward is to give the Secretary of State the sort of delegated powers in the new clauses and amendments and they would be dealt with by negative resolution.<br/>
That is a familiar way to deal with such matters. It would be impractical for the House to attempt to deal with such a measure by positive resolution in the kind of detail and complexity which may well arise. Business managers and Opposition Members are familiar with the negative resolution procedure, which is a satisfactory, effective and practical way of dealing with matters of such complexity. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept and understand that explanation. I think that he well understands the complexity of these matters and the importance of dealing with them in a practical and realistic way. It is for those reasons that the new clauses have been drafted in the way that they have.</p>

<p>The procedural point has been clarified, but we are still left with the substantive issues.<br/>
As the Minister has said, we are faced with considerable and rapid changes in the structure of the accountancy world. As the hon. Gentleman admitted in his short elucidatory statement, those changes make some difficulties for us, raising substantially new and different issues. He has not enlightened us about how he proposes to deal with the matters of substance contained in the new clause.<br/>
We are faced with the possibility of the issuing of regulations at a later date to deal with significant matters: the eligibility for appointment as auditors, the effect of appointing partnerships that are not legal persons and, in particular, ineligibility because of a lack of independence. I need not detain the House unduly by referring to recent events which give those matters considerable moment and significance. The Minister, however, has moved the new

clause very late in the proceedings, when we are all at a disadvantage&#x2014;and he will recognise that we are at an additional disadvantage owing to the timetable motion.<br/>
I apologise to the House for raising the matter, but it has to be raised. I feel that the Minister owes it to the House to give some indication of the substantive nature of the regulations that he proposes with regard to the three issues that I have raised, particularly that of ineligibility on the ground of lack of independence.<br/>
The matter is of considerable public interest, at a time when we are seeing the accountancy world shrink into a small number of large partnerships&#x2014;which, moreover, may change their status. It is important to the markets and to everyone concerned with such issues, and the Minister should elucidate a little more.</p>

<p>I welcome the new clause. Throughout the summer&#x2014;and, indeed, in Committee&#x2014;the Government have been talking to the requisite authorities, including the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. The new clause is the result. I assure the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins) that there is nothing sinister about it or its fellows; if anything, they enable the Government to deal with problems that might arise in the accountancy world very much more quickly and effectively. They would, in fact, deal better than any existing legislation with exactly the matters that the hon. Gentleman has raised.<br/>
The initial reason for discussion was the proposed merger between the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales and the ICA in Scotland. In the end that merger did not occur, regrettably in my view. Rationalisations will, however, take place in the accountancy world. These proposals will enable the law and the requisite protection of the consumer to continue without the need for any legislation. They will enable the existing protections of the Department of Trade and Industry to move quickly from one body to another, new body, and I believe that accountancy welcomes them. Certainly they are not easier than the regulations that have obtained in the past, but they will speed up, as well as tighten, the process of consumer protection.</p>

<p>I understand why the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins) wanted to pursue this point; however, I think that he provided the explanation in the terms in which he put his question. He conceded what we all know, and then gave examples. As he said, considerable changes are taking place in the accountancy world, and that is precisely why we have cast the new clauses and amendments as we have.<br/>
Surely the hon. Gentleman must also concede that, given that background of change and development, to attempt to set any of our proposals in concrete would be counter-productive, and might even go against the objectives that he himself has set out. I suggest that the new clause is the best way to deal effectively with the profession in the face of such a rate of change.<br/>
I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley) for adding his expert and knowledgeable comments. Following our dealings in Committee, I think we all agree that few know as much as he does about the profession, and his words of support are very welcome.<br/>
My hon. Friend mentioned that we had been careful to consult the profession. We have tried, I think successfully, to bring to the House a form of words that will provide the right framework for a modern and effective profession.</p>

The amendment takes advantage of an option in the eighth directive to the effect that, in the case of a firm that has a management body of two, member states need not require that a majority of that body be qualified. Obviously, in the case of a two-member body, a majority would mean both members, and it seems right to allow in the primary legislation for the possibility of one of them being unqualified.<br/>
Hon. Members who sat on the Committee may recall that an amendment with that intention was made to the Bill then.

<p>The amendment fulfils a commitment that I gave in Committee to my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley). It requires a recognised supervisory body to have satisfactory arrangements for taking account of costs of compliance with its rules, and any other controls to which its members are subject. An analogous requirement is placed on recognised bodies under the Financial Services Act by clause 189 of the Bill.</p>

<p>The Opposition are not happy with the amendment, which requires the recognised supervisory bodies to be set up to take costs into account in the training of their rules. It seems to imply that if it is considered too expensive to comply with the rules a less good and less effective system will be introduced.<br/>
We expressed our worries in Committee, not in relation to this amendment&#x2014;which had not yet appeared&#x2014;but in relation to a Government new clause relating to the amendments to the Financial Services Act in which the principle of cost compliance was again introduced. At that time we expressed our concern that that might mean that cost-cutting would take precedence over investor protection. The concerns that we expressed were shared by other organisations, in particular the Consumers Association, which felt that that might lead to a second-rate regulatory service for consumers and investors.<br/>
We had an interesting discussion on the matter in Committee. My hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins) talked about how those costs would be defined. He wanted to know whether they would be the direct costs of complying or the indirect costs. The former Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Corporate Affairs seemed to imply in his reply that it would be both direct and indirect costs. My hon. Friend referred also to something about which I am concerned which is the possible dangers of talking-up the costs of compliance and thereby introducing the danger of giving a convenient financial excuse for not having adequate regulation.<br/>
9 pm<br/>
The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) seemed to share some of the concerns that were expressed by the Opposition. He said that writing cost compliance into the Bill was unnecessary since those responsible would presumably seek to implement the provisions in the most cost-effective way. However, writing cost compliance into the Bill makes it seem as if costs are more important than implementing the necessary measures of regulation.<br/>
In Committee the Minister said that he would look carefully at the reservations expressed by the Opposition and such bodies as the Consumers Association. He said that he would see whether he could respond to them positively on Report. Unfortunately, the reverse seems to have happened and cost compliance has also been put forward for inclusion in this part of the Bill. Instead of removing the principle, we now see it reinforced in this amendment. I do not know whether the Minister felt strongly enough to introduce that extra reference to the principle of cost compliance or whether it was his ex-colleague, the former Under-Secretary of State, who decided that he did not agree with the reservations


expressed in Committee and wanted to reinforce the principle. Perhaps the Minister can explain exactly how that was arrived at.<br/>
I realise that it was one of the Government's supporters&#x2014;the hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley)&#x2014;who urged the Government to include a provision of this kind. In Committee the hon. Gentleman declared an interest as the parliamentary adviser to the Institute of Chartered Accountants. He said that it was the institute that instigated the idea of cost compliance at this stage of the Bill. Can the Minister tell us that the amendment is not simply being introduced in response to one sectional interest? Opposition Members would like to be assured that the Minister has consulted widely before introducing the new amendment. Perhaps he can give us details of the consultations that he has had with various interests.<br/>
In Committee the Minister's former colleague tried to assure us that the interpretation of the principle of cost compliance would not be detrimental to consumers, the regulatory system or to investor protection. He said that he felt that it would simply mean that the regulator would seek to achieve compliance with the rules in the least costly and most cost-effective way. That emphasis on cost is still open to the other interpretation, which is simply that certain measures of investor protection or regulation might not be introduced simply because of the cost involved. We are concerned that the Bill might be interpreted in that way. We feel strongly that it should not be able to be interpreted in a way which would undermine the measures to have adequate and proper regulation of auditing. For that reason, we are unhappy about the proposed change and feel inclined to oppose it.</p>

<p>The hon. Lady has rightly pointed out certain fears which may be present in the minds of those who view the clause from outside. I am happy in my conscience to state that in my view the clause is wholly reasonable because, as I said in Standing Committee, it mirrors one that has already been accepted by the House in the Financial Services Act. It merely brought into line the regulatory bodies such as the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales with the other direct regulatory bodies which exist under the Financial Services Act.<br/>
That point was aired in Standing Committee. I can do little better than to quote my hon. Friend the Minister, who said on 13 June 1989:
<q>The Government believe that it is vital that regulatory bodies pay proper regard to the direct and indirect costs of complying with the rules. It is all too easy, even for practioner-based bodies, to decide upon an approach to a regulatory problem without having assessed the cost of the various alternatives and, unless costs are properly assessed, the regulatory system risks being more burdensome than necessary."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee D,</i> 13 June 1989; c.340.]</q>
I feel strongly that the system must be cost-effective, as the hon. Lady rightly said, but it does not necessarily follow that it has to be the most costly. There has to be a balance or the whole system will collapse. We need a system that is reasonably cost-effective. We need the best system that we can get, without its imploding through too great expense.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman drew a direct analogy between the arrangements for taking into account the cost of compliance proposed here with what happened in the Financial Services Act. We are here discussing a largely self-regulatory profession which might take a different view of the costs and benefits of assiduity in controlling departures from standards from that taken by a body such as the Securities and Investments Board which acts directly on the authority of the Secretary of State under the Financial Services Act, so is the analogy entirely apt?</p>

<p>It is indeed, but the hon. Gentleman is right to raise the subject. The joint monitoring unit that I visited recently is not the poodle, the child or the creature of a regulatory body such as the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales or the other bodies to which it refers. It is a very separate unit, and therefore analogous to FIMBRA or the other bodies which are made up of individual companies sending in subscriptions, acting not only as a regulatory body but as an advocate of the particular industry.<br/>
The way in which the self-regulatory organisations have developed shows that they have a dual role. They are not cosy clubs for members of the organisations concerned, but genuine regulatory organisations which are close enough to the bodies that they represent to understand the industry and to know any wrinkles that members of those organisations might try to use to dodge regulations. The self-regulatory system is therefore the most effective that we have.<br/>
The differences between the recognised professional bodies and the self-regulatory organisations are fewer than the hon. Gentleman might think. In my view, the similarities are greater. Of course, the self-regulatory organisations were set up specifically to take up a task with the recognised professional bodies. With the exception of one, they have existed as self-regulatory bodies for many years. They are based on a system of ethics which I believe has been proven over the years. It is a cost-effective system, but the Government have nevertheless inserted a clause providing that there must be satisfactory arrangements for taking the costs into account. That is acceptable, and shows a trust that the organisations will have to maintain.<br/>
If the hon. Gentleman's fears are borne out in future, I shall support him in calling for an end to the system. At the moment, happily, I believe that we have an extremely effective system. I am grateful to the Government for having added to its confidence by the clause, which is no more than reasonable and mirrors the Financial Services Act.</p>

<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the debate, and I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, East (Ms. Quin) for kindly referring to the remarks that I made in Committee.<br/>
The debate on the amendment, and similar amendments, in Committee was inhibited by a sense of outrage among certain sections of the financial community about the apparent costs of the regulatory mechanisms set up under the Financial Services Act 1986. There was far too much of a stampede to give in to those pressures. As it has turned out, the chairman of the Securities and Investments Board has conducted himself extremely well in this matter. He has been calm, persistent in putting forward the correct


definition, and at the same time has drawn up coherent proposals to deal with the underlying concerns that people have expressed.<br/>
The debate in Committee was far too inhibited by what one may regard as the Poujadist section of the financial markets. A number of unfortunate public statements contributed to the attempted undermining of the public standing of the regulatory bodies set up under the Financial Services Act. It has transpired that because of the chairman's integrity and persistence, and because of the way in which he bent to his task and was not distracted from it by all the noises to which he was subjected, that danger has been avoided. So long as that individual holds his current position and continues to work with the people with whom he currently works, we shall have no fears in that respect.<br/>
None the less, my hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, East was right to draw the matter to our attention, because we are dealing not with regulatory bodies but with individual professional standards and performance. The only consideration should be securing the highest possible standards of personal professional repute.<br/>
There has been a train of examples of what can go wrong. Serious questions are being asked, not least in reports by inspectors of the Department of Trade and Industry. It is unfortunate that a shadow is being cast over the new bodies that will be set up and the current bodies, if they are to take over the task of regulation. The only consideration for the regulatory bodies, when exercising their regulatory powers over the individuals in their profession and the standards that they attain, must be to ensure that those standards are the highest.<br/>
The amendment is unfortunate, and before moving it the Government would have been better advised to have recovered from their temporary panic about the costs of setting up regulatory mechanisms.</p>

<p>I have been trying to understand why Labour Members are expressing concern, because I believe that they are missing the blindingly obvious. Perhaps in the wake of this evening's excitement that is understandable.<br/>
We are trying to achieve a measure of practicality and effectiveness. If we are to make the rules precisely to achieve the high standards that the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins) mentioned, it is only sensible and essential to ensure that regard is paid to their cost. We do not want to end up&#x2014;I do not think that it is a great danger, but let us ensure that it does not happen&#x2014;with an over-enthusiastic regulatory body which rushes off and seeks to lay down rules so onerous that they drive these activities out of existence.<br/>
9.15 pm<br/>
That is the answer to the hon. Member for Gateshead, East (Ms. Quin) who asked about the consumer's interest. We have an effective profession operating in the interests of the community as a whole, which includes the business community and consumers. Consumers want a profession which operates effectively, so its rules must not only be effective but must not be so onerous as to drive people out of business. My hon. Friend the Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley) ably illustrated that point.<br/>
The hon. Member for Gateshead, East asked what the costs mean. That was a slightly strange question, given the

profession that we are discussing. If she does not know what the costs mean, I cannot say with greater confidence what is meant.</p>

<p>The Minister must descend from his talent for occasional Poujadism and return to the subject of the debate. My hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, East (Ms. Quin) put a clear question to him. Does it mean direct costs, including indirect costs, or does it mean direct costs alone? That can make a considerable difference. The Minister would be better occupied using fewer knockabout tactics and applying his mind to those specific questions.</p>

<p>We are talking about professional accountants, not shopkeepers. The hon. Gentleman is in danger of getting the two confused. I shall not attempt to give a detailed answer to that question. It is not my job to set about defining the framework of costs to be taken into account. The bodies concerned will know well the kind of relevant costs involved. It would be inappropriate for me to answer, although it might be appropriate for my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond and Barnes to give us a long dissertation on the relevant costs.</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his brief invitation. The best way to regulate the investment business is to have a full-time inspector based permanently on site as an independent advisers business. That would cost so much that the independent adviser would give up doing the job. He would not bother to help the public. For chartered accountants, it would mean that a person who was professionally qualified and whose ethics were such as to lead him to concentrate not only on independence but on truth and fairness would be driven out of giving investment advice.<br/>
It cannot be in the consumer's interests for all those who currently give independent advice, especially when they are backed by a royal charter and a history of service to the public, to be driven from giving a particular service to the public purely because the costs are so great that it is not worth being in the business. That is why we need. a balance between having a regulated trade, such as one advising the public, and having costs that are reasonable in terms of providing regulation over those who practise.</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend.<br/>
I have tried to answer the Opposition's questions, and I hope that I have succeeded. As I am conscious of the passage of time and wish to ensure that we have every opportunity to consider the Bill in detail, I shall leave it at that and hope that the House will support the amendment.</p>

<p>Having listened to the Minister's few words, I am not reassured. He has not responded to some of my questions. I asked him what consultations he had had and whether he had spoken just to the one sectional interest which we knew was keen on getting the amendment introduced. He also did not answer my question about how exactly it was decided to include in the Bill references to cost compliance in addition to the one reference that had been decided in Standing Committee discussions on amendments to the Financial Services Act 1986.<br/>
The Minister said that he could not understand why we were raising these matters. Perhaps I should remind him


that his former ministerial colleague in the Standing Committee, the hon. Member for Warwickshire, North (Mr. Maude), said that he could well understand the concerns that we were raising about this and also those expressed by the Consumers Association and others, although he felt that they were unfounded. I found that response easier to cope with than the present Minister's complete lack of awareness about why we feel that this issue is so important.<br/>
We want adequate and proper regulation, not cost-cutting regulation. That is why we are concerned about the amendment and why I urge my hon. Friends to oppose it.</p>

<p>I beg to move amendment No. 304, in page 253, line 44, leave out from 'as' to end of line 45 and insert
<q>'auditor under the Companies (Northern Ireland) Order 1986 or under the law of a country or territory outside the United Kingdom where it appears to the Secretary of State that the law and practice with respect to the audit of company accounts is similar to that in the United Kingdom.'.</q>
Ever since statutory requirements on auditors' qualifications were introduced into United Kingdom law in the 1940s, members of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland have been qualified for appointment as auditors in the United Kingdom regardless of whether their training was received in the Republic or in Northern Ireland. Correspondingly, persons qualified in the United Kingdom have always been able to audit the accounts of companies incorporated in the Republic. The


justification for that is that company law in the Republic is similar to that in the United Kingdom. I taught company law in Ireland for many years and the similarities between the Companies Act 1948 and the Irish Companies Act 1963 were striking, except for one thing&#x2014;the Irish Act was twice as long because it was printed in Irish on one side.<br/>
A common body of accounting and auditing standards also applies throughout the British Isles. The amendment would allow the present situation to continue by enabling the Secretary of State to recognise, for the purpose of an auditor's qualification, training in the company audit work of any country in which the law and practice are similar to that in the United Kingdom. The amendment therefore goes slightly further than facilitating auditors in the Republic. After 1992, qualifications and practice may become increasingly similar in various countries.</p>

<p>Will the hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley) explain what is meant by
<q>where &#x2026; the law and practice with respect to the audit of company accounts is similar to that in the United Kingdom."?</q>
Is he also saying that accounting standards would to all intents and purposes he the same? Is the hon. Gentleman also making observations on the level of qualifications required so that they are comparable in both countries, so that auditors in Britain and in the Irish Republic would be qualified to the same standards and operating within the same codes of practice?</p>

<p>Exactly that. The qualifications of Irish and United Kingdom chartered accountants are, I believe, exactly the same both in terms of the nature of their training and in terms of the audit work that they carry out once qualified and in order to become qualified.<br/>
Although the hon. Gentleman is extremely wise and knowledgeable and may well know this fact, it may interest the House to know that the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland covers both Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland, so part of the United Kingdom already receives qualifications according to a law of Ireland. It therefore seems wholly sensible that the training leading to qualification should be recognised in statute as being exactly analogous. The provision would also facilitate United Kingdom accountants training in the Republic of Ireland.<br/>
The provision merely recognises the existing realities of training and qualification and I believe that it will be seen by the Irish Republic as a friendly gesture from our Government.</p>

<p>I should be grateful if the hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley) and the Minister could clarify a few points. I well recollect our discussions on this matter in Committee when I believe that it was the hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes who informed us that the Prime Minister of Ireland, Charles Haughey, was an accountant and would be qualified under these provisions. Even the most devoted Unionist might have a slight feeling of trepidation about that eventuality. None the less, horse racing is popular in both the United Kingdom and the South of Ireland, so we may look forward to a happy coming together on that point. Is my thinking correct?</p>

<p>A chartered accountant, whether trained in the Republic of Ireland or the United Kingdom, divorces himself from his political feelings and preferences

when practising as a chartered accountant, so whatever the hon. Gentleman's feelings about the President of the Republic of Ireland, I assure the hon. Gentleman that as a chartered accountant Mr. Haughey would be totally independent. In other words, the hon. Gentleman's thinking was indeed correct.</p>

<p>As my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley) has just said, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland is specifically recognised in the present provisions on the qualifications of auditors in section 389 of the Companies Act 1985. All its members&#x2014;whether trained in the Republic or in Northern Ireland&#x2014;are therefore qualified in law to audit the accounts of British companies. That reflects the way in which company law and auditing practices in Britain and Ireland have developed hand in hand. Auditing standards and guidelines developed by the Auditing Practices Committee apply equally to the Republic of Ireland and to Great Britain. That answers the point raised by the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins).<br/>
There may be a case for considering whether the work involved in auditing companies in the Irish Republic is so similar to United Kingdom company audit work that practical training in such work could count towards the Bill's requirements on the content of practical training. In any case, I am happy to give my support to the amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond and Barnes, and I hope that the House will join me.</p>

<p>These two amendments take account of a point that came to light only at a late stage in our proceedings. They bring the period in clause 43, within which prosecution in England and Wales of a person who has committed an offence under part II must take place, into line with the standard provisions on time limits for the prosecution of offences. At present clause 43 has the effect that the trial must commence no later than three years after its commission. The amendments correct that to three years after the relevant information was laid, which is already the effect of the clause as far as Scotland is concerned.</p>

New clause 20 would replace clause 89 in the Bill. It contains a number of amendments to clauses 395 and 396. The amendments mostly make some technical but important alterations to terms and provisions that determine whether a charge is registrable. The broad aim is to ensure that we do not require registration if it will cause undue damage to commercial practice. New clause 21 would replace clause 90 of the Bill. It contains amendments to new section 397 but inserts no new provisions. The amendments simply omit an illustrative list and a provisional notice that is replaced by a new provision in clause 30.</p>

<p>The new clauses contain various amendments to existing provisions of part IV that relate primarily to the delivery of particulars for registration. New clause 22 would replace clause 91 of the Bill. It amends new sections 398, 399 and 400. The amendments are largely improvements to the drafting of the new sections. The principal amendment is that in new section 399(1). This makes it clear that an unregistered charge will not be void in respect of those acquiring an interest in property subject to the charge before the charge's creation.<br/>
New clause 23 would replace clause 92 of the Bill. It amends new section 401. Although the new clause contains a number of drafting changes, the only substantive amendment is in new section 401(1). This would allow further particulars of a variation to a charge to be delivered before the variation has become effective.<br/>
New clause 24 would replace clause 93 of the Bill. It contains a number of drafting amendments to new section 402. There are no substantive amendments.<br/>
New clause 25 would replace clause 94 of the Bill. It contains amendments to new section 403. We have widened the circumstances in which a memorandum may be delivered to the registrar.

<p>I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br/>
This new clause inserts new provisions restricting the effect of avoidance. It is designed principally to ensure that the sanctions of avoidance and partial avoidance should not have unduly adverse effects on those dealing with charges. If we do not limit the effect of avoidance in the ways proposed in the new clause, people might be less willing to deal with charges or the property subject to them. As a consequence, creditors might become reluctant to offer secured finance to companies in certain circumstances. The objective of much in the new clause is, therefore, to disapply the effect of avoidance either where it is unnecessary or where the disadvantages flowing from it would outweigh the benefits.</p>

The new clause creates a new offence for which a fine may be imposed. Will the Minister outline what the size of that fine might be? This is referred to in section 408.</p>

<p>There have been problems if companies pay for liability insurance for directors under the provisions of section 310 of the Companies Act. New clause 33 would enable companies to take out insurance against those liabilities for negligence, default or breach of trust on behalf of its officers and auditors, without that insurance being void. It also requires the existence of such insurance to be disclosed in the directors' report. The remainder of the new clause simply tidies up the drafting.<br/>
Amendment No. 257 is a consequential amendment to the Building Societies Act 1986. This will enable the provision in that Act that is analogous to section 310 to be amended so as to ensure that companies and building societies continue to be subject to equivalent provisions.<br/>
I know that many hon. Members will welcome this change in the law. My hon. Friend the Member for Dorset, North (Mr. Baker) moved a similar amendment in Committee. It will be especially beneficial to non-executive directors, paid only a few thousand pounds a year for their services, but jointly liable in law with their executive colleagues for substantial sums. It may be of some help to the House, which showed considerable enthusiasm for non-executive directors in previous debates.</p>

<p>I welcome the introduction of this new clause and I am delighted that my hon. Friend the Minister has moved it. I have two small worries, however, which he may want to look at, but perhaps at a later date. The first concerns the problem that, although there is permission for companies to enter into insurance policies under which legal costs of impending proceedings can be paid, this does not appear to be so if somebody loses the case. The new clause says that the cost will be paid if the case is won. Should not one consider the alternative, which is if the case is lost?<br/>
Secondly, section 310 of the Companies Act 1985 does not prohibit the relief provision, but renders it void. The drafting of the permission for this kind of insurance that the new clause provides does not take account of it. It is not clear what the position will be in relation to the policies in force. If they were rendered void under section 310, it is not clear whether the new clause brings them to life again. I hope that my hon. Friend will take away these small but significant concerns and see whether some later amendment should be made.</p>

<speech hansard_id="667458" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1989-10-26a.1175.1" hansard_membership_id="5287" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/11671" speakername="Mr. Hanley" colnum="1175" time="21:45:00">
<p>The new clause amends section 310 of the Companies Act 1985 so as to clarify that a company is able to purchase insurance for its officers and auditors against any liability that may be incurred by the company. The effect of section 310 was uncertain and the clarification is most welcome. The amendment, however, does nothing to address auditors' fundamental liability problems. Through the operation of the legal principle of joint and several liability, an auditor is liable to be required to meet the whole of a loss for which he is only partially responsible. Secondly, for larger firms the professional indemnity insurance cover at levels that they would regard as desirable is almost impossible to secure at any price. Measures to limit the liability of auditors are therefore extremely necessary. I have raised this issue in new clause 50, which we shall reach later in our proceedings. This is an ideal opportunity to raise the matter, however, because it is linked to new clause 33.<br/>
In 1986, a group known as the Heads of the Profession saw the then Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, my right hon. Friend the Member for Southend, West (Mr. Channon). The delegation met representatives of the DTI and of the Lord Chancellor's Department. The result was that in 1987 and 1988 the Government appointed a series of fact-finding studies into the liability problems of various professions, including the auditors. The report on the auditing profession is believed to have been in the

Department's hands at least since May. Unfortunately, it has not yet been published and the Department has made no statement on it.<br/>
Members of the Standing Committee that considered the Bill will remember that in June the then Minister with responsibilities for these matters, my hon. Friend the Member for Warwickshire, North (Mr. Maude), issued a consultation paper on one of the proposals set out in the study team's report. That proposal I have reproduced as new clause 50. In essence, it allows the shareholders of a company to fix a reasonable limit to the auditor's liability to the company. This is not a solution to the problem but it would be a step in the right direction. The Government have not taken up the proposal in their consultation paper and have made no statement on the results of their consultations.<br/>
It would be most helpful, therefore, if my hon. Friend the Minister could provide some information about the Government's actions in respect of liability problems of the auditors' profession and of the many other professions that participated in the consultation process to state their great difficulties. The problems were aired in a debate in another place at some length. I shall be grateful if my hon. Friend will explain the timescale for the results of the consultation process, which was set in place when the Bill was being considered in Committee. Many of us have been surprised that there is no reference to the matter being brought before the House on Report.</p>

<speech hansard_id="667459" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1989-10-26a.1176.0" hansard_membership_id="168" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/3209" speakername="Mr. Redwood" colnum="1176" time="21:45:00">
<p>I have taken some quick advice on the two issues raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Dorset, North (Mr. Baker). The new clause is as neutral as possible in respect of existing policies. The position would have to be determined in accordance with existing law. My hon. Friend will know that it is a moot point whether existing policies are valid under that law. My hon. Friend asks why there should not be protection if the case is lost. In that event, the director would have been found liable in respect of one of the points set out in section 310. I think that it would be inappropriate that the company should have to pay his costs.<br/>
I can tell my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley) that the Likierman report should be published soon, which I think that he will welcome. I cannot offer him any joy in respect of new clause 50 and the arguments that he is advancing in this debate. I believe that auditors have to be held liable, that auditors owe a duty and there has to be a fair trial in the courts if there is any potential negligence. The sums involved can be large but only because the amounts that may be lost by relying on inaccurate accounts can also be large. Any limitation on auditor's liability would inevitably mean that in some instances people who lost money in that way through no fault of their own would not be able to recover their losses in full. The onus must be on those who propose a change in the law to demonstrate that such a change would be in the overall public interest. I do not believe that that has been established.</p>

<p>The present clause permits companies to dispense with the requirement of having a company seal and makes alternative provision for executing documents. The revised provisions make the following changes to the Companies Act. First, the new clause incorporates reforms proposed by the Scottish Law Commission on the


execution of documents by companies under Scottish Law. Secondly, it takes up proposals suggested in another place that to execute documents other than by sealing, two directors or a director and the secretary should be permitted to sign instead of just a director and the secretary as first proposed. Thirdly, it clarifies and improves the proposals in the present clause 123 in respect of companies executing documents in England and Wales. Fourthly, it makes provisions with respect to the execution of documents by companies incorporated outside Great Britain.<br/>
In all those changes, we are grateful for the comments of several professional bodies in both Scotland and England. I should add that, in respect of Scotland, it had originally been intended that the provisions would be included in a separate private Member's Bill backed by the Scottish Law Commission on the Law of Writings. Unfortunately, that Bill failed to gain a Second Reading and we are therefore pleased, through the Bill, to pick up those provisions affecting companies. I hope that the House will welcome that.</p>

<p>I welcome the new clause. I have one concern, which I hope my hon. Friend can allay. The new clause provides that companies will be deemed to have delivered deeds when they execute them. Subsection (5) states
<q>A document executed by a company which makes it clear on its face that it is intended by the person or persons making it to be a deed has effect, upon delivery, as a deed; and it shall be presumed, unless a contrary intention is proved, to be delivered upon its being so executed.</q>
In that form, it appears that completion meetings will have to change because, as I understand the clause, a company will not be able to execute a document before a meeting and then send it to that meeting a day or two later to have the date put on it and for it to be brought into effect upon that date.<br/>
The subsection would have the effect of making the document come into effect when it is executed&#x2014;possibly two days before the meeting. That could make life difficult for many commercial transactions. Can my hon. Friend allay that concern?</p>

<p>The amendments in the name of the hon. Member for Dorset, North (Mr. Baker) are very much in line with our amendment No. 283. The issues raised by the new clause and the amendment were originally raised in Committee. We do not make any apology for raising them again on Report because they are important matters that were not satisfactorily resolved in Committee. They affect many individuals who are not only experiencing severe health problems, but find themselves in financial difficulties.<br/>
The new clause and the amendment are about the difficulty that an individual faces in claiming compensation in cases of personal injury or the contracting of industrial disease when the company for whom the individual worked has been dissolved.<br/>
We all know from cases in our constituencies just how prevalent some industrial diseases are, particularly asbestosis, pneumoconiosis, byssinosis, and so on. Those who, like me, represent an industrial constituency know the problems vividly, in particular, the physical and financial difficulties that many of our constituents are facing.<br/>
Besides ourselves, many organisations are worried about the problems that the law creates, making it so difficult for people to claim compensation, particularly when they contract diseases several years after leaving the employment of a certain employer.<br/>
I particularly want to mention the good work done by the citizen action compensation campaign in highlighting the issue. That has been rightly active in contacting


members of the Committee and many other hon. Members on both sides of the House who are concerned with the issue.<br/>
The case that brought the problem to the fore is that of Bradley <i>v.</i> Eagle Star Insurance Company which dates from this year where it was decided that the claimant could not bring a claim against her past employers' insurance company for injuries that she alleged she had received while at work. Mrs. Bradley had contracted the respiratory disease byssinosis because of the work that she had done over several years in the card room of a Bolton cotton mill, the Dart mill.<br/>
In 1984 she brought a claim against the Eagle Star Insurance Company because her employers had gone out of business almost 10 years before. However, she could not re-register the company under the present provisions because of the two-year time limit.<br/>
Mr. John Pickering, Mrs. Bradley's solicitor, described her position as a clear injustice which was evident to any man in the street. The victim exists, the insurance company exists and the right to seek compensation for the injury has been paid for. Despite that, Mrs. Bradley was unable to obtain justice or compensation.<br/>
There is also the case of Norman Burden who worked for many years as a docker on the Newcastle quayside unloading bags of asbestos, as a result of which he contracted asbestosis. Because of the same legal difficulty, his family is left without compensation.<br/>
New clause 8 represents the optimum position. It is what we would ideally like to achieve if the Government were prepared to accept our new clause, simply because it provides for three things which do not exist at present.<br/>
The new clause would allow claimants to claim directly against the insurance company in the event that a former employee's company had been dissolved. That is important because it would overcome the problem of having to re-register the company for the purpose of making a claim against the insurer, which is the case at present and which can be a costly process&#x2014;up to &#x00A3;400 for each re-registration.<br/>
Companies must be continually re-registered, depending on the number of claims that claimants want to make against that particular company's insurers. Some trade unions find it expensive to cope with the cost of the re-registration of companies. For example, the General and Municipal Workers Union has to re-register the Upper Clyde Shipbuilders at a cost of &#x00A3;3,000 or more a year. That is expensive, and if the law were changed it would be an unnecessary procedure.<br/>
The new clause also raises the issue of retrospectivity. We wish the period during which a claim can be made against an insurer to be extended from two years to 20 years. As the Bill stands, a claim can be retrospective for only two years. We feel that, especially as so many industrial diseases take a long time to manifest themselves, an alteration to 20 years would be an important step. We also wish the period to be unlimited in the future, which is why the new clause refers to the statute of limitations rather than to a 20-year period.<br/>
We hope that the Minister will respond positively. In Committee, his predecessor seemed to feel that our demands were excessive and that we should show some sympathy for the insurance companies. We were pleased to note, however, that certain Conservative Members took a rather different view, including the hon. Member for

Dorset, North (Mr. Baker), although we were disappointed that that independent view was not reflected in a vote. We hope that that will not happen again.<br/>
We do not feel that the concern felt by insurers about the new clause and amendment are justified. They wrote to members of the Committee, and one point raised in Committee was that insurers, when working out the cost of their premiums, take into account that a number of companies will go into liquidation. We do not think that that complaint is justifiable, particularly as before the Bradley <i>v.</i> Eagle Star ruling the legal position was not really clear, and it would therefore have been very unwise for insurance companies to make such a calculation. We feel that, when premiums have been paid and claims cannot be made because of the existing legislation, the insurance companies are benefiting from a windfall.<br/>
The insurers also say that it is very unfair for them to be held liable for diseases that may manifest themselves in the future, and could not be foreseen by the industries in question. Insurance companies, however, know that that is the position&#x2014;industry cannot possibly be aware of future scientific discoveries, for example&#x2014;and they must deal with their customers on the basis of present knowledge.</p>

<p>Like me, my hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, East (Ms. Quin) represents a constituency that has had to deal with industrial diseases such as "vibration white finger" and asbestosis, which were being discussed many years ago. Workers and their trade union representatives had to fight the social security and legal systems for many years to establish the identity of those conditions&#x2014;and others like them&#x2014;as recognised diseases requiring compensation. Does my hon. Friend feel, as I do, anger that we should be told now after so many years of fighting that those problems could not have been anticipated?</p>

<p>I fully accept what my hon. Friend has said, and I hope that the anger that many of us feel about people who are in difficulties because of their past employment will be shared by the Minister and his colleagues.<br/>
The insurers have also said that, in certain circumstances, it may be very difficult for companies to track down the files on claimants over a 20-year period. That may be a problem, but it is not sufficient reason not to change the law. It may mean difficulties for certain claimants, but those claimants for whom records exist will be able to obtain justice.<br/>
Finally, the insurers are saying that future premiums would become more expensive if the law is changed in the way that we are suggesting, but we are reinforced in our feelings on the subject by the representations made to hon Members by Mr. Robert Kiln, an insurer with more than 50 years' experience who was an insurance adviser to the Department of Trade and Industry. He feels that any such effect would be marginal.<br/>
10.15 pm<br/>
Another case, the Cartledge case, of which I am sure the Minister is aware, resulted in one occasion in the past where a case of retrospectivity was accepted by both sides of the House. Because of that, we urge the Minister to respond positively to our desire for retrospectivity, at least within the 20-year period, on this occasion. I urge the Minister and his colleagues not simply to accept the views of industry, but to see it from the point of view of the many individuals whose future has been blighted and who are


unable to claim compensation at present. Of course it is true that no amount of money can properly compensate for a permanent loss of good health or a permanent disability, but at least we should try to create the legal conditions under which some of those who have been so badly affected can seek compensation, and by doing so alleviate the problems faced by individuals and their families.</p>

<p>It may help the House to make progress if I intervene at this point in the debate. I have listened carefully to the hon. Lady. I know the strong views expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Dorset, North (Mr. Baker) in previous debates. I have problems with new clause 8. They are legal difficulties with which I shall not detain the House unduly but which relate to the very point raised by the hon. Lady. Substituting the company's insurer for the company itself as the defendant to an action for damages or personal injuries poses a number of legal difficulties which the Government find difficult to accept.<br/>
However, it is much more important for the House to learn not about the legal problems but about what I propose to do about the underlying problem which has been described in Committee. I suggest that the House accepts amendments Nos. 287 and 288 in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Dorset, North. Clause 131 already extends the two-year period to 20 years, because the Government wanted to tackle that problem. If the House accepts both my hon. Friend's amendments, I hope that it will agree that we have gone a long way towards dealing with some problems which can be quite tragic.<br/>
That would require the House to accept the principle of retroaction. When I first examined the case and read the Committee proceedings, that caused me some difficulty. I have been swayed by legal representations that I have seen in which many good lawyers suggest that on this occasion it would be reasonable. If the House is united in wanting retroaction, I shall happily accept my hon. Friend's amendments.</p>

<p>I am absolutely delighted by what my hon. Friend has just said. I moved the amendments in Committee because it seemed to me that there was an injustice. The hon. Member for Gateshead, East (Ms.

Quin) described the problem. She is more familiar with it than I am as she has more constituents affected by industrial diseases. It is clearly an injustice that people should be prevented from claiming compensation simply because a company has been dissolved. As a lawyer, I, too, was concerned about the retrospective element but medical science has advanced so much, we know so much more about industrial disease and we know that they take longer to appear. To that extent, one could argue that this is not a retrospective piece of legislation. It is recognising that there is a wrong and I am delighted that we are doing something about it.<br/>
Amendment No. 288 provides for claims to be made for up to 20 years against companies that have been dissolved. I have difficulties with direct remedies against insurers and in making the time unlimited. I think that 20 years should be sufficient.<br/>
This is a great step forward for people who have suffered industrial injuries, and I am delighted with the comments made by my hon. Friend the Minister. I hope that the House will join me in supporting the amendment.</p>

<p>I should like to welcome the comments that the Minister made. Obviously, we still favour new clause 8, but the acceptance of the 20-year period and retroactivity is a considerable victory for those who are concerned about the many cases of injustice that have occurred.<br/>
There was some confusion in Committee when we debated the amendment. The Minister's predecessor believed that the Bill's provisions would deal with the majority of cases. We subsequently realised that the Bradley case and others would not be covered by clause 131, but they will now be covered by the new formula that the Minister has accepted.</p>

<p>I am pleased to see an outbreak of harmony, which was the rule in Committee, with the Government and the Opposition arriving at a much better Bill as a result of discussing the issues. I hope that that will be true in relation to new clauses 9 and 10.<br/>
The new clauses embody proposals for an European Community directive on procedures for informing and consulting employees&#x2014;the Vredeling directive, which was last discussed at the EC's labour and social affairs council in 1986 and is due to be discussed again this year.<br/>
The EC charter of fundamental social rights produced in May this year, and due to be discussed at the summit in December, includes the main principles of the new clauses, and it is right that the House should have the opportunity to consider them again.<br/>
The charter foresees a particular need for rights of information and consultation to be extended to workers where technological change has far-reaching implications for the work force, where restructuring or mergers have an effect on employment or where workers from other member states are particularly affected by their employers' policies.<br/>
In nine of the 12 member states, works councils representing employees have to be kept informed by management about important developments. Unfortunately, the United Kingdom is one of the three states where no such rights exist.<br/>
The new clauses are self-explanatory. They differ from the Vredeling directive in that they refer to a company or group of companies having not fewer than 200 employees. The original Vredeling draft referred to 100 employees, but after a vote in the European Parliament the figure was


raised to 1,000 employees. We see no reason why medium-sized companies should not be covered by these provisions.<br/>
We are aware&#x2014;who is not?&#x2014;that the Prime Minister is resolutely opposed to the provisions of the proposed social charter. I understand that the Department of Employment this week issued a document opposing any legislation on worker participation. Our view is that consultation with employees along the lines proposed in our new clause will eventually be enacted and enforced.<br/>
The requirement is modest&#x2014;that a company should explain its performance and financial and employment prospects to its employees once a year and discuss its plans with its employees. New clause 10 proposes that companies shall consult employees' representatives on decisions that are likely to have serious consequences for the interests of a significant number of employees in respect of such matters as closures, transfers, changes in production methods and health and safety at work. Refusal to provide such information on the grounds of potential harm to the interests of a company may be referred to a tribunal for adjudication.<br/>
We are all aware of the value of freely sharing information with the workers in an enterprise and encouraging participation in its conduct. These new clauses are in the mainstream of European thought, but I am sure that the Government are likely to demonstrate that they are outside it.<br/>
Indeed, like so many of our proposals for the improvement of the Bill, the new clauses are in line with good management practice in Britain. They would give momentum to the wider adoption of good practice in relation to consulting employees on the major issues that affect their lives at work. In a British Institute of Management discussion paper which I received today, the results of a survey of company employee paticipation in Britain show the extent to which formal methods exist for participation in our companies. The most common form of paticipation is the briefing meeting at which company policies are explained to employees&#x2014;very much along the lines of what we propose. Nearly half of all companies have them and 70 per cent. think that they are effective or very effective.<br/>
In the Netherlands and France, these provisions have already been enacted. In West Germany, the two-tier board structure provides for them. It is time that we moved in that direction. Although the number is dwindling, too many companies in this country are remote, authoritarian and still treat their employees as chattels. In the great wave of redundancies which took place in 1980 and 1982 and which are beginning to recur, certainly in my constituency, as a result of current levels of interest, thousands of workers were dismissed with minimum notice, little consultation and little sharing of experience between managers and workers. We believe that workers have a right to be consulted and to be involved in the decisions that shape their lives.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, South (Mr. Garrett) has rightly referred to the Prime Minister's attitude to workers' rights. In one moment of enthusiasm she even described this modest proposal, and proposals like it, as "Marxist". It may well be that a few small bonfires are being lit in Highgate tonight, and

Heaven knows, there may be some reason for that. Those of us who recollect the discussions in Standing Committee will recall the reference to Karl Marx of Brent which enlivened our proceedings a little.<br/>
The proposals in new clauses 9 and 10 have nothing to do with Marxism. Tonight the Government are being tested. The philosophical position which gives rise to the new clauses goes back not to the Communist manifesto of 1848 but to the papal encyclical "Mater et Magister" of the 1890s. The test is whether the Conservative party is prepared to accept the new clauses and start becoming a proper European Christian Democrat party or to remain stuck in an isolationist, reactionary mould which will ultimately exclude them and their successors from all significant influence in Europe's political affairs.<br/>
This is an important matter. The new clauses raise issues which are fundamental to the Government's position in Europe. Every Christian Democrat party in Europe, which in their politics are generally thought of as Right-wing parties, associate themselves with the principle of consulting workers by statute. So far, however, the British Government do not, but today they have the opportunity to reverse their stance and to start engaging in the sensible dialogue that will ultimately be inevitable and necessary, not with us but with their own future political candidate allies, should any be foolish enough to take the conservative party seriously.<br/>
10.30 pm<br/>
The new clauses advance limited, simple proposals which, if the Government do not accept them tonight, they will have to confront in other forms on other occasions in the near future. The proposals are some way down the track that the Government will have to accept. Would it not be better for the Government, for workers and for the Government's standing in Europe if they moved now, before being pushed into another humiliating retreat and surrender on such a simple and fundamental matter?<br/>
It is not simply a case of falling into line with Europe. Steps have already been taken which will inevitably raise the issue of workers' rights in a concrete form throughout British industry. European company statutes have already gone so far as to create the European economic interest group&#x2014;a curious term for the European company.<br/>
The European company is with us. Because of the statutory position of companies and the tradition of social legislation, which is not a matter of controversy between the political Left and the Right in other European countries, the Government will have to accept, if not now, then later, incorporation in company statute of the principles of consulting workers and of workers' rights.<br/>
It is even more curious that the Government accepted that what leads them down this track in the Employment Act 1982, which was incorporated in the Companies Act 1985. I refer to the requirement for a company to demonstrate in its annual accounts what it has done about employee involvement. Companies are required to report on four issues, two of which are precisely what new clauses 9 and 10 propose.<br/>
It is curious that the Government made a great point of philosophical principle about a company not being required to consult its employees and workers or to give them information about key matters of concern to them, but they are willing to require companies to lodge in their accounts a requirement to consult shareholders about what the company does about informing workers. What


tortured logic is it that makes the Government happy to advocate that a company should talk to its shareholders but not to its workers about what it does about workers' rights?<br/>
In 1982, the Government quite voluntarily got into an untenable position. In 1985, they shifted that contradiction from employment legislation to companies legislation. It is entirely logical that we should ask the Government to confront that, and to come up with a sensible reply.<br/>
We have heard a lot tonight about compliance. It would be interesting to know what the Government have done to ensure compliance with the provisions on employee involvement which they themselves created in the Companies Act 1985. All that appears to have been done in that respect is to carry out two surveys on a sample basis of what companies were up to. Those surveys demonstrate clearly that there is a declining number of companies&#x2014;and that is to be welcomed&#x2014;which fail to carry out the provisions originally in the Employment Act 1982 and now in the Companies Act 1985 on the requirement to report their shareholders about workers' rights. None the less, in the last survey carried out in 1988, of the sample taken, more than 10 per cent. of companies failed completely to carry out any of their requirements under the Companies Act 1985.<br/>
If the Government are not prepared to accept new clause 9 and new clause 10 to carry them gently a little further forward towards taking workers seriously, as they will inevitably have to do later, it would be interesting to find out tonight what they propose to do to carry out the proper enforcement of their own legislation requiring companies to report to shareholders on these matters under the Companies Act 1985. We have heard much about compliance and high standards tonight, yet there is not a shred of evidence that any company has had any action taken against it to force it to carry out its duties under the 1985 Act on its responsibilities on employee involvement. That is a shameful state of affairs, which can only reduce still further the credibility of the Government's position on the matter.<br/>
It is no wonder that our European partners are suspicious of the Government's intentions in this respect. But for the other sensational matters which have come before the House today, this debate and the Government's position on new clause 9 and new clause 10 might well have been recorded and studied closely elsewhere. I appreciate, of course, that after today's events, this humble matter is unlikely to catch the headlines. None the less, there will be and there are already people&#x2014;including the partner Governments in Europe and the other Christian Democrat politicians in Europe, whom the government would like to see as their political partners&#x2014;who will look carefully at the Government's response on this. They will be disappointed if the Government do not respond to new clauses 9 and 10 in the same fashion as the Minister responded to new clause 8.<br/>
It is not just a question of bringing about compulsory compliance with matters which will eventually be raised against the Government from European sources, but a matter that the Government themselves should be considering. What was the logic of putting into the Companies Act 1985 the requirement to consult shareholders about employee involvement if the matter was not taken seriously?<br/>
There are areas which the Government are prepared to admit are significant enough to warrant companies

studying their relationships with their workers most carefully. One of the most significant of those is training. Training is an issue that the Government have sought to detect in the employee involvement statements which have been delivered as a result of that requirement in the Companies Act 1985. What a sad story the statements tell, and how inadequately companies have reported to their shareholders on such key matters. The truth is that the economy will not be turned around unless workers are consulted and informed and unless they play a pan in taking key decisions in their companies.<br/>
We should not imagine that when we refer to workers we mean manual industrial workers. Our work force is increasingly comprised of highly skilled, non-manual workers. Above all the Government should seek to mobilise the energy of those workers in the service of their companies and they should do so other than through shareholding schemes.<br/>
Tonight we have said much about accountancy. The turnover of labour in accountancy firms is now running at about 20 per cent. or more. The country is in the grip of a philosophy which advocates advancement through change of job. There is nothing wrong with that, but we should remember that we are approaching a time when the number of workers will decline. It is desperately important to retain skilled workers who can work together on a continuing basis with their colleagues.<br/>
All too often, teams of highly skilled, non-manual workers are thrown to the wind. My hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, North (Mr. Clay) saw the loss of such workers&#x2014;priceless assets&#x2014;from Marine Design Consultants based in his constituency. In the past, workers whose experience was of great value not only to their companies, but to the economy, were simply discarded. The Government cannot continue to shirk their obligations in this respect.<br/>
We are not talking about the industrial workers of the past, but about highly skilled and motivated non-manual workers who want to be part of a team within their company. I hope that the Government recognise that new clauses 9 and 10 present them with an opportunity to mobilise the energy and integrity of such workers in support of their economic policies. I note that the Leader of the House is present. No doubt he is familiar with the Government's economic policies, although they appear obscure to some of us.</p>

<p>That would be entirely forgiveabie. Tonight we have witnessed a sensational example of the difficulties which arise if an enterprise fails to involve its senior workers in achieving its objectives. That failure at worker involvement may come to haunt the Government.<br/>
New clauses 9 and 10 pose a simple test of the Government's attitude to the work force and of how they intend to respond to the European social charter. It is most important for the Government to sort out whether they want to be a Christian Democratic Government in the social tradition of Europe or whether they wish to remain an isolationist, localised Government obsessed with their own ideas. Tonight, above all nights, we have seen them in that light.<br/>

<p>I am delighted to respond to the points made by the hon. Members for Norwich, South (Mr. Garrett) and for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins).<br/>
The new clauses do different things. New clause 9 gives employers the duty to make an annual report to their employees. I agree that it is good practice to do so. Indeed, all companies have to publish a report of some sort&#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i>Yes, they do&#x2014;an annual report, and in the main, they have to cover many of the issues referred to here. I should have thought that it would be eminently sensible to cover all the matters which are relevant to shareholders, customers and workers, and to ensure that copies of the report are made available to employees. That seems an excellent example of the best sort of industrial practice.<br/>
10.45 pm<br/>
The difference between us is whether it is right to turn from good practice to trying to impose a requirement of that sort by statute. The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central asserted that there is a great ideological dispute between us&#x2014;between Marxism and liberal Tory economics, but I very much doubt that. Throughout these highly successful 10 years of industrial regeneration, we have sought to put minimum burdens on industry, whereas the hon. Gentleman is always hankering for controls, regulation and statutes.<br/>
New clause 10 goes much further and requires employers to give 30 days' notice of decisions which might have serious effects such as closure; transfer; changes in the activity of the company, its working practices or production methods; mergers; takeovers; and health and safety matters. If it so happens that a company believes that the decisions that it has to make will be of a sensitive nature, it can apply to the industrial tribunal on the grounds that it might do substantial damage to the company if these were to become public. The company must then await the verdict of the industrial tribunal before approaching a decision.<br/>
New clause 10 is a far more serious and inhibiting provision than new clause 9. It would mean considerable delay before decisions could be taken. The judgment of what could be a sensitive decision which could do great damage&#x2014;not only to that company, but perhaps to other companies and to the whole operation of the market in buying and selling those industrial units&#x2014;would no longer be within the jurisdiction of the directors but would lie with the industrial tribunal. That in itself is an inhibition which would place a great disadvantage on our boards of directors. Furthermore, the delay inherent in these procedures would have serious consequences for the ability of directors to take decisions in what are sometimes fast-moving situations.<br/>
The curious thing about these provisions is that they seem to apply to the company itself and its board of directors. Presumably, if the company is a foreign and not a European company, and the members of the board of directors are not resident here, it would be hard to enforce the provisions. That would give an enormous advantage to foreign rather than European owned companies in this country.</p>

<speech hansard_id="667546" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1989-10-26a.1192.2" hansard_membership_id="11415" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30571" speakername="Mr. Ridley" colnum="1192" time="21:45:00">
<p>The advantage is that they would not have this great delay and uncertainty about their ability to take decisions.<br/>
An even stronger example is that the real upset and worry that the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central mentioned is for workers whose companies are taken over&#x2014;not for those in the company doing the taking over. How a company seeking to take over another is supposed to give notice and go to the industrial tribunal about its intentions to take over that other company certainly beats me.<br/>
These proposals do not remotely fit the modern fast-moving industrial world of which the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central spoke. He described the difference between the two sides of the House as being between Marxism and market economics, and then pretended that he understood about the fast-moving industrial changes of today. His contention that his proposals are designed to facilitate those changes does not remotely fit the facts&#x2014;that in such a world the decision makers must be given the chance to take decisions properly.<br/>
An example of the sort of inhibitions that new clause 10 might cause was to be seen in an action brought by the trade unions in the High Court in 1987. The unions claimed that they had not been consulted on the transfer involved in the privatisation of the dockyards, as was required by the Dockyard Services Act 1986, which contains the very provisions the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central seeks in the new clause. They arise under the relevant provisions of the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations, which implemented a European directive negotiated by the Labour Government.<br/>
The unions admitted at the hearing that their aim throughout had been to delay privatisation and the High Court found that all reasonable steps had been taken to inform and consult the workers. Mr. Justice Millett said in his judgment:
<q>If there is a lesson to be learned from what has taken place, it is that effective consultations cannot take place with those who do not wish to be consulted".</q>
The Opposition would vest these sometimes genuine and sometimes obstructionist powers in the hands of people who sometimes do not want to be consulted.<br/>
There are two defects in the Oppositions's approach. First, they want to enshrine in statute, regulations and controls that which we believe should be left to the judgment and decisions of boards of directors, operating in their own best interests and in the best interests of their workers in a highly competitive economy. All unnecessary regulations will make them less likely to be able to provide the improvements in conditions and pay that the employees rightly deserve and expect.<br/>
Secondly, the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould)&#x2014;typically of the Opposition&#x2014;has waged a war against the shareholder. He is, I suppose, the most extreme example of this syndrome. Yesterday he boasted about his book. It might be interesting for the House if I gave it a little more publicity&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>I have not finished my sentence. The hon. Member says in his book:
<q>Where there is no substantial public equity stake on which to build, we shall establish voting control without necessarily buying the equity &#x2026; The golden share already establishes the principle of separating voting rights from the other incidents of equity ownership</q>
He says elsewhere:
<q>Our concern is to provide mechanisms &#x2026;which provide real control to employees over the enterprise to which they devote their working lives &#x2026;We also believe that employees should have increasing access to such major decisions as plant closures &#x2026;and takeovers or mergers".</q>
That is what lies behind the new clause. It is also what lies behind the social charter and the European initiatives that the hon. Gentleman has so prophetically&#x2014;or perhaps I should say pathetically&#x2014;advocated.<br/>
There is a better book than the one by the hon. Member for Dagenham, and it is free. I shall give a copy to the hon. Member for Norwich, South (Mr. Garrett). It is about the improvement and progress in employee involvement in Britain and the great benefits that have come by leaving such matters to those who practise industrial policy. They have responded and have found many important ways to involve workers in the affairs of their companies. That is why we have seen a great increase in industrial productivity and in the standard of living of people in successful industries. Those things are the result of not adopting Opposition policies.</p>

<p>It is my pleasant duty to welcome the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry on, I think, his first appearance, at the Dispatch Box in his new role. We can look forward to many hours of entertainment from him and fully expect him to do for British industry what he did for the environment.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman was not present in Committee, but he will know that the Opposition moved many amendments aimed at creating companies which are accountable not only to their employees, as the amendment proposes, but also to shareholders, consumers and potential investors. Far from opposing the shareholder, our amendments have tried to advance the concept of the accountable company. I do not know whether the right hon. Gentleman has sat down or whether he gave way to me.</p>

<p>These two new clauses deal with the onus of proof in merger cases. Under the Fair Trading Act 1973, if a proposed merger involves net assets of a value of more than &#x00A3;30 million or a 25 per cent. product market share it is scrutinised by the Director General of Fair Trading, who recommends to the Secretary of State whether the merger should be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. This new clause accepts these arrangements but establishes new guidelines that a merger shall be referred unless it is clear that it will not operate against the public interest.<br/>
According to the Government, mergers are generally a case of market forces successfully at work for the benefit of the economy as a whole. Mergers are good because they are good management driving out bad; because they yield economies of scale; and because the threat of a takeover serves to keep managers on their toes. It is argued from this that on the whole the only reason for a proposed merger to be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission is the possibility of its having anticompetitive, monopolistic implications. This doctrine was first publically announced in 1984 by the right hon.

Member for Chingford (Mr. Tebbit), then the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, in the so-called Tebbit doctrine.<br/>
During the Second Reading debate of the Companies Bill in the House of Lords, the subsequent Secretary of State, Lord Young, stated:
<q>In the vast majority of cases, decisions on mergers should be left to shareholders&#x2026;It is normally only when a merger threatens the interests of customers by reducing competition that the law should intervene."&#x2014;<i>[Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 16 January 1989; Vol. 503, c. 7&#x2013;8.]</q>
We believe that that approach is deficient. Lord Young retained a reserve power to make a reference on wider public interest grounds when, for example, he referred the Kuwait Investment Office shareholding in BP. The practice of retaining golden shares in privatised industries also represents a recognition of public interest issues beyond the promotion of competition. We therefore have ad hoc intervention in the merger process without any coherent public interest criterion.<br/>
A survey in February this year by Channel 4's "The Business Programme" showed the incoherence of the Government's policy&#x2014;the way that it varies from one specific case to another. The survey covered the top 20 financial advisers in the United Kingdom mergers and acquisitions field, and 19 of the 20 experts agreed that the Government's mergers policy was neither consistent nor clear-cut. The survey cited confusion over the referral ofs such as Elders' bid for Scottish and Newcastle, where analysts felt that there was no threat to competition, and the decision not to refer the Nestle takeover of Rowntree in spite of concern over Swiss non-reciprocity.<br/>

The Director General of Fair Trading has supported the idea that the onus of proof should change. In December 1986 he suggested that the reversal of the onus of proof, perhaps on mergers above a certain size, could be a way of tackling the problem of financial markets taking an excessively short-term view which could be against the public interest.<br/>
The scale of merger activity has been on an upward trend during the 1980s. In 1988, the total value of mergers and acquisitions exceeded a record &#x00A3;22 billion involving 1,200 companies. Mergers are generally reckoned to be an inefficient means of growth compared with new investment in plant and equipment, yet total spending on acquisitions is twice the level of manufacturing investment and over half the level of investment in all companies. All the research evidence is that more than half of all mergers lead to a decline in or, at best, a neutral effect on performance, as measured by profits and the return on assets.</p>

<p>That policy was unsuccessful but it must be put in the context of the management ideology of the time. I was a manager in industry at that time and it was generally thought that large conglomerate organisations were the appropriate way to growth. Management has changed since then, partly as a result of the greater ability to manage smaller companies through the development of inflation technology, about which the hon. Gentleman will know as well as anybody else. It was generally thought at


the time that what we now call "gigantism" but was then thought to be "economy of scale" were widely appropriate. The Labour Government of the day was as wrong about that as most of the great industrialists. At that time Lord Weinstock was putting together GEC. One can remember the growth of large conglomerates in the private sector which are now no doubt being unbundled as management fashions change. The hon. Gentleman has, as so often, made a valid point.<br/>
In other mergers, improvements in efficiency tend to be no greater than what would have been expected in the absence of a merger. Such findings are supported by the Government's 1978 Green Paper, Cmnd. 7198&#x2014;the Leisner report on mergers policy. That considered several studies but attempted to evaluate the benefits of mergers by looking at post-merger profitability and before the mergers took place. Those studies produced the finding that in roughly half the cases examined the merger had resulted in an unfavourable or a neutral effect on the profitability of the companies concerned.<br/>
The Department of Transport's 1988 report on mergers policy referred to later studies, on the same lines as the Leisner study, which on other criteria
<q>reinforced the findings of poor post-merger performance." The growth of virtually unregulated mergers led to defensive management, what we called in Committee "short-termism", rather than risk-taking management which makes a company vulnerable to takeover. It also means that companies aim for size rather than competitiveness. Managers are preoccupied with short-term survival and a cautious attitude to investment, training and research and development, because any drop in short-term profits will be translated into falls in the share price and increase vulnerability to takeover.</q>
As the&#x2014;I was about to say the present Chancellor of the Exchequer, but that is wrong. He was the Chancellor of the Exchequer until 5 or 6 o'clock this evening.</p>

<p>I wrote it yesterday. Things change so fast. In June 1986, the right hon. Member for Blaby (Mr. Lawson) said:
<q>The big institutional investors nowadays increasingly react to short-term pressure on investment performance&#x2026;They are unwilling to countenance long-term investment or a sufficient expenditure on research and development.</q>
Incentive schemes for pension fund managers, for example, are based on short-term horizons&#x2014;quarterly and annual performance&#x2014;so that their tendency is also to favour the short term.<br/>
We have had the example of virtually bid-proof companies in Switzerland, but much the same is true elsewhere in Europe, and certainly in Japan. In Germany and France, the equivalents of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission are much less likely to allow control of domestic companies to move abroad. I remember that, when I was a manager in industry, German law&#x2014;or German convention or practice&#x2014;laid down that what was called "mind and management" of a company operating in Germany should reside there. In 1988, European acquisitions in the United Kingdom were at nearly twice the value of United Kingdom acquisitions in Europe.<br/>
Lately we have seen the effects of an import from the United States&#x2014;the colossal highly leveraged or "junk bond" bid&#x2014;in the &#x00A3;13&#x00B7;4 billion Hoylake bid for British American Tobacco, which the Minister has refused to refer

to the MMC, although the potential victim is one of our largest companies. We discussed the possible effects of that bid with him late one night. But for the late Chancellor's constant increases in interest rates, there would no doubt have been many more bids based on the issuing of high-interest bonds on very little security, which can be redeemed only by the break-up of the victim company and the consequential loss of jobs.<br/>
We think that it is time that a brake was applied to this merger mania by our putting the public interest first, and that is the purport of the new clauses. By "public interest" we mean not only competition but consumer interest, innovation and development, the balanced distribution of industry, and the international competitive position of British producers. If those criteria sound familiar, it is because they are all in the Fair Trading Act 1973.</p>

<p>The two new clauses do not require us to take a view about whether mergers are right or wrong; they simply require the reference of a merger for considerations of public interest. What the judgment of public interest would be in any particular case would be a matter for the relevant regulatory body. I do not feel that we need to debate the values or otherwise of mergers, as such.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, South (Mr. Garrett) referred to the takeover bid for BAT by Hoylake. One of the things that I find most objectionable about that attempt is the fact that a pleasant seaside resort on the Wirral peninsula should have its name flung into the centre of a debate of this kind: I think that the good name of Hoylake the town will suffer considerably for a long time, to the disadvantage of its inhabitants.<br/>
That bid may be right or it may be wrong, but it raises very relevant questions of public interest. The stated purpose of a great many of the major acquisitions of the past few years has been to deconcentrate and demerge; the purpose of the takeover of BAT is to dismember it, to liberate brand names, asset values or public good will&#x2014;the particular aspects of a company's operation&#x2014;and to put them on the market and find buyers for them.</p>

<p>If the Labour party is now so opposed to conglomerates, why is it so unhappy about the proposal to unbundle BAT? The hon. Gentleman said earlier that we were not discussing the merits of mergers. At present the law is so constructed that the presumption is in their favour; the Labour party proposes to create a presumption against them.</p>

<p>BAT is a good example. We are not required to decide whether what is proposed for BAT by the misnamed Hoylake, or by the board of directors is right or wrong. Incidentally, at a recent annual meeting, one shareholder who, since his name has already been mentioned tonight, ought to get a small record in the history books&#x2014;a man called Antonio von Marx&#x2014;objected to that proposal. I cannot be sure whether Mr. Antonio von Marx is related to the other Marxes who have been referred to tonight, but at the most recent annual general meeting of BAT, a Mr. Marx was very unhappy about the proceedings.<br/>
The point is not whether we, in our own personal judgments decide whether the proposed takeover of BAT&#x2014;the unbundling version proposed by Hoylake, or the defensive version proposed by the board of directors&#x2014;is right or wrong. Our concern is that matters of public


interest are involved in that operation. In the final judgment, what weight should be put upon any or all the proposals involved in that exercise is quite another matter. We all have our own views about that and about each specific proposal.<br/>
Matters of public interest are raised in deciding whether the exercise should be launched in such a manner, and if it is, whether it is right that we should have no regulatory mechanism available whereby the particular proposals that are made, either offensively by Hoylake or defensively by the board of directors, are appropriate and in the long-term interests of the public and the country.<br/>
In any specific case it may be right or wrong to dismantle conglomerates, but the two clauses proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, South (Mr. Garrett) make no judgments as to what might be the outcome in particular cases. They require only that the public interest involved in bids such as the one for BAT should be tested in an appropriate regulatory arena. That is all they ask, and it is a modest, limited and sensible request.<br/>
Other Opposition Members&#x2014;I suspect, at least one hon. Member present today&#x2014;have reservations about takeover bids financed on the so-called junk bond basis. Yet the clauses do not require us necessarily to take the view that bids financed by junk bonds are wrong. The clauses ask only that the public interest aspects of those suggestions, and the counter suggestions from the board of directors conducting the defence against those operations are tested.<br/>
Insurance is a very productive industry. If we are ever to get the balance of payments right, we should talk up the part played by industries such as insurance.</p>

<p>I thought that my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, South would like that one.<br/>
Just before the single market in 1992 and when the fate of our insurance industry is so important to the country, it is important that major insurance companies such as Eagle Star and Pearl should not be exposed to the risks to their operations that they face today.<br/>
We are not saying that it would be wrong to stop the proposed mergers, but it must be right to suggest that we require a regulatory mechanism that would test those bids against some consideration of public interest. That is the modest demand that the new clauses make, and surely no sensible person could refuse or refute it.</p>

<p>It will come as no surprise to the hon. Member for Norwich, South (Mr. Garrett) that I find the new clauses difficult to accept. He claimed that the Government are implying that mergers are good because they may lead to economies of scale and keep management on their toes. That is not the burden of the Government's case. The Government's case is much simpler&#x2014;it is that in most cases shareholders and bankers should decide about mergers, particularly shareholders, who have the votes and own the assets. As past Labour Governments have shown, Governments should not attempt to meddle and make decisions about how best to construct or reorganise industry. Governments in the past have left industry with

little profit, little return on capital and little chance of employing more people and making the investment that we need.<br/>
The hon. Member for Norwich, South mentioned the Tebbit doctrine and the competition criterion, which has been important to the Government's merger policy. He pointed out that we have kept the public-interest criterion, but we have made it clear that it rarely applies. Its most notable manifestation is where competition will be limited and market dominance will be created by a merger that may be against the public interest.<br/>
I rebut the idea that there has been no coherence to the Government's approach to merger policy. The Tebbit doctrine, the Blue Book and the statements made by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State have provided a continuity of policy and have made it quite clear that the criterion is usually competition, but that public-interest matters may have to be judged by the Director General of Fair Trading or the Secretary of State.<br/>
The hon. Member for Norwich, South made much of the fact that some studies, including the Leisner study, which is about 10 years old, have suggested that half of all mergers, or more, might produce disappointing profits and returns on assets. Again, the Government's case is that shareholders should take that into account when making their decisions. There is no evidence that Governments would be better at making those decisions. If the Labour party's policies were implemented, the Government of the day might succeed in blocking half of the mergers. That would add to profitability and investment but let through the half that did not. Such intervention, based on the experiences of the 1970s, would be far from helpful for the industrial recovery that is now under way.<br/>
We were told that companies aim for size rather than competitiveness. That is an unreasonable description of the way that companies behave. Large bids, particularly in the United Kingdom, show that size is not a bar to a bid being made or, in the United States, to a takeover being completed. Companies simply aiming for size and not taking into account the need for competitiveness, good performance and earnings and dividend progression, will not succeed in the way that the hon. Gentleman suggests. That is not a good argument against the Government's merger policy.<br/>
Companies can defend themselves against predatory attack, and many have done so successfully by showing a basis of achievement and often by stressing their belief in long-term investment, long-term projects and research and development, which all hon. Members wish to see as the hallmark of good industrial practice.<br/>
The hon. Members for Norwich, South and for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins) expressed their displeasure at certain types of highly leveraged bids. I cannot comment on a particular case because I do not want to put my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State in any difficulty. He must retain his powers and be entirely independent in judging specific bids.<br/>
I should like to make one or two brief comments on the general question of leveraged bids. A break-up of a company through a merger does not necessarily lead to a loss of jobs or a worse performance, as the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central accepted. He was in some muddle about whether demerger was good or bad because he was in some muddle about whether conglomerates were always, or sometimes, bad. There are types of break-up that may create independence for


subsidiaries which could help them by giving them greater morale, separate access to capital and so on, which they may have lacked under the conglomerate.</p>

<p>I very much agree with the sentiments behind my hon. Friend's address. I followed what he said about leveraged bids. I should like ' to put to him one scenario which is relevant when casting policy. Leveraged bids tend to be a function of bull markets. If a bull market ceases to be a bull market, as it did for a few days recently in the United States and this country, one sees what happens to leveraged bids. For example, in the case of United Air Lines, they fall by the wayside. Happily, in a sense the bids were not under way. In other words, although the debt might have been underwritten, the company had not been acquired.<br/>
The problem arises in a bear market when shares are falling steeply or successively and a leveraged bid has been made. The company making the leveraged bid finds itself owning the company that it acquired in the hope that it could sell off sections of it in part or in whole to redeem the debt. It finds that they do not begin to recover the debt. It therefore has to sell most, if not all, of the company at knockdown prices and perhaps even go into receivership. This is why such deals are often carried out through vehicle companies rather than subsidiaries of major companies. No Government can afford to ignore a future scenario in which that may happen for cyclical reasons. The Government, the employees and the industrial companies may be left in a position where the companies have to be sold off or shut down.<br/>
Does my hon. Friend feel&#x2014;I am sure that he does&#x2014;that in a changed market that might be a legitimate criterion for a reference and for assessment of whether such a merger was in the public interest?</p>

<p>I will answer, if the hon. Gentleman will contain himself.<br/>
My hon. Friend is right&#x2014;there could be dangers in certain kinds of leveraged bids. I have no particular case in this country in mind, for reasons which I have outlined. I have made it clear that shareholders and bankers&#x2014;the principal interest groups concerned&#x2014;should be very aware exactly how that debt will be serviced and repaid when considering any proposal which they may be financing or to which they may be responding. If the debt is to be repaid primarily out of asset sales, they might want to ask questions about the price at which assets would be sold, whether it was feasible to sell them and the timescale within which that would be achieved. They may well have to take market conditions into account as my hon. Friend said.<br/>
If the bidder and the banks that are backing the transaction intend to finance it out of increased profitability through merger benefits&#x2014;increased efficiency, performance and the like&#x2014;I hope that shareholders and bankers will ask the right questions, such as, "What happens if the underlying market for the product declines, or if there is a slowdown in economic growth in the major world markets in which the company is operating." Usual questions of prudence should be asked. The people who make the judgments should have a good understanding of the relative risks that are being run.<br/>
If a company is highly leveraged in its operations, and added to that is high leveraging through its financing, the risk of corporate failure or of disaster is multiplied considerably. I hope that shareholders and bankers will take such considerations into account.<br/>
The Government's case is that it cannot be the task of Government to make such decisions. Whether a bond is junkie must be determined by those who might buy or sell it. It is discovered whether the bond is junkie only some years later. If the paper is issued and it turns out that the transaction was very good, the company's profits go up, the debt is repaid, and it does not turn out to be junkie. If a wrong judgment is made and the company is saddled with too much debt, trading conditions deteriorate and things go wrong, the bond turns out to be junkie. That is the problem.<br/>
The Government cannot make hundreds of decisions about the junkiness or otherwise of financing. We have made it quite clear that our policy on these matters is to trust the judgment of shareholders, bankers and others, and refer only if leveraging is allied with some other characteristics which may operate against the public interest. That is a clear policy that has been laid down by successive Secretaries of State, and I think that it will serve us well. The Governor of the Bank of England has recently commented on financing systems in various sectors of the economy.<br/>
The requirement to make a reference, as suggested by the Labour party, would make a substantial difference to the way in which merger policy operates. At the moment, about 10 out of 300 mergers are referred. It is difficult to calculate how many might be caught under Labour's


recommendations, but I think that at least four or five times as many would because they would represent quite a substantial shift.<br/>
Labour's proposal reminds me of a return to the bad old days when businesses were run from Whitehall, and when it was assumed that three or four politicians sitting in certain Whitehall offices were able to make all these judgments about the future of British industry which enterprising business men were unable to make.<br/>
In the 1970s, when that belief was rife, industrial profitability fell to record low levels, there was a large number of redundancies from nationalised industries and Government policy seemed to be based on organising conglomerate mergers and public monopolies which did not serve the customer any better than the people who worked in them or the markets in which they operated.<br/>
It is better to trust business men to make business judgments. Politicians are here to defend the public interest. That is exactly what our largely competition-based reference policy produces. There is great coherence in the policy. It has been stated clearly on several occasions. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and the director general are always prepared to examine a case if a public interest issue arises. If one arises, the merger should be referred and investigated exhaustively.<br/>
I urge the House to reject the new clause.</p>

<p>I am not very hapy with the Minister's response. I have met him across the Dispatch Box several times now. We are beginning to size him up. He is really just a housetrained version of the right hon. Member for Chingford (Mr. Tebbit). Underneath that shy, fawn-like exterior is a marketeer, red in tooth and claw. Moreover, he is a follower of policies which, in spite of what he said at the end of his speech, have left us with an unbelievably high balance of payments deficit. Unemployment is officially registered at about 2 million, but is probably more than 3 million, and inflation is the highest in western Europe, so the Minister may come to regret his words.<br/>
11.45 pm<br/>
We regard the reversal of the burden of proof in mergers as serious and central to our beliefs about the way in which mergers should be regulated. I invite my right hon. and hon. Friends, therefore, to join me in the Division Lobby in support of the new clause.</p>

<p>Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. The effect of the clause as drafted is to prevent a member of a group of persons who control the bidder from buying any further shares in the bidder.

<p>The objective of the amendments appears to be to relax the temporary prohibition on share dealings following a reference so that parties on one side of a merger can continue to acquire one another's shares. Although we are not unsympathetic to the reasoning behind that, we consider that it would be a mistake to tackle the issue by amending the Bill rather than by using the Secretary of State's power to issue consents.<br/>
Clause 139 makes it unlawful for the duration of the MMC inquiry for any parties to propose a merger which is referred, or to acquire shares or interests in shares in any of the parties, except with the Secretary of State's consent. The prohibition extends to all those covered by the reference and their subsidiaries and associates. This prohibition puts on a permanent statutory basis the standard practice of making individual orders in each case under the Fair Trading Act 1973 to limit the holding which bidders can acquire.<br/>
The purpose of the prohibition is to prevent the outcome of MMC inquiry or any action necessary following it from being prejudiced by the merger going ahead in the meantime. The complexity of many merger arrangements has led us to make the prohibition in the Bill a general one which applies to all possible relevant parties to a merger. It would otherwise be very difficult to catch everyone whom we might conceivably wish to catch. Rather than have a complicated&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br/>
The new clause is along the lines of a new clause tabled in another place when the Bill began its passage though the House. It was also referred to in Standing Committee. The arguments are well known, but we believe that it is an important issue and therefore do not apologise for bringing it to the attention of the House now.<br/>
The new clause would put the takeover panel on a statutory footing. We know that the panel is very attached to its present status as a non-statutory body. I know, too, that the director-general of the panel has written to


Members of the Standing Committee making his views clear. Nevertheless, it is interesting that the director-general of the takeover panel acknowledges that our new clause preserves the essential characteristics of the panel's method of working and its freedom from tactical litigations, and we understand the panel's attachment to flexibility. However, the panel has been in existence for 21 years and there is no doubt that economic conditions have changed considerably during that time. That is certainly true of the increase in takeover activity of recent years.<br/>
There was an interesting debate on this matter in another place, when it was clear that some of their Lordships who had previously supported the non-statutory panel had become less convinced as time went on. Lord Rippon of Hexham said in an interesting contribution that he did not feel that we had a system in which the interests of shareholders and the public interest were best protected. He was concerned, as were others, about the deterioration of standards in takeover bids, and he referred to the aggressive tactics of some merchant banks which seemingly encourage bids. He was worried, too, by the behaviour of some institutional shareholders who increasingly regard share certificates, in the words of the noble Lord, as
<q>casino chips to be used to secure short-term capital gains rather than long-term investments"&#x2014;<i>[Official Report, House of Lords, 6 March 1989; Vol. 504, c. 1295.]</i></q>
Since we have been anxious about the problem of short-termism and the lack of long-term industrial strategy in this country, we have great sympathy with his words.<br/>
It was interesting to note that another noble Lord' Lord Lucas of Chilworth, said that he had been swayed by events in the last few years into believing that something stronger and with more force was needed.<br/>
In the debate in the other place it was said that a working party of the takeover panel was looking at its operation in regulating takeovers. I do not know whether the working party has reached any conclusions or, if it has, what they are, but it would be interesting to know if it has come to any firm conclusions. Perhaps the Minister could tell us about that.<br/>
There is undoubtedly a European Community dimension to all this because of the negotiations presently taking place, of which I know the Minister is aware, about the formulation of the 13th company law directive. We think that some of the matters that concern us would be given statutory force by that directive, although it is obvious that, as negotiations are continuing, the form of the directive is not clear. However, article 6 seems to give the force that interests us.<br/>
As I have said, we are not out to destroy the flexibility of the takeover panel but simply to give it the weight, importance and extra effectiveness that we think statute would give it. My hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, South (Mr. Garrett) said in Committee that it is anomalous that the Securities and Investments Board draws its authority from the Secretary of State while the takeover panel does not. The new clause restates our view that the takeover panel should have statutory force.</p>

<p>I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, East (Ms. Quin). With the Financial Services Act 1986, the Government created a mixed economy of regulation in which there are statutory bodies

operating in a way that is not quite free. So far, at any rate, that has proved a successful format. The new clause seeks to put other matters of regulation of financial matters on a similar basis. The Government should be flattered that we recognise and have such a good opinion of the 1986 mixed economy regulation formula.<br/>
The present system of regulation is rather inchoate. It is not so much a mixed economy as a car boot sale. In different parts of the system, regulation is achieved on different principles and by different methods. The new clause simply seeks to extend to the work of the takeover panel the same principles and formula of regulation as those applied more narrowly in the more specific financial markets by the Financial Services Act. I hope that the new clause is acceptable to the Government. The fact that we are prepared to extend that formula to other areas should commend itself to the Government.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Gateshead, East (Ms. Quin) is absolutely right to say that the takeover panel wrote to members of the Standing Committee when this matter was raised earlier. Because of that approach, I decided to look at the takeover panel, to study the way in which it does its work, and to see those who work therein. I do not think that I was suborned by my visit. I came away with a much greater appreciation of the work of the takeover panel and of the people who work in it, especially those on secondment.<br/>
The vast majority of the consultants on the takeover panel come from major financial and business institutions. They are extremely dedicated and act independently. In hardly any cases has the takeover panel been accused of anything by any of the parties to the activities that it has helped to regulate, because it is utterly fair. The other reason why it is so successful is that because it is non-statutory, the advice that it gives is not subject to being decided in the courts because it exists within the market by the consent and agreement of all those various parties, which respect it thoroughly.<br/>
I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to resist the new clause for the important reason that if the panel were statutory, it would be susceptible to litigation. Then, the parties of a contested takeover, trying to use every tactic available to them, might resort to the courts and perhaps for no other reason than delay for tactical advantage. That would be most undesirable. A company with the resources and the tenacity of a Lonhro could extend the takeover bid for many months. The advice given honestly and independently by the members of the takeover panel and its staff would be put to question. While I am sure that they would be supported in any decision, many takeover bids would be put in jeopardy for the wrong reasons. I ask all my hon. Friends to resist the new clause.</p>

<p>I have appeared before the takeover panel, and I have found it quick, cheap, efficient and independent. Opposition Members have argued in favour of tidiness and said that they do like such bodies to be regulated by different systems. I am not interested in tidiness for the sake of it in the regulation of companies. I want a system of regulation which works, and this does. It is flexible, and members of the Committee were presented with examples of the different changes that the takeover panel has accommodated in changing its rules. I


will not go over them now, but it is impressive how, in 21 years, the panel has adapted to new problems that have arisen, and new situations that have to be met.<br/>
Furthermore, the panel has avoided litigation. I plead guilty to being a lawyer. The hon. Member for Norwich, South (Mr. Garrett) wants more work for lawyers. I came to Parliament to try to reduce the work for lawyers, but I have been unsuccessful. The takeover panel is a good example of how to avoid litigation by being non-statutory and not giving rise to litigation. This is an example of where the self-regulation system works, so let us allow it to do so and resist the new clause.</p>

<speech hansard_id="668026" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1989-10-26a.1241.0" hansard_membership_id="168" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/3209" speakername="Mr. Redwood" colnum="1241" time="23:30:00">
<p>The hon. Member for Gateshead, East (Ms Quin) provided two of the best reasons why the new clause should be resisted. She agreed that the director-general wants the takeover panel to stay as it is, and she accepted that it is doing good work. She recognised that freedom from tactical litigation is an important part of its method of operation. Its flexibility is what makes it so successful and widely accepted by all those participating in the market place for control and in need of rules and a guiding hand to ensure fair play between the parties. She asked me what had emerged from the panel working party looking at its operations. That work has led to proposals for rule changes which I hope will be welcomed on both sides of the House.<br/>
It has been requested that a model section 212 notice of disclosure should be issued, and I am happy to see that happen. It has been suggested that a cash alternative in a bid should be required if a company has bought 10 per cent. of the shares of the target company in the previous 12 months, rather than 15 per cent. That may help hon. Members who have been worried about certain kinds of bid using paper rather than cash.<br/>
There is another requirement that there should be no purchase above 30 per cent. of the shares until it is clear that the Secretary of State does not intend to refer the matter to the MMC. This shows the takeover panel at work responding to changing conditions, which it can do speedily and flexibly as a result of its structure. I am grateful to my hon. Friends the Members for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley) and for Dorset, North (Mr. Baker) for urging the House to reject the new clause, and 1 must do the same.<br/>
12.15 am<br/>
We have a successful panel system. It achieves the important objective of protecting shareholders' interests while maintaining an open and efficient market for takeovers. Compliance with the code is high and the panel continues to exercise authority over those it regulates. It is difficult to understand why we should tinker with a system that operates so effectively. It is not enough to be motivated by a vague desire to establish all regulation in statute. There must be a real and perceived need for improvement before legislation can be justified, and there is no such need in respect of the panel.<br/>
Nor do I think that there is a need for the Secretary of State to have a role in appointing the members of the panel. It is already the position that the chairman, two deputy chairmen and one further individual are independent lay members appointed by the Governor of the Bank of England. The remaining member organisations represent the full range of those who have a interest in the proper market conduct of takeovers. We are

continuing to discuss the effect of the takeover directive in Brussels. It would be premature for Parliament to be considering at the same time as the new clause the implementation of the directive as none of us has any idea what exactly the directive will provide. Its existence as a proposal is no argument for legislating before the final text is agreed. We are still at the Council working party stage. There is a long way to go before a satisfactory directive is finally agreed.<br/>
The new clause is potentially damaging in the effect that it might have on the status of the panel and the code. That is where I think that the hon. Member for Gateshead, East is in some difficulty. We regard the maintenance of the panel's current relationship with the courts as essential to the proper conduct of takeovers. As the code is not legally binding, the panel can be flexible in the setting and interpretation of its rules. It is also able to make rulings quickly during the course of takeovers. Broadly speaking, the panel is the final arbiter in its rulings. Takeovers cannot be delayed or frustrated through tactical litigation during their progress. The measure of discretion that is available to the panel affords that combination of flexibility and speed which enables it to be successful.</p>

<p>I am trying to follow the Minister's argument. Would he regard the implications of the DTI inspector's report on the County NatWest affair, especially the recommendations for future legislation contained in paragraphs 10.35 and 16.41, as being potentially threatening to the integrity of the takeover panel as he is presenting it this evening?</p>

<p>No, I do not find it so threatening. I think that the panel has proved its worth in many situations in recent years.<br/>
I believe that the new clause could jeopardise the satisfactory operation of the panel and could lead to some legal difficulties. I urge the House to reject it.</p>

<p>At least one positive result of tabling the new clause and discussing the issue in Committee was to encourage the hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley) to visit the takeover panel.<br/>
In tabling the new clause we were aware of the danger of promoting too much litigation, and I felt that we had responded to it, especially when I had introduced the clause to the House. We do not believe that everything in the garden is rosy in the way that has been described by the Minister. The fact that the panel has been carrying out an examination and has recommended some changes shows that certain changes were felt to be necessary. I refer again to the debate which took place in another place, during which specific concerns were expressed about the panel's ability to deal with takeovers in the special climate that we have seen develop over the past few years. For those reasons, I shall press the new clause to a Division.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br/>
I shall not detain the House for long. The new clause has two objectives. It seeks first that the Securities and Investments Board should have the power to maintain a register of all those in the financial advising world, and secondly, that the SIB should be able to lay down conditions as to how and when those names should be placed on the register. That could be by a competence test or by educational qualification. The SIB may be inhibited from taking the lead, so I suggest that we should alter the Companies Bill to remind the SIB that it can take such a lead and then it will probably do so.<br/>
The background to the new clause, as my hon. Friend will recollect, is that during the early stages of the Financial Services Bill, the SIB and the Marketing of Investments Board organising committee petitioned the Government to include a competence test, but that was refused. Now that FIMBRA is embarking on competence tests and the SIB is also considering its position, the time has come to provide the powers which could be used to set a standard. The designated rules could be used a a vehicle for requiring all appropriate self-regulatory organisations and registered professional bodies to introduce registers and tests. If the Minister cannot give us a categorical assurance tonight, or if the wording of the new clause is somehow defective, I hope that he will give the new clause sympathetic consideration.</p>

<p>I have listened with interest to the arguments presented by my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South (Sir W. Clark) in presenting new clause 51, but I believe that the Bill has enough safeguards for investors already in place. The House should remember the substantial degree of control over individuals employed in investment business by the existing powers in the Financial Services Act.<br/>
Authorised firms have a clear and direct responsibility for ensuring that their employees are properly selected, trained and supervised. They are also responsible for ensuring that their employees comply with the full panoply of conduct of business rules or risk loss of authorisation or other sanctions. Large firms in which staff tend to specialise or which undertake a variety of activities have to ensure that the only members of their staff who advise the public on investments are those who are fully competent to do so.<br/>
The Act provides two other powers. First is the power to obtain information from authorised businesses, self-regulatory organisations and other recognised bodies. That enables the SIB to obtain such information on individuals and other matters as it deems neccessary for investor protection. The recognised bodies are able to obtain information from their members under similar provisions in their own rule books.<br/>
The second relevant power is contained in section 59 of the Financial Services Act 1986, under which the SIB can seek an order banning an individual from being employed


in connection with investment business. A list can therefore be kept of all individuals who appear not to be fit and proper persons to engage in such business.<br/>
Given the weight that the Act places on the authorisation of businesses and not individuals, and given the array of powers available to ensure that those businesses employ only individuals who are properly selected and trained, I cannot see the advantage to be gained from requiring specific tests of competence.<br/>
Passing such a test would never guarantee that an individual was incompetent at that time or in the future any more than the absence of a qualification could be held to disqualify someone with a lifetime's experience who had been giving good service.<br/>
I am afraid that I am not convinced that the limited benefits of the additional powers proposed by my hon. Friend would outweigh the burdens that they would place on business.<br/>
In the light of that, I hope that my hon. Friend will withdraw new clause 51.</p>

The amendment clarifies the rights of action of investors in the event that the breach of a principle promulgated by the SIB also involves a breach of the common law.<br/>
It is clear that some matters that may be coverred by principles might already have legal consequences under the common law, such as actions for negligence or breach of trust. However, the principles stated in new section 47A(3) are not to give rise to any right of action on the part of an investor or other person affected, nor to invalidate any transaction. It has been pointed out that the clause as currently drafted might be held to extinguish such rights as already existed. That was not the intention, so the amendment makes it clear that any rights that an investor might have at common law in respect of matters covered by these principles are not extinguished.</p>

<p>It is essential that recognised professional bodies avoid any charge of second-class regulation. The misguided attempt to relieve RPBs of the responsibility of complying with the core rules laid down by the SIB give weight to that charge.<br/>
I know that RPBs are bound by statute and royal charters, but they must use their best endeavours to comply with the standards sensibly laid down and adopted by self-regulating organisations, and the amendments aim to achieve that.<br/>
We must take care, because it would be illogical if some financial advisers were subject to some rules while others were subject to other rules. I hope that my hon. Friend the

<p>I recognise the genuine concerns that have persuaded my hon. Friend to move the amendments, but I hope to be able to convince him that the action that we propose will meet his concerns.<br/>
New section 47A of the Financial Services Act 1986 will give the Secretary of State a power, which it is intended should be transferred to the SIB, to promulgate statements of principle on the conduct required of investment businesses. A breach of such a statement of principle could lead to disciplinary action. New section 47B gives the SIB and SROs a limited power to waive the application of the principles in a particular case if its application would be unduly onerous and if it could be waived without undue risk to investors.<br/>
The purpose of the clause is to provide more flexibility in the operation of the Financial Services Act by allowing regulators scope to make provision, the legal effect of which is appropriate for the mischief that they are seeking to control. The clause does not set out the level of detail for which the statements of principle should provide. Under this power, it would be possible for the SIB to make statements of principle which deal in some detail with matters that are currently dealt with in rules under section 48.<br/>
If the powers were to be used in that way, I am sure that my hon. Friend would agree that there should be appropriate flexibility to provide for waivers in the closely defined circumstances set out in the clause. However, the board has said that it does not, for the foreseeable future, propose to use the power in this way. It proposes to use it to promulgate up to 12 general principles which are of such a fundamental nature that the use of the waiver would not be appropriate in any circumstances. In the light of that, the Government have decided not to commence new section 47B while the principles take that form.<br/>
I hope that my hon. Friend agrees that this is a satisfactory way of dealing with the important problem which he has raised. I understand that the SIB is content with this approach, which is important. I should be grateful if my hon. Friend would withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p>The amendments are concerned with the extent to which rules which have been designated by the SIB under new section 63A may be waived or modified by an SRO. The Government think that there should be a mechanism by which the majority of these rules may be waived or modified for individual members of the SROs. These rules would be very different from the statements of principle made under new section 47A.<br/>
Without the flexibility represented by the power to waive or modify, it would be difficult to make effective use of the power to draft rules which might be designated. It may be appropriate at this stage to stress the important role that the SROs play and will continue to play in the structure established by the Financial Services Act. It is only these organisations that have the experience necessary to make the detailed rules appropriate to their members and to monitor and enforce compliance with those rules.<br/>
It is also clear, however, that the unconstrained use of waivers might have the potential to undermine the intention behind this new power, which is to provide a common core of rules which apply essentialy to all SRO members.<br/>
I believe that the SROs can be relied upon to use their power to waive or modify designated rules in a responsible way, but I am also conscious that there are likely to be some designated rules to which any modification or waiver might be inappropriate in principle. The amendments recognise that distinction by providing the SIB with the power to specify that certain rules designated under new section 63A may not be waived or modified by an SRO in any circumstances or only in circumstances set out in the rules or regulations.<br/>
I stress that I and, I understand, the SIB see this very much as a reserve power. I would expect that, provided SROs exercised their power to waive designated rules with

moderation, there would be no need for the SIB to exercise the power that the amendment gives it. On that basis, I commend the amendment to the House.</p>

<p>In Committee, we in general opposed the power to waive rules given to SROs, and the amendments seem to reverse the Government's position. They provide that to such an extent as may be specified, presumably by the SIB, the designated rules or regulations may not be modified or waived in relation to a member of a recognised self-regulating profession. Interestingly, we understood from the SIB that the power of waive provisions came as a surprise to it. It was not particularly keen on them. We would like the Minister to say whether what I have described is true and that this is a significant change of position by the Government, in which case it is welcome.</p>

<p>I received a note from the Securities Association about the amendment. It was worried that the amendment would introduce an unfortunate degree of inflexibility into the system. Will my hon.

<p>What proposals do the Government have for monitoring these proposals? There is now the possibility of some choice of regulatory system. The creditability of the mixed economy regulation that the Minister is proposing depends on there not being regulatory arbitrage. The proposals may go some way to undermine the clarity of the system. That may be acceptable, but does the Minister propose to put in place a monitoring of the system by the SIB, some other agency or even the Department, to ensure that abuses do not grow up from the ability to choose the regulatory mechanism under which one operates?</p>

I must tell my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) that I spelled it out carefully, and it is on the basis which I described that it goes forward for those special circumstances which I outlined.<br/>
The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins) asked about the monitoring changes and whether there could be choice between regulators in a way which could reduce the protection to investors and other users of these financial markets. I do not think that that is possible, because all these SROs and practitioner bodies have to meet the adequacy test. That is the underlying guarantee concerning the protection offered.</p>

The core rules are not to apply to the recognised professional bodies. We discussed this issue in Committee, where I proposed an amendment similar to, but not the same as, this one. The amendment tries to ensure that, even though the core rules are not to apply, investors who deal with members of recognised professional bodies will get no less effective protection than that afforded to those who invest through members of SROs.<br/>
In response to the amendment that I proposed in Committee, my hon. Friend the Minister's predecessor said:
<q>There is a difficulty with amendment (a). It risks locking the recognition tests for professional bodies to their investment business rules. That is unnecessary because in some respects&#x2014;for example, solicitors and clients' money&#x2014;adequate protection can be achieved by relying on the general rules of the body."&#x2014;<i>[Official Report, Standing Committee D,</i> 29 June 1989; c. 643.]</q>
I have redrafted my amendment to take his point into account. The amendment now refers not just to the investment business rules of the recognised professional body, but to the general rules that apply to all the business that the member of an RPB undertakes. For a solicitor who is a member of the Law Society, there are client account rules which apply to all his business. Now that I have modified my amendment to take account of the objection of my hon.

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr Smith) for recasting his amendment, but I am afraid that I still have problems with it. I hope to convince him that the effect that he hopes to achieve can already be achieved by the Bill.<br/>
The Government have often made it clear that it is not intended that regulation of our recognised professional bodies should or could be regarded as a soft option. That is why, in the Bill, as in the original Act, the test that self-regulating organisations and professional bodies have to satisfy is, when it comes to the protection provided to investors, identical&#x2014;which is what I said in response to the previous debate. When these new provisions come into force, SROs and RPBs will have to satisfy the SIB that their rules provide an adequate level of investor protection. They will not all achieve that level of investor protection in exactly the same way.<br/>
It is one of the main strengths of a practitioner-based system that, within the overall requirement of providing adequate protection for investors&#x2014;which is what the debate is about&#x2014;it is for the regulator concerned to devise the best way of regulating its members. There is no compromise on the level of investor protection. In every case, the SIB will have to be satisfied that it is adequate. My hon. Friend's amendment could turn out to be not only unnecessary, but harmful.</p>

<p>As I have just explained, the bottom line is what kind of protection is offered to investors. The adequacy test is the same for both categories. There are different routes to achieve that.<br/>
The amendment could be difficult. My hon. Friend will recall that one reason why we are amending the recognition test for the SROs and RPBs is that the original equivalence test was widely interpreted as requiring a close textual comparison of different sets of rules, rather than a comparison of their effects and we should be interested in the effects, I fear that, by reintroducing a formal comparison between the rules of an SRO and the rules of an RPB, the amendment would lead to a similar approach being adopted in the future. I urge the House to reject the amendment.</p>

<p>I am disappointed, and it is noticeable that the Government have changed their ground. I sought to cater for the objection put up to my original amendment, yet we now have a completely different objection, which was not even mentioned in Committee. As three months have passed since that debate, I thought that I would ask a few of the RPBs whether they would mind if the core rules were applied to them. The other day, I went to the Insurance Brokers Registration Council, about which I was fairly critical in Committee. The council members are clearly not the people who are responsible for this failure of the core rules to apply to the RPBs. The council, which is an RPB, told me that it would be happy for the core rules to apply to its members. Will my hon. Friend the Minister tell me who objects?</p>

<p>The new clauses are to be inserted in place of the present clause 200, which is removed by amendment No. 259. The new clauses merely set out the arrangements for Northern Ireland. On the face of it, it seems curious that some provisions extend to the Province, whereas others, even in the same part, do not. It may be appropriate for me to take a few moments to explain how that has occurred. Traditionally, and constitutionally, it has been practice for the Northern Ireland authority to cary out most of the executive functions of Government, including in particular most company law functions.<br/>
Under the developed powers of the Northern Ireland Act 1974 provisions may be enacted by an Order in Council and this procedure is intended for provisions in the Bill affecting company law and insolvency law. However, some enactments amended in the Bill, notably the Financial Services Act 1986 and the Fair Trading Act 1973, were, in the main, introduced to apply on a United Kingdom basis. We therefore had to follow suit with amendments to those acts.<br/>
Inevitably there have been some new provisions in the Bill which do not follow any precedent-part IX on transfer of securities is such an example. In those cases we have taken the advice of the Northern Ireland authorities in deciding which procedure to follow.<br/>
I hope that that explains the pattern. The amendments being made simply reflects changes made in the Bill and I hope, set out the provisions a little more clearly than before.</p>

<p>Some doubt has been expressed as whether debts that were not due and payable at the commencement of a bankruptcy could be incorporated in a set off under section 323 of the Insolvency Act 1986. A set-off is a device by which a creditor can add up all his credits and debits with an insolvent person and claim the net figure.<br/>
The doubt particularly concerns contingent creditors such as guarantors of the bankrupt's debt since the


guarantor is often called upon after the commencement of the bankruptcy. The present clause seeks to deal with that perceived doubt by omitting the word "due". It has also been simplified in its construction. The clause may well have clarified the position of some contingent claims, but only by potentially widening the scope of those claims capable of being included in the set off. The extent of that widening could be considerable. It is desirable as far as possible to maintain the principle of pari passu or fair distribution in insolvency.<br/>
To avoid creating fresh uncertainty we have decided that it would be preferable to delete the clause from the Bill. In taking that decision we have borne in mind that the current law has not been fully tested in the courts. In all the circumstances it is sensible and desirable to delete the clause and allow the existing law to develop. British law thrives on cases and individual decisions&#x2014;</p>

<p>My amendment proposes that certain provisions of the Bill should be brought into effect upon Royal Assent. The first set compromises certain of the provisions on mergers in part VI of the Bill, the most important of which concern the new powers to accept undertakings to divest instead of making a reference, the temporary restrictions on share dealings once a reference has been made and the improved powers for looking at creeping acquisitions. We consider that those provisions will be of sufficient immediate use to warrant early introduction and will not, on the other hand, impinge unfairly on business.<br/>
The other provision covered is clause 187. That amends section 195 of the Financial Services Act 1986, which increases from one year to five the maximum maturity which certain debentures may have if they are to be offered without a prospectus.<br/>
The change is one of a number of measures announced in the Chancellor's Budget to unify the short-term corporate bond and sterling commercial paper markets.</p>

<p>That was a very nice welcome from my colleagues, and I thank them.<br/>
I am grateful for this opportunity to raise the case of Mr. Ronald Cannon, a constituent of mine who is currently serving a prison sentence of four years at Swaleside prison, Kent. Mr. Cannon is a reformed heroin addict, and like most people who have had that unfortunate experience he found it difficult to break free from the circumstances of his addiction and those who surrounded him. As a result, in October 1988 he was sentenced to prison for conspiring to supply controlled drugs.<br/>
On the face of it, that would not appear to be anything other than a straightforward case, with which I would not have bothered this House. However, three facts surround the circumstances in which Mr. Cannon is being held in prison. They should be brought to the attention of the House, and they are the subject of the debate.<br/>
There are three reasons for my concern. First, through incompetent administration by those responsible for keeping Mr. Cannon's records, he has been deprived of the opportunity that he should have been given to seek a second review of his suitability for parole. Because of that, he has been deprived of the chance of obtaining his freedom and is now languishing in jail. I am not concerned with the merits of whether that parole should be granted, only with the circumstances by which he has been denied the opportunity to put his case.<br/>
Secondly, it has been brought to my attention, from two separate sources&#x2014;Mr. Cannon and his prison visitor that&#x2014;my intervention in an attempt to expedite his case has in fact had the reverse effect. The House will no doubt agree with me that should that prove to be the case, it would be extremely serious; no Member of Parliament could properly represent his constituents if he thought that the result of his doing so would be to prejudice that constituent's circumstances.<br/>
Thirdly, during my investigations into what has happened to Mr. Cannon, I discovered that his case is representative of a great many of those who are seeking parole and that the whole system of parole has broken down. I shall ask the Minister to do the root and branch reform of the system of parole and remission suggested in 1988 by my noble Friend Lord Carlisle of Bucklow and his review committee on the parole system in England and Wales.<br/>
I shall deal first with the matter of Mr. Cannon's freedom, because that is probably the most important of the three points that I shall deal with. I can do no better in an effort to explain the circumstances than to read the letter which I received from Mr. Jennings, the prison visitor to whom I referred. Mr. Jennings wrote to me in a letter of 4 October in respect of my constituent. The letter states:
<q>I write as a member of the Board of Visitors at Swaleside Prison in Kent, a member of the Parole Review Committee and a Magistrate.</q>


<q>Over many months, I have been trying to assist Mr. Cannon in connection with his second parole review.</q>
<q>Unfortunately, when he was sentenced no-one noticed that he had already served 15/16 months on Remand in Custody. As a result, all his dates were wrongly calculated, and entered in his records&#x2014;it took many months for this to be put right, and by this time he was already overdue for his first Parole Review. This was eventually completed, and not surprisingly, he was unsuccessful&#x2014;The committee no doubt thinking that he would have another opportunity at his second review.</q>
My involvement in this arose when I wrote to the predecessor of my hon. Friend the Minister on 7 June and asked him to look into the circumstances whereby Mr. Cannon had been kept waiting for the result of the Parole Board sitting that had occurred in February. Mr. Cannon had been waiting for about four months and I therefore wrote to the Minister asking when he would be given the result of the Parole Board decision. He received it four days later, but I did not know that because I received no reply to my letter until the end of August, by which time I had written a second letter to the Minister.<br/>
In the considerable correspondence that I have had with my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State and his predecessor, no one mentioned to me that Mr. Cannon's period on remand in custody had not been taken into account when dealing with the date of his parole review. It is dreadful that he has not been granted a second parole review. The reason for that is set out in the latest letter which I received from my hon. Friend the Minister:
<q>Mr. Cannon does not qualify for another parole review as, under Rule 6(6) of the Local Review Committee Rules 1967, a prisoner is not eligible for a further statutory parole review unless there is a period of 16 months or more between the previous review and the earliest date of release. In Mr. Cannon's case this period amounts to less than 14 months; he must therefore I am afraid, serve to his earliest date of release which is currently 2 April 1990.</q>
That does not take into account the fact that the date of Mr. Cannon's first parole review was wrong, and was heard too late. Therefore, he should have had the opportunity of two parole reviews. That is why I say that he has been deprived of the opportunity to argue again for freedom earlier than he can now expect.<br/>
The second question that I wish to raise is whether my intervention has helped or hindered Mr. Cannon's case. My attention was drawn to the danger that he might have been prejudiced by my intervention by a letter that he wrote to me at the end of August. The letter states:
<q>Today I have seen one of the prison governors to get them to expedite my answer.</q>
By that he meant the answer to a petition that he had sent to the Home Office immediately upon receiving the refusal of his first parole review in June. The letter continues:
<q>I have just been told that because I wrote to you voicing my disappointment with the parole decision my petition was withdrawn and not even looked at. But today it has gone back into the pending tray. Four months I have been waiting for an answer.</q>
As a result of that letter, I wrote on 7 September to my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State:
<q>I am concerned that the fact that Mr. Cannon wrote to me may have jeopardized his position, and I find it hard to see why someone who is a 'prison trusty', allowed out on home leave, should be found unsuitable for parole.</q>
<q>I would much appreciate it if you would satisfy yourself that my intervention has not had an adverse effect on Mr. Cannon's position.</q>
I did not receive an answer to that letter until 17 October and in that letter, my hon. Friend says:

<q>Finally, I should add that a reply to Mr. Cannon's petition was forwarded to the prison on 12 September and reassure you that your intervention in Mr. Cannon's cases did not adversely affect consideration of it.</q>
Unfortunately, I cannot entirely accept that answer as being accurate, because in the letter that I received from Mr. Jennings, and that I was quoting earlier, Mr. Jennings also has something to say about the circumstances in which Mr. Cannon was prejudiced by my intervention.<br/>
He continues in his letter of 4 October as follows:
<q>He has tried every avenue open to him without success and the last time I telephoned London"&#x2014;</q>
by London he meant the Parole Board in London, as I confirmed on the telephone to him&#x2014;
<q>about his case I was told &#x2026; 'Unfortunately, Cannon has involved a Member of Parliament and this will cause further delay."'</q>
I cannot accept that my intervention on 7 June should still be causing further delay by the time that Mr. Jennings was talking to the parole board in London. I cannot accept that my intervention, in any circumstances, considering that it was by making a specific request that review of the case be expedited, should have caused delay in reviewing his case.<br/>
I wish my hon. Friend to investigate who made that comment to Mr. Jennings. Unfortunately, he was not able to say who had said it to him. Secondly, will he find the person who told Mr. Cannon that my intervention had caused his petition to be put aside. Thirdly, are these facts accurate? Fourthly, will he take whatever necessary action is due to be taken, either in regard to why that information was wrongly given to Mr. Cannon and Mr. Jennings, or why that delay took place? The latter would be a much more serious event than if the former had proved to have been made inaccurately, by an employee in the Home Office or in the Parole Board offices.<br/>
My last point concerns parole generally. Having made some inquiries as a result of being alarmed by the way in which Mr. Cannon had been treated, I discovered that the parole system is largely breaking down. Mr. Jennings told me that he has at least 10 cases a week about which he is deeply concerned and in which parole is failing to come up accurately or in time. He told me that in some instances, he even has cases where the parole review decision is not announced until the prisoner concerned has already been released on remission, and sometimes months later.<br/>
My hon. Friend is aware of what Lord Carlisle proposes in his review. In paragraph 299, Lord Carlisle recommends a root-and-branch reform of the parole and remission systems. I warmly endorse the proposals made in that report, and urge my hon. Friend to implement them as soon as possible. The parole system is ineffective. It is dealing with 26,000 cases a year, when it was set up and structured to deal with only 4,000 or 5,000. The projections are that, if trends continue, by the early 1990s, it will deal with 33,000. Such an escalation of the number of people being investigated for parole would make this system inoperable, and unless the Government take action, we shall shortly have a chaotic and appalling situation.<br/>
I ask my hon. Friend to do that, and to see to it that Mr. Cannon, notwithstanding the general rule, gets a further opportunity to apply for parole, because as I understand it, and as Mr. Jennings has been told, that second review should be granted if his first review had been properly


carried out in terms of his early imprisonment on remand awaiting trial. Will he also undertake the investigations that I have asked for?</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Upminster (Sir N. Bonsor) for raising the case of Mr. Cannon and providing me with an opportunity to address the House on the important subjects of parole and Mr. Cannon's particular circumstances. My hon. Friend has raised especially Mr. Jennings's letter this evening, and it is the first time that I have heard of it. According I shall not comment on its contents, which I have not seen. However, my hon. Friend has asked me to investigate its contents, and I shall do so. I shall take extremely seriously anything written to a colleague or to myself from a member of a board of prison visitors. I have no reason to believe that my hon. Friend's intervention, as I stated when I wrote to him, had any effect on the outcome of the parole consideration, nor on the dates.<br/>
Perhaps it would be useful if I gave some background both to the parole system, as my hon. Friend made a number of remarks on the way that it is working now, and on Mr. Cannon's case. All prisoners serving determinate sentences of more than a year are eligible for parole. Their parole eligibility date marks the earliest date on which they can be released on licence if the parole board so recommends. It is important to remember that no one may be released early on licence without a positive rcommendation either from the local review committee acting on behalf of the Parole Board, or from the Parole Board itself. A prisoner becomes eligible for parole either when he has served one third of his sentence&#x2014;taking into account any time spent on remand&#x2014;or six months after the sentence has been passed, whichever is later. That is, I think, an essential part of the misunderstanding which clearly exists in this case.<br/>
Mr. Cannon was remanded by Havering magistrates court on 5 August 1987; committed by it on 10 November 1987; and tried at the Central Criminial court and sentenced on 26 October 1988 to four years' imprisonment for conspiracy to supply class A controlled drugs. Mr. Cannon's parole eligibility date was calculated to be 26 April 1989. As hon. Members will readily calculate, this means that in Mr. Cannon's case, his PED was six months after the start of his sentence, rather than one third the way through.<br/>
All cases are considered first by the local review committee or LRC as it is commonly called, at the prison where the inmate is held. The timing of the LRC meeting depends on the length of the sentence. Generally, for sentences of up to two years, the LRC will consider the case about eight weeks before PED. For longer sentence cases&#x2014;and Mr. Cannon's case falls in this class&#x2014;the review is generally held three and a half to four months before that date.<br/>
There are two objectives to these timing arrangements. First, to maximise the time available for observation and reporting in the establishment before the parole review. Perhaps I could remind my hon. Friend that parole review is definitely not re-sentencing. The parole selection procedure is based not merely on the evidence and reports available to the judge at the time of sentencing. In

addition, a large number of reports on the prisoner drawn from a number of sources are prepared&#x2014;from prison officers in various parts of the prison who may come into contact with the prisoner in his daily life; prison governing staff; prison medical staff; chaplains; prison probation staff; and importantly, a home circumstance report prepared by a probation officer from the probation service which would offer supervision in the event of early release on licence. These reports take some time to prepare and it is only fair that they are based on a reasonable period of observation. It is for this reason that we allow six months as a very minimum time in which to prepare and consider the reports.<br/>
The second objective is to allow sufficient time for the rest of the selection procedure to be followed and for the establishment to be notified of the parole decision in sufficient time for the inmate to be released on the parole eligibility date, or its anniversary, if parole is granted. In Mr. Cannon's case, the LRC at Wandsworth considered the reports on 9 February 1989, just over 11 weeks before his PED.<br/>
Mr. Cannon's offence did not fall in those categories of cases which can be decided on the advice of the local review committee alone. It was therefore referred to the Parole Board for a further review. Mr. Cannon's case was considered by the board on 2 June 1989. As my hon. Friend will know, the Parole Board did not find Mr. Cannon suitable for early release on licence; and accordingly the Home Secretary had no power to grant parole. Notification of this decision was sent to Swaleside prison where Mr. Cannon was then located on 12 June; and he was informed accordingly.<br/>
Naturally, Mr. Cannon was disappointed with the outcome of this parole review. He has drawn to my hon. Friend's attention the fact that he is a "prison trusty" allowed out on home leave and yet denied parole. Hon. Members will be aware that although an inmate's behaviour in prison is one of the factors considered by the Parole Board, other aspects are also reviewed. The Parole Board regularly publishes its criteria for parole selection in its annual report. It considers each case carefully under six headings. The first is the nature of the offence. The Parole Board has due regard to the public's concern about early release of inmates already convicted of offences of violence or those which jeopardise public safety. Although each case is considered individually, cases involving trafficking in drugs such as heroin are bound to cause concern.<br/>
The second heading relates to an inmate's criminal and other history. The incidence and frequency of previous offending, having regard to the nature of offences, is used as a guide to the probability of reoffending. Obviously, many previous convictions indicate, in the absence of other factors, a high probability of reoffending. Other indicators of this are persistent offending since an early age, short intervals at liberty between convictions and a record of employment which is poor in terms of the quality of the jobs and the lengths of continuous employment. If an inmate has previously been under the supervision of the probation service, his response to that may be relevant to his likely response to parole supervision. I have no doubt that the Parole Board will have reviewed Mr. Cannon particularly carefully under this heading.<br/>
The third category is prison behaviour and response to treatment. As I have said, the main bulk of the dossier will consist of reports by various prison officials who know the prisoner well. These reports build up a picture of what the


prisoner has done and in what light he has shown himself since his conviction. In general, bad conduct in prison is a factor against parole and good conduct a favourable factor. But many recidivists are well experienced at playing the system, so prison behaviour&#x2014;which may have little bearing on behaviour outside the prison walls&#x2014;has to be regarded in light of other factors.<br/>
The fourth heading is medical considerations. In this case, where Mr. Cannon's offence involved drugs, medical reports will be of crucial importance as regards the chances of the prisoner reoffending and the possible gravity of further offences.<br/>
Fifthly, the inmate's home circumstances and employment prospects on release are considered. Home circumstances and employment prospects can be critical for success on parole. A good home, a job to go to and the absence of the circumstances and temptations which led to the earlier crime are factors favourable to parole.<br/>
The sixth and final heading is co-operation with parole supervision. The supervision of a parolee by a probation officer during the parole period is an essential part of the parole scheme. It is always difficult to be sure about this. However, a previous failure on parole or a failure on probation may make co-operation doubtful.<br/>
Each case is carefully considered against these criteria. For this reason there is no mileage in comparing Mr. Cannon's case with those of any co-defendants. The Parole Board will consider each individual's circumstances. Mr. Cannon has drawn my hon. Friend's attention to his good prisoner behaviour. I am sure that the Parole Board will have taken that into account. It will also have taken into account his criminal record&#x2014;and I should have liked to have given the House an account of that&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>I accept what my hon. Friend is saying but as I said at the outset, I am not arguing that he should have been given parole at that review. The point that I was making&#x2014;and the point that Mr. Jennings made strongly to me in the letter from which I quoted&#x2014;was that one reason why the parole review board might have turned down his original application was on the understanding that he could have another. I should be grateful if my hon. Friend would address that point.</p>

<p>I have partly addressed that point and will return to it. As this is part of a continuing exchange, it is worth making it clear that the Parole Board makes its own decisions, which the Home Secretary and myself can in no way alter. If the circumstances of which my hon. Friend's constituent has complained are such that he is surprised at the result, that must be part of my reply.<br/>
It is an important part of my reply to show that on the information that is available to me the result is not at all surprising. However, I accept what my hon. Friend says and I hope that he will accept that there is nothing about the background of the case that makes the Parole Board's decision in the least bit surprising.<br/>
I am satisfied that Mr. Cannon's case was considered thoroughly and carefully by the Parole Board, and, alas, he must serve until his earliest date of release, which at present is 2 April 1990, as my hon. Friend said.<br/>
But although Mr. Cannon is serving a four-year sentence, during which he might normally have expected a second review, he does not qualify for a further review.

The local review committee rules provide that an inmate is not eligible for a further statutory parole review unless there is a period of 16 months or more between the previous local review committee review and the earliest date of release.<br/>
In Mr. Cannon's case, owing to the time that he spent on remand from 10 November 1987 to 25 October 1988, he was required to serve the full six months minimum qualifying period before his parole eligibility date. That was the point that I made at the beginning of my remarks and where the root of the misunderstanding probably lies.<br/>
The local review committee review may take place only up to four months earlier than that date. For Mr. Cannon, that meant that the very first date on which his case might have been eligible for local review committee consideration would have been 26 December 1988. Even at this relatively late hour, those hon. Members who are present will readily be able to appreciate that Boxing day 1988 was less than 16 months before the earliest date of release of 2 April 1990. I recognise that it falls short by a mere three weeks, but I am sure that my hon. Friend will appreciate that the line must be drawn somewhere. Mr. Cannon's local review committee review actually took place on 9 February, just under 14 months before his earliest date of release. But if it had happened at the earliest point that it could have done, he would still not have been eligible for a second one.<br/>
I am aware that fine footwork is involved in the timing of parole reviews, and decisions about the eligibility of second and subsequent reviews are not an easy matter to understand, particularly at this time of night. I appreciate how difficult it must be for Mr. Cannon and his family and my hon. Friend to accept the Parole Board's decision and to know that because of the time that he spent on remand he is not eligible for a further review.<br/>
I am also sorry that it should have take so long to complete the first review. Here I come to one of my hon. Friend's major points. The delays that have plagued the parole system are a sad reflection on the increasing number of cases and, until recently, the inability of the Home Office parole unit to keep pace. But I reject my hon. Friend's suggestion that the system is breaking down. It is plagued by heavy delays, but within those delays it works effectively. Parole delays cause unnecessary anxiety to inmates and their families and lead to problems for the staff in the prisons. They are unacceptable and we have taken some firm steps to eliminate them. We have reorganised the parole unit, streamlined procedures and authorised and recruited additional staff. The Home Secretary has appointed additional members to the Parole Board and the board is considering additional cases at each panel sitting. We took those measures several months ago, but already they are beginning to bear fruit.<br/>
We are now seeing the first signs of real improvement and there are no longer any significant delays on cases that do not go the Parole Board but stay with the local review committees, but there are still some delays with the Parole Board. I am sure that the worst of the delays are now being eliminated and we are considering what further changes and reforms are needed to reduce those delays still further and then eliminate them altogether. I am sure that that will be achieved, if not this year, certainly during the first half of next year. That is our intention.<br/>
I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising this difficult case. I shall look at the letter from Mr. Jennings, to which he referred, and follow it back to its source. But on the


timing of the review and on the decision that there is no opportunity under the rules for a second review, the letters that I and my predecessor have sent to my hon. Friend are correct. But I realise that the situation is complex.</p>
