<p>I have been asked to reply. There is no risk of any confusion between prisoners of war and civilian internees sent to the Dominions. As regards the latter, my right hon. Friend is fully alive to the necessity for supplying to the Government of any Dominion to which internees have been, or may be, sent as much information as possible regarding them, in order to ensure proper discrimination in their treatment. A communication on the subject has already been sent to the Government of Canada, which is the only Dominion that has yet received any internees, and one will shortly be sent to Australia, to which country internees are now on their way. It is hoped to make arrangements, in consultation with the Governments of Canada and Australia, for the return to this country of those whose release can properly be authorised.</p>

<p>Coal was by far the largest item of our exports both to France and Italy. Since the war, the total volume of all exports to France had much increased, and considerable changes also took place in the make-up of the trade, owing to France's situation and war needs: In this period, indeed, our exports were made more to assist our Ally in the struggle against the common enemy than for commercial reasons, and the loss of the French market must not therefore be regarded as comparable in its effects with the loss of a neutral market taking a similar amount of exports. A considerable proportion of the goods exported to France would have been very valuable to our own war effort. Every effort is being made to find other markets for those goods which do not fall into this category. Of these, coal is much the most important and, as my hon. Friend the Secretary for Mines stated in reply to a Question on 23rd July, the coal industry is being consulted as to the best methods to promote this trade.</p>

of little consequence, despite the fact that we exported coal and other commodities which are of primary importance; and can he rely entirely on the good will and the efforts of the coal industry in regard to facilities in the search for new markets?</p>

<p>German occupation of the West European coastline from the North Cape to the Pyrenees has greatly changed the conditions of the economic war. The German Armies have succeeded in overrunning large parts of Western Europe, but the overseas imports which they require are still barred from the seas commanded by the Royal Navy. Many fewer ships are now engaged on legitimate neutral trade between Europe and the Americas. Moreover, we must now control, not only shipping approaching the Mediterranean or the North Sea, but all shipping crossing the Atlantic. To apply this control in the old way would mean diverting many ships far out of their course to contraband bases in British waters, either in this island or in West Africa. To avoid imposing such grave inconveniences upon shippers, shipowners and crews, His Majesty's Government have decided to extend the navicert system to all seaborne goods consigned to any European port, as well as to certain Atlantic islands and to certain neutral ports in North Africa. In future ships sailing from a neutral port to any such destination must obtain navicerts for all items of cargo, and in addition a ship navicert at the last port of loading. Any consignment not navicerted and any ship without a ship navicert, will henceforth be liable to seizure by our patrols. The same rules will apply to outgoing trade. Ships sailing from European ports, or from certain Atlantic islands, or from certain neutral ports in North Africa must have certificates of non-enemy origin for


all items of their cargoes, and any ship whose cargo is not fully certificated will be liable to be seized together with all uncertificated items of the cargo. An Order-in-Council giving effect to these changes will be issued forthwith.<br/>
It has been suggested in some quarters that we intend to extend the blockade to certain neutral countries. This is not so. Where supplies can reach such neutrals without the risk of falling into the hands of the enemy we shall grant navicerts on such a scale as to allow imports adequate for domestic consumption, but not for reexport to other countries. Moreover, it will be the policy of His Majesty's Government not merely to allow such adequate supplies to pass through our controls, but to assist neutral countries to obtain them. These measures will greatly benefit those engaged in honest neutral trade. Delays in such trade, due to the exercise of our controls, will be much reduced. At the same time, a heavy blow will be struck at those who seek to elude our controls and to carry supplies either to or from the enemy. Our friends will be further encouraged, and our enemies discomforted, by some ingenious provisions which my right hon. Friend the Minister of Shipping will, I understand, immediately announce.<br/>
Finally, I would recall that on 2nd July I informed the House that contraband control had been extended to French territory under enemy control and that no goods were being allowed to reach the enemy through unoccupied France. After a most careful review of all the circumstances, His Majesty's Government have now decided, with regret, that in present conditions they must treat all metropolitan France, as well as Algeria, Tunisia and French Morocco, in the same manner, for the purposes of contraband and enemy export control, as enemy-controlled territory. Goods destined for these territories are, therefore, liable to be seized as contraband and goods originating in, or owned by persons in, such territories, are liable to be placed in prize. These steps, which I have now announced, are designed to smooth the path of genuine neutral trade, while increasing the strength of our blockade and avoiding all unnecessary calls upon the Royal Navy.</p>

<p>Shipments of oil and oil products to Spain from America during the first half of this year have been substantially greater than during the corresponding period of last year. Before the collapse of France the only route by which oil could reach Germany from Spain was by sea across the Western Mediterranean and through Italy, and we relied upon French naval patrols to prevent such traffic. Since the collapse of France many features of the situation have become obscure, and I am sending an officer of my Ministry to Spain this week in order to confer with the Spanish authorities and with His Majesty's Ambassador at Madrid. The desire of His Majesty's Government is to enable Spain to receive adequate supplies of oil for her own internal consumption, but not for re-export, and to maintain her oil stocks at a reasonable and steady level.</p>

<p>The silver war badge was instituted in 1916 for those who had been discharged as physically unfit, and was intended for wear with civilian clothes. It was later permitted to be worn with uniform by those who rejoined, but this concession was withdrawn in 1922, when the wearing of wound stripes and chevrons denoting overseas service also ceased.</p>

<p>While I have every sympathy with the representations made by my hon. and gallant Friend, a change of title would involve many consequential alterations in documents, badges and the like, and I do not think I should be justified in recommending it at the present time.

<p>asked the Secretary of State for War whether he is prepared to support a scheme for affording convalescent treatment, with adequate family allowances over the period, to all men discharged from the Army with a health breakdown following a short period of Army service, after having been initially passed by a medical board, so enabling many such men to become fit to resume the remunerative jobs they vacated on being called up?</p>

<p>Provision is made for men who are discharged as medically unfit for further service in that each soldier so discharged is granted one month's furlough with pay and allowances. Normally, the man goes home as soon as it is decided to discharge him, and this provision enables him to have a month's rest if he so desires in which to adapt himself once more to civilian conditions. After the expiration of the month's furlough, if the disability is attributable to service during the war, the man will receive from the Ministry of Pensions any award of pension appropriate to his case, with family allowance if permissible.</p>

<p>asked the Secretary of State for War what is the explanation of the order issued from Royal Engineer records requiring that all non-commissioned officers who have not held their rank for 90 days and who were evacuated from France, south of the Somme, shall revert to the rank held before the 90-day limit, seeing that many of the men affected have been on active service since the outbreak of the war and fully earned their promotion?</p>

<p>I think my hon. Friend is under a misapprehension. Under the ordinary rules for promotion in war, acting rank is only granted to personnel actually with their units and is held, apart from short absences of less than 21 days, only for so long as they are performing the duties for which such rank is granted, except that if they have held acting rank for three months it is automatically confirmed into war substantive rank. According to a strict interpretation of these rules, a soldier who became detached from his unit during the fighting and evacuation and who, in consequence, ceased to perform the duties for which such rank was given would automatically relinquish it after 20 days' absence. Instructions were issued, however, to protect the soldier from the operation of the normal rules and to allow him, even if he were separated from his unit during the evacuation, to retain his acting rank pending the reorganisation of units. Whether a soldier continued in his acting rank after the reorganisation had been completed would depend upon whether or not he was performing the duties of his acting rank.</p>

<p>Am I to understand from that answer that there may be men who were involved in the evacuation from France on the various occasions who have not been able to ascertain their full rights in this matter and that they are entitled to apply for them, and have been reduced in rank in consequence of their service overseas?</p>

<p>asked the Secretary of State for War whether arrangements have been made for home leave for all British Expeditionary Force men who have returned to this country, and what is the nature of same; have free railway warrants been issued for such leave, and is it a special and not one of the regulation leaves; and how many leaves per annum with free warrants are granted to members of the Forces?</p>

<p>The expression "enemy alien" merely means a foreigner who is the subject of a State at war with His Majesty.

<p>I have been asked to reply. I am sorry if the hon. Member has experienced difficulty in obtaining information regarding, or permits to visit, internees. I understand that there has been a very large number of applications for permission to visit internees on business matters, and that the Prisoners of War Department of the War Office have been endeavouring to regulate the grant of permits in accordance with the relative urgency of the requests, and, in particular, to give priority to visits to internees who are going overseas.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman really answered this Question before I asked it. I wanted to raise the point of Order why this Question was being answered by someone other than the Prime Minister, in view of the fact that for the last eight days I, personally, have been sent from one Department to another and have found nether knowing which was responsible for this matter. For that reason I put the Question down to the Prime Minister because of the lack of co-ordination between two Departments.</p>

<p>May I ask a Supplementary Question, then, on the answer given? Is the hon. Gentleman aware that at the end of eight days' investigation, of the kind to which I have referred, I was told by a representative of the War Office that no permits were being given to allow internees to be seen by their legal advisers except in such cases as those under which powers of attorney had already been given or the internee was immediately proceeding overseas?</p>

<p>Obviously, it is all important that internees should have an opportunity of consulting with their legal advisers. There has been a large number of applications to visit internees, and I understand that the rules laid down by the Prisoners of War Department have had to be modified on the lines of the answer I have already given. If I may explain about the lack of co-ordination referred to in the hon. Member's Question, it is, I think, partly due to the fact that the hon. Member approached the Private Secretary to the Under-Secretary of State for War on a matter in which he is professionally concerned, and a civil servant, placed in a difficult position like that, does not know if an hon. Member is approaching him as a matter of public interest or in his professional capacity. The natural inclination of a civil servant when placed in a dilemma of that kind is to pass the responsibility on to somebody else.</p>

<p>The course of the war has made necessary new measures for the control of shipping. A large volume of shipping is already under British and Allied control, and this includes a substantial tonnage of neutral shipping on British time charter. While His Majesty's Government remain prepared to take further tonnage upon charter, they propose other measures to ensure that so far as possible shipping which is not controlled by the Allies will not find employment in trades which would in any way benefit the enemy.<br/>
Hitherto, the widespread and important shipping facilities under British control have been freely available to all vessels. Such facilities include the provision of bunkers, dry-docking and repairing, insurance, stores and many minor services. It is not reasonable that these facilities should continue to be freely available to shipowners who do not render commensurate service in return, or to those who fail to satisfy His Majesty's Government that they will refrain from carrying on trade which would be injurious to the Allied war effort. The possession of a ship's navicert for every voyage to which the navicert system applies will be essential. Neutral owners who have not already entered into satisfactory arrangements on these lines are invited to do so, and to supply His Majesty's Government with such particulars as may be necessary to establish the character of the trade on which their ships are engaged. Those who give acceptable undertakings will receive for each of their ships a pass called a ship's warrant which will assure them of continued access to the available commercial shipping facilities under British control. Ships which are unable to produce a ship's warrant will be subject to separate inquiries on each occasion on which they desire facilities under British control. This must at least mean delay and inconvenience. I hope that all shipowners affected will lose no time in signing the necessary undertaking themselves or instructing their London representatives to do so.<br/>
The scheme comes into operation forthwith. Shipowners or their representatives desirous of participating in the scheme can obtain information as to the undertaking required and as to the scheme generally by application to the Ministry of Shipping.</p>

<p>A week ago the Government were led to believe that there was a desire in the House to have a Debate about foreign affairs, and that it was the wish of the House for it to take place in secret, so that Members of all parties could say what they really felt about foreign countries without any danger of adding to the number of those countries with which we are at present at war. It is always the desire and also the duty of the Government, so far as possible, to meet the wishes of the House, and arrangements were accordingly made for this afternoon. However, it appears that some of the newspapers prefer that the Debate should take place in public, and we are assured that secrecy is undemocratic, especially in times of war, that it would be wrong for Members of Parliament to have privileges in matters of information not enjoyed by the whole mass of the nation, and that the Government should take the nation and the enemy fully into their confidence and let the whole world see plainly exactly how and where they stand in relation to all other countries in the present critical juncture. These arguments, or others like them, seem to have made an impression in various quarters of the House, and the Government are now in the embarrassing position of a servant receiving contradictory orders from those whom their only desire is to serve. We therefore have found means to give the House an opportunity of expressing by Debate and Division, the opinion whether the Debate should be secret or public. Also we have arranged that this preliminary Debate can itself take place under conditions of the fullest publicity. I conclude by moving,
<q>That the remainder of this day's Sitting be a Secret Session and that strangers be ordered to withdraw.</q>
This is a debatable Motion. The Government will not attempt to influence the opinion of the House on the issue. Unless provoked, we shall take no part in the discussion, and Ministers will take no part in the Division, which will be left to the free vote of the House. After that matter has been decided, my right hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs will, at any point in the

Debate that may be convenient, make his statement, either in public or in private, as the House may have decided. He has already, I believe, taken the precaution of preparing two speeches, both, I am sure, excellent, but one somewhat longer than the other.</p>

<p>My hostility to this Motion has already been almost disarmed by the most witty and eloquent speech of my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, but despite the cries of "Divide," which proceed from some of my hon. Friends, I do suggest to the House that a question of some constitutional importance is involved in this issue between secret and open Sessions, and I do not think it is a question which can be disposed of without some form of Debate. [HON. MEMBERS: "For how long?"] That depends upon the character of the Debate and how many people wish to express their opinions on one side or the other. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has made it abundantly clear by his speech that in its genesis this proposal for a Secret Session did not proceed from the Government. Indeed, the Lord Privy Seal in his answers to Questions last week explained that it was not the Government's desire to express any opinion upon the subject, but, he said, there had been expressed in various quarters of the House what he regarded as a majority opinion in favour of a Secret Session. I submit with great respect to the House, whose Members, or at any rate the majority of its Members, I wish to convince, and none of whom I wish to offend, that this is, as I have said, a matter of great importance and that it should be quite clear, if the Debate is to be held in secret, that there is a majority in favour of holding it in secret.<br/>
May I, in the first instance, on the general principle of Secret Sessions, recall to the memory of the House this fact? In the whole of the last war, from 1914 to 1918, when the circumstances on many occasions&#x2014;as, for example, in March, 1918, or earlier&#x2014;were just as serious as they are to-day, only seven Secret Sessions were held, whereas in this Parliament we have already held five, and if


there is one to-day, it will be the sixth. However unpopular this view may be in the House, I feel bound to give voice to it, because it is certainly held outside, that Secret Sessions are a drag on the formation of public opinion. If the whole House were against me on that point, I should still make that statement, because it seems to me self-evident that the Press and the public properly base their opinion directly on the arguments adduced and the facts disclosed in Debate in this House. Therefore, it is unfair to the Press and the public to hold Secret Sessions save in exceptional circumstances. I would also like to say, if it is not impertinent, that both those bodies&#x2014;if I may so term them&#x2014;namely, public opinion and the Press, have, on the whole, behaved exceptionally well in this war. There has been no division of opinion between the public outside and the Press outside and this House, on any question of principle, and I think we owe it to the Press and the public to say so.<br/>
I am now about to say something which may provoke interruption, but which, nevertheless, I believe to be true. This House is not a sort of Sanhedrin or a collection of notables. It derives its authority from, and owes its authority to, the representation of the people. In those circumstances, I maintain, on the question of principle, that Secret Sessions can be justified only in the most exceptional circumstances. Those circumstances clearly arise on occasions when, for example, we are discussing questions of defence. Obviously there are occasions when defence should be discussed in private. For example, if it were found necessary in the course of the war to remove two or three high officers from positions in the Army or the Navy and if it would, obviously, be impracticable and impolitic to discuss the matter in public, then there should be a Secret Session. I see quite clearly, as an old Member of the House, that I have not the House on my side in this matter, but I say clearly, and I shall continue to assert with the greatest confidence, that Secret Sessions should be very much the exception rather than the rule, and I claim that public opinion outside and nearly all the Press hold that view very strongly.<br/>
Some hon. Members asked how long this Debate would last, and I wish to set an example by being as succinct as possible, but I would ask the House to consider for a moment what are the circumstances which justify a Secret Session in the opinion of this mysterious majority&#x2014;and I am not seeking to controvert what was said by my right hon. Friend the Lord Privy Seal&#x2014;which is supposed to exist in the House and was, no doubt, represented by those who shouted "Divide" when I rose to speak. What are the reasons which in their opinion would justify us in holding this particular Debate in secret? Surely this is not the time and not the occasion for giving even the suggestion of secret diplomacy. At one time we were told by opponents of the late Government and by others that one of the things which was doing this country harm, was secret diplomacy. Such a charge would be ridiculous if brought against us to-day, and yet it is bound to be brought against us, if we discuss foreign affairs in secret.<br/>
There is another matter which is, I think, of some importance, though my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister in his most charming speech indicated, if I may say so without impertinence, that the whole question was not of great moment. I should have thought there is a real danger at the present time, with the fantastic and wicked lies and propaganda which are being used on the part of certain enemy countries, that it would be suggested, particularly after what happened a fortnight ago&#x2014;ridiculous as that suggestion would be&#x2014;that we intended in some mysterious way to discuss in our Secret Session what the peace terms to Hitler would be. If any hon. Member is prepared to deny that, and to say that there is no chance that Dr. Goebbels would do any such thing; if any hon. Member is prepared to say that he knows Dr. Goebbels better than I do, and that Dr. Goebbels would never make such a suggestion, let him get up and say so.<br/>
I do not wish to anticipate the course of the subsequent Debate. It would be very wrong, on this Motion, to do so. But I do suggest&#x2014;in fact, it is well known&#x2014;that the two main reasons which have actuated the majority who are said to have asked for this Secret Session, are that they wish to discuss our diplomatic


and political relationships with two great countries, one of them in Europe and the other in Asia, and they think, because that relationship is difficult and delicate, at the present time, it would, therefore, be better to discuss it in secret. I ask the House, in all honesty, is that really so? Are we likely to have better relationships with these countries as a result of discussing those relationships in private? I have heard certain arguments used which, frankly, seemed to me to be ridiculous, to the effect that hon. Members might like to put certain views or to ask certain questions which they were not prepared to do in public Debate. If that is so, I suggest that the proper way to put those questions is by a private letter to the Minister. I think it inappropriate and wrong that questions should be put in private on matters of high policy which cannot be put in public. I hope there will be some reply to my arguments. I have not attempted to collect any body of supporters around me. On this matter I am open to conviction, and I am willing to be convinced, if it is shown that I am wrong, but I think even those who disagree with me will regard some of the points which I have put as substantial points, which ought to be considered by a deliberative and representative Assembly.<br/>
I would finish with an admonition and a declaration. I believe this House stands very high in public estimation at the present time. I think its enemies, who have always existed, sometimes in frivolous circles outside, have been silent of late. The House certainly stands higher than it did, for example, in the 'eighties when there were constant disorders over the Irish question, and higher even than it did in the days which the Prime Minister and some other hon. Members will recall, immediately before the last war, when we were often on the verge of fisticuffs. I think this House has never commanded higher respect than it does at the present time. If that be so, what justification is there for holding six Secret Sessions in less than a year when, during the whole of the last war, we held only seven?</p>

<p>I hope my hon. Friend does not suggest that I ever threw a book

at anybody, though I am sometimes, wrongly, associated with that incident. We should be extremely careful on this or any other occasion before embarking lightly upon Secret Sessions. At least reasons for such sittings should be given. In this time, when the lights of freedom are extinguished all over Europe, and when, for obvious reasons, they are dimmed in this country, we should guard its stronghold and its refuge in this House. We in this place are free, proud men and women looking all the world in the face. Let them know how we feel and think and talk. Let them know that our danger may be great, but our determination is greater. There is nothing in the matter of our relationships with foreign Powers which we need be ashamed to say, publicly, in this place.</p>

<p>I never become agitated about ordinary questions of procedure, but I think it is agreed that the principle of the publicity of our proceedings in the House of Commons is important. The public at present take an intense interest in Parliament&#x2014;not only the public of this country, but the public throughout the Empire. On the other hand, those who sit on these benches have, as a party, from time to time suggested that Sessions should be held in secret. In the early days of the war we pressed the Government for these Secret Sessions, sometimes without success. We attached then and we still attach great importance to those discussions, in which questions of defence are at issue, being conducted in private. It is obviously impossible for the Government to disclose all the facts to the public. On the other hand, my hon. Friends and I feel that there is no real case against having a full, frank and free discussion on international affairs. If the Prime Minister suggests that there is information which cannot be made public, he should give the House of Commons an opportunity for which there was a precedent during the last war; that is, to hold the first half of our discussions in public up to, say 7 o'clock. [HON. MEMBERS: "No," and "Divide."] Then Members who wish to speak in public can have their opportunity and those who have information of a secret or confidential character will be able to disclose it in the


latter part of the Debate. I understand from the Prime Minister that the Under-Secretary has two speeches. Let him give one speech in public and the more secret and confidential one later in the Debate.</p>

<p>I do not think this is in the least an easy question to decide by an early Division. There were centuries during which this House considered that its Debates and its Votes ought to be secret. It took nearly a century of agitation before the House discovered that in its own interest its words ought to be published and public, that criticism of the Government was valuable; and even Governments finally supported that view. Today we are reverting over a great part of the world to the fifteenth or sixteenth century, and in exactly the same way this House is trying to revert to type by keeping its discussions secret and to have a certain private privilege over the people in the country&#x2014;[An HON. MEMBER:"No."]&#x2014;It is a privilege to have information given to you which other people do not possess. One of the greatest privileges we enjoy in this House is free access to the Executive.</p>

<p>This is not a matter which we can pass over in the light way in which it was dealt in the Prime Minister's speech. Directly I heard the Prime Minister make that speech I knew there would be no hope of getting freedom of Debate to-day. It is because of my fervent hope that I may convert the Prime Minister for future occasions that I address a few words to the House to-day. It is most important that Debates in this

House should not be private committee Debates, but that they should be open Debates. It has been said over and over again, particularly by my hon. Friends on this side, that it is important that we should be able to cross-examine Ministers privately and get information from them.<br/>
It has often been advocated on these benches that we should have what the French call the committee system, under which there is a committee dealing with, say, foreign affairs which has free but private discussions with Ministers on matters concerning their Departments. That system has great advantages, and it introduces a large number of people to the Executive. We have got round it in this House. Over and over again Members on both sides, in the 1922 Committee or in Labour party meetings, have been addressed in private by Ministers from whom they have got information which is not made public. They are also able at these meetings to give Ministers their strongly held opinions which it would not be desirable to make in public. That course can easily be worked under our present procedure. All we ask is that the Government must not take advantage of their vast majority to prevent public expression of criticism in this House any more than they can do it in the Press. The Press has been the principal critic of the Government for the last few months&#x2014;not a hostile critic, but a critic to stimulate their energy. It would be unfortunate if we gave an opportunity to people outside to say that the House of Commons had abrogated its duty of public criticism in favour of the newspapers.<br/>
Why was this Debate asked for? It was because some of us were afraid of the policy of appeasement which was so disastrous at Munich being extended to the appeasement of Japan or of Spain or of Rumania. Is there any reason why that could not be said by us in public as by the Press? The whole House and country are vitally interested in whether there has been a change in policy in the Foreign Office of this country, and it is urgently necessary that we should express our anxiety lest this extension of the policy of appeasement, long after we had hoped it had ceased to be, should be carried on by the Foreign Office with their tendency to avoid criticism, to carry through their measures, and then to wash


their hands of the consequences. In the last war the whole criticism from what is called the Union of Democratic Control and from all the Left Wing, was against secret diplomacy. Here we are forgetting that and once more contributing to secret diplomacy. It is all very well to say that in Secret Session we can impress the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs.</p>

<p>We hope he agrees with us already. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs is not present. The whole object of public Debate is to back up by criticism in this House the criticism expressed in the country, and, above all, to direct that criticism to the people who are criticised. The people we want to criticise are the permanent officials, of course, through the proper political channels. In open Debate the permanent officials are present under the gallery, and they know what is going on; the OFFICIAL REPORT and the Press report it, but when the criticism is made in Secret Session the permanent officials are not there, the country and the Press are not present. There is only the unfortunate Under-Secretary, who cannot possibly remember all that is said in Debate and is not able to look to his permanent officials for anything, and the Debate is wasted. It has no effect whatever on the people who are actually conducting the affairs of the nation.<br/>
The first objection to a Secret Session is that it gives the public the erroneous impression that something tremendously secret has been divulged. Everybody who has been at any Secret Session knows that every one of them might just as well have been in open Session. [HON. MEMBERS: "No."] I should be glad to</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1940-07-30a.1202.0" colnum="1202" time="">
<p>hear in the subsequent Debate anything which has been said by anybody in Secret Session that could not have been divulged in open Session. The next objection is that the Debate can have no effect upon the people we most wish to affect, namely, the Civil Service and the military heads of the different Service Departments. Then, the holding of a Secret Session impresses the country as a sign of weakness&#x2014;the fact that we are forced to debate a thing in secret. The country is suspicious, and is bound to be suspicious, not so much about what individual Members are doing, but about what the Government are doing, if the subject of debate has to be discussed in secret. Then there is the far worse effect it has upon Goebbels and Goering. Everything that is reported in the OFFICIAL REPORT Goebbels will&#x2014;</p>
