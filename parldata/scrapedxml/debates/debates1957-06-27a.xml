<p>With your permission, Mr. Speaker, and that of the House, I desire to present a Petition from the citizens of the Borough of Hackney, which has been signed by approximately 9,600 residents, including the civic dignitaries, the Worshipful Mayor and Mayoress, leading people of religious thought, trade unionists, housewives and people who are concerned.<br/>
<q>And the Petition</q>
<q>Sheweth that the future of all the peoples of the world including our own British people is endangered by nuclear weapons and that every fresh explosion of a bomb increases the danger both to people now alive and to those yet unborn.</q>
<q>Wherefore your Petitioners pray that the honourable the House of Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland should immediately propose the abolition of nuclear bomb tests through international agreement and any further tests

should be deferred until an answer has been received from interested Governments.</q>
<q>And your Petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.</q>
In view of the fact that I have read the Petition, I do not propose to ask the learned Clerk to read it again.</p>

<p>The campaign of vilification against the police and security forces in Cyprus culminated in a statement by Archbishop Makarios last week. Complaints made to the hon. Member for Cannock (Miss Lee) and the hon.

Member for Eton and Slough (Mr. Brockway) by Cypriot prisoners in Wormwood Scrubs are clearly, by their timing, part of this campaign. Hon. Members will, I am sure, not be misled by the motives of this campaign.<br/>
Archbishop Makarios, who, despite his association with terrorism and murder, has been given every encouragement to put forward constructive ideas on the future of the island, has failed to make any constructive move during his sojourn in Athens. Instead, he devotes himself to making fantastic charges against our fellow-citizens in Cyprus who are carrying out a difficult task with the courage and restraint which are associated with the British police and armed forces everywhere. I know that most hon. Members on both sides of the House who represent these men and men like them in Parliament know that they are not the sort of people likely to commit the acts alleged by Archbishop Makarios in this campaign.<br/>
Nevertheless, the Governor is investigating the allegations of ill-treatment recently made wherever they are framed in sufficiently specific terms to make investigation possible, and as soon as these investigations are completed I will place detailed comments in the Library so that the House can form its own judgment on them. I am, however, satisfied, that these wild charges do not justify a special inquiry.</p>

<p>Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that no investigation by the Governor or the Cyprus Government can possibly allay the very real concern that is felt by numbers of people about this? Is he further aware that not only Greek Cypriots but responsible people in Cyprus have expressed great anxiety about some of the incidents which had been reported, and since he said a week or two ago that the Governor was anxious to clear the good name of the security forces, will he not realise that the only way in which this can be done is by an independent inquiry?</p>

<p>I think that some hon. Members do not perhaps altogether understand the conditions at the moment in Cyprus under which witnesses who wanted to give evidence against statements made under E.O.K.A. pressure would be placed if they were asked to


make those statements to some other inquiry. I am absolutely satisfied that one of the main reasons for this campaign of denigration is to enable E.O.K.A. to discover and to eliminate weaknesses in its own organisation and methods of operation which have enabled the security forces to make such inroads upon it. One of the so-called victims of these charges, in effect, said a week or so ago that there really was no charge to make. He said, "The Church is very powerful here." Does the hon. Gentleman really think that I, or any other responsible person, should set in motion machinery under which that and similar statements would be published in a way which would identify the individuals?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-06-27a.385.0" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Miss Lee" colnum="385" time="">
<p>Is the Minister not aware that it would be quite improper for Cypriot prisoners who are making allegations of maltreatment to be judge and jury in their own case? Is he also aware that the logic which applies to these Cypriot prisoners applies to himself and to the Governor of Cyprus? Is he further aware that, if the situation remains as it now is, in the eyes of the world the British Government have pleaded guilty? [HON. MEMBERS: "Nonsense.] Therefore I ask, if we are to justify the good name of our British soldiers abroad, of which we are all proud, that in their interests as well as in the interest of the honour of the Government, it is absolutely essential that an independent inquiry should be set up?</p>

<p>I cannot accept the hon. Lady's conclusions. Her own visit with the hon. Member for 'Eton and Slough (Mr. Brockway) to Wormwood Scrubs, which the Home Secretary was very ready to facilitate, brought her into contact with a number of men who made charges. These men in Wormwood Scrubs were all examined in the routine manner by the prison medical officers on their arrival last year and at the beginning of this year. I have seen and read carefully every one of the reports.<br/>
No marks, bruises, or anything else suggesting injury or ill-treatment were noticed on any of these men, and no complaints of such ill-treatment were made at the time of their entry into Wormwood Scrubs. Of the men that the hon. Lady saw, four complained when they were in Cyprus of rough treatment in Cyprus,

and those four cases will be dealt with in a statement that I will lay in the Library. I would ask the House to note&#x2014;to put it mildly&#x2014;the curious coincidence in timing between the suggestion made that these two hon. Members should visit Wormwood Scrubs and the statement made by Archbishop Makarios in Athens.</p>

This is a most important topic, and I must submit that it would be quite improper not improper on your part, Mr. Speaker&#x2014;but it would be unworthy if the Colonial Secretary by the vehemence of his language and the length of his replies were to get away with statements which are quite unfounded, especially in so far as they reflect on the conduct and honour of my hon.

<p>Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that the hon. Lady the Member for Cannock (Miss Lee) and I saw the injuries upon nine of these prisoners, and that while many of those injuries might have taken place in ordinary fighting, some, like deep cuts around both wrists, were quite obviously due to other treatment than that? In view of these facts, will he not only investigate these cases but investigate a large number of other cases of which evidence has been given by an independent inquiry for which we have asked?</p>

<p>I am not challenging the hon. Member's belief in what he saw, but I would suggest that it would have been better and probably more valuable to the course of justice if those prisoners had themselves complained to the prison medical officer when they were received at Wormwood Scrubs. I have given an answer. I have read the medical officer's report, and I have given the answer that is based on those reports. As my right hon. Friend the Lord Privy Seal and Home Secretary has told one of the hon. Members who went to Wormwood Scrubs, the prison medical officer is carrying out a further investigation into these matters, and I think the House will hear about it with interest in due course.</p>

<p>A point of order takes precedence of other business, because if something has been done which is out of order I am bound to listen to it before I can go on. On the main point, I remember a similar incident happening when a previous Government were in office and when the then Speaker, my predecessor, deprecated the giving of notice to raise a matter on the Adjournment by the same side of the House as was under cross-examination. I would remind the House of that, and I agree with what my predecessor said. I hope we may now pass on, as notice has been given and I am bound by it.</p>

<p>Is it not an illegitimate procedure and an abuse of the tolerance of the House for an hon.

<q><i>Following is extract from the Governor's speech:</i>
<q>At the same time, and again with the agreement of the Secretary of State and subject to the approval of this Council, I propose to appoint six Unofficial Assistant Ministers. These Assistant Ministers will be expected to relieve the Ministers of many of the executive and administrative responsibilities for the departments which will be allocated to them, the departments having been chosen because the activities affect a large section of the population. In any case it is important that Ministers, if they are to devote themselves to policy, should be free as far as may be possible from such executive and administrative work. The Assistant Ministers would, furthermore, speak for their departments in Legislative Council, and where matters affecting these departments came before Executive Council, would attend meetings of Executive Council and take part in discussions. Finally, Assistant Ministers will have the duty of travelling widely in the territory and of acquiring first-hand information, assessing public opinion and explaining Government's policies. They will also be available to serve as chairmen or members of committees, or to undertake enquiries.</q>
<q>In the very near future I shall be inviting certain individuals to accept appointment as Assistant Ministers; the name of those who have agreed to accept, together with the subjects assigned to them, will then be announced. It is proposed to make these selections on a non-racial basis and no special significance should be attached to any racial balance which my emerge from those selected and prepared to serve as Assistant Ministers in this interim measure in the development of a Ministerial system.</q></q>

<p>I have been asked to reply. It would not be in the public interest to give details of the performance of the various types of nuclear weapons, but so far as danger from test explosions is concerned, the degree of danger from fall-out varies not so much according to the nature of the weapon as according to the manner of its detonation. The degree of danger is negligible when high air bursts are used, as they were in the recent British tests.<br/>
So far as the industrial use of atomic energy is concerned, the safety precautions taken ensure that there is less risk either to the general public or to the staff on the premises, than from many other kinds of industrial activity.<br/>
The latest report of the Medical Research Council was published in June, 1956. Figures for the measurement of fall-out are released periodically by the Atomic Energy Authority, and the two


latest documents have been placed in the Library. It is wrong to suggest that there is a further report which my right hon. Friend has declined to publish.</p>

<p>Is the Leader of the House aware that what I had in mind was that if the Committee system were extended, many hon.

<p>What I was not quite sure about was whether the hon. Member had in mind the idea of Congressional Committees as in the United States.

<p>As the Questions on the Order Paper dealing with telephone intercepts have not been reached, I will, with your permission, and, perhaps, for the convenience of the House, answer these Questions now in the form of this general statement.<br/>
First, as regards the manner in which the power of interception is exercised. Interception is carried out not by the police but by the Post Office, acting on the authority of a warrant of a Secretary of State addressed to the Postmaster-General. The police and the Post Office are well aware that this authority is required; and I am informed that if a Post Office servant intercepts a telephone line and discloses the information obtained contrary to his duty he commits an offence.<br/>
The Secretary of State considers each application to intercept a telephone line individually; permission is not given in relation to categories of offence or in relation to all offences of a given description. Each application is considered in relation to the circumstances of the particular case. No list of categories or offences can, therefore, be given.<br/>
The answer to a further series of Questions is that, as I informed the House on 25th June, I should not be justified in the public interest in disclosing either the number of interceptions authorised or


whether a warrant has been issued in any particular case or in relation to any particular class of persons.<br/>
I have also been asked at whose request or suggestion the results of intercepting were handed over to the Bar Council in a particular case. The answer is as follows:<br/>
On 26th October, 1956, the Attorney-General, as Head of the Bar, referred to the Bar Council a complaint of alleged unprofessional conduct by Mr. Marrinan, in a matter about which evidence had been given in a trial at the Central Criminal Court. The Secretary of the Council asked the police whether any further information was available about Mr. Marrinan's conduct. The only further information in the possession of the police was information obtained in June and July, 1956, as the result of an interception of the telephone line not of the barrister but of a Mr. Hill.<br/>
The Secretary of State authorised disclosure of this information to the Chairman of the Bar Council, the right hon. and learned Member for St. Helens (Sir H. Shawcross), who subsequently asked that he might have a copy of it and for permission to disclose its existence to the Bar Council, to the Benchers of Mr. Marrinan's Inn, and to Mr. Marrinan, so that, if necessary, it might be used in connection with any investigation into the conduct of Mr. Marrinan. This permission was given.<br/>
As regards the suggestion that this matter should be referred to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, my present view is that this procedure is neither necessary or appropriate.<br/>
Finally, the House would like to know that my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister and I are meeting the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Liberal Party this evening to discuss how certain aspects of this matter could best be handled in future.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-06-27a.413.0" hansard_membership_id="4695" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/15124" speakername="Mr. Gaitskell" colnum="413" time="">
<p>On the last sentence of the right hon. Gentleman's statement, I should like, to avoid any possible misunderstanding, to make it clear that, while I am very glad to meet the Prime Minister and the right hon. Gentleman to discuss this question, there can be no question, as far as we are concerned, of ignoring either the past or the present

situation, nor could there be any question of our regarding such a meeting as a substitute for a debate in this House.<br/>
May I ask the right hon. Gentleman, as I asked him just before the Whitsun Recess, whether there is any precedent for disclosure of information obtained in this way to any outside body, and, if there is no such precedent, why did the then Home Secretary make this disclosure?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-06-27a.414.0" hansard_membership_id="1961" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/32690" speakername="Mr. Butler" colnum="414" time="">
<p>I quite understand the reservations made by the right hon. Gentleman about the meeting this evening. No terms and conditions have been laid down for the meeting, and, no doubt, we may have reservations of our own on our side. But I hope that the meeting will be successful in making some progress with this matter and seeing how this sort of question could best be handled in the future. That is all we can hope, and that the meeting will be successful.<br/>
On the question of precedent, it is not easy to discover a case similar to this, so far as my researches have gone up to date. As I said, we do not intend that this shall be a precedent.<br/>
As regards the reference to my predecessor, I should simply like to say that, from studying the papers, I am quite satisfied that he acted with the highest motives in handing this information over, because he felt that he was doing something which might help to retain the highest standards of the Bar. I am satisfied as to his motives in so doing.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-06-27a.414.1" hansard_membership_id="4695" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/15124" speakername="Mr. Gaitskell" colnum="414" time="">
<p>There is, of course, no question of impugning the motives of the noble Lord who then held the office of Home Secretary, but there is very grave doubt as to the appropriateness of his action. Will the right hon. Gentleman make it plain that on no future occasion will any information obtained in this way be disclosed to the Bar Council?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-06-27a.414.2" hansard_membership_id="1961" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/32690" speakername="Mr. Butler" colnum="414" time="">
<p>I think we might even take the matter further than that. I certainly do not propose that this matter should be treated as a precedent, and I hope that, partly out of our meeting this evening and out of further developments, we may be able to form some procedure which gives satisfaction to the House in this matter. I think that that would be more satisfactory to all concerned.</p>

<p>If, as I understand, the then Home Secretary actually volunteered the information that this tapping had taken place, does the present Home Secretary hold that that could possibly have been covered by the prerogative in any form?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-06-27a.415.1" hansard_membership_id="1961" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/32690" speakername="Mr. Butler" colnum="415" time="">
<p>The prerogative covers only the question of the Secretary of State of the day authorising interceptions, and the rest is a matter of judgment on the part of the Secretary of State of the day in regard to the action he took. He responded, in fact, to a request from the secretary of the Bar Council to the police, asking whether any further information was available about Mr. Marrinan's conduct. When it was discovered that this further information was available, he decided, in his discretion, to make it available, for the reasons I have given.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-06-27a.415.2" hansard_membership_id="6116" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/16142" speakername="Viscount Hinchingbrooke" colnum="415" time="">
<p>On the general issue, is my right hon. Friend aware that so much public anxiety has been aroused that it is unlikely to be resolved by a debate, because my right hon. Friend will feel himself just as restricted in that debate as he has been in his considered answers to Questions which have been put down. In those circumstances, would it be possible to consider, with the right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the Opposition, the appointment of a Select Committee of this House to take evidence and report, with discretion, to the House and the country?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-06-27a.415.3" hansard_membership_id="1961" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/32690" speakername="Mr. Butler" colnum="415" time="">
<p>I myself feel that something rather more than a debate may be necessary, although, of course, I do not exclude a debate in our ordinary constitutional procedure. It is precisely that sort of matter which I should like to discuss with right hon. Gentlemen and my right hon. Friend this evening, when we have an opportunity. We will take into account what my noble Friend suggests. I am not quite certain that the solution would be exactly on those lines, but I think that it may be necessary to reassure the House in some way on the sort of lines he suggests.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-06-27a.415.4" hansard_membership_id="9545" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29783" speakername="Mr. H. Morrison" colnum="415" time="">
<p>The Home Secretary, I thought, suggested earlier that this information was given at the request of the chairman of the Bar Council specifically&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "The secretary."]&#x2014;or the secretary; I thought it

was then the chairman. In view of his later statement, may I ask the Home Secretary now whether it is the case that the Bar Council asked the police whether they had any further information on the case, which may have been quite legitimate, but that then the then Home Secretary voluntarily offered the record which was the result of the interceptions? In those circumstances, would not the Home Secretary agree that the major responsibility for this exceptional action was not on the Bar Council, but on the then Secretary of State?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-06-27a.416.0" hansard_membership_id="1961" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/32690" speakername="Mr. Butler" colnum="416" time="">
<p>It is a little difficult exactly to apportion responsibility. The right hon. Gentleman is correct in saying that the original request as to whether there was any information came from the secretary of the Bar Council to the police. The further, subsequent, development was that the Secretary of State, as I said in my statement today, authorised the disclosure of this information to the chairman of the Bar Council. I think that hon. Members must, therefore, make up their own minds where they think responsibility lies.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-06-27a.416.1" hansard_membership_id="4695" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/15124" speakername="Mr. Gaitskell" colnum="416" time="">
<p>Is it not the case that the Home Secretary authorised the disclosure of this information in the first place to the secretary of the Bar Council and that only subsequently did the chairman of the Bar Council ask for a copy of the transcript?</p>

<p>Exactly what happened was this. The information was, as I have ascertained from the papers, made available to the secretary of the Bar Council. It so happened that the chairman was away at the time and the information was made available to the secretary. When the chairman returned, he gained this information and subsequently contact was made between the chairman of the Bar Council and the Secretary of State of the day. The right hon. Gentleman is correct in saying that, in the first place, the information was given to the secretary.</p>

<p>As members of the Bar have to take part in the public administration of public law, is it not vital that their conduct, if criticised, should be inquired into from every angle and that all information, from whatever source, should be available to that inquiry?<br/>
My right hon. Friend referred to the tapping of the telephone conversations of a Mr. Hill. Is that the same gentleman who, I have read in the papers, describes himself as the "King of the underworld?"</p>

<p>The answer to the latter part of my hon. and learned Friend's supplementary question is, "Yes, Sir." He does describe himself by that title, which, I think, he seems to have deserved.<br/>
The answer to the first question is that I would rather make no further observations, because, as everybody knows, this case is being considered by the Benchers today, tomorrow and the next day.</p>

<p>In view of the very wide anxiety that this case has aroused, and the grave doubts concerning the extent of the prerogative claimed by the Home Secretary, will the Government not reconsider the desirability, to ally public anxiety, of referring this whole question to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, so that there may be an authoritative pronouncement not only on the extent of the prerogative to tap telephone conversations, but on whether such prerogative exists and covers in any circumstances the conveying of such information to outside bodies?</p>

<p>I am satisfied that my predecessors have exercised this power from the very earliest time, not only in respect of letters but also telegrams and, after the Edison case, in relation to telephones&#x2014;that is, for many years. I am satisfied that they have been right in doing so. I would rather not give a final opinion on the legal position in question and answer, because it is extremely complicated. Therefore, I would rather reserve that for another occasion when a decision can be taken with the advice of our own Law Officers.</p>

<p>Is my right hon. Friend aware that everyone appreciates that he has a very difficult job in holding the balance between the freedom of the individual and the security of the State?

In this connection, I go back to a precedent, although telephones were not invented at that time, on the subject of interception of communications in 1735, from which date the House has always resolved that the Secretary of State of the day has special powers by warrant.

<p>I do not think that I should be out of order in saying that, having looked at the records very carefully, I see really no difference in practice under the present Administration and that which was carried out under my predecessors.

<p>Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that everything he has said today still leaves the position most unsatisfactory from the point of view of

both hon. Members and the general public, and that we are justified in believing that we are living in a police State? In view of the fact that it is, I think, generally agreed that there should never be any disclosure of police intercepts to outside bodies, why did the Home Secretary reject the suggestion made by my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition to recall the transcripts that had been wrongly sent to the Bar Council? Why did he reject that legitimate suggestion and not show that at least to that extent he regretted the very grave blunder that had been made in disclosing these intercepts to an outside body?</p>

<p>I did not take any further action on the transcripts because I thought they seemed to have got quite enough publicity already&#x2014;in fact, many people, in the Press and elsewhere, say that they have seen them&#x2014;and I did not think that it would do any good to withdraw the transcripts from the Bar Council.

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. When the Home Secretary was answering Questions on telephone tapping, I stood on my feet each time and tried to catch your eye. One Privy Councillor asked these supplementary questions, and on each occasion when he was called I was on my feet. In fact, I think I was the only hon. Member who stood up and was not called.

<p>There is no limit to the discretion which may be exercised by a Privy Councillors, if that is what the hon. Member is asking, but that is another matter.

<p>The House will be sorry to learn of the sudden illness of my right hon. Friend the Minister of Health. With your permission, Mr. Speaker, and that of the House, I wish to make a statement on lung cancer on his behalf.<br/>
In its Annual Report, and more particularly in its special report on tobacco smoking and cancer of the lung&#x2014;which will be available in the Vote Office at 5 p.m. this evening&#x2014;the Medical Research Council has advised the Government that the most reasonable interpretation of the very great increase in deaths from lung cancer in males during the past twenty-five years is that a major part of it is caused by smoking tobacco, particularly heavy cigarette smoking. The Council points to the evidence derived from investigations in many countries in support of this conclusion in particular to identification of several carcinogenic substances in tobacco smoke.<br/>
The Government feel that it is right to ensure that this latest authoritative opinion is brought effectively to public notice, so that everyone may know the risks involved in smoking. The Government consider that these facts should be made known to all those with responsibility for health education. The Minister of Education included in his recently published Handbook for Teachers on Health Education advice about the dangers of smoking and he is circulating copies of this statement to local education authorities and education authorities generally. Corresponding action will be taken by the Scottish Education Department in Scotland.<br/>
The Government now propose to bring these views to the notice of the local health authorities who are concerned under Statute in the prevention of illness and who are responsible for health education as a means of prevention. Local health authorities will be asked to take appropriate steps to inform the general public and in this task they will have the assistance of the Central and Scottish Councils for Health Education.<br/>
Once the risks are known everyone who smokes will have to measure them


and make up his or her own mind, and must be relied upon, as a responsible person, to act as seems best.<br/>
The Medical Research Council is at present supporting an extensive programme of work designed to discover the way in which tobacco smoke exerts its effect and the relative importance of other factors, such as atmospheric pollution, which may also play a part in the causation of lung cancer. The recent expansion of this programme has been greatly assisted by a substantial grant made in 1954 by a leading group of tobacco manufacturers; on the advice of my right hon. Friend's predecessor, the present Minister of Labour, this sum was given to the Medical Research Council with complete discretion as to the choice of research projects to be supported and to the publication of results.<br/>
The work at present in progress consists largely of chemical and biological studies of the many different constituents of tobacco smoke and atmospheric pollution. In addition, surveys of the role of atmospheric pollution and of specific industrial hazards in the causation of the disease are being, undertaken. Work along these lines is being supported in many centres in different parts of the country and the Council has also established, as part of its own organisation, three new research groups in Exeter, London and Sheffield, where long-term studies of different aspects of the problem are being carried out. Every opportunity will be taken by the Medical Research Council to pursue any promising new lines of research which may become apparent.</p>

This Amendment corrects a minor error. The payments in question will be allowed for the tax purposes of the company which makes them in the year in which they become due and not necessarily in the year in which they are made.

<p>I beg to move, in page 17, line 20, to leave out from "Kingdom" to the end of line 28.<br/>
The purpose of this Amendment is to ensure that an overseas trade corporation shall not be exempt from tax, unless it at least pays some tax in the country in which it is carrying on its trading operations. We understand that it is the Chancellor's purpose in the whole of this O.T.C. device to avoid discrimination as he calls, it, between a British company trading overseas and its foreign competitors.<br/>
Although we do not accept in full the whole of this plan, taking it for granted for the moment, I can see that there may be some case for arguing that if a United Kingdom firm trading overseas pays some Income Tax or Profits Tax, or whatever the tax arrangements may be in the country where it carries on trade, then it should be relieved of United Kingdom taxation in this specially far-reaching fashion.<br/>
But supposing there is no local tax levied, as, I believe, is the case in certain countries, then to exempt the overseas trade corporation from. British taxation

altogether is to put it in a fantastically favourable position <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> other British companies which may be exporting and carrying on overseas trade in various ways. It seems to me an extraordinary conclusion, if one sets out to try to put United Kingdom companies on a fair level with their competitors and, indeed, with other trading companies generally, to reach a point at which a certain minority of companies may be absolutely exempt from all tax, either in the country concerned or in the United Kingdom&#x2014;unless, presumably, they remit dividends to shareholders here, in which case to that extent they would still pay United Kingdom tax.<br/>
I am informed that no tax is chargeable in, for instance, Kuwait and Bermuda, of a kind which would preclude this concession applying to a company which was an O.T.C. Therefore, it appears to be true that if there were a British O.T.C. operating in those two countries, it would pay virtually no tax. Perhaps the Financial Secretary will explain how this will work. I suppose that it will mean that if there were an oil company, or a branch of one of the great oil companies which had created an O.T.C. for the purpose and which had its management in the United Kingdom and which carried on trade in Kuwait&#x2014;where, presumably, it would carry on some of its trading operations&#x2014;that company would be almost completely exempt from taxation.<br/>
In the case of Bermuda, would it be possible for Mr. Noel Coward, for instance&#x2014;and I use his name not to advertise, but just to take a realistic example&#x2014;or for some other playwright to form a private company&#x2014;and, unless the Financial Secretary contradicts me, I assume that there is nothing to prevent a private company as well as a public company becoming an overseas trade corporation&#x2014;and forming an O.T.C. which would have its management and control in the United Kingdom and which would carry on the trade of selling plays or books or other literary products, perhaps the copyrights, whatever may be the most appropriate legal method, in Bermuda.<br/>
Supposing the whole of the shares of that company were held by a British playwright or an actor or somebody of that kind, who for the purpose of the law was resident not in the United Kingdom but in Bermuda, would we not then reach the conclusion that on the profits of those


operations, if there were profits, no tax would be paid, either Profits Tax or Income Tax, either by the company or by the shareholder, in either that country or the United Kingdom? I agree that that may be a rather extreme case.<br/>
This concession has the double and rather extraordinary effect that at one and the same time it gives a bonus to British investors to invest abroad and to foreign investors to invest in this country. There may be an argument for that, but it is a rather strange thing that this tax concession, at much expense to the Revenue, should produce those two mutually contradictory effects. This provision also leaves the Chancellor in the position of having to assume that a tax described as of a character and scope corresponding in all respects to Income Tax, that is to say, to our Income Tax, is charged in another country where in fact it is not charged. We are reaching a remarkable Alice-in-Wonderland position in tax law if we base the liability of a United Kingdom taxpayer on assuming that some tax exists in some other country where, in fact, we explicity recognise that it does not exist.<br/>
I am sure that the Financial Secretary is aware that Australia, when introducing a similar concession, specifically enjoined that it should not apply in a country where there is no tax similar to the British Income Tax or Profits Tax. That is our intention. My authority for saying that is the memorandum from the Board of Inland Revenue, which we have all read. Of course, we have now learned that the Chancellor has not as high an opinion of the Board of Inland Revenue as have some of us and that he is disposed to disregard its advice. Indeed, he seems to think that he is acting correctly as Chancellor when he says that he knows that the Board of Inland Revenue thought of it, but that he has decided to neglect what it said.<br/>
I do not know whether the Chancellor will go very far on those principles. Even if he does not pay attention to the advice of the Board of Inland Revenue about what he should do in matters of policy, I hope that he will at least be prepared to accept it as an authority on the actual legal practice in other countries, and I hope that the Financial Secretary will agree that a limitation on the concession is enforced in Australia.<br/>
If the Australians are able to effect a limitation of that kind, it must be practical and possible to administer it in our country. This seems to us another case where, as it stands, the Bill has been carried to extreme lengths to permit this class of company to pay virtually no tax and I hope that the Committee will feel that this is a case where we can reasonably and legitimately lay down some limitation.</p>

<p>The general object of this part of the Bill is to place companies resident in the United Kingdom in the same position as non-resident companies trading abroad in the same country. Of course, that includes companies resident in that foreign country where the trade in question is being carried on. That being the purpose of this part of the Bill, it would be quite impossible to pick and choose between one territory and another and to say that here is a territory which has an income tax&#x2014;admittedly low, but an income tax&#x2014;and, therefore, the provisions of Part IV should apply&#x2014;</p>

<p>May I ask a question about the purpose? Is it really the Government's purpose&#x2014;because we have had it stated both ways&#x2014;to put a British company in, say, Kuwait on a level with a non-resident company, presumably a British company operating and registered there, or, as we originally thought, with some other foreign company, perhaps an Australian company, operating in the same business in Kuwait? If it is the latter, it will not be achieved by this concession.</p>

<p>The object is as I originally stated, and it is not consistent with that object that one should select one set of territories where one tax system exists and allow Part IV to operate there while refusing to allow it to operate in another kind of territory with a different tax system.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman imagined a case of a private company whose business it is to sell or otherwise to exploit the works of a playwright. He will find that that possibility is excluded by subparagraph (ii) of subsection (3, <i>b</i>). The subsection to which the Amendment relates has the purpose of ensuring that all companies whose trading profits are exempt by this part of the Bill have a


permanent establishment somewhere so as to be a legitimate object of local taxation in the country concerned. It is not the object of this part of the Bill to create a situation in which a company escapes taxation anywhere, whatever the taxation may be in the various countries or places in which it operates. That is not the object for which the O.T.C. provisions were designed.<br/>
Paragraph (<i>b</i>), which the Amendment proposes to leave out, is, therefore, essential. It assumes that throughout the world there is a tax system identical with that in this country and it is a requirement that all the profits of a company obtaining exemption under Part IV should, on this hypothesis, be caught by tax. That is to say, they will, somewhere or other, have a permanent establishment which will render them liable to whatever local taxation there is.<br/>
4.30 p.m.<br/>
Paragraph (<i>b</i>) is, in fact, sufficient to achieve that purpose without paragraph (<i>a</i>). Paragraph (<i>a</i>) applies the actual test of whether a tax similar in character to Income Tax or Profits Tax is being paid. As the Committee will observe, that case is covered by the universal and theoretical test of paragraph (<i>b</i>), but paragraph (<i>a</i>) is a convenient way of finding out whether Income Tax or Profits Tax was, in fact, being paid in some overseas country. That simple and actual test will often suffice, and it is helpful to have it side by side in the Bill with the universal and theoretical test in paragraph (<i>b</i>).<br/>
To omit paragraph (<i>a</i>) would, therefore, be quite possible, although inconvenient; to omit paragraph (<i>b</i>) would be disastrous. If we omitted paragraph (<i>b</i>), it would mean, for example, that the pioneer relief given in some overseas countries would he frustrated, because it would mean that a company which, under the local law and for deliberate local purposes, was exempted from tax, would not benefit by Part IV of the Bill. It would be back again in the original position of bearing full United Kingdom taxation, because it would not be able to qualify as an overseas trading corporation.<br/>
The effect of leaving out paragraph (<i>b</i>) would be that it would frustrate the deliberate tax relief given in overseas countries; in other words, it would defeat

the one purpose which right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite have recognised as valid in this part of the Bill.</p>

<p>We are not debating whether Part IV of the Bill ought to be restricted to giving pioneer relief, but whether this paragraph should stand. I am pointing out to the Committee that if this test is omitted, pioneer relief, amongst other things, will automatically be frustrated.<br/>
By the omission of this paragraph, we would bring in companies which I am sure nobody in the Committee would want to be exempt from tax. It is possible for a company to be carrying on trade in no country at all. It might, for example, be drilling for oil under the sea beyond the territorial limit. It may be carrying on whaling operations, whilst resident in this country and therefore taxable in this country, apart from Part IV of the Bill. It is precisely to ensure that companies are not in the position of carrying on all their operations in no country, while resident in the United Kingdom, and thus, by virtue of this part of the Bill, escape all taxation, that we must have the universal test in paragraph (<i>b</i>).<br/>
Therefore, because its omission would leave out companies which everybody wants to bring in and would bring in companies which everyone would like to be left out, I suggest that we must retain paragraph (<i>b</i>).</p>

<p>May I ask the hon. Gentleman one or two questions? I am intrigued by this possibility of a company having operations in the middle of the ocean. I suppose that the example of whaling would do, but even then one would have to bring in the products of whaling to land ultimately. I see that the Financial Secretary to the Treasury is shaking his head, and I understand from him that he knows of a company which carries on whaling and never brings any products to the land.</p>

<p>These fascinating possibilities have not been as fully developed in my mind as in the remarkably ingenious mind of the Parliamentary Secretary. I would ask him how does the Clause operate there, because there is no assumption that, in a place which is not a country outside the United Kingdom, there is any tax at all. Apparently, there appears to be an unfair discrimination between those who carry on their whaling operations or whatever they may be inside territorial waters and those who do it outside territorial waters. That is the first question which I should like to put to him, and I feel certain that the hon. Gentleman's ingenuity will provide an immediate answer.<br/>
The second question is a little different. A company is not to qualify as an overseas trading corporation unless, to put it shortly, all of its trading profits are chargeable to something similar to Income Tax or Profits Tax. Let us assume that the whole of the profits are chargeable to Profits Tax. I do not think&#x2014;and here I stand to be corrected, if need be&#x2014;that the standards for the assessment of Profits Tax and Income Tax are the same, and, therefore, the profits so chargeable might be different. What happens in that case? If the profits are, in fact, chargeable to anything like Profits Tax, then I suppose there is no assumption to be made about Income Tax at all. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman could elucidate that.</p>

<p>Speaking for myself, I am more confused about this than I was before I heard the Financial Secretary's attempted explanation of it. While I do not want to delay the Committee, I think that in the interests of clarity we ought to know what this means before we pass from it.<br/>
I wish to refer to subsection (5), paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>), but before I do so, I should like to refer to what I thought were the very significant observations of my right hon. Friend the Member for Battersea, North (Mr. Jay), which I thought the Financial Secretary seemed to brush aside as if they did not matter. My right hon. Friend referred to the example of a company carrying on trade largely outside the United Kingdom, and he inquired what would be the position

of a private company which acquired the rights of Mr. Noel Coward's talent and so forth. I think that my right hon. Friend asked a very sensible and intelligent question, but what was the answer?<br/>
The Financial Secretary referred us to a paragraph which has no relation to the matter at all. It has to deal with ships and aircraft, and I am not sure that Mr. Noel Coward has any connection with ships and aircraft, though I quite understand that he may be thought to have some connection with copyright in literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works. How does that subsection affect the matter? Paragraph (<i>b,</i> ii) of subsection (5) merely deals with
<q>payments in respect of copyright in literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works, the author of which is ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom.</q>
That has nothing to do with the point which my right hon. Friend was raising. My right hon. Friend was saying suppose we had a gentleman&#x2014;or a company enjoying the benefits of his talent and works&#x2014;operating very largely outside the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>The Financial Secretary says they would not pay tax. I am not sure whether my right hon. Friend will think that a very satisfactory answer, but if so, I do not think it is the end of the matter. It certainly makes the position a little clearer. The Minister is now saying to my right hon. Friend that such a gentleman pays no tax.</p>

<p>Is it intended that it should continue and that other people should be able, if they so desire, to take advantage of this part of the Bill, put themselves in a similar position and, therefore, pay no tax? I take it that it will make it easier for them to do so than is the case at present.<br/>
There is quite a serious problem here. The Minister is now saying that certain people can take advantage of the law as it stands to avoid paying tax. We want to know whether it is the effect or the intention of Part IV that artistes and others carrying on a similar kind of profession should be able to obtain greater benefits from the Income Tax laws than they enjoy at present. I think that that was the purport of my right hon. Friend's question.<br/>
I now revert to the principal object of the Amendment, namely, the elimination of paragraph (<i>b</i>). The Minister said that it would not matter if paragraph (<i>a</i>) were in the Bill or not, but that paragraph (<i>b</i>) was essential. If it does not matter about paragraph (<i>a</i>) I am at a loss to understand why it should be included. If the Minister is content to rely upon paragraph (<i>b</i>) why not rely upon it, and not have paragraph (<i>a</i>)? Either paragraph (<i>a</i>) is necessary or it is not.<br/>
Contrary to the Minister, I should have thought that paragraph (<i>a</i>) was essential, and that it would have been much better to rely upon it and to eliminate paragraph (<i>b</i>). One of the reasons why I think that is that paragraph (<i>b</i>) seems to be quite unintelligible. It says:
<q>A company shall not qualify as an Overseas Trade Corporation unless"&#x2014;</q>
then come certain assumptions&#x2014;
<q>the profits arising from the whole of the trade carried on by the company would he chargeable in one or more such countries to tax of that character.</q>
This is a very novel form of Parliamentary draftsmanship, as I am sure the Minister, who has made some study of phraseology, will admit. How, in an Act of Parliament, can one define an obligation or qualification which is based upon an assumption? I know of no precedent for it whatever.<br/>
Let us analyse the situation. First, what is the assumption? It is that in every country outside the United Kingdom there is a tax of a character and scope corresponding in all respects to Income Tax. Who will decide that? Other countries have different kinds of fiscal laws. It is not every country which thinks that the most sensible way of raising revenue is by way of Income Tax. Other countries have withholding tax and sales tax&#x2014;all kinds of comic taxes not

known to this country. Some may well be of a scope not identical with our Income Tax, but in some respects similar. Who is to say whether the tax laws of a country such as Kuwait or Bahrein correspond to our Income Tax laws? There may be considerable argument about that.<br/>
Let us suppose that there is a doubt about it, and that it is arguable whether a given country, such as Kuwait, has a tax, corresponding to our Income Tax. The assumption made in paragraph (<i>b</i>) would not then hold good, and I take it that the Minister would then agree that the rest of the operative words of the paragraph would not apply. What would be the position then? In other words, what would be the effect upon whaling companies and similar organisations? Can the Minister tell us whether or not it is intended to disqualify companies from having the benefit of the overseas trade corporation provisions on such ambiguous grounds as these? If the Minister is right, and paragraph (<i>b</i>) is the one upon which he relies, would it not be more sensible to withdraw paragraph (<i>a</i>) and rewrite paragraph (<i>b</i>) in a form which is quite definite and intelligible? I believe that my right hon. Friend has raised a very sensible point, which I hope the Committee will press before we part with this part of the Clause.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 17, line 31, at the end to add:
<q>or in any European country which the Board of Trade, with the consent of the Treasury, may declare to be part of a European free trade area including the United Kingdom:</q>
<q>Provided that any such declaration shall be made in the form of a statutory instrument and shall be laid before Parliament.</q>
This is a comparatively simple, but important, Amendment. It deals with subsection (6), which says:
<q>A company shall not qualify as an Overseas Trade Corporation if it is carrying on a trade in the Republic of Ireland.</q>
The Amendment seeks to extend the provisions of this subsection so that it will also apply to any European country which came to form part of the European Free Trade Area, if and when such a trade area is set up&#x2014;although the declaration from


the Board of Trade to specify which countries should be included would be required, and it would have to be laid before Parliament in the form of a Statutory Instrument.<br/>
It seems clear that if and when a European Free Trade Area comes about it will be undesirable in many respects&#x2014;and I should have thought that this would certainly be recognised by the Government and hon. Members opposite&#x2014;for it to be possible for overseas trade corporations to operate within the Free Trade Area and to gain the benefits of Part IV of the Bill.<br/>
For instance, we are all aware that it is quite possible for a United Kingdom manufacturing company to hive off an export company which will enjoy the benefits of being an overseas trade corporation. If the European Free Trade Area were to come into being, without some such provisions as the Amendment provides it would seem possible for United Kingdom capital to be used&#x2014;and perhaps United Kingdom manufacturing expertise or "know-how"&#x2014;to set up a manufacturing company in Germany or Belgium, let us say, which would manufacture goods largely for export into the British market but which would have a separate, importing company to take over and do the actual importing and selling of goods in this country, so that the manufacturing company, set up with British capital and "know-how", operating under British auspices in Europe and able to enjoy a much more favourable tax position than if it were set up and manufacturing in this country, would not disqualify itself from the provisions of Part IV by trading in this country. This would be a most undesirable situation.<br/>
There are many powerful arguments in favour of our participating in a European Free Trade Area, but there are no arguments in favour of such participation providing incentives, by way of favourable tax concessions, for British capital to be used not in this country but in Europe for the manufacture of goods which may ultimately be exported into this country. There is a point of real danger here.<br/>
The whole of Part IV deals with extremely complicated matters, which lead us inevitably to put our remarks in the form of questions rather than assertions. I therefore do that in regard to the example which I have just quoted.<br/>
I should like the Economic Secretary, who, I trust, will apply himself extremely closely to this matter, to give a detailed explanation of the dangers which do, or do not, exist here, and to tell us whether this is a real danger. If he takes the view that a danger does not exist, that it is not necessary to make safeguards such as we propose, I hope that, alternatively, he will explain why it is necessary to make this special provision concerning the Republic of Ireland with which we are already, as it were, within a free trade area; and why it is not so necessary to make it with other countries which would be in a wider free trade area when this came to be set up. Therefore, believing this to be the real danger with which we have to deal, I should like the Economic Secretary to tell us what is the position.<br/>
I hope that he will not sweep this matter aside. In our debates yesterday we found a slightly alarming dichotomy in the attitude of the Government to some of the anti-avoidance provisions in this part of the Bill. I believe it was the Financial Secretary&#x2014;he is not present at the moment&#x2014;who was most eloquent on this point. Sometimes the Government say that this part of the Bill is hedged round with the most meticulous provisions to make sure that there is no abuse, and that they want to give this concession in such a way that there will be no avoidance and no evasion. At other times the Chancellor of the Exchequer&#x2014;who is rapidly qualifying as one of the most reckless Chancellors we have ever had in this country&#x2014;says, "This is a concession which I want to give as widely as possible. I want to benefit all shareholders of companies. I want to see British trade encouraged, and if it leads to dangers, that must be put up with. I am taking a clear view. I am a 'one hundred per center' on this and other issues."<br/>
This is rather an alarming difference. I hope that the Economic Secretary, speaking in the absence of both his right hon. Friend the Chancellor and his hon. Friend the Financial Secretary, will, in dealing with this Amendment, lean a little more towards the technique practised by the Financial Secretary and give a close and detailed explanation of the position regarding the real danger in this part of the Bill. I hope that he will tell us


whether, when a European Free Trade Area is set up, there will be a tax incentive to manufacturers, employing British capital and "know-how", to carry on, not here at home employing British labour, but elsewhere on the Continent of Europe employing non-British labour.</p>

<p>The reason for the omission of the Republic of Ireland is that there is a special double taxation agreement with Southern Ireland in which companies trading there are not subject to Irish Income Tax. They are subject to a small corporation Profits Tax of 10 per cent. if they make more than &#x00A3;2,500. In view of this special agreement, which does not exist elsewhere, it was thought right to omit Ireland. We have been in consultation with the Government of Ireland who agree that this is the correct way to deal with the matter.</p>

<p>Why is Ireland different, because Ireland excludes the United Kingdom resident companies operating in Ireland from the operation of Irish Income Tax? Why is there a difference of principle between Ireland and, shall we say, some other overseas territory which gives pioneer relief exempting a company entirely from local taxation, and the position of a United Kingdom resident company, say, in Bermuda, where, as we heard during the debate on a previous Amendment, Income Tax does not exist?</p>

<p>The main reason Ireland is different is because of this exclusive agreement. There may be certain places where no taxation is charged and where a special case may apply, but that is the general principle.<br/>
The main object of the Amendment is to exclude countries in the Free Trade Area from the benefit of Part IV of the Bill. Having listened to the hon. Member for Stechford (Mr. Roy Jenkins) I am still not altogether clear why the party opposite wish to make the Amendment. This provision is based on the idea of jurisdiction&#x2014;that the taxation of a company should in the first instance be in the country where it operates and that the taxation in the country of residence or origin, as it were, comes in only when the profits are distributed. I do not

understand what would be the object of cutting out the Free Trade Area from that general principle. Risks mentioned by the hon. Gentleman would exist just as much anywhere else as in the Free Trade Area.</p>

<p>I think not. It would not be possible to manufacture goods in most parts of the world and import them duty free into this country, as would be possible from the Free Trade Area.</p>

<p>It would certainly be easier to import them from the Commonwealth at easier rates of duty.</p>

<p>That is certainly a point. But I think the real reason, the main reason, against accepting the Amendment is that it seems to me to be a highly hostile act, when we are trying to negotiate a Free Trade Area, to say that we will make other countries in the area pariahs, as it were, and not allow trading on the same terms in that area as in the rest of the world.<br/>
So far as the migration of companies is concerned, and the dangers which ma), ensue from that, we should be in a far worse position if the Free Trade Area did not come about because the inducement to companies to set up abroad in order to avoid United Kingdom tax would be far greater if the common market comes about with no Free Trade Area than if we had a free trade union with other countries.<br/>
I am glad that the hon. Gentleman is in favour of a Free Trade Area. It seems to me wrong to make a special distinction here. Of course companies manufacturing overseas in the Free Trade Area could not export directly to this country while trading as O.T.Cs. There would have to be elaborate arrangements with a third party which would be subject to taxation. I do not think there is any real danger here, and I think that it would be a retrograde step to take action such as this which could be considered only as something hostile to the whole conception.</p>

<p>After listening to the Economic Secretary I am by no means entirely convinced. The right hon. Gentleman said that after listening to my speech he was not clear why we put down


the Amendment. My trouble is that after listening to his speech I am not clear why the Government introduced Part IV of the Bill. The right hon. Gentleman failed to explain most of the points. He told us the reason for the specific exclusion of Ireland was this special form of double taxation agreement. I do not know exactly the details of the double taxation agreement and perhaps the right hon. Gentleman does not either, but I do not think he made absolutely clear what was the difference in principle in the treatment of companies operating in Ireland under this double taxation agreement and companies operating in overseas countries where there are special concessions such as pioneer relief.<br/>
As to the position in Europe, I agree that if we had a common market without a Free Trade Area there would be a danger that we would have to set up companies within the wall of the Common Market if we were to compete within the Common Market. But what we all believe&#x2014;and the Government do not seem to have done much about it in recent months&#x2014;is that we should guard against the danger of extending the narrow Common Market into a wider Free Trade Area. The danger I was concerned with was a more extreme danger than that which the right hon. Gentleman talked about. I was not concerned with the position in which we would have to set up companies within the fence of the Common Market, in order to sell within the six countries on reasonably favourable terms.<br/>
I was concerned about the position in which, the Free Trade Area having come about, it might be advantageous for British manufacturers to set up special companies operating within Europe under</p>

<p>This seems to me a very undesirable situation. The Government believe in the Free Trade Area and we on this side of the Committee believe in the Free Trade Area, though recognising some of its dangers, but we want to minimise those dangers and certainly while the negotiations are being conducted, however dilatorily by the Government. We do not want to see developing the situation in which we actually carry through a tax provision which would give a direct incentive for British capital and "know-how" to be exported to Europe and used there to manufacture goods for the home market. Because I feel that this is a real danger and because I am unconvinced by the Economic Secretary's arguments I hope that my hon. Friends will carry the matter into the Division Lobby.</p>

<p>I have already replied to that point. If, of course, a country in Europe has a more easy tax system than ours that of itself gives advantage to the manufacturers of that country whether British, French or whatever their nationality.

<p><i>Motion made and Question proposed,</i> That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-06-27a.451.2" hansard_membership_id="9373" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/18429" speakername="Mr. Mitchison" colnum="451" time="">
<p>This is the Clause which is going to save everything. It provides those stringent conditions which are to make impossible the tax avoidance which has been so freely prophesied by I think everyone who has studied this part of the Bill. Let us have a look at it. The importance of it, it seems to me, is that it is intended to do that which the Board of Inland Revenue thought impracticable and unworkable. While I agree that on questions of policy its opinion is not infallible, nor indeed always relevant, on

questions of administration we are bound to pay attention to its knowledge and experience of the practical side.<br/>
It is quite a long Clause. It starts by making a general exclusion of companies that carry on a trade in this country. That in itself, though by now the words are pretty definite in their meaning, has certainly led to a great deal of trouble in the past, and even now is not as clear as all that. We could have had no better instance than the little dispute which arose, I think it was yesterday, about whether a company buying and selling land is or is not carrying on a trade. That dispute reflected quite a deal of legal controversy on exactly that point.<br/>
Then we come to an exception which will depend on the meaning, among other things, of "a recognised market," and the Government are so confident that everyone attaches the same meaning to those words that they have not thought fit to include a definition. So far as I know, the words have never before occurred in any Statute, fiscal or otherwise. The nearest we ever got to them was a recognised Stock Exchange, and that is a bit different.<br/>
We come after that to the question of exporting companies. This was a matter that was again considered very carefully by the Board when it was putting in its observations to the Royal Commission. I think that the conditions laid down here reflect some of the comments which were made in those memoranda. But I remember, and the Committee will remember, that yesterday vigorous protests were made from the Government benches about not tying up businesses, not compelling people to carry on their trade in one way or another and not, in fact, interfering with the ordinary run of free business.<br/>
Look at subsection (2). Look at the conditions which are here imposed and which have the effect that if, in fact they are not strictly complied with, a company ceases to be an overseas trade corporation. I agree with the Government that if we are to have an overseas trade corporation at all we have to try to draw a line; but the Government go on to say, "We have drawn a line." They may have done, but my conclusion is a little different. If this is a line we are trying to draw, then a concession of this sort depends on such narrow distinctions that it is really indefensible in principle.<br/>
We shall not carry out the object we have in mind if this is the sort of distinction we have to draw. I would say that it is possible for a company so minded to comply with these conditions. It is, of course, a considerable interference with business in one form or another. I agree that it is possible to do it, but the distinction, fiscal, moral or any other between a company which does comply and a company which does not comply seems to me to be completely bogus.<br/>
I think that it is perfectly possible for a company to arrange to comply with many of these conditions and in fact to do things which, I am sure, are not within

the general intentions of this part of the Bill, at any rate as it has been explained to us. We could not have had a more remarkable instance of a completely inconsistent addition to this Clause as a whole than the one that we had yesterday when the Government accepted an Amendment which would allow a company trading abroad to sell in this country not merely the produce that it made or produced abroad but any commodity of the same kind. Any distinction that there may previously have been between a producing company and a merchant company disappeared the moment that that quite illogical concession was made.<br/>
5.15 p.m.<br/>
The fact that the concession was argued, let alone conceded, shows the extraordinary artificiality of the lines that are drawn in this Clause. Naturally a good many hon. Members opposite say, "Oh, well; we and our friends would like the concessions to be as large as possible; let us make a sieve so full of holes that anybody can get through them. Let us extend to every conceivable purpose the special concession that is to be given only in special circumstances to special companies." We have had a good deal of that.<br/>
Is not there another deduction to he drawn from all this? Is not the other deduction simply that this is the wrong way in which to try to give a special concession to companies trading overseas when we do it purely on the fiscal basis of it being what is here called an overseas trade corporation and refrain from doing it with regard to the purposes that that company is serving.<br/>
I had a good deal of sympathy with an Amendment moved yesterday from the benches opposite about the special case of some chartered companies. I am not sure, when we look at it, that it did not really boil down to a single company. It is no doubt true that there are companies registered and resident in this country which are carrying out projects of special value to parts of the Commonwealth in particular. We argued last year, and we shall argue again today, that a concession, having regard to that sort of purpose and that sort of project and that sort of enterprise, is thoroughly justified.<br/>
This proposal goes wildly beyond that. The line that is attempted to be drawn


here does not depend in any way on the character of the trade that is served, on its use to the Commonwealth or its use for any other special purpose that might commend itself to the Committee, but purely on the character of the business. How extraordinarily narrow it is. Look, for instance, at the subsection to which I was referring, about exporting. The first part says that the goods have to be sold on what are commonly called "free-on-board" terms, or perhaps others indicating delivery at a rather later stage.<br/>
Nothing whatever is to be done about insurance, commission and other charges by anyone but the seller. That is the ordinary procedure with a delivery of that kind; the purchasing company is not to provide service. That does restrict it to f.o.b. deliveries or to cost, insurance and freight deliveries at some later stage. In practice, the type of delivery that is carried out in many of these cases is a strange mixture that does not fall into the somewhat rigid categories here laid down.<br/>
I would not draw the conclusion that we ought to make no provision at all but would simply point out that it is not a good way of drawing the line if we have to depend on a dictation so rigid and so abstract. I find a great deal of support for that point of view in the Bill.<br/>
When I turn to the miscellaneous Clauses&#x2014;to which I refer for purposes of illustration&#x2014;I find in the special subsection the very remarkable provision that if the company has done anything by mistake or has been obliged to do it, and has not had any material advantage out of it, the Commissioners may disregard it. We may have to consider that provision when we come to it.<br/>
The need to insert a provision of that sort illustrates better than any words I can use the artificialities that are introduced into the Clause. My conclusion is not that the distinctions are not necessary or are too wide or too narrow. That is not what I am considering. It is that the lines on which those distinctions are drawn must be wrong, and they throw a light on the artificial character of the proposals in Part IV. If, instead of drawing the line in this way, it had been drawn in relation to the special relief provided for Dominion countries, or in

relation to the particular purpose of the company, or something of that sort, it would have been far easier to work. Here I rely on the Board of Inland Revenue's opinion. It would have been far easier for those concerned to understand and conform to than are these elaborate provisions.<br/>
We shall not oppose the Clause. It is obvious that if we are to have some provision of the wide kind indicated by the preceding Clause, we must have qualifications and disqualifications, and we must try to draw our line somewhere. The Clause illustrates that the purpose of Part IV is misconceived because we have to draw such a wholly artificial line if we are to make any sense out of it.<br/>
Before I sit down I cannot forbear teasing the Financial Secretary on his complete failure to answer the extremely difficult question that his own almost excessive ingenuity raised in connection with subsection (5). He devised out of the recesses of his mind the conception&#x2014;it may be perfectly real&#x2014;of a company which did not carry on a trade in any country because it carried it on in the middle of the sea. When I asked what we did about that the hon. Gentleman did not explain what the company was.</p>

<p>The hon. and learned Member for Kettering (Mr. Mitchison) will observe in paragraph (<i>b</i>) that the profits arising from the whole of the trade carried on by such a company would not be chargeable in any country and therefore the company would not qualify as an overseas trade corporation.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-06-27a.456.1" hansard_membership_id="9373" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/18429" speakername="Mr. Mitchison" colnum="456" time="">
<p>I am very glad we have an answer at last. We might perhaps have had it when the point was raised, but there it is. Does not it illustrate the fantastic character of this part of the Bill? Suppose a company which does a little bit of whaling, sometimes inside and sometimes outside territorial waters, or two companies, one of which fishes inside territorial waters and the other outside&#x2014;[<i>Interruption.</i>] One of my hon. Friends points out that they might catch something even better and fruitier than fish. They might find oil. We all know what that means. It will depend upon territorial waters whether the company becomes an overseas trade corporation.<br/>
Curiously enough, the middle of the ocean is not overseas, but the territorial


waters on the other side are. That is as it may be. I take it only as an instance of the extreme artificiality of the line we have to draw. I suggest that a line so drawn is unworkable and opens the door to evasion, and consequently to the administrative difficulties that the Board foresaw. The need to draw it shows that there is something wrong in the character of the concession that is offered by the Bill. What is fundamentally wrong is that the concession has no regard to the purpose for which the company is operating. I include in that Commonwealth purposes.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-06-27a.457.0" hansard_membership_id="12621" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/21036" speakername="Mr. Geoffrey Stevens" colnum="457" time="">
<p>As I listened to the hon. and learned Member for Kettering (Mr. Mitchison), it seemed that he overlooked the undoubted fact that the overseas trade corporation is an entirely new conception in our taxation law and practice. In the circumstances, it must be somewhat complicated. I am less pessimistic than he. I prefer that the conditions of disqualification be reasonably fully set out. In any case, our taxation practice is based not only upon statute law but upon case law, which is derived from it.<br/>
Before very long, we shall be able to solve such problems as what is and what is not a recognised market to the satisfaction of the hon. and learned Member for Kettering and the learned profession which he represents, of which he is so distinguished an ornament, and which may benefit very greatly from the complexities of Clause 21, if, indeed, the Clause is as complex as the hon. and learned Gentleman suggests.<br/>
I have only one point to raise. I would say how much we welcome Part IV and, in broad terms, accept the disqualifications of Clause 21. As the hon. and learned Gentleman has said, the line has to be drawn somewhere, but I am puzzled about one particular bit of the line, indicated by subsection (3, <i>a</i> (i)). Banking is excluded from overseas trade corporation status. On the Second Reading of the Bill the Financial Secretary to the Treasury gave the Government's reasons. He said:
<q>The activities of banking, finance and insurance are also excluded, because it would be difficult to say of any concern of that kind that its day-to-day operations can be separated from the activities of central control and management."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 7th May, 1957; Vol. 569, c. 819.]</q>

That may be true, but I see absolutely no reason why that should disqualify a bank from overseas trade corporation status.<br/>

A great part of the problem of the balance of payments position of this country is eased by the overseas banking services provided by our banking institutions. To a large extent, they carry them out in overseas territories, not by subsidiary companies only, but by branches. It might well be advantageous to put them on the same basis as the financial institutions of the countries with whom they will be in competition. There is a little difficulty here. I agree that it is not so easy to think of suitable conditions in which all banking organisations could be brought in. I am not at all certain that the banks themselves in this country having overseas activities are entirely happy about the precise lines upon which they might be allowed to qualify. Therefore, I have no practical proposal to make at present for bringing banks within the framework of this Bill.<br/>
None the less, I think it important that the position of the banks should be considered. I should like the Financial Secretary to give a little further explanation on the Motion, That the Clause stand part of the Bill, of the consideration which the Government have given to the position of banks and indicate that they would be willing in the months ahead to consider the position again, so that if a good case could be made&#x2014;as may well prove to be so&#x2014;perhaps in a subsequent Finance Bill the banks could be brought within the ambit of Part IV.</p>

<p>While welcoming, like my hon. Friend the Member for Langstone (Mr. Stevens), the provisions of Part IV and accepting the disqualifications and the way in which they are drafted, none the less I wish to ask the Financial Secretary for some further clarification of subsection (3, <i>a</i> (11)) in relation to the ordinary commercial operations of pastoral and stock and station agencies in Australasia, as they are called.<br/>
This Clause deals with lending money. The point I wish to make is a relatively narrow one as to what "wholly or mainly" means. I had an Amendment on the Order Paper which, if it had been


called, might have clarified the matter, but I can explain the point quite shortly. These businesses consist largely of the following categories of work: firstly, the sale of wool, of land and of stock for auction and by private treaty on a commercial basis; secondly, the sale of agricultural merchandise of various kinds to their clients, machinery and other agricultural necessities&#x2014;in particular to farmers in Australasia; and, thirdly, the operation of grazing properties.<br/>
Of those categories, by far the most important is the sale of livestock and the sale of wool and the sale of land. As the Committee will be aware, that is vital to Australasian economy and it is of vital importance to the British Commonwealth in the export trade. The Committee will be familiar with the amount of wool sold, in particular to the United States of America. The United Kingdom companies&#x2014;there are five or six of them&#x2014;behave with very great responsibility and have a high reputation in Australasia for the manner in which they carry out their operations.<br/>
One of the matters which is particularly highly regarded is the way in which they arrange orderly marketing of agricultural products and in that connection, as a customary part of their operations, they provide their clients with finance pending the sales of commodities in which they are interested. For instance, they might lend money to a farmer while the wool is growing on the back of his sheep. That is an example, but there are many other such activities. This is an ordinary matter of quite natural commercial practice.<br/>
I have looked at the accounts of a number of these companies and I have the accounts of one such company in front of me. When we look at the total income derived from these different activities and compare the activities of buying and selling on commission in the way I have described with the activities of lending to clients and the gross income derived from those two things, it is clear that the lending of money constitutes a very small part of the business, but when we look at the net figure when a large sum of money is involved, a rather different picture is shown.<br/>
It is not clear at the moment how the Inland Revenue will judge this matter, whether it will judge it on the basis of the gross figure, which I should have

thought the logical basis, or judge it on the basis of the net figure. Should it judge it on the basis of the net figure, it would seem quite unreasonable because that would mean that these companies would be disqualified from being considered overseas trade corporations, although in fact on the face of it, in logic and from the point of view of the layman, they would seem abundantly qualified.<br/>
That is the point I ask the Financial Secretary to give an answer to or to resolve in some way, but two other points arise out of this subsection. Firstly, in regard to the wording of the Clause it may be that I have slightly misunderstood it, but it seems that the long sentence comprises two different things, lending money on the one hand and providing capital for hire purchase operations on the other. I take it that those are two separate things and that one should not read the subsection as meaning lending money for the purpose of its provision for hire purchase purposes. I take it that entirely separate operations are concerned in that subsection.<br/>
The second additional point is this. I do not wish to enter upon a discussion of Clause 32 at the moment because I realise that would be out of order, but we find that subsection (2, <i>b</i>) of that Clause comprises the lending of money without security. In this case the question of whether or not the clients of the companies concerned give security for the loans they receive is not mentioned. I am told that in Australia in particular, and especially in the State of Victoria, if one asks for security one is thought to be quite mad. To ask for security is not done.<br/>
I wonder why there should be this distinction in the Clause. It might be that hon. Members may think Victoria is a very desirable place in which to live, but this is a matter of some importance to the companies concerned. In dealing with these matters this is a large part of their important business, which is vital to this country. I should be grateful if the Financial Secretary could say why the difference is made in the wording later and not here. I am quite satisfied with the way in which the Clause is drafted.</p>

<p>I wish to ask the Financial Secretary a question about the interpretation of subsection (5). He will be aware


that we put down some Amendments to this Clause which, in effect, would have stipulated that the companies must have a permanent establishment in the area in which they are trading in order to qualify as O.T.C.s.<br/>
Those Amendments have not been called, so we have to look at the interpretation of the subsection as it remains unamended. The question I want to ask is this. Subsection (5) says:
<q>A company shall not qualify as an Overseas Trade Corporation unless&#x2014;</q>
<q>(<i>a</i>) the profits arising from the whole of the trade carried on by the company are chargeable in a country or countries&#x2026;to income tax&#x2026;</q>
That means, in other words, unless Income Tax would have been paid on its trade in the foreign country.<br/>
Suppose that a company in this country sells not by means of a permanent establishment in a foreign country but merely by means of an agent who is more or less a general broker and does not confine himself to selling the firm's goods, but the goods are nevertheless sold in such a way that Income Tax in that country will fall on the proceeds, is not the exporting company in some way brought within the terms of the Clause? It would be selling merely through an agent and undertaking little or no risk. However, because the profits on its wares would be subject to Income Tax in the foreign country as they passed through the hands of an agent, that company would be able to qualify as an O.T.C. and accumulate untaxed reserves in that foreign country which might presumably be used for starting up a business there or establishing its own sales outlet there.<br/>
The puzzle is what will happen where exporting companies are merely acting through agents. Will they have the benefit of the Clause? Will they be able to accumulate funds in the countries where they are merely selling? Where companies are undertaking no risks of any magnitude in the foreign market and meeting no real competition but are merely leaving it all to an agent, is it right that the Bill should be extended to cover them? These are problems which one foresees if the Clause is unamended.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Langstone (Mr. Stevens) reminded the Committee that we are taking the

first, and necessarily experimental, step in a new departure in our tax law. Therefore, he will realise that such questions as he raised about the possibility of bringing banking in any form within the ambit of Part IV must be given further consideration. The main problem, as he recognised, is that it is extremely difficult to separate that part of the profits of a banking business which are made in this country by the central operations from those made overseas. That is at the heart of the difficulty about placing banking business in the same position as other businesses which qualify under Part IV. As I have said, this is the first stage, and we shall have to see what experience teaches us as we go on in its application.<br/>
With regard to the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton (Mr. du Cann), I understand that the companies which he has particularly in mind have been in touch with the Inland Revenue which is examining the facts of the undertakings and their business. Therefore, all that I ought to say at the moment is that "consisting wholly or mainly" is intended to convey the general emphasis of the undertakings of the firm concerned. My hon. Friend also referred to Clause 32, but that is concerned with a different matter, not with the disqualification of a company but with whether part of its receipts rank as trading or investment income. I can confirm, as he said, that the two matters which are dealt with in sub-paragraph (ii) are separate and not cumulative.<br/>
5.45 p.m.<br/>
The hon. Member for Northfield (Mr. Chapman) spoke about an overseas trade corporation carrying on a merchant business, but carrying it on, as it were, indirectly and not directly. It must, of course, be entirely an overseas merchant business, and it must be one in which no profits are earned in this country. The other provisions of the Clause and other Clauses in Part IV are designed to produce that effect. That being so, what the subsection in question is designed to achieve is that no part of those profits&#x2014;they are profits of the company and not of the agent; we are dealing only with the profits of the company&#x2014;are earned in such circumstances that no local tax system bites upon them. That is why the Bill does not in any way have the effect


of absolving from both United Kingdom tax and local tax, whatever or wherever it is, any part of the profits of a company.<br/>
If there is a situation in which as a result of these provisions there would be no tax liability anywhere, here or in any other country, then the company would be disqualified by subsection (5). I think that the main problem which the hon. Member had in mind was concerned with-other parts of the Clause and other provisions of this Part of the Bill, those which ensure that no profits earned in this country shall rank for the exemption given by Part IV.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-06-27a.463.0" hansard_membership_id="5220" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/15395" speakername="Mr. Gordon Walker" colnum="463" time="">
<p>I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for the care with which he has replied to the points raised. I had intended to speak before he rose. First, can he tell us what a "recognised market" is? I should have thought that "recognised" demands "by" after it. It must be recognised by someone. I hope that he will be able to deal with this point.<br/>
Subsection (2) deals with the necessity to sell exports at f.o.b. prices to an overseas subsidiary if it is to be an O.T.C. I presume from my reading of the Bill that any O.T.C. which broke these provisions by not selling at genuine f.o.b. prices would be disqualified as an O.T.C. Who decides that it should be disqualified? How long would it be disqualified? Would it have an appeal against disqualification?<br/>
These are important points, because subsection (2) has been inserted specially to satisfy foreign criticism, particularly about the terms of G.A.T.T., and if it is not clear how the provision is to be enforced there will be very considerable doubts in the minds of other countries which are members of G.A.T.T. We are inclined to think that this part of the Clause will be unenforceable. It is extremely important that there should be a very clear penalty on anyone who is caught. However, I think it would be extremely difficult to enforce in the general run of things. Our view is that all these f.o.b. provisions are eyewash put in to satisfy foreign critics of the Government. We do not wish to divide against the Clause, because it contains disqualifications which must be provided. The

f.o.b. part of it will arise again on Clause 28 where we can go into the matter at greater length.<br/>
One major point about the Clause to which I should like to draw the hon. Gentleman's attention is this. The Clause contains the disqualifications. I take it that any overseas trade corporation can disqualify itself deliberately by infringing any of these provisions. The disqualifications apply whether done deliberately or not. Therefore, any overseas trade corporation that found it convenient to stop being one just disqualifies itself, and then, presumably, requalifies itself later if it so wishes.<br/>
In other words, is it not true that by the provisions of Clause 21, which are designed to limit the concessions of this part, a company can, so to speak, pop in and out of the status of an overseas trade corporation as it wishes; that it can deliberately disqualify itself and then requalify itself? Say it does a little trading at home&#x2014;it disqualifies itself by doing so, and it might be very convenient for it to do so. For some tax reason or other it then wants to requalify, so it stops that trading at home. Is not the effect of the Clause that companies can, if it is convenient for them for tax purposes, opt in and out?<br/>
How are we to guard against that? if that is the effect, does it not open up a rather wide door for people to dispose of their status as an overseas trade corporation, or disqualifying themselves as one? Does it not mean that they could really arrange their tax affairs more freely than could those companies in the United Kingdom that could not possibly qualify as overseas trade corporations? This would give special benefit to those who could qualify for that status, then disqualify themselves and later requalify. This seems to us to be a point of some importance, and I should like to hear the views of the Government on it.</p>

<p>Perhaps the Committee will excuse me if I do not at this stage deal with the question of a recognised market, since we shall in due course reach Amendments dealing with that.<br/>
The second point that the right hon. Member for Smethwick (Mr. Gordon Walker) put to me related to the matters set out in subsection (2)&#x2014;if there is disqualification, how long does it last and


what right of appeal is there? In the first instance, of course, it is the business of the Inland Revenue to apply the tax law. If it appears to the Inland Revenue that the trading income of a company is not exempt, that the company does not qualify as an overseas trade corporation by reason of the disqualifications here set out, the Department will assess it for tax in this country as not being an overseas trade corporation&#x2014;</p>

<p>These are very detailed provisions about the terms of particular contracts. How does the hon. Gentleman anticipate that, in the ordinary course of taxation practice, the Inland Revenue is to find out whether such and such a sale, in the case of a company which may carry on many sales in the year, was strictly f.o.b., without any services being rendered or charges incurred?</p>

<p>Of course, the Inland Revenue will have to be satisfied about the business as a whole and that the conditions in this part of the Bill are fulfilled. It is proposed to give the Department extensive powers to obtain the necessary information. The price charged is a matter which arises under Clause 28, and the existing powers of the Income Tax Acts are there applied to transactions such as one might here be concerned with. But the general procedure is clearly&#x2014;</p>

<p>I apologise for troubling the hon. Gentleman again, but I know of no provision at present under which the Inland Revenue would be able to get this detailed information. Perhaps even now, or on some future occasion, the Financial Secretary would tell me about it. It would seem to involve disclosure of the particular contracts. Moreover, I do not understand how the Inland Revenue is to begin. It is given the accounts of a company, or whatever it is&#x2014;and these are the terms of every single contract. As I understand it, if a company enters into a single contract otherwise than on strict f.o.b. terms, it is thereby disqualified for a period.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-06-27a.465.3" hansard_membership_id="5594" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30191" speakername="Mr. Powell" colnum="465" time="">
<p>As we shall see when we come to Clause 28, the Inland Revenue already inquires into the prices at which transactions take place between companies, and inquires into the details of those transactions for tax purposes. There is no essential difference between

its satisfying itself on these matters and satisfying itself as to the starting point of the business which is carried on by a company claiming overseas trade corporation status.<br/>
As I have said, the procedure will be that if the Inland Revenue is not satisfied that the company has avoided these disqualifications its duty will be to assess the company to United Kingdom Income Tax. The normal appeal procedure will then follow&#x2014;the appeal to the Commissioners, and, on points of law, appeal to the High Court. There is, therefore, the normal, impartial resort as between the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue in this case, as generally.<br/>
The disqualification, like the qualification, applies, in general&#x2014;and detailed exceptions appear later in the part&#x2014;for a year. Overseas trade corporation status, like the tax code on which it bites, is a matter of the tax year. It is a year to year matter, and it is therefore for the Inland Revenue to satisfy itself year by year that companies to which this status is accorded are not disqualified in any of the ways set out in the Bill.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman raised the very important question of a company deliberately disqualifying itself, for tax avoidance purposes, in years when it was convenient for it not to be an overseas trade corporation. This is a matter which is germane to that discussed by the Committee yesterday, when my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kensington, South (Sir P. Spens) raised the question of an option&#x2014;to be or not to be an overseas trade corporation.<br/>
It will quite clearly be necessary to take steps to prevent companies from being able to disqualify themselves for tax avoidance purposes, and to give a discretion to the Inland Revenue, such as it has in a good many circumstances already&#x2014;as it already has, for example, under Clause 27&#x2014;not to accord overseas trade corporation status to a company which is clearly hopping in and out of that status for tax avoidance purposes. It is my right hon. Friend's intention to take measures to that end in the Amendments which he will table on Report to meet, in part, the point raised yesterday by my right hon. and learned Friend.</p>

<p>Yes, it would be very much more convenient to discuss that Schedule with this Amendment which, indeed, is just put down to bring in the Schedule.<br/>
This is a major Amendment from our point of view. Granted that the principle of the Bill is being accepted, this is the best we can do with it, and I hope that the Chancellor will pay serious attention to the arguments we use. So far, he has been a bit slap-happy and reckless, not to say frivolous, in his attitude to our Amendments He says that it does not matter what the Board of Inland Revenue says and it does not matter what the Royal Commission says. He says that it does not matter what the effect on our balance of payments is. All that matters is something called overseas trade, which sounds rather good&#x2014;one can make a patriotic appeal about it&#x2014;but which, apparently, really means that things now manufactured in this country will be manufactured abroad with the blessing and encouragement of the Government. That is really the essence of the Chancellor's argument so far. It is really not good enough for him to brush everything else aside and

work on a sort of instinct, giving no reasons at all for what he is doing, and certainly not troubling to controvert, if he can, the arguments we put forward.<br/>
6.0 p.m.<br/>
I will not go through the things we have to say about the general principle of the Bill, but it is clear that we are very doubtful about the whole project of setting up overseas trade corporations. We do not believe that the country commands the necessary resources to be diverted on such a scale to overseas investment at the moment, and we think that it will damage our balance of payments. Indeed, the Chancellor is in agreement with us about that; at any rate, in the short run&#x2014;and we really do not know how long will be the run&#x2014;the Government's proposal, he admits, will have a bad effect on our balance of payments. It is, moreover, clear that certain sorts of overseas trade will have a worse effect on our balance of payments than others.<br/>
Holding those views, we have put down the proposed new Schedule, the purposes of which is, first, to scale down the whole extent of this concession and, secondly, to discriminate between one sort of undertaking in overseas trade and another, partly for political reasons, in order to give preference to trade in the Commonwealth, and partly for economic reasons, because there are certain sorts of overseas trade which are less harmful to our balance of payments in the short run than other forms of overseas investment.<br/>
The principle we adopt is to differentiate by percentage of United Kingdom tax remitted and by reference to the area in which the trade is taking place. There are many examples in the world of these two methods being used, either separately or in conjunction, and it cannot, therefore, be argued that what we propose is unworkable. It may be argued that it is undesirable, but it cannot be argued that it is unworkable. The United States, for instance, does just this; it gives a percentage reduction against home tax and it discriminates according to the area in which the overseas trade is taking place.<br/>
American trade in the Western hemisphere, but not elsewhere, is given between 27 and 30 per cent. rebate against local United States tax. That is very much the same as we are proposing in our Amendment. Trade in the United


States possessions is given 100 per cent. remission of United States tax. The Americans. therefore, are doing just what we suggest we should do; they are discriminating by percentage rebate according to areas and the political importance of the trade for the United States or United States possessions.<br/>
We ourselves in our own legislation have drawn this distinction between Commonwealth and non-Commonwealth or extra-Commonwealth trade by the very same device of a percentage in the unilateral double taxation relief provided for in Section 348 of the Income Tax Act, 1952. If one is trading with a Commonwealth country with which we have not got a double taxation agreement and we therefore give unilateral double taxation relief, 75 per cent. of United Kingdom tax is remitted; whereas if one is trading in similar circumstances in a foreign country, not in the Commonwealth, the rebate for double taxation is only 50 per cent. It will be seen that we ourselves already, in our own existing legislation, make the distinction by variable percentage between Commonwealth and non-Commonwealth trade. New Zealand gives concessions only to overseas trade in other Commonwealth countries, not in foreign countries. Belgium does it by percentage, giving 20 per cent. relief. France gives special reliefs in the French Union.<br/>
There are plenty of examples of the method being used. Indeed, the way it is proposed to do it in the Bill really seems to be unique. When one looks at what other nations do, one does not find that any of them have picked that way. Practically all other countries which use this sort of device have, in fact, done it more or less along the lines which we propose in our new Schedule. We argue, therefore, with conviction, that our proposals are at least practicable and workable, and they will stand up.<br/>
The actual way in which we apply the principles is really very simple. Every overseas trade corporation would get a basic rate of 20 per cent. of its United Kingdom tax remitted to it for overseas trade, which happens to be the level that Belgium gives to her overseas trade corporations. We, however, add to that, namely that if the overseas trade corporation is trading in the Commonwealth it

shall have double the basic rate, namely a 40 per cent. remission of United Kingdom Income Tax. Then we give a bonus of 10 per cent. over and above that in both cases to all overseas trade corporations dealing in plantations, mines, oil wells, public utilities and similar things. In other words, for such overseas trade corporations as deal in extractive industries of one sort or another, the basic remission of Income Tax would be 30 per cent. and, if trading in the Commonwealth, 50 per cent.<br/>
The reason for the bonus is that undertakings engaged in the sort of operations referred to are the best from the point of view of our balance of payments. They are operations of a kind designed to produce imports into this country at as cheap a rate as possible. If one is going to do this at all, there is a good deal to be said for encouraging investment particularly in the sort of undertakings which are more likely to turn the terms of trade in our favour. If there is to be. as the Chancellor has admitted, at any rate an ill effect in the short run upon our balance of payments, it is better to try to arrange mattes so that that bad effect is as small as possible.</p>

<p>In our proposed Schedule, we recognise what has been argued from both sides of the Committee, that there is a special reason for giving full benefit to what we call pioneer companies, companies which are given pioneer relief in some Colony. We provide that, where there is pioneer relief of this sort, the British company concerned shall get the full extent of that relief should it be more than it would get otherwise under our proposed Schedule according to the type of trade it is conducting.<br/>
This proposal, therefore, is a workable one. It is very much more sensible than the Government's proposal. It is related to the true needs and interests of the nation and of the Commonwealth. It is extremely important, when discriminating in this way, to give a clear preference in favour of the Commonwealth, and this we do in our Schedule. The Government stubbornly and stoutly refused to do it, though, of course, they have today every


opportunity of doing so by accepting our Amendment.<br/>
If the Chancellor or the Economic Secretary advise the Committee to reject the Amendment, they will be asking the Committee to reject the whole principle of giving preference to the Commonwealth when dealing with this sort of thing. In our view this is a constructive, carefully thought-out proposal which is greatly preferable to the one at present in Part IV.</p>

<p>I would not have risen but for the observations made repeatedly throughout the debate yesterday that the Amendment and its attendant Schedule were to be the great feature of the debate and that those of us who were deeply attached to the cause of Commonwealth development should find ourselves in the Lobby with the right hon.

<p>The hon. Member is wrong. Our real proposal is in a new Clause. This method is merely assuming that it has to be done the way the Government want it. The new Clause should really attract the hon. Member, because it would give the entire help to the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman at least began his remarks by saying that this was a most important Amendment. If he now wishes to run away from that, I am in company with him, because while I am always ready to support any proposal which effectively discriminates in favour of Commonwealth interests, I do not think that this proposal would do so.<br/>
There may well be a case for giving selective reliefs. Certainly, throughout our discussions so far, the balance of payments has loomed large and I well see the motive behind the argument which has been advanced from the benches opposite. I should have thought, however, that if any particular trades were to be given selective reliefs, basing the case for doing so on the balance of payments argument, they should be those earning dollars and hard currency.<br/>
There is a fallacy, which perhaps the Committee has noticed, in the right hon. Gentleman's arguments. The provisions of the Amendment and the Schedule

apply only to overseas trade corporations&#x2014;that is to say, to companies trading overseas and resident in the United Kingdom. If that be so, they cannot apply to the subsidiaries of British companies trading overseas. Yet the Schedule draws attention to the frustration of pioneer reliefs and the whole purpose of the proposal, I take it, is that that frusttration should, in part at least, be removed.</p>

<p>Agreed. But the point with which the right hon. Gentleman is not seized is that pioneer concessions are given in British Colonial Territories&#x2014;at least, in the main, if not wholly&#x2014;to companies registered abroad, which are wholly excluded from the Bill and which are not overseas trade corporations and are, therefore, quite outside the scope of these proposals. Thus, the Schedule is complete nonsense.<br/>
As I understand it, the proposal here is that benefits arising from overseas trade corporation status should be enjoyed on a discriminatory basis, the maximum benefit being 50 per cent. in the case of certain companies and certain kinds of trade. It is interesting to observe, therefore, that the party opposite wishes in respect of these companies to whittle down by half the concession which my right hon. Friend is willing to extend to them. That is an odd way of helping the Commonwealth.<br/>
6.15 p.m.<br/>
I ask the Committee, however, to observe something else in order to get the matter in perspective. The argument used by the right hon. Gentleman&#x2014;it was implied throughout everything said by him and his hon. Friends yesterday&#x2014;is that this proposal was designed to help the Commonwealth. I should point out that while such companies operating in foreign countries would get a 50 per cent. relief, other companies operating in the Commonwealth will get only a 40 per cent. relief or less. This is not only a discriminatory provision, but in some respect it discriminates against companies operating in the Commonwealth. Because of that, I consider the right hon. Gentleman's proposal mean, restrictive and cumbersome and I hope that the Committee will reject it.</p>

<p>The right hon. Member for Smethwick (Mr. Gordon Walker) was, I thought, glowing with the pride of authorship when he made his speech. It is certainly an ingenious proposal and it is a pleasure to see hon. Members opposite seeking to give some preference to the Commonwealth. That, of course, is a great change from the past. So many Socialist idols have fallen that they now find it necessary to lay their votive gifts at the feet of Lord Beaverbrook. At any rate, it is something that we can welcome.<br/>
The first point to be noted if one wants to benefit the Commonwealth is that the effect of accepting the Amendment would be to reduce the amount of relief granted to those companies. Secondly, it departs entirely from the principle both of the Royal Commission Report and of the Bill, that is, the principle of jurisdiction. In other words, the tax is levied in the country where the company is operating. The Amendment departs from that and it goes in for a large amount of discrimination&#x2014;one might say discrimination with a vengeance. The right hon. Gentleman yesterday was very severe about discrimination. He said:
<q>&#x2026;we do not like the radical departure from the basic tax principle of this country, that there should not be discrimination between taxpayers."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 26th June, 1957; Vol. 572, c. 310.]</q>
The Amendment would bring about very considerable discrimination, and, in the nature of the case, that discrimination would be bound to be arbitrary. For example, the taxation on mining companies operating outside the Commonwealth would be higher than on those mining companies operating inside the Commonwealth, regardless of whether the metal that the mine produces was available in the Commonwealth. For

example, borax is not, I think, available in the Commonwealth. This provision would penalise the production of something which is of immense importance to this country.<br/>
We all want to help the Commonwealth, but we cannot invest in the Commonwealth unless we have money to invest, and we cannot get that money unless we can trade all over the world. We cannot live in the Commonwealth simply by taking in each other's washing. Therefore, discrimination of this sort would not only be against the principle of the Bill and against what was said in the Royal Commission's Report, but it would also diminish our capacity to help the Commonwealth by reducing our trade, our world wide balance of payments and our economic strength. It is on our economic strength that our ability to help the Commonwealth depends.</p>

<p>I am rather surprised at the Economic Secretary's reply. I agree that yesterday we on this side of the Committee said that we were against discrimination, and I agree that our Amendment produces discrimination, but, if the right hon. Gentleman will recollect, we were yesterday opposed to the whole principle of Part IV of the Bill, and our point is that if we have to accept Part IV then let the discrimination be in the most favourable way for the Commonwealth.<br/>
I should like to refer to three aspects of the Amendment, namely, the partial relief, the Commonwealth preference and the discrimination in favour of the extractive and agricultural industries. The Chancellor said yesterday that he was a hundred percenter. He showed that he had a bold and buccaneering spirit, and he was loudly cheered by his supporters. This is very encouraging. It has an almost schoolboyish charm about it, but, of course, this bold spirit is being shown at the expense of other people's money and at the expense of the right hon. Gentleman's own responsibilities. Therefore, it is not quite as commendable as it might at first seem to be.<br/>
I suggest to the Chancellor that when he is indulging in a completely unknown and unforeseeable type of fiscal measure he should proceed cautiously, and to proceed cautiously here is to make these reliefs partial. The right hon. Gentleman


must bear in mind that there will be regulations in other countries. It is quite likely that other countries will start making concessions to their overseas corporations, or their equivalent, and will therefore nullify the measures that we are taking today.<br/>
If, on the other hand, our measures are of a partial nature they are not likely to cause such a stir and such a strong reaction on the part of other countries. The Chancellor must bear in mind that in many countries where there are overseas trade corporations there is a strong feeling of nationalism. A sudden sweeping 100 per cent., such as is proposed in the Bill, might well give the impression that there is to be a wholesale invasion of those countries by British firms, and it might result in nationalistic disapproval.<br/>
As to the aspect of caution, from the purely budgetary point of view if we have these discriminatory percentages they can be varied from year to year in accordance with the conditions of world trade. All Chancellors over the past few years have been painfully familiar with the sudden and repeated variations which there can be in world trading conditions. Here, by means of the Amendment, we on this side of the Committee are providing a mechanism for varying discrimination so as to obtain the maximum advantage.<br/>
Obviously, there is a strong argument for giving preference to the Commonwealth because it occupies such a high place in our export trade, and the sterling area is in a constant state of capital shortage. If the Chancellor accepted the Amendment he would certainly ensure that capital would be exported to those places where it would produce the maximum advantage both to ourselves and to the sterling area. The Chancellor will also find that the constant problem that he has to face is that of the sterling balances. Our Amendment would ensure that such capital as is exported would tend to go into the sterling area rather than outside it, and would tend on the whole to ease that problem.<br/>
The Chancellor is already aware that Commonwealth trade is considerably weakened. There have been difficulties in our trade with Australia and New Zealand and a very big decrease in Commonwealth trade as opposed to

world trade as a whole. Therefore, here again our Amendment will have a very helpful effect. The right hon. Gentleman must also bear in mind that there is a definite psychological value in any Amendment which gives Commonwealth preference, because Commonwealth ties have been rather painfully weakened in the last year through unhappy events into which we will not now go in detail.<br/>
The other aspect of the Amendment is the preference for the extractive and agricultural industries. That is an obvious advantage in that these industries produce substances of which we have a great need in this country and of which there is a world shortage. Therefore. anything that tends to increase their production will be valuable. In addition, capital invested in extractive industries and agricultural production will cheapen those products. Thereby, there will he an improvement in our terms of trade and consequent benefit to our balance of payments. On the other hand, if the Chancellor's concessions are given to manufacturing, processing and distributing industries, there will be a tendency for those industries to sell their goods at considerably lower prices without any increased productivity, and that will have an opposite effect of making the terms of trade move against us. Again, there will be a tendency for the interests of British workers to be prejudiced if Part IV of the Bill is passed completely unamended.<br/>
Another matter which the Chancellor should particularly bear in mind is that there will be competition between various countries to obtain British capital. The result will be that the poorer countries, which will be unable to give tax concessions, will tend to fall away in the race and they will suffer. That, from an elementary point of view of humanity, anyone who has any familiarity with the standard of living in some of the Commonwealth and Colonial territories will certainly take very seriously in mind.<br/>
The Amendment, therefore, is something of a watershed. It is the dividing point. The Committee should be told quite clearly what the Chancellor's intentions are. Does he intend that Part IV should be of real value to our balance of payments position and to world trade generally, or is Part IV simply another concession to the shareholders and to the upper income groups, rather like his


Surtax concession? Here we on this side of the Committee are providing an Amendment which will have a logical effect and will make sure that the benefits of Part IV, such as they are, will be distributed in the manner most acceptable to our balance of payments and to our Commonwealth generally.<br/>
Yesterday the Chancellor made a statement which should receive a prize as the under-statement of the Session when he said that he was not shocked by shareholders benefiting. Is that the keynote to Part IV? Is it first and foremost a question of shareholders benefiting, or does the right hon. Gentleman want to produce a useful Measure that will produce ultimate prosperity for the country?</p>

<p>The Amendment under discussion relates to Clause 22, which is really the main operative Clause in Part IV of the Bill. First we had Clause 20 which gave us the definition of an overseas trade corporation. then Clause 21 gave us the disqualifications, and Clause 22 gives us the main Income Tax relief on overseas trade corporations.<br/>
I can understand the Treasury Bench feeling so weary of all this at this stage for it is a wearisome and complicated task. This is the kind of provision in the Finance Bill which can go through without adequate discussion because it is so complex. and it is so difficult to grasp that it might easily escape critical examination in this Committee. Yet under this Clause there are more millions of tax relief, I think I am right in saying, than in any other Clause in the Bill. That shows how important it is. I will not say that this is the Clause under which&#x2014;</p>

<p>Yes, Sir William. I was coming to the Amendment in a moment. I thought I had better first say what the Clause did before I discussed what the Amendment tried to do with it. It probably takes a little longer but I will get there very soon. I was about to say that the Royal Commission on the Taxation of Profits and Income

devoted about twenty-four pages of its report to the matter with which this Clause deals and which our Amendment seeks to alter.<br/>
There is no doubt that the Royal Commission had great difficulty in making up its mind on this matter. If we re-read Chapter 24 of that report which deals with overseas profits, we appreciate that the arguments and the counter-arguments and the analyses of the taxation aspects of this matter gave the Royal Commission a good deal of trouble. It is a form of discrimination in our tax system which the House of Commons always looks at very critically. The Clause proposes one way of doing it, the Royal Commission examined an alternative as well as the method adopted in the Clause, and the Amendment suggests another way of doing the same thing.<br/>
What we are dealing with is a matter of opinion based on examination of the administration problems involved and the purposes of the tax relief which it is proposed to give. It depends on consideration of all those matters as to what conclusion we reach. In paragraph 666 the Royal Commission said that there were two main alternatives in the methods of granting exemption. One was to define a particular kind of profit as overseas profit and to exempt that in the hands of the taxpayer. The other was to define a particular kind of corporation as an overseas trader and to exempt all the profits or, perhaps, all the income and profits of that corporation.<br/>
There are difficulties about both, both as matters of policy and of administration. The Amendment suggests a third way of channelling this tax relief into overseas activities in the Commonwealth. The Economic Secretary has raised some objections to it. There are objections to be raised to almost anything one can think of in this context, and it is a matter of the balance of considerations which leads to the final conclusion.<br/>
The main point, however, is what are we trying to do? The Chancellor seems to be in no doubt about what he wants to do. He wants to give this relief to overseas trade activities on a very wide scale. It can be questioned whether the full extent of the Chancellor's purpose is necessary to bring about that incentive to the development of overseas trade, which is the only purpose of this tax relief.


There are few grounds for this relief by reference to considerations of equity.<br/>
Their economic purpose is really the mainspring of these proposals, and when the Royal Commission reached certain conclusions under the heading of "The Action Recommended" on page 206 of the report, it said:
<q>Any scheme that is put into operation on these lines touches economic issues of great importance. We have tried to identify and analyse those issues in the earlier part of this Chapter. Such a scheme can only be justified in the long run by its contribution towards success in the handling of those issues. It is by this that it will have to be judged rather than by theoretical arguments of equity.</q>
It is by reference to that criterion that we have to judge the Chancellor's proposals and the alternative to them in the Amendment. However doubtful we may feel as to the case for this relief in general, there is no doubt that we should feel more enthusiastic about it if the relief were being given to help overseas trade in the Commonwealth. That, at least, is something which has great sentimental interest as well as an economic and Commonwealth purpose, and is to be warmly welcomed.<br/>
The Chancellor's proposals, of course, go much further and really amount to a wide discrimination in favour of capital which is employed outside the United Kingdom and not necessarily within the Commonwealth. I know some people think that it is a bad principle to discriminate between the home and the export trade in any circumstances. There are also criticisms which can be levelled against proposals which compel firms in this country with overseas activities to go through complicated processes of hiving off their overseas trading activities in order to bring them within the scope of this relief, involving reorganisation, extensive professional advice, the creation of fresh companies and the like, none of which will increase the national income in this country by a single penny&#x2014;though the Chancellor no doubt says in his mind that eventually he not only hopes he will, but feels confident that he will achieve this result.<br/>
There are administrative difficulties which can be raised against our Amendment. There are administrative difficulties which can be raised against the Clause and any alternative to the Clause. Indeed it is no secret now, it appears, that the Board of Inland Revenue addressed

themselves at great length to the Royal Commission on a great number of them. It is unfortunate that their evidence to the Royal Commission on matters covered by this Clause and by this Amendment have become available in such a queer fashion.<br/>
The Financial Secretary reminded me last night that documents prepared by the Inland Revenue and submitted to the Royal Commission were dealt with in a certain way by the Royal Commission, and copies of these documents were deposited in the British Museum, the National Library of Scotland and other libraries mentioned in paragraph 12 of the Final Report of the Royal Commission. No mention was made about the documents being in the Library of the House of Commons. I went to the Library a few moments ago and got hold of the last copy. Hon. Members who want to look at the memoranda will be at a disadvantage because there will be no copies in the Library. I do not think that is the proper way to do business.<br/>
I do not want to quote from any of the memoranda, because I think that in a way they were privileged documents. The Inland Revenue addressed itself not only to the difficulties of administration of the Clause and anything resembling our Amendment, but to the policy of the matter as well. I am not questioning its right to do so. It is fully entitled to say that those who are claiming relief under Clause 22 have failed to make out their case for it if that opinion is based on the evidence and information in the possession of the Department. I am not quarrelling with that.<br/>
However, I am not sure whether that view should be available for publication and quotation unless the consent of the Inland Revenue has been obtained and unless it is available for all to see and it is not merely confined to libraries or those hon. Members who may have visited our Library a little earlier than I did. All I would say on that is that some hon. Members are better equipped than others to deal with the problems arising on the Clause and our Amendment, and this is solely due to the memoranda being given a restricted circulation instead of their having the full benefit of publication.<br/>
Leaving that aside, I think we can go to the main bible of this and other


matters in Part IV, and that is the Report of the Royal Commission. Extended consideration was given to the subject. The headings in Chapter 24 are suggestive:
<q>General observations.
The problem ascertained.
The case for exemption.
The case against exemption.
Further differences of view on the general argument.</q>
We have not finished yet. Even when we have stated all the arguments for exemption and all the arguments against it, there is more to be said, and it was said under the heading:
<q>Further differences of view on the general argument.</q>
Other headings were:
<q>Possible methods of exemption.
The charge on distributions.
The action recommended.</q>
The Chancellor has adopted in the Clause the recommendation, if it can be called that, of the Royal Commission, though it says in coming down on that side of the fence&#x2014;that is, discrimination in favour of an Overseas Trade Corporation rather than discrimination in favour of particular types of overseas income or profit&#x2014;
<q>We have decided to base our recommendation on a scheme of this kind because it is the one that would receive the largest measure of support among the signatories to this Report, of whom some would not be ready to recommend a more comprehensive measure.</q> So the Royal Commission was hesitant and even divided right to the last in making its recommendation.<br/>
6.45 p.m.<br/>
We have to ask ourselves whether this very large tax relief is necessary or justified for the whole range of overseas trade corporations, written down by the disqualifications in the preceding Clause, in the present economic situation. On that, as we were saying yesterday, opinions will differ considerably. The narrow issue on the Amendment is whether those reliefs should be given to overseas trade activities in the Commonwealth and not generally, and even then there would be variations in the amount of the relief according to the type of company or activity undertaken.<br/>
All our reservations against the scheme as a whole come out once more on this

Clause. The Government have said that they will not accept the Amendment Presumably, in a few moments we shall pass to a discussion on the Clause, which is the real issue of Part IV. There is a large body of opinion in the country and among those who have been discussing these matters intelligently that it would have been better, as a beginning at all events, to give the relief a more restricted scope than that proposed in the Clause and to give greater emphasis to Commonwealth development in doing so.</p>

<p>I wish to return to the points put before the Committee by the hon. Member for Essex, South-East (Mr. Braine) and the Economic Secretary.<br/>
We all followed the speech of the hon. Member for Essex, South-East very closely, and were grateful for it. It has been rare even to see a Government back bencher, and the privilege of both seeing and hearing one is so remarkable that we do not allow it to go by default. Apart from that, his words would have commanded attention on their own merit.<br/>
None the less, I thought there were one or two fallacies in the hon. Member's points. He reverted to a point on which he was very eloquent yesterday and said that the Schedule was nonsense because it tried to help pioneer companies without dealing with the case of a company which was not resident in this country. As I pointed out in an aside at the time, to the extent that the Schedule is nonsense in that respect, the Bill is equally nonsense. The Chancellor, with whom I am in full agreement on the point, dealt is completely with the issue yesterday. It is one which has a certain amount of force behind it, but it is untrue to say that no help is given to pioneer companies unless the particular point of view of the hon. Member is accepted.<br/>
With regard to another point, I think that the hon. Member has not read the Schedule. I had read it carefully, but I have read it even more carefully since his intervention. I also thought, even more surprisingly, that the Economic Secretary had not read it, because he implied that there were circumstances in which an extractive company outside the Commonwealth would be more favourably treated than any company within the Commonwealth could be.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman referred to something I said and I am glad that he has asked for clarification. I am greatly relieved to hear that the party opposite does not regard Colonial Territories as foreign. If the learned Gentleman looks at line 24 of the Schedule he will see the word "foreign" used there. Amendments and Schedules put before the Committee ought to be couched in language which is clear. Will the hon. Member confirm that the effects of this discrimination might be regarded by the Commonwealth Governments concerned as an attempt by the United Kingdom Government to interfere with, to dictate to or to shape their economies, and that this might invite retaliation? This is really a most dangerous proposal.</p>

<p>In the course of explaining why he misunderstood the Schedule in the first place, the hon. Member has raised an entirely new matter. The use of the phrase
<q>foreign plantation, mine or oil well</q>
arises entirely because we were referring to language used in a previous Act in this respect.<br/>
Clearly, there are two sets of qualifications which we are seeking to apply. First, we are dividing companies into those which operate in the Commonwealth and those which do not. Secondly, we are dividing companies into those which operate plantations, mines or oil wells, broadly speaking, extractive companies, and those which are not extractive companies. On the whole, we are more in favour of Commonwealth countries than non-Commonwealth countries, and more in favour of extractive companies than non-extractive companies. Leaving aside pioneer relief, the type of company which will get the maximum relief, 50 per cent. under our Schedule, is one which fulfils both qualifications, being a Commonwealth company and an extractive company. One which is one or the other, a Commonwealth company but not an

extractive company, gets a slightly lower rate, 40 per cent.; one which is an extractive company, but not a Commonwealth company gets a still lower rate, 30 per cent.; one which is neither gets 20 per cent. I hope that we are all clear on that, including the Economic Secretary. This seems to be a sensible basis of discrimination.<br/>
A perfectly fair point made by the Economic Secretary and which must be met is that yesterday my right hon. Friend the Member for Smethwick (Mr. Gordon Walker) and other hon. Members on this side of the Committee made much of saying that discrimination in tax matters was of itself dangerous. The Economic Secretary thought that he could therefore say today that our discriminatory Schedule was in contradiction to what we had been saying yesterday. That is a point which must be met and which can be met.<br/>
We are confronted with Part IV of the Bill which is extremely discriminatory among companies which, roughly speaking, have an equivalent ability to pay. However, we are not framing our own scheme, but seeking to amend a series of Clauses put forward by the Government themselves and which are very discriminatory. The degree of discrimination does not depend on the number of classes of discrimination. It depends on the difference between those which are chosen and those which are not chosen.<br/>
Our Amendment reduces the difference between those chosen and those not chosen and also puts it on a basis which would be more helpful to our economy and to the purposes which we wish to serve. Nothing we said yesterday should be taken to mean that we believe that discrimination in the tax system can be avoided in all circumstances. What it can be taken to mean is that discrimination is in itself a bad thing and that before one does it one must be sure that there are strong economic arguments in favour of doing it. The Schedule does not cut across the general principles which we put forward yesterday.<br/>
There is something to be said for discrimination in favour of Commonwealth countries, even though under our arrangement the amount of relief permitted, even to Commonwealth countries, is not as great as that under the Chancellor's flat provision. One of the things about which


we are concerned is the channelling of capital into countries overseas, particularly into Commonwealth countries. Yesterday I made it clear that I doubted whether the Bill went too far in offering incentives for the export of capital. Leaving that point aside, it is surely the case, if we are dealing with the export of capital, that if we have discrimination in favour of Commonwealth countries, then, even if the absolute rate of relief is lower than under the Chancellor's proposals, the effect is that more favourable treatment is being given to Commonwealth countries than to non-Commonwealth countries, which means that under our arrangement such capital as is exported is more likely to go to Commonwealth rather than to other countries than would be the case under the Chancellor's flat rate arrangement.<br/>
With our other form of discrimination in favour of extractive industries as opposed to processing, manufacturing, and other categories of industries, we are concentrating upon those industries, the</p>

<p>Those are powerful reasons for accepting this carefully worked out Schedule. We are presented with a position in which the Chancellor is trying to do something, the objects of which we do not dislike, but by methods which we cannot accept. We are circumscribed at this stage to move within the framework which the Chancellor has laid down. We believe that this method would be less harmful to the Revenue and to the balance of payments and more beneficial to the Commonwealth and to the type of industries we want to encourage. I hope that my hon. Friends will carry this matter into the Division Lobby.</p>

<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-06-27a.489.2" hansard_membership_id="6330" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/16343" speakername="Mr. Houghton" colnum="489" time="">
<p>The Committee will be glad to know that most of what I have to say in the debate on the Question, "That the Clause stand part of the Bill", I contrived to say in my speech on the last Amendment. This Clause exempts the trading income of an overseas trade corporation from Income Tax. It does not exempt its investment income, and it prohibits the setting off of trading losses against investment income. It also provides that, notwithstanding the tax relief given in the provisions of this part of the Bill, companies making distributions of profits must deduct Income Tax at the standard rate.<br/>
We do not complain about the latter provision. We do not complain about the prohibition against the setting off of trading losses against investment income, nor about the exclusion of investment income itself from the concession. But the main provision of the Clause is to exempt from Income Tax the trading income of those companies which qualify under the Bill for status as overseas trade corporations.<br/>
This is the biggest "give away" in the Bill. I must be careful in using that phrase, because the Chancellor objects to people saying that he is giving away money when he relieves people of taxation. He prefers to put it that he is allowing the taxpayer to retain more of his own income by the tax relief given. The right hon. Gentleman can have it how he likes, but the fact is that this is a very substantial tax relief indeed, and, in the context of the Budget as a whole, represents approximately one-quarter of

the &#x00A3;100 million tax reliefs given. Therefore, we are discussing a Clause of no small importance. In fact, the whole issue of Part IV of the Bill centres upon the tax relief given and the way of giving it.<br/>
I suppose the first question to ask is whether the tax relief should be given at all. Then, if the answer is "Yes", we consider what is the most appropriate way of giving it. If I were to utilise all the information at my disposal against the principle of the Clause I should have to quote from the memoranda, which I have said I will try not to do. After hearing the evidence of the Board of Inland Revenue and of many other people in trade and in the professions, of economists and others, the Royal Commission, with some hesitation and division of opinion among its members, which seems obvious, came down in favour of the method of giving relief which the Chancellor has adopted.<br/>
I cannot say that the alternative which the Commission examined would have been freer of administrative complications, although I think that it would have enabled the Chancellor to be a little more pointed in his discriminatory policy. The Committee will remember that the two alternatives were, first, to define the kind of income from overseas activities which should be exempted and, secondly, to exempt all income of a particular type of corporation. The former would be highly selective; it would involve a judgment of the economic value of particular activities and discrimination as between one form of trade and another.<br/>
On that basis I should say that the trading activities of the Sao Paulo Company of Brazil&#x2014;which, we understand, is merely a glorified estate agency or


property-owning company&#x2014;would not be high on the list of the Chancellor's priorities if he were looking at the first of the alternatives, namely, to exempt particular kinds of profit from overseas activities. So the Chancellor has rejected that alternative. The Royal Commission felt that there were great difficulties about it and preferred the method which the Chancellor has now adopted.<br/>
The general economic arguments have been canvassed pretty fully and there is little that one can add to them, other than to go on asking questions and providing the best possible answers upon all the available evidence. The big question is: Does the economy of the country need this tax concession? Will it benefit our balance of payments in the manner anticipated? Is it essential to encourage capital investment overseas, at a time when restraints are still put upon capital investment at home? These are all factors which we have to weigh in our minds.<br/>
Britain cannot earn her living wholly or even mainly from profits earned overseas; we have still to do a great deal here to earn our living, and that can be done only if our industries at home are modernised, re-equipped and put into the sort of shape which will enable them to compete in the markets of the world. There are growing fears that some sections, at least, of British industry will certainly have to modernise themselves and make themselves more efficient if they are to go into the European Free Trade Area with confidence that they will be able to maintain their position against competition from other European countries within that Free Trade Area. Before long some industries may regret the fact that they have not invested more of their profits in capital development.<br/>
7.15 p.m.<br/>
We have to hold the balance between the needs of overseas investment and the need for investment at home. The Chancellor himself will recall his regrets at not being able to restore investment allowances over the whole range of home investment, and at having to restrict that additional incentive to investment to a highly particular type of industry.<br/>
In the course of the debate much has been said by way of questioning the doc

trine that this tax relief is necessary to enable us to undertake overseas trade activities in a bigger and bolder way, and to earn more of the national income through overseas trade activities. There are possible dangers, some of which were referred to by the Royal Commission itself. My hon. Friend the Member for Loughborough (Mr. Cronin) alluded indirectly to one of them, namely, the fact that when overseas territories knew what tax relief was being given in Britain to these overseas trade corporations they might feel that they could impose additional taxation upon them locally, and that we should therefore be transferring the benefit from the overseas trade corporations to the Exchequers of the areas in which they were operating. Those are possible dangers, which may mean that the overseas trade corporations will finish up little or no better than before, although the Chancellor has forgone very considerable revenue here in order to meet what he believes to be their needs.<br/>
Our reservations upon the Clause must therefore express themselves in the traditional way. The major criticism of the method adopted by the Chancellor is that it will give this relief to overseas trade corporations who are already making big profits and doing very well, and who do not need this tax incentive or benefit to further their operations or to increase the scope of their activities.<br/>
The Clause now stands before us for final judgment. When we consider the tax reliefs given here, without a convincing case having been made out for them and given in a highly concentrated form, mostly to those in the higher income brackets, and relate them to the need for tax reliefs generally at home, the Bill appears to be a very unbalanced one in the matter of providing relief for the hard-pressed taxpayer.<br/>
But the Chancellor, in that engaging and&#x2014;if I may say so without disrespect&#x2014;juvenile way, says that all taxes are bad; that ours are worse than most; that they are all too high, and that as long as he is there he will pull them down. Never were such words from the Chancellor received with such wild enthusiasm&#x2014;and never were comments made by a Chancellor made more wildly than were his. I must say that he knows how to


keep up the spirits of his supporters&#x2014;which is one of the great qualifications of a Chancellor of the Exchequer. But the chickens will come home to roost, and the Chancellor will find that the relief given in the Clause will be looked at more critically by an intelligent community than he realises.<br/>
Although many of the indirect benefits from this may be hard to discern, I hope that there will be those of us who will have the necessary application and penetration to find out the effect of all this upon the companies concerned and upon our national income and general prosperity. At present, we are so doubtful about it that we cannot support the Chancellor's proposals and we should prefer that the whole of Part IV were left aside for the moment so that it might be further examined in the light of the needs of the present situation. However, as the Chancellor has already confessed that he is a "whole-hogger", I do not suppose he will do any such thing, and there will be no alternative left for us but to register our opinion in the customary way and say that we do not like it and that we cannot go into the Lobby to support it.</p>

<p>As I heard the speech of the hon. Member for Sowerby (Mr. Houghton) and listened to hon. Members opposite retracting the good will expressed last year, and observed that even the most enthusiastic hon. Members opposite have continually voted against the Government, I was filled with regret. On the other hand, as was said by the hon. Member for Sowerby, the Chancellor is determined to go ahead. I wish that he was determined to go further ahead.<br/>
The only comment I wish to make about this Clause is that it makes a distinction for the first time between trading and investment income, and in investment income, of course, is included the income from trading subsidiaries registered overseas. As I said last night, I am staking out a claim for the future. I hope the time will come when the income from trading subsidiaries overseas will be treated as trading income. From a practical point of view there is no difference whether one carries on trade through a branch or through a subsidiary company established overseas. For that reason, and from the trading

and practical point of view, it is really a theoretical difference which should not exist when the income is derived from an actual overseas trade corporation, or when it comes from a subsidiary corporation which exists wholly in order to assist the trade of a group of companies.<br/>
I am grateful for the scheme. I think it bold and I believe it will be useful. I do not believe in these anxieties about how it will affect capital at home and that sort of thing. I think it necessary for the development of the trade of the country as a whole. I hope that it will meet the practical needs of businessmen and that these distinctions between strict overseas corporations and subsidiary companies, created or acquired for the purpose of carrying on part of the same trade of the same group of companies will he removed, and that ultimately the income will be treated as trading income, which of course it is.</p>

<p>I wish to deal with the accusation as I understand it because it has been made in other quarters. I am not content merely with going through the Lobbies every time the Division bell rings; I should like to express what I feel.<br/>
I consider that there is no inconsistency between the support which I gave to the new Clause put on the Order Paper last year in the names of some of my hon. Friends, whereby the Chancellor was urged to introduce a measure of relief regarding companies engaged abroad in what, for the want of a better term, may be described as pioneering activities. I think that a genuine case was made out for that. It was that where companies, whether British. American or of any other nationality, trading and operating in an overseas country, were subject to local laws specially designed to give some attraction and advantage to pioneering efforts in that country, British companies found themselves at a manifest and obvious disadvantage compared with


those companies registered in other countries, whether America, Germany, France, Belgium, Holland or elsewhere.<br/>
On those grounds, I think there is a case for removing from the British companies the discrimination under which they labour at present. It was with that objective that we put down the Clause last year, and it is with precisely the same objective that we have made similar proposals this year.<br/>
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Sowerby (Mr. Houghton) that this Clause is the central feature of the Chancellor's first Budget. I do not wish to pay a compliment to the Chancellor on his Budget or any part of it. The right hon. Gentleman would not expect me to do so. We have to try, firstly, to form an objective judgment about whether or not this set of proposals is necessary; secondly, sensible; thirdly, equitable and fourthly, workable. I have read carefully both the majority and the minority Reports of the Royal Commission; I have read the observations of the Board of Inland Revenue and I have listened to the speeches made yesterday and today. I can appreciate how the difference of opinion arises, but I feel that the balance of argument and the whole of the weight of evidence available is against the proposals of the Chancellor.<br/>
I am prepared, if necessary, to put aside the observations of the Board of Inland Revenue that they are unworkable and may lead to a great deal of evasion, anomalies and difficulties. After all, the Chancellor will be responsible for seeing that attempts at evasion, or to obtain undue advantage over and above what he intends to concede, are prevented, and that any loopholes are closed. We wish him success in his endeavours and we shall give him all possible assistance. But, surely, the real question is whether, in the interests of the country's economy, it is necessary at this stage to make such a vital and serious inroad into the principles of equality of taxation which have hitherto been one of the cardinal tenets of our fiscal policy.<br/>
I am not persuaded that it is necessary. My experience is that under the present law British companies have not managed too badly in finding opportunities for overseas investment during the last few years. There are the opportuni

ties provided by forming subsidiary companies with managements abroad, and so on. Statistics show that in the last few years there has been a substantial amount of overseas investment on the part of British companies. From the point of view of the national economy that it is questionable whether the limited amount of capital which this country has available for investment should not be wholly concentrated in this country rather than permitting and, indeed, encouraging a large amount of it to be utilised to obtain tax benefits offered by this scheme.<br/>
That is a matter of economic judgment, but with regard to the fiscal questions, the taxation questions, with which we are primarily concerned, what I think worries a great many people is that in this Finance Bill we are introducing a very serious precedent; we are discriminating between one kind of taxpayer and another. We are departing from the principle of treating all taxpayers and taxpaying companies alike.<br/>
7.30 p.m.<br/>
To introduce such a departure may well have serious repercussions. In any event, it is bound to create a great deal of heart-burning and a great deal of injustice on the part of those companies and shareholders in those companies who are not favoured by these concessions. They&#x2014;particularly those engaged in export&#x2014;might equally well stake out claims for differential and more beneficial treatment on the ground that by their industrial and commercial efforts, they are also making important contributions to the national economy. The danger is that once that principle is conceded, once it is conceded that the Chancellor of the Exchequer in framing his Budget proposals can discriminate in favour of one kind of taxpayer or against one class of company on the ground that the work which it is doing or the business enterprise in which it is engaged is of greater importance to the national economy, we are embarking on the slippery slope and are treading very dangerous ground.<br/>
That is the major criticism of the Chancellor's proposal. As the Royal Commission pointed out, any proposal of this kind, by reducing taxation to the extent of &#x00A3;35 million, or perhaps very much more, on this particular class of companies engaged in this particular kind


of trade must inevitably produce as a corollary the effect that other taxpayers will have to bear an additional burden. Whether that additional burden falls on all other companies or has to be met by old-age pensioners, or produces the result that the Chancellor cannot accord reliefs and allowances of one kind and another which we think are more deserving, the fact remains that this relief to the extent of &#x00A3;35 million has to be found in some way or another by all other taxpayers. It is for these reasons, because I do not think that the case has been made out on fiscal ground, on workability or on grounds of national economy that I am opposed to these proposals.</p>

<p>I do not know whether the Chancellor intends to say anything himself on this Clause, but before we part with it I wish to refer to one matter which has not been much discussed in these debates. That is the very considerable capital gains which the Chancellor has presented to the luckier shareholders in these companies as a result of this action in the Budget.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Sowerby (Mr. Houghton) said that the Chancellor did not like speaking of having given away revenue by his tax actions. I thought the Chancellor was being a little unkind to his last predecessor but one, the Lord Privy Seal, because the present Lord Privy Seal, in his Budgets of 1955, constantly referred to himself as having given away large amounts of revenue. Therefore, when the Chancellor casts aspersions on that conception, I am afraid he is again making attacks on his predecessor, the Lord Privy Seal, who is again in trouble in the office to which he has removed himself, or has been removed.<br/>
This is a Clause which gives remission of Income Tax on the trading profits retained in the business of these overseas trade corporations, but at the same time imposes Income Tax on dividends paid to the shareholders of the companies. Presumably, the Chancellor must have realised that as a result it encourages the corporations to put profits to reserve and over a period of time that is bound to mean capital appreciation for the shareholders. I have a much higher opinion of the Inland Revenue than either the Chancellor or my hon. Friend the Member for Sowerby&#x2014;although I do not

think either of them would get very far without it&#x2014;but I propose in this case to rest my argument not so much on its authority as on that of the <i>Financial Times.</i><br/>
I do not know whether the Chancellor noticed it, but at the very beginning, on the publication of the Bill, the <i>Financial Times</i> pointed out that this provision would give some very agreeable capital appreciation to Surtax-payers in particular. On 1st May, after having described the way in which the concession would work, one of its first comments was:
<q>Although this does increase the scope for higher dividends, there will be a clear incentive to retain profits to the greatest extent possible; the main investment appeal is to the surtax-payer interested in steady capital appreciation. Indeed, in so far as the general object of the proposals is to encourage the retention of profits, their most interesting investment implications are for surtax-payers. Not only are they likely&#x2026;</q>
That is the concessions&#x2014;
<q>to promote a steady rise in asset values, but distribution of liquidation (after the return of tax-free capital) will be subject only to income tax, not to surtax or profits tax.</q>
Perhaps the Chancellor thinks that is a minor effect of this concession, but, quite apart from the major effects in the rest of the Bill, a very attractive field for tax-free gains has been opened up. The <i>Economist,</i> on 4th May, also commented on the same point, rather more briefly:
<q>As the concession encourages the growth of assets, its investment appeal is to the surtax-payer interested less in dividends than in capital appreciation.</q>
Of course, the behaviour of the Stock Exchange over the last few months has borne out, as one would have expected it would, the truth of these observations in the financial Press. There has been a remarkable rise in the shares of the companies which are believed, at any rate in the City, to be likely to gain substantially by this concession. To take one example, I do not know whether the Chancellor observed the behaviour of Unilevers ordinary shares, not merely in the weeks since the Budget, but, strangely enough, most notably in the weeks immediately preceding the Budget. It would appear that there were very confident expectations in the City, as with Entertainments Duty, that something of this kind was to be done. The rise in Unilever shares at the beginning of the year was one of about 50 per cent. That seems


"a bit steep", which is a Parliamentary expression, in this connection.<br/>
Perhaps my hon. Friends were going a little too far in describing the Chancellor as reckless or frivolous, but I suppose he might say in the light-hearted, or light-headed, fashion in which he tosses these arguments aside, that the large profits might have been made by someone on the Stock Exchange who happened to have an idea that this would be put forward and be beneficial to Unilevers or some other company trading overseas but, "What does that matter? That is one of the minor consequences of this action."<br/>
I do not think we can look at it quite as lightheartedly as that. This illustrates a principle which is of much more general application. We believe that these capital gains are much too easy to secure and are much too free of taxation already. We think that avenues for such tax-free gains should be limited rather than further opened up. It is true in the case not merely of overseas trade corporations but of companies manufacturing in this country that if we enable them to build up their capital by this process of reinvestment of existing profits we are practically bound over any long period to present capital gains which are at present tax-free to the private shareholder.<br/>
For those reasons, we think that some method will have to be discovered of building up reserves and capital both for companies operating abroad such as we are now discussing and over the whole field of industry other than this method of self-financing, company saving or whatever one calls it, which, though very beneficial on the one hand in that it means national savings, is much less beneficial on the other in that it means capital gains for private shareholders.<br/>
I should like to ask the Chancellor&#x2014;I do not think he will deny that this has been one of the results of his action&#x2014;whether he is quite happy about the effects of this discrimination in bringing to operators on the Stock Exchange such immediate benefits, which are, incidentally, nothing to do with overseas trading or extra capital employed in overseas trading but are immediate speculative benefits.</p>

<p>Perhaps I might say

a few words in conclusion on the debate on the Clause, if only because, as the hon. Member for Sowerby (Mr. Houghton) said, it is the effective central Clause of this group of proposals associated with the overseas trade corporations.<br/>
It is a good Clause. I venture to think that it is an effective Clause which will make a considerable contribution to the building up of the reserves and the general investment in British companies trading overseas. I dare say that because of that the capital value of the companies will rise, but if&#x2014;</p>

<p>&#x2014;one were to flinch from making tax reductions simply because in some circumstances there might be capital gain, one would have a sorry job as Chancellor of the Exchequer. There are not only capital gains in this matter. Many people will gain&#x2014;the people who work for the companies, the territories overseas where they are situated, and the economy of this country. Whatever may be said about interim or short-term balance of payments, what is wanted is that we should have these trading operations carried on effectively, rightly capitalised, and investment put into them. As the hon. Member for Stechford (Mr. Roy Jenkins) very fairly said about that investment, one cannot invest a deficit. In the long run it depends on what we do here at home, how we build up surpluses, and matters of that kind.<br/>
I am surprised to find the Labour Party hesitant about this investment. Hon. Members opposite have made a lot of it in their speeches in the country, particularly in regard to the Commonwealth, saying that a large proportion of the gross national product should be devoted to it. When they are presented with a practical proposition for reinforcing success&#x2014;in many cases these are companies or operations which are already established and going ahead&#x2014;and we give an opportunity to plough back profits free of tax, I should have thought that hon. Members opposite would have welcomed such a practical application of the very policies which they have in some measure advocated in the country.<br/>
7.45 p.m.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Battersea, North (Mr. Jay) thought that any form


of discrimination was abhorrent and should be avoided. Listening to him, I thought that the sternest minds in the Inland Revenue could not have bettered him in his approach to matters of this kind. He said that in no circumstances whatever would he put one taxpayer into a position in any way different from any other. It sounded all right at the time, but it did not fit in with some of the things we heard earlier when all kinds of discrimination between different types of trade and those in the Commonwealth and those outside it were being urged upon us. Moreover, in the case of investment allowance and so on I have heard discrimination urged as a positive virtue in trade matters. I do not urge that absolute consistency should be held all the way through, but some of the things which the right hon. Gentleman has said may be held a little against him.</p>

It is that discrimination which we seek to end or at least very much to mitigate.

This is little more than a drafting Amendment. The subsection as it stands makes it clear that dividends will be charged at the standard rate for the year of assessment in which they fall due. It perhaps does not sufficiently make it clear that they will be charged in the year in which the dividend falls due at that rate. It is simply to clarify that that this Amendment, and the two which follow and hang with it, are put forward.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 18, line 34, to leave out subsections (2) and (3).<br/>
Unlike the previous Amendments, Sir Norman, this is more than a drafting Amendment. Were it carried out, it would have some fairly large consequences, and I am glad to see that its importance is recognised by the presence of the Government Chief Whip, the first time for quite a period in the course of our deliberations. The purpose of the

Amendment is to withdraw the exemption from Income Tax which the Bill gives to distributions of dividends to non-resident shareholders.<br/>
This is a fairly difficult issue and one about which, like some of the others that we have considered yesterday and today, the Royal Commission found some difficulty in making up its mind. I give it freely to the Financial Secretary that the majority, the rather doubtful majority of the Royal Commission which reported on this point, did come down eventually in favour of granting the exemption given under the Bill, but it did so with a good deal of hesitancy and the bringing forward of some arguments on the other side. I certainly think that the arguments on the other side are of some force, and ought to be considered by the Committee. We are, after all, putting non-resident shareholders in United Kingdom O.T.C.s in an extraordinarily favourable position when we give, as it were, this double concession.<br/>
To take the rather extreme but in no way impossible case of a shareholder resident in Bermuda holding shares in a company registered in London but operating in Kuwait, this shareholder, as far as I can see, would escape any tax of any sort on all the profits earned by the company and any distributions which were made to him. It is an extraordinarily favourable position in the modern world for anyone to be in, and it is a position, of course, that might well encourage certain large shareholders in O.T.C.s to emigrate.<br/>
8.0 p.m.<br/>
When the Chancellor introduced his Budget, the Surtax concessions were at times presented in such a form as to suggest that the Chancellor had had to introduce them in order to drag most valuable


members of the community out of the emigration queues where they were waiting to clamber aboard ships and aircraft leaving for Canada or wherever it might be; the concessions were introduced only just in time, it was suggested, apparently, in order to prevent this great wave of emigration which would, so it was argued, have been most damaging to the interests of this country.<br/>
It is a little curious that the same Finance Bill which enshrines these Surtax provisions, presented to a very large extent as having been brought forward in order to counter this move towards emigration, should contain a provision which, certainly so far as a shareholder in an O.T.C. is concerned, would give a very great incentive to undertake precisely that act of emigration which was regarded as so undesirable in the case of other Surtax payers. I do not know whether the Government would counter that argument by saying that, on the whole, in their view shareholders in O.T.C.s are not particularly desirable citizens whom they would particularly wish to keep in the country. It would be a possible argument, but I think a slightly dangerous one, and I should be a little surprised if the Financial Secretary were to use it. But if he is not prepared to use it, there seems to be a good deal of contradiction in the Government's approach to these matters.<br/>
Apart from those matters, it can be argued that there should be a certain liability&#x2014;I am not for the moment discussing what it should be&#x2014;to United Kingdom tax even where a company operates in Kuwait and the shareholder lives in Bermuda. After all, if someone wants to have a company registered in the City of London or elsewhere in this country and enjoy the benefits of British protection, the protection of British company law and, presumably, in certain circumstances, of British prestige, British influence and of the British Armed Forces overseas, there ought to be some liability to United Kingdom tax. To breach that principle completely and say that it is possible for a shareholder to draw dividends from a company registered in the United Kingdom but in no possible way incur any liability to United Kingdom tax is going altogether too far in the granting of exemptions.<br/>
No doubt, the main Government argument in favour of the exemption will be

that it encourages foreign shareholders to invest in United Kingdom resident O.T.C.s and thereby encourages the flow of capital, not perhaps towards this country, but towards United Kingdom registered companies. Precisely where does this argument lead? The difficulty is immediately apparent in my hesitation about saying "towards this country", because, if we want foreign capital to flow into United Kingdom companies, the question arises whether we want it to flow in exclusively to companies operating overseas. Do we want to give foreign resident shareholders an enormous incentive, if they are going to invest in a London registered company, to do it in one which on no account trades anywhere in the United Kingdom? Is there a case for giving to, shall we say, the United States shareholder an enormous incentive to invest in a company registered in London which owns cotton mills in India rather than in one which owns cotton mills in Lancashire? Yet that is the very thing which this new incentive is introducing by the Clause as it stands.<br/>
I am a little sceptical altogether about what is the advantage to this country of encouraging companies whose connections with this country are really so tenuous as to be almost non-existent. We are asked to embrace the principle that the existence and development of a company operating entirely overseas, owned, it is suggested, to as large an extent as possible&#x2014;because we want to encourage foreign shareholders&#x2014;by people almost entirely not resident in this country, is of enormous advantage to our economy. The only connection which such a company has with this country is that it happens to have its seat of control in London or elsewhere in the country. Curiously enough, when we get to that point, we are then told by the right hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Kensington, South (Sir P. Spens) and by other hon. Gentlemen opposite that even that connection with this country is of itself of no importance and that the company should be quite free to move its seat of control if it wants to do so.<br/>
I am a little doubtful, as I say, about the advantage of encouraging companies whose connection with this country is so tenuous as really to be almost nonexistent. I hope, therefore that the Financial Secretary, when he comes to reply, will apply himself closely, as he


has done in all the debates in which he has taken part, I think, to the points put to him. I hope he will try to explain what is the reason for this excessively favourable treatment of non-resident shareholders. Why should he wish to encourage shareholders in O.T.C.s to emigrate? Why is it reasonable that someone should be in the position of paying no tax at all on the operations of the company from which he draws his income? Why is it desirable that there should be this incentive for foreign capital to go exclusively into companies operating overseas as opposed to those operating in this country? Is it reasonable that, in the case of a company registered in England and enjoying the protection of the laws of this country and of the power and prestige of the British Government, there should be no contribution, in all the circumstances, towards those services?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-06-27a.509.0" hansard_membership_id="2212" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/31417" speakername="Mr. Chapman" colnum="509" time="">
<p>I share with my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Stechford (Mr. Roy Jenkins) considerable doubts about this part of the Clause. I have one particular question which I shall put to the Financial Secretary, and I hope that he will be good enough to find an answer to it. Later in my speech, I want to come back to consider this question of encouraging the richer taxpayer generally to emigrate, and I shall have a few words to say about the sort of "Noel Coward" case which is in all our minds. There is, however, as far as I can see, another and a beautiful way of possible avoidance in this Clause, and, from my own researches. I cannot see that the existing legislation has a chance of stopping it. If it has, I shall be very glad indeed to know.<br/>
The Clause makes clear, and we know in any event, that in tax law a person is also a company; but it is made clear further that it is possible under the Clause for a foreign company to be exempt if it holds shares in an O.T.C. Just as a foreign resident is exempt from the payment of tax on the dividends distributed by an O.T.C., so would a foreign company be exempt from paying tax on dividends on shares in a British O.T.C.<br/>
In that case, if I were a rich taxpayer who wished to get the advantage of non-residence and to get tax exemption on my

holdings in an overseas trade corporation, what is there to stop me from, say, setting up a &#x00A3;50 private company in Bermuda which would, in effect, have my holdings of shares in an O.T.C.? Then, if I wished it could accumulate funds for me in Bermuda. They would never be remitted back here. Therefore, I should not be taxed on them on a remittance basis as I would if they were sent to this country. They could be accumulated for me there and I could still be a resident of this country&#x2014;I should not be a non-resident person. I should not have personally to emigrate. I should merely have a private company which had emigrated on my behalf. I should then get all the benefits of the Clause.<br/>
It would be a very nice loophole, if it existed, for many rich men simply to deposit their securities abroad and get some nice tax-free dividends on them. I thought that this loophole would possibly be blocked by Section 36 of the 1951 Finance Act, which controls the emigration of companies, but try as I may throughout the whole of that Section, I cannot find that it covers the case.<br/>
As far as I can see, that Section, which prohibits the emigration of companies, does not prohibit, so to speak, the emigration of personal holdings to a foreign country, which would then be held abroad instead of being held in this country. I should be pleased if the Economic Secretary could tell me any more, but as far as I can see, the loophole still remains.<br/>
Let me now return to the general issues as set out by my hon. Friend the Member for Stechford. What is also very surprising is the definition of "emigration". My hon. Friend suggested that people would be tempted to emigrate, but that is not quite so, as, I think, my hon. Friend would be the first to agree. If I am a rich man who wishes to get the benefit of the Clause, I do not have to emigrate to a foreign country in any permanent sense. What I have to do is to keep myself abroad sufficiently under the Schedule D rules, which are quite clear on this matter. I should not come home for more than six months in any year. I probably should not maintain a permanent place of abode, or the Inland Revenue would become suspicious again. I must not even, in periods of less than six months of the year, make my visits too frequently. If I were to start coming home for three or four


months at a time in about four consecutive years, the Inland Revenue might begin to say that I was resident. These are not terribly difficult conditions to impose on these people.<br/>
If I were a rich man and wanted a beautifully easy tax-free set of dividends on which to live, I could very nicely winter every year in Bermuda or some pleasant foreign country. I could come home for at least two months every year to arrange my affairs, or possibly three months. I should miss a year occasionally in order to fulfil the requirements of the Inland Revenue. As far as I can see, like Mr. Noel Coward but, perhaps, in a more agile way, I should be avoiding tax and I should become non-resident for the purpose of the subsection.<br/>
8.15 p.m.<br/>
It is very bad indeed&#x2014;I do not say this in any partisan class sense&#x2014;that we should now be offering a tax-free bonus to the richer members of the community who can afford to winter abroad for nine months in every year and simply come home to arrange their business affairs for two or three months in most years. That is precisely what the subsection does. I do not have to emigrate or change my nationality. I simply have to be abroad for a sufficient portion of every year. The position is more dangerous, therefore, than even my hon. Friend pointed out. Emigration as defined within the meaning of the subsection is nothing very strong.<br/>
Then, there is the final and general point raised by my hon. Friend about the way in which persons who are investing in British overseas trade corporations are to some extent getting protection for their shareholdings and to that extent ought to be paying United Kingdom tax. The Royal Commission dithered on this issue, quite unjustifiably, I thought. Some of its remarks were really not very good arguments. As regards these non-residents and their holdings in British companies, the Royal Commission said, in paragraph 693:
<q>their source enjoys the benefit of United Kingdom protection and therefore the charge to domestic tax is justified as an equivalent for the protection. It is true that the investor in a United Kingdom company has the security of our domestic legislation which governs the administration of companies: and in another sense such a company can expect that its interests overseas will be the concern of Your Majesty's Government.</q>

Those are quite formidable, tangible things.<br/>
We are encouraging a section of foreign nationals to invest in British companies. They invest in British companies precisely because of the security, stability and protection of our laws and the way in which our tax system and our political system protects any investment that is properly made. There is no likelihood of unjustifiable and arbitrary confiscation of their assets. All these benefits are British assets which we are to some extent conferring on these people. [<i>Interruption.</i>] Do hon. Members opposite not consider that they are tangible?</p>

<p>We are not talking about whether, in fact, there is nationalisation. When there is nationalisation, for example, there is proper compensation and a stable Parliamentary system by which it is carried through. If the hon. Member does not believe I am right, he cannot expect foreign investors to invest in British companies. He cannot have it both ways.<br/>
The justification for the subsection that is advanced from the other side of the Committee is that our British system encourages people to invest in British companies. Now, hon. Members opposite are saying that the British system does not encourage people to invest in British overseas trade corporations. Which way round does the hon. Member for Ilford, South (Mr. Cooper) want it?</p>

<p>I am quite willing to argue the facts of those cases at any time that the hon. Member cares to choose. What he must bear in mind, however, is that despite the fact that nationalisation takes place in this country, much to my satisfaction, it nevertheless has not been any substantial discouragement to foreign investors to invest in our overseas trade operations. That is because of the


stability that the House of Commons applies to the whole way in which the matter is effected, and because of the guarantees which the system gives of fairness of treatment. The hon. Member really cannot have it both ways. He cannot have the Government putting forward the Clause as a way in which foreign investments will be attracted and, on the other hand, say that our system is not likely to attract those investments anyway.</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr. Mitchison), but I frankly admit that I am more interested in sticking to the Clause and the real arguments that are being put forward on both sides of the Committee than in going into the byways into which the hon. Member for Ilford, South would lead me.<br/>
After all, these non-resident shareholders are getting something quite tangible&#x2014;a great deal of protection and a guarantee when they invest in a British company. It is quite proper and quite important that our fiscal system should say that these people who are getting these benefits should make some contribution through taxation towards them. Otherwise, why do not they invest somewhere else? If they do not want the benefits that Britain can afford them why do not they take their investments elsewhere?<br/>
When we come back to the argument about the justification of attempts to attract foreign capital into our overseas trade corporations, the final point is that it can still be done in a way that is quite satisfactory. It is a way that has been bothering the right hon. and learned Member for Kensington, South (Sir P. Spens) all through our debates. It is the way of attracting capital to these firms <i>via</i> an overseas registered subsidiary, and then they would be free from the British code of taxation.<br/>
As the right hon. and learned Member and I and other hon. Members have pointed out, a large part of this kind of attraction of foreign capital is going on through foreign registered subsidiaries and not through the sort of subsidiary

that is likely to be an overseas trade corporation within the meaning of the Bill. I see no particular reason for suddenly bringing them all back through the British fiscal system as overseas trade corporations, unless they are willing to pay to some extent for the stability, and protection that Britain affords them in making their investments here.</p>

<p>The general effect of overseas trade corporation status is that a company though registered in this country, is, for the purposes of the Income Tax Acts, treated as if it were non-resident. A shareholder, who is not a resident of this country, who has shares in a non-resident company does not pay any United Kingdom Income Tax. Therefore, <i>prima facie,</i> since we are according to overseas trading corporations the position of a non-resident company, the consequence to a shareholder who is non-resident should follow, namely, that he does not pay United Kingdom Income Tax on his dividends.<br/>
I was strengthened in the feeling that this is the natural consequence by one of the last remarks made by the hon. Member for Northfield (Mr. Chapman), who pointed out that what is attracting foreign investment into foreign registered companies as compared with companies registered in this country is the advantage they have of avoiding United Kingdom tax thereby; and it is an underlying purpose of this part of the Bill that we do not want companies to be at a disadvantage in any respect just because they are registered in this country.<br/>
On general principles, and arising from the general purposes of this part of the Bill, I should have thought it a natural consequence that the non-resident shareholder should not pay United Kingdom Income Tax. As the hon. Member for Stechford (Mr. Roy Jenkins) pointed out, this point was considered by the Royal Commission. It came to the conclusion that on the whole, this was the right solution. For example, at the end of paragraph 692 of its Report, it said:
<q>the non-resident shareholder seems to have a fair case for exemption of his dividends on general grounds.</q>
That is as well as on economic grounds The Report concluded:
<q>We do not think it necessary to say more than this, that the adoption of any scheme for


exempting company overseas profits from United Kingdom tax would raise directly the question of taxing dividends of the non-resident shareholder; and that whatever may have been true of the past, the case for their taxation today has worn very thin.</q>
There is a further consideration besides the general logical position, and one that was not considered by the Royal Commission. It is a reason that is really decisive.<br/>
Most, though not all, of our double taxation relief agreements provide that United Kingdom Income Tax shall not be imposed upon a foreign resident beyond the taxation imposed upon the company from which the profits are drawn. That being so, it would clearly be a breach of the spirit, if not of the letter, of these double taxation agreements that a non-resident should bear tax upon his dividends from a company whose profits, unless and until they are distributed, are not subject to United Kingdom Income Tax. For this company the overseas trade corporation is in a quite different position from that of the ordinary British registered company which bears Income Tax on its profits whether it distributes them or not. Therefore, if we did not make this provision in subsection (2) we should be involved in a breach of a whole range of our double taxation agreements, and that is not a position we could well contemplate.<br/>
The hon. Member for Stechford directed all his arguments towards subsection (2), but of course, the Amendment, perhaps merely consequentially and as a matter of drafting, proposes also to omit subsection (3).</p>

<p>Oh, no. It is necessary for me to point out the importance of subsection (3). The effect of subsection (3), which would not be achieved if it were not within this Clause, is an effect to which I know many hon. Members of this Committee attach great importance. That is, that it should be possible to switch the profits of one overseas trade corporation to assist in building the business of another O.T.C. in the same group. Without this subsection that would not be possible. Although I realise that the proposal to omit this subsection was consequential, I thought it was worth while to point out its effect.</p>

<p>As my hon. and learned Friend said, subsection (3) in its present form could not stand without subsection (2), but the Financial Secretary is certainly correct in thinking that the burden of the Amendment is to remove subsection (2). If the hon. Gentleman would give an undertaking that he would put in subsection (3) in a different form, that would be satisfactory to us.</p>

<p>Anyhow, we are all clear that we want the effect of subsection (3), which is to enable overseas trade corporations within the same group to be able to use their profits anywhere within the group without incurring United Kingdom Income Tax in the process.<br/>
The hon. Member for Northfields put two specific avoidance cases to me. The first was of a United Kingdom resident shareholder in an overseas trade corporation who transferred his holding in it to a company registered overseas in a country where local tax was low or nonexistent, so as to be able to get the benefit of this subsection.</p>

<p>While he remains resident in this country. I think the hon. Gentleman will find that possibility is stopped by Section 412 of the Income Tax Act, 1952. Perhaps if I simply read the rubric of that Section, it will be sufficient for the present purpose. The Section contains:
<q>Provisions for preventing avoidance of Income Tax by transactions resulting in the transfer of income to persons abroad.</q>
In this case the income of a shareholder is transferred to the supposed Bermudan company abroad for avoidance purposes.</p>

<p>In the case posed by my hon. Friend there would be no transfer for the avoidance of tax, there would be a capital investment made in a Bermudan company. That company, being a foreign company for the purposes of this subsection, would derive all the benefits of the accumulation of profits in, for example, the Kuwait company. When there was a remittance to the United Kingdom company, the Bermudan company would not be subject to any tax. As a result, in the case posed, the


individual who started with an investment in the Bermudan company would accumulate a great deal of capital.</p>

<p>Yes, but for the purposes of the avoidance device it would be necessary for the United Kingdom shareholder in the overseas trade corporation to transfer his holdings in the O.T.C. to the Bermudan company. That would be the start of it, and it is that transaction which is prevented by the Section to which I have drawn attention.</p>

<p>I am sorry I did not find that one; I only found the 1951 Act. It says specifically, if it is proved to be for tax avoidance. There may be many ways round that one too. Does it prohibit completely the transfer of stocks and shares owned merely for the purpose of tax avoidance?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-06-27a.517.2" hansard_membership_id="5594" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30191" speakername="Mr. Powell" colnum="517" time="">
<p>I have, perhaps rightly, suffered for the sin of quoting a side title in order to save the time of the Committee. If the hon. Gentleman will consult the Section he will find that it prevents the initial transaction upon which the whole avoidance device would rest.<br/>
He posited a second case where the taxpayer himself went abroad so as to become non-resident and thus not liable to pay Income Tax upon his dividends from an O.T.C. It is true that a person who renders himself non-resident can avoid United Kingdom Income Tax on any income arising outside the United Kingdom, and consequently, if one accepts my earlier logic, upon income arising from a company treated as non-resident. In the instance which he gave&#x2014;a certain playwright, who has been mentioned more than once in these debates&#x2014;of course that playwright escapes United Kingdom Income Tax only upon his non-United Kingdom earnings.<br/>
To sum up, I would therefore put it to the Committee that it is consistent with the general effect and purpose of this part of the Bill&#x2014;and is, indeed, necessary because of our double taxation arrangements&#x2014;that we should have the provisions in subsection (2). I hope that the hon. Member for Stechford will not think the worse of British registered companies trading overseas because they happen to have a certain number of non-resident shareholders. It was probably

an unintentional hyperbole, but I did not think that they deserved to be described on that account as "companies whose connection with this country is so tenuous as to be almost non-existent."<br/>
I think we must treat these overseas trade corporations as a group, and accept the logic of non-resident shareholders in those corporations not paying United Kingdom Income Tax.</p>

<p>I wonder whether the Financial Secretary would be kind enough to answer a question which puzzles me. Subsection (2) refers to a person not resident in the United Kingdom and it provides for his getting certain refunds of Income Tax. It then has a proviso which reads:
<q>that this subsection shall not apply where the person owning the shares in the Overseas Trade Corporation is</q>
&#x2014;I omit various words&#x2014;
<q>resident in the United Kingdom".</q></p>

<p>Very well. I will put them in. It reads:
<q>Provided that this subsection shall not apply where the person owning the shares in the Overseas Trade Corporation is a company which is a subsidiary of a principal company and that principal company&#x2014;(<i>a</i>) is resident in the United Kingdom&#x2026;.</q>
Would the Financial Secretary explain to me what is contemplated? First of all, we have an overseas trade corporation. Then we have a subsidiary of a principal company. Is the idea that that subsidiary should not be resident in the United Kingdom? Then we have a third person, which is a principal company resident in the United Kingdom. What sort of practical point has the hon. Gentleman in mind? I wish it could be explained because I find it very baffling, and I am not at all certain that I like the provision.</p>

<p>The effect of the proviso is this. So far we have been considering a non-resident shareholding company in an overseas trade corporation, but if that non-resident shareholding company were itself the subsidiary&#x2014;let us say the mere puppet of a United Kingdom company&#x2014;the practical effect would be that a United Kingdom company or a United Kingdom resident could be drawing the tax-exempt profits of an overseas trade corporation by


drawing them through a non-resident shareholder. It is to prevent this method of avoidance that the case where the non-resident company is a subsidiary of the United Kingdom principal is ruled out.</p>

<p>Is not that altogether too easy?&#x2014;It depends finally on the dummy company the Financial Secretary knows what I mean&#x2014;being the subsidiary. Supposing that two or three companies, perhaps engaged in a similar trade, have a dummy company of this sort; it is not a subsidiary of any one of them and they will accordingly be able to extract tax-free income although it is not intended that they should. I say that it is not intended that they should because if it were the subsidiary of one of them they would not get it. But all they have to do is to combine, the three of them, and to put up a dummy between them, and they will get the benefit. I should like to know what is the answer to that. I expect that there is one.</p>

<p>I beg to move in page 19, line 9, to leave out from "Kingdom" to the end of line 10.<br/>
This point follows on directly from that which I have been discussing with the hon. and learned Member for Kettering (Mr. Mitchison). It is necessary that the case of a United Kingdom resident principal company should be ruled out even where that United Kingdom principal company is itself an overseas trade corporation. There need be no connection between this overseas trade corporation and the original overseas trade corporation from whose trading profits the dividends are drawn. There is no reason why a United Kingdom company which happens to be an overseas trade corporation on other grounds should profit by the avoidance device, which the proviso is intended to prevent, more than any other kind of United Kingdom company. It is for that reason that the words are required out of the subsection.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 19, line 15, at the end to insert:
<q>and that subsection as so applied to dividends on shares owned by an Overseas Trade Corporation shall have effect as if the proviso were omitted".</q>
This is an extremely difficult Amendment to move shortly and clearly. The purpose of the Clause as it stands is to ensure that if a dividend is paid out of untaxed profits to a shareholder who is not resident in the United Kingdom and if there is deduction of tax, the non-resident shareholder shall be entitled to repayment of Income Tax. However, we have just been discussing the proviso in subsection (2) which has now been amended by the omission of paragraph (<i>b</i>).<br/>
The situation now arises that where an overseas trade corporation has more than one subsidiary company, each of which is an overseas trade corporation, but where the parent company of the parent O.T.C. is not itself an overseas trade corporation, then that parent company of the string of overseas trade corporations will not, as the Bill is drafted, be able to reclaim the tax deducted from the dividends.<br/>
I do not think that that follows through the entire intention of this part of the Bill. It seems to cut across the intention which is apparent in the Bill. In such a case one O.T.C. should be able to switch funds to another O.T.C., and the Amendment puts that detail right. I hope that the Amendment is as clear to the Committee as I hope it is to me.</p>

What we want to make possible is transfers of funds without liability to United Kingdom Income Tax between the parent company and the children O.T.C.s, and the fact that they happen to have a grandparent which is not an overseas trading corporation, that is to say, a principal company resident in the United Kingdom, is no reason why they should be excluded in that case from the benefits of switching funds.

<p>I want to say how very glad I was to hear my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr. Mitchison) say that. I saw an expression of surprise on the face of the Financial Secretary, and I suppose he is thinking that because the Sixth Schedule to which I will not refer in detail, makes grants or loans to individuals liable to tax and deals with distributions on winding-up and so on, he is surprised that we should be voting against it.<br/>
I want to tell the hon. Gentleman that one of the things that annoys us intensely, for example, is that Surtax is going to be excluded on winding-up. Further on, when we come to other provisions, we find that certainly Profits Tax is excluded. Thirdly, and much more important than the other two, I do not believe that the provisions of the Sixth Schedule are at all watertight. I do not want to be out of order by discussing them now, but when we have to go into something like four and a half pages of close type in a Parliamentary Bill in order to put in some anti-avoidance provisions, it makes us realise how very complex the matter is, and how easy evasion is probably going to be for the people who specialise in that sort of thing. When we come to discuss the Sixth Schedule we shall have some suggestions to make as to how that evasion is likely to take place. The very complexity shows how difficult it is to check all these loopholes. I rose only to say how surprised I was to see the Financial Secretary register shock when we said that we would divide. There are very good reasons why we should do so.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 21, line 12, at the end to insert:
<q>(3) Where in computing for the purposes of the profits tax the profits from a trade or business carried on by any person there is to be included a dividend or a part of a dividend which is to be so regarded as paid out of exempt trading income, then for the purposes of Part XIII of the Income Tax Not, 1952, as it applies for the allowance of credit against the profits tax such part, if any, of the taxes falling to be taken into account under the last foregoing section in the allowance of credit against income tax chargeable by reference to that exempt trading income as remains after the allowance of credit against that income tax</q>

shall be deemed to have been paid by that person in respect of profits of which the dividend, or the part of the dividend, represents the amount remaining after payment of the said part of the taxes.</p>

<p>This Amendment deals with the case of a United Kingdom company which is not an overseas trade corporation and is a shareholder in an overseas trade corporation. In the normal case a United Kingdom company drawing dividends from a United Kingdom company trading overseas would get the benefit of credit for foreign tax both against


Income Tax and against Profits Tax paid by the other company. Where, however, the United Kingdom company trading overseas is an overseas trade corporation, that overseas trade corporation is exempt by reason of the provisions of Part IV from Profits Tax, but the company drawing the dividend will have to pay the profits tax instead.<br/>
The effect, therefore, would be that apart from the Amendment the non-O.T.C. shareholding company would be unable to obtain credit against its Profits Tax for any foreign tax still outstanding after it had been applied against the Income Tax payable on the dividend by the overseas trade corporation. In other words, this is to enable a United Kingdom company which receives a dividend to be in the same position when it receives a dividend from an O.T.C. as it would have been had that company not been an overseas trade corporation. It still secures that there will be credit against United Kingdom Profits Tax for any outstanding foreign tax for which credit has not been allowed.</p>

<p>This is a rather important Clause which carries out the major reduction in Profits Tax which the Chancellor is making. I should like, briefly, to make clear why we on this side of the Committee still have some doubts about the main purpose of this Clause.<br/>
Hon. Members opposite have rather taken the line throughout these debates that the Chancellor is making some reduction in taxation of profits. They think any reduction in taxation of profits is a

good thing and, therefore, are all in favour of it without inquiring too carefully into what he is doing. What he is really doing is to give this substantial concession of &#x00A3;35 million&#x2014;a big part of which is through Profits Tax&#x2014;to a certain group of companies, and just because he is deciding to give the concession in this way it follows that other companies and other taxpayers will have to pay more. I see the right hon. and learned Member for Kensington, South (Sir P. Spens) shaking his head. It is no good his doing that. As a matter of logic, unless this action in some other way increases the revenue available, and nobody has argued that it does, what I say must be true.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-06-27a.528.0" hansard_membership_id="12522" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20900" speakername="Sir P. Spens" colnum="528" time="">
<p>That is the whole difference between us. All the way through our discussions right hon. and hon. Members opposite have assumed that no good whatever will follow from the increase in trade resulting from these Clauses. My hon. Friends and I take the view that a great deal of extra revenue will come. The argument of hon. Gentlemen opposite is a fallacy which has been put forward dozens of times.</p>

<p>The Chancellor makes the same assumptions as we do, because he has not allowed in his Budget for any increased revenue resulting from this change. The only logical assumption&#x2014;</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-06-27a.528.2" hansard_membership_id="12522" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20900" speakername="Sir P. Spens" colnum="528" time="">
<p>It will not be immediate; it will come in the future.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-06-27a.528.3" hansard_membership_id="6629" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/16611" speakername="Mr. Jay" colnum="528" time="">
<p>&#x2014;is that the Chancellor has taken a decision&#x2014;it is legitimate if he thinks it is right&#x2014;that this relief shall be concentrated in this way.<br/>
The Chancellor's argument, often repeated, is that it is necessary to put the firms trading overseas on a level with their competitors. Incidentally, he and the Financial Secretary have used a slightly different argument when we have asked who are the competitors. The Chancellor told us that they are foreign companies competing with British firms in these territories. The Financial Secretary told us that they are subsidiaries of British companies which are non-resident in the areas concerned. It is not quite the same argument, but no doubt the Chancellor could say that the British companies will be in competition with both.<br/>
I do not think that we have sufficiently carefully analysed what is supposed to be


the competitive disadvantage from which British companies are at present suffering. It is alleged that they are paying higher taxation. That does not mean that their costs are not the same and that they are not selling at the same competitive price as the firms with which they are competing. So far as we know, and so far as the argument goes, they are on a level in terms of costs and prices. All that is alleged is that out of the profits made a rather larger share is taken by the British Exchequer than by the treasury authorities of other countries.<br/>
What this amounts to is an argument that these firms should be enabled to build up capital tax free and to finance their expansion by that method rather than by borrowing, subject to interest payments, from outside. I agree with the Chancellor that to this extent, if they are unable to expand interest free, they are at a disadvantage compared with competitors paying a much lower rate of taxation. What seems to us to he curious about the concession is that that argument could be applied equally well to a British firm manufacturing in this country and exporting all over the world in competition with all sorts of other companies. I think that the right hon. and learned Member for Kensington, South would agree that it could be used by a company manufacturing in the United Kingdom and competing here with goods imported from a firm in Japan, the United States or Germany.<br/>
Therefore, if the Chancellor's argument really is that it is unfair that a British firm should not be able to build up new capital interest free when its competitor is able to do so, it does not seem to me that that argument applies any more forcibly to the companies trading overseas in the same area as their competitors than it does to any British firm which is exporting or is competing with foreign firms in this country or anywhere else in the world. Therefore, I would have thought&#x2014;and this is really our quarrel with the proposal&#x2014;that if the Chancellor had decided that he had &#x00A3;35 million to give away&#x2014;as the Lord Privy Seal used to say, but as the Chancellor now says we must not say&#x2014;it would have been better and fairer to have concentrated the relief, or the assistance, or whatever it is called, over the whole field of industry which, by and large, is competing with foreign firms either in the home market

or in exports in one part of the world or another.<br/>
I ask the Committee to recognise that what the Chancellor has decided to do is to concentrate the &#x00A3;35 million in this way on this rather narrowly, as it seems to me, and arbitrarily chosen group of firms. He could have taken another decision. He could have decided to use this relief to re-establish the investment allowance over the whole field of British industry. That would have had two advantages. First, it would have encouraged investment at home&#x2014;which is something that we want&#x2014;as well as investment abroad. Secondly, the investment allowance has the great merit over this other method that the Exchequer relinquishes revenue only when the firm actually carries out investment in new productive assets. If the Chancellor adopts the present method, a firm gets the relief even though it may use the undistributed profits to invest in securities and not in any expansion of productive capacity at all.<br/>
For both those reasons, I should have thought it could have been strongly argued that it would have been better to re-introduce the investment allowance rather than to take this rather special and arbitrary measure. It is for those reasons that we are still unconvinced&#x2014;given that there was this sum of money to use as a stimulus or a shot in the arm, or whatever the Chancellor likes to call it, to British overseas trade&#x2014;that this was the best and most economic use to make of it.</p>

<p>I do not think that I will follow the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Battersea, North (Mr. Jay) into all the various permutations and combinations of the way in which the money which is available for tax reliefs might have been used. He started his speech by saying that if this tax remission were made, other people would have to pay more, but what we have to look at is the difference between the short run and the long run.<br/>
Clearly, as was announced in the Budget, in the short-run this will cost money. We believe that, in the long run, it will bring money in. We are, as it were, casting our bread upon the waters, and we think that it will return to us after not too many days&#x2014;</p>

<p>To complete that argument, could the right hon. Gentleman just tell us in what form this money is to flow back to the Exchequer?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-06-27a.531.1" hansard_membership_id="4876" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/12392" speakername="Mr. Birch" colnum="531" time="">
<p>It will flow back through the increase in our exports, as we believe, and the profits overseas which will, in the long run, be distributed here.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman sought to show that there was a difference between my right hon. Friend the Chancellor and my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary as to whom the remission was enabling firms to compete with. Clearly, the answer is both, as he suggested. It will enable the British-registered company to compete better both with the foreign companies and with British companies registered overseas. As we have several times stated, one of the objects of the exercise is to retain companies registered here so far as we can, because we believe that in the long run&#x2014;and in the short run, for that matter&#x2014;it is better for our exports.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman went on to cast some doubt on the proposition that the competitive power of these overseas trade corporations might be improved by the taxation reliefs they had. I must say that that was not the argument put in an earlier debate on the Free Trade Area. What is certainly true, as he went on to show, is that it does enable companies, as is the object, to build up their reserves more easily. Therefore, not in the short run but in the long run, it does enable them to compete more than they would otherwise do.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-06-27a.532.0" colnum="532" time="">
<p>The right hon. Gentleman then introduced the argument again really, in effect, to say that it would be just as logical to remit taxation on companies operating here as on O.T.Cs. I do not think that that is altogether logical, because a foreign company working here is subject to British taxation. One is comparing like with like, the companies paying the same taxation. What we are seeking to do is to bring about a situation where a British registered company can compete on equal terms with companies abroad paying the taxation which obtains in those countries.</p>

<p>If a British company is exporting, for instance, to Italy, and selling there in competition with an Italian firm, and if the Italian firm is paying a lower level of taxation, could not exactly the same argument be used?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-06-27a.532.2" hansard_membership_id="4876" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/12392" speakername="Mr. Birch" colnum="532" time="">
<p>If I may say so, it is not quite the same thing. Of course, we have an efficient economy here, and it is perfectly true that we can export to countries with lower taxation; that is partly owing to the fact that we are a very highly organised country with very highly skilled labour, and so forth. What I was saying is that we are trying to compare like with like. If one is operating in a country in competition with other firms operating in that country, one ought to be on level terms with them.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 21, line 43, at the end, to insert:
<q>Provided that a company shall qualify as an Overseas Trade Corporation for any such year if it only fails to comply with the requirements specified in any of the foregoing paragraphs because it, or a company which is its subsidiary company, has only recently been formed, or is about to be or is being wound up, and, consequently, is not carrying on a trade outside the United Kingdom.</q>
This is a very minor Amendment, designed to deal with the case of a company which is formed or wound up during the tax year. It is a requirement for qualifying in such circumstances as an overseas trade corporation that, among other things, the company shall he carrying on trade outside the United Kingdom during the whole time that it is in existence. It will be obvious that where a company is being wound up or is just starting, one could not guarantee that it was actually conducting trade abroad either on the last day before it ceased to exist or on the first day after it came into existence. Therefore, without this proviso it might be prevented on a purely technical ground from qualifying and getting the benefit of subsection (1, <i>a</i>). It is to rectify that doubt that the proviso is felt to be</p>

<p>Clause 27 (2) appears to give to the Commissioners of Inland Revenue certain discretionary powers to deal with companies which have slipped up. It says that
<q>If it appears to the Commissioners of Inland Revenue that a company would have the necessary qualifications so as to qualify as an Overseas Trade Corporation for a period but for some event over which the company had no control or some act done by the company inadvertently and that no material advantage, was obtained by the company from that event or from its act, then for the purposes of this section that event or act shall, if the Commissioners of Inland Revenue in their discretion so direct, be disregarded.</q>
This seems to me to be a new and unusual power given to the Commissioners and we should invite the Financial Secretary to throw some light upon it.<br/>
Section 66 of the Income Tax Act, 1952, deals with errors and omissions and things of that kind and the rights of the taxpayer to rectify them but, as far as I know, none of the provisions of that Section enables the taxpayer to say, "I am awfully sorry but I inadvertently did something which has put me at a disadvantage according to the Income Tax Act. I really had no idea


that I was doing it and up to now have had no material advantage. Will you please disregard it? "We ought to know what are the conditions under which the Commissioners of Inland Revenue would be able to exercise this discretionary power.<br/>
9.30 p.m.<br/>
Then again, under Section 66, in the event of the Commissioners rejecting a plea for rectification from a taxpayer, ho has certain rights of appeal to the Special Commissioners. The Committee will be reluctant to give discretionary powers to the Commissioners of Inland Revenue which may have the appearance of manipulating the law or allowing the taxpayer to manipulate the law. I am sure there is no ulterior motive in the subsection, and I have the utmost confidence in the Commissioners of Inland Revenue&#x2014;at least, on everything except establishment matters. They, I am sure, will exercise these powers with discretion, but will this be fair to other taxpayers? What are the circumstances in which a taxpayer would inadvertently do something which he would be justified in asking to be disregarded?<br/>
Is it that this box of tricks in Part IV of the Bill is so complex, so full of pitfalls and stumbling blocks that at the end of this labyrinth there must be the comforting arms of the Commissioners of Inland Revenue, who will put him right if he stumbles through the dark thing? We want to know whether that is the object of this subsection.<br/>
After all, most overseas trade corporations will be littered with chartered accountants, astute solicitors, ingenious advisers of every kind and ilk, and they will not be without sure guidance through all the traps in Part IV of the Bill. In fact, the great worry of the Commissioners of Inland Revenue is that there are so many ingenious taxpayers who are able to employ at high professional fees the most astute and imaginative professional advice which will open up all the loopholes, create those that are not there to begin with and, in the end, draw a coach and horses through it, and when the Commissioners of Inland Revenue have seen the money draining away for four or five years then the Chancellor does something about it.<br/>
I really think that this is so unusual that the Committee should have a full explanation of what it is intended to do. For instance, why does a company that does something inadvertently, and derives no material advantage from it, have to be put right? Why has the discretion of the Commissioners of Inland Revenue to be sought unless it is to put something right which will lead to an advantage to the taxpayer?<br/>
We do not want to give discretionary powers to the Administration which may be exercised in a way which this Committee and the House would not approve, and to which other taxpayers may object. I hope that the Financial Secretary will have reassurances to give upon this point, and explanations of the type of case that the Clause is put there to help. Otherwise we shall he bound to regard this with such repugnance that we must vote against it. If there is need for something of this kind, it should be put on a statutory basis, or at least the authority to exercise the discretion should be a body to which the taxpayer could go in the full light of day and have his case heard in a judicial manner.<br/>
The Commissioners of Inland Revenue, as I have said more than once, have the care and maintenance of the Income Tax Acts. They are part of the bureaucracy to administer one of our most complicated tax codes and they are therefore, as a rule, not an appellate body. Usually the appeal is to the General Commissioners and from them in certain circumstances to the Special Commissioners or to appeal tribunals or to the courts. I think we ought to know more about this provision. We ought to have definite assurances that it is intended for a proper purpose and that it can rarely be used, and then only in manner which would receive public approval.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-06-27a.538.0" hansard_membership_id="5594" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30191" speakername="Mr. Powell" colnum="538" time="">
<p>I think all sides of the Committee approve that the conditions on which companies shall enjoy the status of overseas trade corporations shall be very narrowly and tightly drawn so as, in particular, to avoid giving a preference to one person trading and making profits in the United Kingdom as against another; and, amongst other places, these conditions are to be found in Clause 21, which has been added to the Bill. The concept is that a number of resident companies,


by fulfilling the conditions in Clause 21&#x2014;the type of company to which the purpose of this part of the Bill is directed&#x2014;will gain the status of overseas trade corporations and will in future trade under those equal terms with their competitors which this Part of the Bill provides for them.<br/>
If there were not this provision to which the hon. Member for Sowerby (Mr. Houghton) drew attention, then on a strict intepretation of Clause 21 a single and even inadvertent action in contravention of any of the requirements, for example of Clause 21&#x2014;I will give an example in a moment&#x2014;would in strict law disqualify that company for the whole of that tax year from the status which it enjoyed, was intended to enjoy, and thought it was remaining qualified to enjoy. It is therefore clearly necessary that we should prevent a merely technical slip from having an effect which, given the general policy, no one intends.<br/>
Let us suppose that an overseas trade corporation is taking over a cargo free on board which it is to dispose of in its overseas trading field. Let us suppose that that ship is held up by some trouble and that the cargo, perhaps perishable, is nevertheless, after coming into the possession of the overseas trade corporation, disposed of, perhaps by the company's agents in the United Kingdom. Although that action might involve loss rather than gain to the company, under Clause 21 it would technically disqualify that company from overseas trade corporation status for the whole of that year. It is that type of irrelevant and accidental breach of the conditions, particularly of Clause 21, to which this subsection is directed.<br/>
Consequently, I can readily give the assurance which the hon. Member asked me to give. This provision is intended both to be rarely used and to be used only in cases where there can be no question of the company deliberately seeking a double advantage&#x2014;the advantage of a company treated as an overseas trade corporation and the advantage of trading in contravention of some of the requirements for an O.T.C.<br/>
If it is to be dealt with in the manner which the circumstances require, this is obviously a matter in which a discretion has to be given to the Commissioners of Inland Revenue who, <i>ex hypothesi,</i> will

be entirely <i>au fait</i> with the trading proceedings of the company in question and will be in a position to judge the bearing of this act or event upon the trading position of the company.<br/>
I therefore suggest to the Committee that although, as the hon. Member for Sowerby said, and I accept it, this is a new and unusual power which we are here entrusting to the Commissioners of Inland Revenue, it is sensible and convenient and one without which the purpose of the Bill as a whole might in some entirely meritorious cases be frustrated.</p>

<p>The reply the Financial Secretary has given to my hon. Friend the Member for Sowerby (Mr. Houghton) will be regarded in many parts of the Committee as rather extraordinary. He said that because of the possibility of inadvertence it was necessary in these cases for the Commissioners of Inland Revenue to be able to exercise their discretion. That is almost without precedent in Income Tax law and administration.<br/>
The Committee and the Committees in previous years have always been very much on guard against any provisions allowing too much discretion to the tax authorities. Perhaps we have debated this far more in terms of the Board of Customs and Excise than in terms of the Board of Inland Revenue. I remember hon. Members in several parts of the Committee on a previous Finance Bill two or three years ago expressing very grave concern in connection with that very technical subject called "uplift" in which the word "mainly" or "substantially" was used. It was left in the hands of the Board of Customs and Excise. The Paymaster-General, who had something to do with those matters at that time, may recall that debate. It is very strange that this discretion is given in this way to the Board of Inland Revenue.<br/>
The Financial Secretary did not take up the point of my hon. Friend when he asked in what previous cases this has been done. My hon. Friend with his vast experience of Income Tax law finds it difficult to put his finger on any similar case. I remember hearing a very distinguished tax lawyer a couple of years ago when I was having a general discussion who said to me. "Of course, your job in the House of Commons would be


a great deal easier if instead of having all these vast Finance Bills and consolidation Measures you just said that Income Tax shall be paid in those cases where the Board of Inland Revenue considers it right that it should be paid. "I told him that that was something of an exaggeration and I think that I was justified in saying so when one looks at the extent to which the Board of Inland Revenue is restricted and confined in the cases in which it can tax and disallow tax.<br/>
The Financial Secretary is one who, unlike the Chancellor, on the whole wants these provisions tight, but one wonders where this will all end. Are we to have new Measures covering the whole of Income Tat and Profits Tax legislation where there are hard cases and where some chap has fallen foul of the law in some small particular where the Board of Inland Revenue shall have the power to overlook it? Is that to be a new and very important hole which will be drilled below the Revenue water line in some subsequent Finance Bill? Perhaps the Financial Secretary will assure us that the Government do not have that in mind.<br/>
In other cases where a hard luck story is produced the Revenue would never dream of accepting it and would say that it could not accept it because of the law of the land. I might mention one or two parallel cases. I am not pleading for the Revenue to have a right of discretion in these hard luck cases, but I am saying that since taxpayers have to meet the requirements of the law in every other case known to us, I do not know why there should be discrimination in this case.<br/>
As an illustration, I could refer to subventions under Section 20 of the 1953 Act. It might be that because of inadvertence a particular exchange of shares did not take place quite on the right day; it might have been thought to have been done, but not have been properly sealed or something like that, and with no gain or financial advantage resulting from the inadvertence. Perhaps they were a day late, and therefore the subsidiary or associated company did not come into the group for E.P.L., or whatever it was. That might well happen, and it probably has happened but the Board of Inland Revenue have no power at all to give a certificate of inadvertence or whatever is

required under the new procedure, and, we should say, quite rightly.<br/>
9.45 p.m.<br/>
There are all sorts of hard cases in the field of social insurance, and every one of us knows from experience of his own constituency cases of men injured a day or two early. In my own constituency, a man was killed two days before the passage of the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Bill, and, therefore ruled out from benefit. We may say that it is hard luck for a man to be killed a day or two early, and all that sort of argument might apply. The same thing applies in the case of widows whose husbands died under the appropriate age. But no one has ever suggested that the Ministry of National Insurance should have the power to grant a dispensation, and I am glad to see that my hon. Friend the Member for Ince (Mr. T. Brown) is here, because he knows it so well.<br/>
Here is a case where it is not a question of pure bad luck but of frank mismanagement. These companies have the benefit of the most highly-paid lawyers and accountants to advise them, and if they bring cargoes into the country which they should not have brought, they should know that by doing so they put themselves outside the reliefs given by this Bill. In the sort of case which I have mentioned, the subvention case, where the Revenue hardens its heart, and rightly so, it applies the law as the law is laid down by this House in past Finance Bills.<br/>
To take another case rather nearer to the sort of thing we are talking about in Part IV of this Bill, let us consider the case where a company&#x2014;and this sort of case has been mentioned many times this week&#x2014;has established by one means or another a non-resident company overseas. It has appointed a local board of directors, or has seen to the appointment of a local board of controlling directors, to fulfil the local laws of the country in question. The whole of the shares are held by the British parent company, but, because control is purely shareholding control, even though they may have acted in a sense <i>in terrorem,</i> because this board of directors can be sacked at a moment's notice by the shareholders, even so, the Revenue have always accepted in such cases, provided that the local board of management does exercise management, that it is a non-resident company


outside the tax jurisdiction of this country.<br/>
We know that the services of the greatest lawyers and accountants have been used in order to ensure that the Revenue never has any excuse for suggesting that in such cases that a non-resident company is in any way controlled, and that is why every letter that goes out to them is drafted in terms suggested by lawyers. For instance, they never tell the local board of management to do anything. They say, "We suggest for your consideration that you might consider doing so and so", or "This is a matter which we should like you to consider." Of course, the local board of directors knows all the time that they are being told to do it, and that if they did go against the parent company, in due course they could be discharged under the shareholders' control.<br/>
Nevertheless, in accordance with the law, long established for 75 years or more, the Board of Inland Revenue says that if there is no control in this country, then it is a non-resident company and it is outside tax jurisdiction. But let us suppose that by inadvertence, perhaps when the director looking after this sort of business is on his summer holidays or may be listening to a debate in the House of Commons about overseas trading corporations, and he is not there, some junior person, inadvertently and without authority, perhaps sends a letter to this overseas board of management and says "It is our view that you should do so and so", or "You had better buy this or sell that", or "You are charging too much for these materials you are exporting overseas." I do not think that any gain comes to the company from that one act, but the Board would not be empowered&#x2014;and I think rightly so&#x2014;to waive the conditions of the Income Tax Acts in such a case. It is inadvertent, and it is only one small slip or accident. There is no direct gain to the company therefrom, but in that case inadvertence is a matter which is heavily punished, and the company might then be regarded as not being a non-resident company.<br/>
In this case, however, from the illustration given by the Financial Secretary, if there is this act of inadvertence and this little accident or slip-up, from which, as a consequence of the law, the company

should lose its status, the Board of Inland Revenue is empowered to be generous and overlook this little fault. We hope that the Financial Secretary is right in thinking that it will always be easy to spot the case of sheer inadvertence, and to distinguish that case from the case where a deliberate act has taken place.<br/>
But just as hon. Members on this side of the Committee feel that this part of the Bill puts an impossibly heavy load upon those having to operate a complicated system, and just as we think that the already heavily strained Inland Revenue system is being given almost impossible tasks of decision, so I think that the Financial Secretary is adding to those difficulties once he admits this principle of inadvertence and lays upon inspectors of taxes and the Board of Inland Revenue this very difficult task of having to decide whether a particular chance arrival of an allegedly perishable cargo is a piece of inadvertence or a deliberate act for the sake of some immediate gain.<br/>
Once the Clause is accepted, if there is such a chance arrival there is no doubt that the firm concerned or its accountants and lawyers will say, "We should like the Board of Inland Revenue to exercise its waiver in this respect". The Board, with such information as it has, will then have to decide, one way or the other, whether this was a piece of inadvertence, and whether there was any gain from this shipment. This will put a very heavy load upon the Board. It will greatly increase the burden upon the staff. I hope that the Government will think about this matter again. As far as we know they are creating an entirely new precedent. If not, perhaps the Financial Secretary can tell us of other cases where the Board has this power of discretion.<br/>
We hope that the Government will agree to think again about this question and will put the law with regard to overseas trade corporations upon exactly the same basis as the law applying to other taxpayers. If not, by being overgenerous in this case the hon. Gentleman will be creating unfairness in all those cases where taxpayers have to suffer because they make some little slip, and where, because they fail to conform with some quite small cedilla of the law, they are landed with a heavy tax payment.


Surely the hon. Gentleman will agree to re-examine this question and to put this part of the law upon the same basis as that with which we have become familiar through previous Finance Bills.</p>

<p>We regard this Clause as a bad one. It will add lush, fresh fields of tax avoidance to our fiscal system. The purport of the Clause is to create artificial conditions under which it is pretended that two companies which are really one and the same are trading at arms length. It is trying to create artificial conditions&#x2014;which do exist between distinct and separate companies&#x2014;between a parent company and its hived-off subsidiary. The whole idea is that the Clause will stop phoney subterfuge prices being charged between one of the companies and the other.<br/>
On the Second Reading of the Finance Bill on 7th May the Financial Secretary said that the present powers of the Commissioners of Inland Revenue contained in Section 469 of the Income Tax Act, 1952, are expanded by Clause 28. He said:
<q>The Commissioners will in fact find this power easier to exercise than their present power under Section 469&#x2026;"&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 7th May, 1957; Vol. 569, c. 817.]</q>
I do not think that when he said that the hon. Gentleman could have taken into account that we were to have at our disposal the memoranda of the Board of Inland Revenue, because they deal with this precise point. At any rate, I do not think the hon. Gentleman would have said that with such ease, assurance and complacency.<br/>
A good deal has been said about the proper r&#x00F4;le of the Board of Inland Revenue in our affairs, and its views. Every hon. Member agrees that the views of the Board are not very important or very decisive where matters of policy are involved. Governments and the House of Commons must decide matters of policy, advised by officials, but only advised by them. But when the Board of Inland Revenue begins to talk about details of administration and the administration and enforcement of a Clause like Clause 28, then what it says begins to be fairly weighty, and it cannot be just brushed off, as the Chancellor did the

other day. They are arguments which must be met and faced.<br/>
It is no good the Financial Secretary simply contradicting what the Commissioners said. That is what he did in his Second Reading speech. The arguments have to be met. In paragraph 14 of Memorandum No. 109 the Commissioners refer to Section 469 of the 1952 Act. In paragraph 15 they say that cases under the Section are rare and that
<q>&#x2026;there have been thirty-seven in the three years in which the Section has operated.</q>
That remark was made in 1954. I suppose there have been a small number since.<br/>
The Commissioners said that:
<q>&#x2026;the main purpose of the Section was <i>in terrorem.</i></q>
That is a different picture from what the hon. Gentleman gave us on Second Reading. The Commissioners said that:
<q>&#x2026;it serves its purpose by deterring groups of companies from invoicing goods to each other at prices which are blatantly fictitious, but it is not, and cannot be, used as authority for challenging invoice prices"&#x2014;</q>
the very opposite to what the hon. Gentleman said&#x2014;
<q>which do not look unreasonable, notwithstanding that variations in price may have a very marked effect on profits and, therefore, on tax liability.</q>
I ask the hon. Gentleman to take account of this in his reply, because it absolutely contradicts what he said. This is not a view; it is the Board of Inland Revenue giving the history of the administration of Section 469. The Commissioners say in paragraph 16:
<q>It must not, therefore, be imagined that we have by experience built tip any body of practice which would help us in administering a scheme on the lines proposed.</q>
That is, on the lines of Clause 28. They add:
<q>In the case of many classes of export, there will exist no independent merchants"&#x2014;</q>
This refers to the fictitious pretence of trading at arm's length&#x2014;
<q>and as the rate of profit to turnover varies considerably according to the nature of the commodity there will not even be a theoretical basis for computing the merchanting profit.</q>
The memorandum says in conclusion that claims will be made under the Act when there are special reasons why the price is a little different from what might be expected, and that such claims will be impossible to check.<br/>
This is the absolute controversion of what the hon. Gentleman said, and unless he can put up counter-arguments these statements of the Board will hold the field. What the hon. Gentleman told us on Second Reading was that Section 469 was frightfully important and was being extended, but the Board of Inland Revenue says that it is not very important and, if extended, would be unenforceable. What reasons can the hon. Gentleman give for accepting what he told us as against what the Board of Inland Revenue is telling us&#x2014;not about its views on policy and on the theory of taxation but actually giving an account of the administration of a Section of the Act which it has been administering for a number of years.<br/>
If Clause 28 is, as we think, and as the Board of Inland Revenue seems to think, unenforceable, then, of course, the whole of this part of the Bill becomes unenforceable&#x2014;including Clause 21, which tries to enforce f.o.b. prices. If all that is unenforceable we shall get into terrible trouble, sooner or later, with the G.A.T.T. and with O.E.E.C. We shall be breaking all their rules, and only pretending to keep them by Clauses which sound pretty, look nice, but are unenforceable.<br/>
The whole of this part of the Bill, particularly as exports are brought in, is really a subterfuge; pretending that people are different from what they really are, that they are trading differently from the way in which they are really trading, and pretending they are charging prices different from those that they are charging in reality. There is no way, says the Board of Inland Revenue, of enforcing it. We therefore regard this Clause as extremely bad, phoney and fictitious.</p>

<p>I am sorry that the right hon. Gentleman thinks that this is a bad Clause, as he has not tried to amend it, but it is, of course, a very important Clause indeed, because it is designed not only to prevent the syphoning away of profits to a place where they would not be taxed, but to meet the accusation that the overseas trade corporation conception might lead to a concealed export subsidy.<br/>

<p>It is not an export subsidy. If an exporting company buys goods at the same price f.o.b. as any other foreign company can buy them, there is no export subsidy. We have had that out already. Quite clearly there is not one.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman quoted the Board of Inland Revenue as saying that there is no point in challenging something that does not look unreasonable. That seems a very sensible thing to say. As far as Section 469 of the Income Tax Act 1952 goes, it is perfectly true that there have not been many cases where adjustments of prices have actually been made, but there are two reasons for that. One is that there may not have been many attempts at evasion. Secondly, of course, under Section 469 as it is drawn, the powers are much less great than under this Clause.<br/>
There are two differences between that Section and this Clause. First, the Clause extends the provision; that is to say the company is not to be under control and is not to be a foreign company. The reason for not making it a controlled company is that there may be cases in which a consortium may be formed by two or three companies for the purpose of setting up an overseas trade corporation, and it might be possible there to syphon away profits. We have, therefore, specifically cut out the condition of control. The second way in which it is easier under the Clause than under Section 469 is that, <i>ex hypothesi,</i> these overseas trade corporations are resident companies, and their accounts can, and will be examined. It is not, I think, really beyond the powers of the Inland Revenue, when examining accounts of companies, to have a fairly good idea whether cheating is going on or not.</p>

<p>All O.T.C.s are resident in this country, and their accounts are open to examination if necessary. It is far


easier to enforce this Clause than to enforce Section 469, because one has control over both sets of accounts.<br/>
We believe that the Clause can be made to work and will be worked. We think it a pity to express doubts upon the ability of the Inland Revenue to carry it through.</p>

<p>If I may say so, this is really very unsatisfactory. When all is said and done, the right hon. Gentleman the Economic Secretary has tried to deal in about three minutes with a great deal of closely reasoned argument and evidence adduced by the Commissioners of Inland Revenue, wherein they say, quite frankly, that they have no experience in this sort of field. The Commissioners say:
<q>It may, as a matter of theory, be necessary to rewrite a company's accounts and to substitute for prices at which goods are actually invoiced other figures based on market prices. In fact, cases of this kind are rare.</q>
In other words, the Inland Revenue is saying from the start, "We have had no experience of this sort of thing". A little further on, referring to principles, the Memorandum says:
<q>If their actual application had to be checked closely on a large scale, there would be much difficulty in particular cases".</q>
These are sentences which I just put at the side of those already quoted by my right hon. Friend to show that the Inland Revenue is saying, quite bluntly, that we are entering upon a completely new field, and the Revenue has really not had to go into books, and vouchers or be involved in rewriting company's accounts, almost on a fictitious basis. That is, in fact, what will have to happen under the Clause.<br/>
The Economic Secretary dismisses that in a few sentences in about three minutes. It is not good enough. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Sowerby (Mr. Houghton) has been saying that we must not take too much account of what the Inland Revenue says, but he was not talking about this sort of section in the comments of the Inland Revenue. He will, I am sure, get up in a minute and say that this is precisely the kind of point on which the Inland Revenue is to be regarded, not disregarded. He was saying that the Revenue must not make policy and principle for us, but I am sure he will say that, when it comes to knowing something about how to evade tax, the Com

missioners of Inland Revenue can tell us a good deal about what is going on in this country today.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-06-27a.554.0" hansard_membership_id="12581" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/19338" speakername="Mr. E. Partridge" colnum="554" time="">
<p>Is the hon. Gentleman saying that the Inland Revenue has had no experience? If so, then let us give it some.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-06-27a.554.1" hansard_membership_id="2212" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/31417" speakername="Mr. Chapman" colnum="554" time="">
<p>Perhaps the hon. Member for Battersea, South (Mr. Partridge) is one of those who wants a lot of people to escape the tax net in order to teach a few lessons to the Inland Revenue. I think it would be better not to start on the exercise at all. I am anxious to preserve the nation's revenue.<br/>
The argument and evidence put is very formidable indeed. It points to examples of companies, for example, where, when it comes to re-writing figures on more or less a fictitious basis, there is no basis of comparison. They are unique, producing a unique product. Who is to know what is the arms-length trade in a unique product more or less confined to one particular firm producing it for export? This sort of thing should not be dismissed in a minute or two, as the right hon. Gentleman is trying to do.<br/>
How is the Inland Revenue to set about its job? After all, as I understand it at the moment, there are only very rarely-used powers in the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to enforce the actual production of vouchers, invoices and all the rest. The powers of the inspector at the moment are confined to the production of books and accounts. To go much further into the privately kept papers of the individual firm requires special authorisation by the Commissioners.<br/>
What we want to know is whether there will be a willingness on the part of the Commissioners to use powers of this sort to ferret out what will doubtless be the attempts at evasion in cases like this. We want assurance that there will be energy in application and that even our fears are shared by the Government Front Bench. I have a feeling that the right hon. Gentleman, like his right hon. Friend this afternoon, is dismissing all this by saying, "It will not happen. We can leave it. These are wild imaginings of the Opposition and on those grounds we need not worry about it." We on this side want some effective answers to the people who know what tax evasion is when they have put before us ideas and


suggestions about how it will go on unless there is more thorough enforcement than is apparently the case at the moment. I regard the Minister's reply as totally unsatisfactory and I hope we shall divide against the Clause.</p>

<p>I support what my hon. Friend the Member for Northfield (Mr. Chapman) has said. It is inescapable that the Clause will fail completely to deal with the evil which it is intended to meet. The possibility is admitted that there will be traders who adopt false and fictitious prices for their exports of commodities. The attempt is made by the Clause to give the Inland Revenue power to deal with those people, but the Inland Revenue has admitted that it has no experience of dealing with such cases.<br/>
The Treasury has failed completely in attempting to deal with the problem. The Inland Revenue has admitted that it has no experience whatever in dealing with this kind of problem in applying Section 469 of the Income Tax Act. It confesses that it does not understand how to do it and has not done it.<br/>
If the Chancellor really wants to cure the difficulty, let me tell him that the people who have had considerable experience of this matter are the Commissioners of Customs and Excise, because they have had to deal with precisely this problem in reverse in connection with imports. There are plenty of cases in which English subsidiary companies of foreign parent firms, or, <i>vice versa,</i> try to import goods into this country at unduly low prices to avoid Customs duties. Therefore, the Commissioners of Customs and Excise have had considerable experience in detecting this kind of abuse and dealing with it. They are, however, as the Chancellor should know if he has looked at the Customs Consolidation Act, given wide powers.<br/>
If the Chancellor is serious in attempting to check the practice in connection with exports, which is only the same operation in reverse, he should not have applied Section 469 of the Income Tax Act but should make sure that the Commissioners of Inland Revenue have the same powers as the Commissioners of Customs and Excise in dealing with imports. Everybody will recognise that nothing like the same power is being given to the Commissioners of Inland Revenue. The Chancellor will find that, however well-intentioned he may be in trying to

prevent this kind of abuse, it will almost inevitably take place and the Inland Revenue authorities will be unable to cope with it. For that reason, we oppose the Clause.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Islington, East (Mr. Fletcher) has made an extremely valuable suggestion and certainly added to the information at our disposal in considering this matter, which is more than can be said for the speech of the Economic Secretary, who dealt with the matter in the most perfunctory way. It is quite clear from the course of our debates that when we have replies from the Economic Secretary they are much more perfunctory than those we get from the Financial Secretary. When we get replies from the Chancellor, of course, they are just breathless and reckless, but have a certain engaging quality of their own. We should like to have more replies from the Chancellor. We value them when they come, even though we do not altogether agree with them.<br/>
It has emerged quite clearly that of the Treasury trio, unsupported, rather unusually, on any occasion by a Law Officer, despite the extremely complicated nature of this legislation, the only one of the three who has any real feeling for dealing with avoidance and the possibility of evasion is the Financial Secretary. Yet when we come to deal with a Clause which is the main anti-avoidance provision, it is odd that the Financial Secretary should not speak about it and that the Economic Secretary, who joins with the Chancellor in not being concerned about avoidance, being a "hundred percenter" or whatever it is, should get up and give this extremely perfunctory answer.<br/>
I should have thought that it was common ground on both sides of the Committee that the views of the Inland Revenue were extremely relevant on this matter. Last night we had a good deal of dispute as to what extent, on matters of policy, we should take account of the views of the Inland Revenue, but when we are dealing with technical, administrative and anti-avoidance problems, I have no doubt, and I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Sowerby (Mr. Houghton) would agree with me, that the views of the Inland Revenue carry a great deal of weight.<br/>
It is no good the Economic Secretary pretending that we are dealing with a different problem here and that Clause 28 is something qualitatively different from the Section of the 1952 Income Tax Act under which the Inland Revenue had previously proceeded, because quite clearly a great part of the views that the Inland Revenue put forward in Memorandum 109 referred to what it could or could not do under a particular piece of legislation. It referred quite clearly to the extreme difficulty of anybody in any practical sense making a judgment as to what was a fair arm's length price between a manufacturing company and an exporting company.<br/>
The Inland Revenue referred to it in quite forceful language. It developed it by saying that the problem was exacerbated by the fact that in just those exports which were and are expanding most rapidly it yeas most difficult to make such a decision, because they were essentially specialised products where there can be, by their very nature, no past practice by which to go and by which to make a</p>

<p>decision on what is a market price. I certainly think, therefore, that in view of the extremely unsatisfaotory, perfunctory and brief reply by the Economic Secretary, and in view of the importance of the issue, we on this side of the Committee are bound to express our disapproval by voting against the Clause.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-06-27a.558.1" colnum="558" time="">
<p>The Clause, of course, is better than nothing, but it is highly unsatisfactory. In view of the fact that we were told by the Financial Secretary, when the Bill was first introduced, that the avoidance provisions were of great importance and had been most carefully worked out, and yet when we come to examine them in detail nothing is said in support of them except some few brief sentences by the Economic Secretary, we have no recourse, unless we have a further and more satisfactory reply from the Government, but to vote against the Clause.</p>

<p>This Clause deals with the technical machinery of the process that we have become accustomed to describe in these debates as "hiving off". It deals with it in the case where the company hived off is to be virtually a fully owned subsidiary of the parent company. As subsection (1) is drafted, however, provision is not made for the case where it might be desired, instead of hiving off the trading company directly, to set up a holding company subordinate to which there would be two or more overseas trade corporations.<br/>
The Amendment covers the case where the trading companies formed by hiving off will be the fully owned subsidiaries, whether directly or partly directly or indirectly or partly indirectly, of the principal company. There is no practical difference, but it enables a structure to be set up embodying a holding company, thus making possible the switch of resources between Overseas Trade Corporations through a parent holding Overseas trade corporation</p>

<p>The Financial Secretary keeps talking about these obscene litters as overseas trade corporations. I cannot see why there should be so many special provisions for doing things indirectly through a series of holding companies and the like. We were told earlier in the discussion that this was a first venture, and whenever we come to anything about the structure of companies the Government appear ready</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-06-27a.562.0" colnum="562" time="">
<p>to involve themselves in a mass of complications, and in spite of it to omit some of the more obvious points about subsidiaries, to one of which I had occasion to call the Financial Secretary's attention a short time ago. But complexity as such has no terrors for him. On the other hand, when it is a question of putting up a smoke-screen about some fictitious prices, only the simplest machinery is used, as being, I suppose, easier for the foreigners concerned in G.A.T.T. to understand and easier at the same time for those who are to be engaged in these transactions to no good purpose to find their way through.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-06-27a.562.1" colnum="562" time="">
<p>I do not see why it is necessary to have a provision of this sort and why the advantages of the following subsections of the Clause should be extended beyond what is at the moment obvious and beyond what is necessary to give a fair trial to a new set-up in this matter. I cannot help feeling that the more O.T.Cs., parents, grandparents, uncles, aunts and what-nots of an O.T.C. that the Financial Secretary thinks about, the more pleasure it no doubt gives him, but the more complicated he makes the net and the easier to find holes in it. T therefore somewhat mistrust this Amendment.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-06-27a.562.2" colnum="562" time="">
<p>Frankly, all of us, including the Board of Inland Revenue, have so little idea of how the whole of this Part will work and how many means and what means will be found by those who wish to do so of getting the advantages without incurring the conditions that I do not feel able to ask my right hon. and hon. Friends to divide on a small point of this sort, but I am bound to say that I do not see the need of the Amendment.</p>

<p>I regard this sort of Clause as capable of classification in various ways. It may be understandable, it may be incomprehensible, it may be understandable with difficulty but capable of only one meaning, and it may be understandable with difficulty and capable of a rich variety of meanings. I am inclined to think with some hesitation that this Clause comes into the fourth category, probably understandable with difficulty but capable of a rich variety of meanings.<br/>
The same applies with increasing force to the additions we have just made. I cannot view with any interest or approval in a scheme of this kind the supposed necessity for complications of this sort. If this is to be a workable scheme and workable without the prospect of comprehensive evasion, it ought to be possible to make it a great deal more simple than the Clause makes it in these matters.<br/>
When we do get to the tolerably clear and easy provisions they are demonstrably unworkable, not only from their

nature but from the report we have had on them from the Board of Inland Revenue. This kind of Clause and the further complications which the Chancellor's own Amendments have made at this stage simply make me think that this is too complicated to work properly, but not by any means too complicated for people to get round if they want.</p>

The Clause gives the Commissioners of Inland Revenue powers by Statutory Instrument to make regulations to deal with this part of the Bill. The second power which is given to them is the power to extend the time within which assessments may be made. I am moving the Amendment because, whatever other powers the Commissioners have, the time for making assessments ought to remain the ordinary statutory time. It is true that the Government have put down an Amendment which will enable them to do it only with the consent of the House of Commons, but all the same on previous occasions we have resisted the power of the Board of Inland Revenue to extend the time for assessments. I strongly take the view that if the statutory period is not sufficient, then the fault is that of the Commissioners and nobody else.</p>

<p>I hope that the Government will not be so weak-kneed as to accept the Amendment. We have already passed a Clause, quite unprecedented, giving the same Commissioners the power to remit mistakes which did not result in any great benefit for the company. After that quite remarkable innovation in the law of Income Tax, that little reversion in financial matters to the Statutes of Henry VIII, it is remarkable for the right hon. and learned Gentlemen of the Tory Party to boggle at a little thing like this.<br/>
The right hon. and learned Gentleman used language which implied that a positive Resolution would be required, but the following Amendment is in the opposite sense, and it gives the House


an opportunity of praying against one of these orders if it thinks it unreasonable. While I view with certain suspicion the grant of unfettered discretion, even upon a comparatively small scale, to the Commissioners&#x2014;which is what we had a short time ago&#x2014;this kind of thing leaves me much less bothered, and I can see no particular reason why the Commissioners have not had this power. One never knows what the Government will accept nowadays, but I suppose that it is a fair inference from the next Amendment that they will not accept this one, so perhaps I need not say more.</p>

<p>I find that my right hon. and learned Friend's arguments have made more impression upon me than they evidently have upon the hon. and learned Member for Kettering (Mr. Mitchison). It is quite true, as my right hon. and learned Friend said, that the period within which assessments can be made&#x2014;fixed by Statute&#x2014;is a very important safeguard of the subject. The idea behind the paragraph which the Amendment seeks to delete was that cases can arise&#x2014;as has been mentioned earlier&#x2014;where an overseas trade corporation, in a particular year, might claim to have put itself out of court as an overseas trade corporation where that was an advantage to it, and that claim might well disclose the fact that throughout the whole of the period in which it had been treated as an overseas trade corporation&#x2014;which might have been for more than six years&#x2014;it had been enjoying that status without any right to it.<br/>
I hope that the provisions which my right hon. Friend proposes to introduce to prevent overseas trade corporations from disqualifying themselves at will in order to gain a tax advantage, however, will be sufficient to meet the point in mind, and I therefore recommend the Committee to accept the view that paragraph (<i>b</i>) is unnecessary and should fall away.</p>

<p>The wisdom of what the Government have done by accepting the first of the two Amendments to the Clause will depend entirely upon the efficacy of the Amendments they propose to make, which will be to the effect of preventing people using the qualifications in the Clause to come in and out of the status of overseas trade corporations&#x2014;for those were the Amendments to which the Financial Secretary referred. Those Amendments, as he told us earlier, will give the Commissioners power to investigate the intentions of the companies concerned, which means, in fact, the intentions of the directors of those companies. It seems to me a very remarkable view of the value of individual liberty to object to a time of assessment&#x2014;as was the objection in this case&#x2014;and, at the same time, to accept the principle and the practice that the Commissioners are going to inquire into intentions in a matter of this sort. I should have thought that it was not advisable to have it depend entirely on matters of intention, and that to omit what has been omitted today simply on the strength of that will prove a serious mistake.<br/>
As with so much of this part of the Bill, we get the same thing. Late at night the Government themselves drill an even larger hole than already exists in the sieve which the scheme contemplates. It happens regularly every night. If we went on for a few nights more, it would simply mean that there would be a few more holes in the sieve. The Government then cheerfully say "It will come out all right in the end." I dare say it will, but for whom? Whether it will be for the Revenue or for some of the Government's friends in the City of London, I do not know.</p>

However, that leaves a third, and important, case out of account, namely where the payment or transfer occurs not via the principal company but directly

between subsidiaries. There is, clearly, no reason why that direct transfer should be penalised when the indirect transfer is to be permitted without going through the hoop of United Kingdom Income Tax.

It would seem on the face of it&#x2014;thinking of those companies and of those companies alone, although I appreciate that other considerations may be involved&#x2014;a little illogical and unreasonable that what has been ordinary commercial practice should involve such companies in some difficulties under this Clause.

<p>As my hon. Friend knows, the question here is what falls within the ambit of trading and what within the ambit of investment. Any income


arising from the lending of money would be classified as investment income, and the purpose of these words is merely to make it clear that the income arising from the lending of money is investment income, even when the money is lent without security.</p>

<p>Yes, Sir Gordon.<br/>
These two Amendments are designed, first of all, to give some practical sense to the phrase "recognised market" by giving the Board of Trade, with the consent of the Treasury, power to declare by Order what a recognised market is. If the Committee wants a precedent for that, there is a very rough one in the "recognised stock exchange" defined in the same sort of way in the Prevention of Frauds Act, though, naturally enough, there is no Treasury consent required in that case. The second effect of the two Amendments is that when the Board does declare that, it has to do it in the form of a Statutory Order, and that Order shall be subject to annulment.<br/>
The phrase "recognised market" occurs in Clause 21 (1), and it is highly important in connection with the sale of commodities&#x2014;either, as the Bill originally stood, commodities produced abroad by an overseas trade corporation or, as the Bill now stands, commodities of the kind produced abroad by an overseas trade corporation.<br/>
The object of the reference to a "recognised market" is to limit the sales

here to sales through agents or brokers of a market of that kind in this country, and not to allow an overseas trade corporation to go beyond that and have what one may call some particular selling or some more elaborate selling. I would say at once that I can think of quite a number of instances where there obviously is a recognised market, but I come to all sorts of cases where it is much more doubtful whether there is or is not a recognised market.<br/>
The very large question, of course, is what does "recognised" mean. Does it mean recognised in the trade in question? Does it mean recognised by the general public? Does it mean recognised in some form or another by the tax authorities? If it has the latter meaning, then I cannot see how they have had to consider the question before. Therefore I rather reject that one.<br/>
What is the real object of having a "recognised market" of this kind? It is, as I understand it, to bring the sales into the category of a type of sale made in tolerably large numbers, in tolerably similar conditions, made, perhaps, according to the rules of some trade association, made in some tolerably well-known place, and not up and down the country&#x2014;things of that sort are intended. There are all sorts of difficulties. Take the last point I mentioned. It is true that if one is looking for a particular centre for sales, say, of cotton or tea, one can find it, but if one looked for a particular centre for timber, I think it would be a great deal harder to find it.<br/>
Is there, or is there not, in those circumstances a "recognised market," both for tea and cotton on the one hand, and for timber on the other? Then again, what is the sphere of a "recognised market"? Is it a "recognised market" if it is controlled by one or two concerns and the price is more or less dictated by them&#x2014;altered from time to time, no doubt, in relation to the demand&#x2014;but still very much a one-man matter? Take a metal like copper: what is the position there? The right hon. Gentleman, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, has forgotten more about this than I have ever known, because he has recently been President of the Board of Trade, but I wonder if he would tell us whether or not there is a "recognised market" in copper, and if it is a sort of open market of the kind he wishes to recognise here, or if it is a


matter that is largely regulated by a few large copper producers.<br/>
What about diamonds? I am not in the habit of buying them myself, because I cannot afford to do so, but the right hon. Gentleman is. [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh!".] If it is diamonds that we are considering, is there or is there not a "recognised market"? I have always understood that one goes round to a body called the diamond corporation, or something like that, and that it sells one diamonds. On the other hand, I am told that there are a lot of dealers. I always see a delightful picture of men in bowler hats, walking about in Hatton Garden with little bags carrying diamonds worth millions of pounds. I have never met any of them, and have not been to Hatton Garden very often, and then never for the purpose of business but merely because it happened to be between one place and another, but I should like to know whether there is a "recognised market" in diamonds.<br/>
These overseas trade corporations may have to deal with all kinds of other things, and the picture is altogether fascinating. But this is the distinction that will make a difference to very many of these bodies&#x2014;whether they do or do not get the advantages supposed to be offered them under this part of the Bill. Therefore, it is exceedingly important and, indeed, a vital decision. More than that, it is up to them to do it right, because if they do not, we will have the awful possibility, disclosed to us a short time ago, that they will discover that when they were dealing in toothpicks, or whatever it was, in what they thought was a recognised market, they had in fact been dealing in toothpicks in an unrecognised market, and for that reason for six years past they had been getting an advantage to which they were not entitled. It is not satisfactory that so much should turn on such a vague phrase, and I have come to the conclusion that the Government themselves do not know what they mean by it.<br/>
I suggest that if there is to be any other ground of decision than the convenience of particular people who choose to say that something is a recognised market, the Board finding no particular

reason to deny it, the matter ought not to be decided so much by definition in the Bill&#x2014;I recognise that one cannot properly do that since it is something so changeable and various&#x2014;as by a power in the Board of Trade to decide it. After all, the Board of Trade is the body for this purpose, to say what is or what is not a recognised market.<br/>
I earnestly hope that the right hon. Gentleman the Chancellor will accept the Amendment, and not view with too much horror and suspicion the entry of his old friend the Board of Trade into a Finance Bill. There is, after all, something so august about the Treasury that it really knows nothing, except everything; for that reason, it is better to have the more specialised knowledge of another Department brought to bear upon the matter.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman for moving the Amendment. He has made a very reasonable point. I think that there should be some closer definition of what the term means. We do not want to accept his actual form of words, but we should like to consider the matter further, before Report. It clearly is the duty of the Board of Trade to draw up the list, in consultation, of course, with the Treasury. Whether the device of a Statutory Instrument is rather too ponderous a one, I do not know, but if the hon. and learned Gentleman would be good enough to withdraw the Amendment, we will consider the matter and raise it again on Report.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-06-27a.572.1" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. H. Wilson" colnum="572" time="">
<p>We are all grateful to the right hon. Gentleman the Economic Secretary for what he has just said. This is a very glaring, if minor, gap in the Bill. My hon. and learned Friend has put the arguments, and I need not repeat them. It is very difficult to know in certain marginal cases whether there is a recognised market or not. We know that some markets are simply the result of a number of chaps getting together over the telephone, buying and selling. I imagine that, in most cases, those would be excluded from the list the Government have in mind.<br/>
What we are particularly anxious to ensure, so far as I can see from the Bill, is that there should be a definite and


more or less predetermined price, established by quotations from the market and Press, and all the rest of it, so that there is no possibility of an overseas corporation selling to any associated company at a price which might or might not be a result of the famous "arms' length" business. My hon. and learned Friend did mention one or two special examples. I hope that when we come to the Report stage, the Government spokesman will, in addition to producing an Amendment, give some information on the kind of markets which will be included and those which will be excluded. Copper was mentioned. There is a copper market, of course, and we know that prices are fixed from time to time, a few weeks ahead, by the two principal Rhodesian companies.<br/>
Further, I should be glad if the right hon. Gentleman the Chancellor and his hon. and right hon. Friends would look at the expression "recognised market" in relation to bulk buying. If I am right in assuming that the reason for this is to ensure that the price for the goods is determined quite outside the control of any parent companies at home. it being an ascertainable and independent fixed price, there is, of course, also the matter of bulk buying to be considered. I do not want, certainly at this time of night, to get into an argument about any possible resumption of bulk buying in certain of these commodities, though before very long, I think, the Chancellor will find that he really cannot encourage Commonwealth trade, as I am sure he would like to do, except by a resumption of bulk buying. But, in case that should happen, it should be made quite clear that the term "recognised market" would include a Government or other form of buying agency.<br/>
There is, as far as I know, one commodity which is still bulk bought by the Government in this country, namely jute. Does the jute control constitute a recognised market for the purpose of this Clause? I think that the Government would have to agree that the existence of a jute control fulfils the conditions perfectly. I should be glad if the Chancellor would look at this point and, if necessary, make certain that "recognised market" includes an independent bulk buying authority.<br/>
We welcome the fact that the Chancellor has made this small concession, and if it is the wish of the Committee, we shall be glad to withdraw the Amendment.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 27, line 25, to leave out "more than one half" and to insert "one half or more."
This proposal is not as trivial as it might appear. A subsidiary company is defined in as one of which more than one half of its ordinary share capital is owned by another company. It is the fact that in certain cases local pressures or regulations make it impossible for a company to obtain 51 per cent. or more of its share capital. I think that the words should be "one half or more." It is true that this might mean that a company might be a subsidiary of two parent companies at one and the same time. I do not think that would be of any particular significance in this context, because then any dividends received from the subsidiary company would be trading income in the pockets of both parent companies.<br/>
I hope that the Chancellor will be able to accept the Amendment.</p>

<p>I hesitate to say that I hope the Government will not accept the Amendment, because when I do, they always accept it. Perhaps it would be better not to say anything, but my feelings are sufficiently strong to allow valour on this occasion to outrun prudence.<br/>
I earnestly hope that the Government will not accept the Amendment. When the Committee discussed Clause 32, we agreed that some of the advantages there depended on a subsidiary company really and truly being a subsidiary company, and that it might lead to very dangerous and difficult consequences if one could have a company&#x2014;to take the instance I gave at the time&#x2014;which was owned by three companies together.<br/>
The whole framework of this scheme is so tied up with a subsidiary having its natural mien&#x2014;that of a company owned


and controlled by another company&#x2014;that to open this particular door would be much too dangerous. I hope that the Government will not knock a second large hole in the sieve at this late hour of the night and in this particularly dangerous way.</p>

<p>I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Langstone (Mr. Stevens) appreciates the importance of the definition of a subsidiary company. It is important for two reasons; for the reason mentioned by the hon. and learned Member for Kettering (Mr. Mitchison), that it is essential that there should be real control between the principal and the subsidiary companies, and also because it is essential to ensure that the holding of the principal company in the subsidiary is for trading, and not merely for investment purposes. The definition is, therefore, one which we have to scrutinise very carefully. My hon. Friend has indicated that there may be cases where local requirements would not permit a 51 per cent. holding while they would permit a 50 per cent. holding, though in the circumstances that would give the same degree of practical control and would still be a trading holding as much as if it were 51 per cent.<br/>
My right hon. Friend would like to take the opportunity of the interval between this stage and Report for examining in detail cases of that kind with a view to ascertaining how they might best be met, and I hope my hon. Friend will feel, in view of this assurance, that he would be justified at this stage in withdrawing his Amendment.</p>

<p>If that is going to happen, it just shows the result of allowing valour to outrun discretion. I am sure the Financial Secretary would not have said what he has said if I had not suggested that he should not say it. Now that we are to have that arrangement, we shall have to wait and see what emerges, but I would ask the Financial Secretary at the same time to consider the possibility, for the reason that he himself gave, that in the majority of cases there ought to be more and not less than a 51 per cent. control, and to consider also whether the natural meaning of a subsidiary is not something rather more than bare control when what is required to do is to

differentiate between investment and trading.<br/>
I do not expect the hon. Gentleman to do anything about it. I am just asking him to think a little more. We seriously recognise that he has done a lot of thinking about this Bill; a little more thinking would be very good for him.</p>

<p>I wish to refer to subsection (3) of this Clause and once more to express my regret that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has not been able to agree to an earlier date than 15th May, 1957, for this new scale of gratuities to temporary staffs of the Civil Service which was recommended by the Priestley Commission on the Civil Service in 1955.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman knows that an understanding has been reached on the Civil Service National Whitley Council which would preclude me, as Chairman of the Staff Side of the Whitley Council, from moving any Amendment to the Bill in Committee without a breach of that understanding. That, however, would not have precluded any of my hon. Friends doing so had they wished, but we have tried to keep to that understanding and I am not doing any more than expressing regret that the right hon. Gentleman was not able to do something more generous in this matter of the effective date.<br/>
Since the Bill has been before the House, I have received many letters from ex-temporary civil servants who have been discharged in recent months and who are bitterly disappointed that they are not brought within the scope of the Bill. They naturally looked for

ward, when they saw the recommendations of the Royal Commission in the autumn of 1955, to an early implementation of those recommendations. They understood, not with complete accuracy, that all the recommendations of the Priestley Commission were in one package and were being adopted comprehensively and as a whole. But those of us who were close to these negotiations understood the distinction, which might he merely technical or real, between those recommendations of the Commission which it was within the power of the Treasury to apply without legislation and those which required this Bill to give effect to them.<br/>
There is no more to be said. We either do a thing or we do not in a matter of this kind. There is no close argument to be used as to why there should be an earlier effective date than a later one It just is the fact that the recommendations were made when they were, and it is regrettable that they were not given earlier effect. I acknowledge, however&#x2014;I want to be quite fair to the right hon. Gentleman the Chancellor; we have full confidence in his fairness in these matters&#x2014;that the Bill has come somewhat earlier than his predecessor gave us to understand might be the case, and we are grateful that he has found time to bring the Bill forward this Session and to ask the House to deal with it.<br/>
I think that that is a fair acknowledgment of the fact that we have the Bill before us tonight. To that extent, probably, the recommendations of the Commission are beginning earlier than they would have done if the Bill had been introduced later, and certainly earlier, probably, than if the Bill had been introduced in the next Session. I know the wretched administrative difficulties that dog one in all these matters, whether in reforms or otherwise.<br/>
I know the difficulty of going back and finding people who have left and of going into their entitlement to these gratuities after they have departed, but a measure of retrospection to the date of the Commission's actual Report or thereabouts would not have provided half the difficulty which we have had in trying to deal fairly with people who have gone out of the Civil Service in the past. I do not wish to detain the Committee a moment longer. I have put


this on the record. We shall certainly co-operate in completing the passage of the Bill through the House at the earliest possible moment.</p>
