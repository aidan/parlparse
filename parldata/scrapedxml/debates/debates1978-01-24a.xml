<p>I think it would be premature of me to try to give my hon. Friend an estimate of total costs at this stage. Several legal claims are involved, and it is far too early to make an assessment of their outcome. As to where the ultimate burden of the cost would fall, we would expect to be able to reclaim our extra costs from the civil Depart-

ments where it is reasonable and fair to do so.<br/>
As my hon. Friend will recognise, the future of the "green goddesses" is a matter for the Home Secretary, but I understand that they are not now to be disposed of as was originally intended.</p>

I do not think that we should let any occasion go by without expressing the gratitude of the House and the country as a whole. My right hon. Friend has done that on more than one occasion.

<p>I am obliged to the hon. Gentleman for raising the question. It is a matter which has given us concern because of the impact on the individual men involved.

suffer as a result of their participation in this activity.</p>

<p>The defence budget estimates for 1978&#x2013;79 which will shortly be presented to the House will represent about 4&#x00BE; per cent. of estimated gross domestic product at market prices, compared with the 5 per cent. in last year's Statement on the Defence Estimates for 1977&#x2013;78.<br/>
The Government have decided to increase the defence budget by 3 per cent. in real terms in 1979&#x2013;80 over the revalued Cmnd. 6721 figure for 1978&#x2013;79 and by a further 3 per cent. in 1980&#x2013;81, subject in the latter case to review in the light of our economic circumstances. No decisions have been taken about subsequent years. Defence took its full share of the public expenditure cuts in 1976. Now that our economic prospects are improving, it is right that we should plan to contribute to the increase in NATO defence effort made necessary by the marked and continuing growth of Warsaw Pact military power.</p>

<p>My right hon. Friend is to be congratulated on the reduction to 4&#x00B7;75 per cent. which he has announced today. Does not the increase of 3 per cent. per annum again raise the percentage of our gross national product which we are spending? If that is so, are we not moving in a direction exactly opposite to that which we promised in our manifesto at the last General Election?</p>

<p>No. It should not be thought that 3 per cent. on total defence expenditure in real terms is 3 per cent. on the share of the gross domestic product. Of course, one has to make estimates of the growth of the economy because the percentage of defence expenditure of GDP depends on two factors&#x2014;on defence expenditure on the one hand and on the economic state of the nation on the other. On the estimates that we have, the increased 3 per cent. will leave the figure roughly at 4&#x00BE; per cent.</p>

<p>Does my right hon. Friend accept that, if we were to have exactly cur equal proportion in relation to defence expenditure, it would release &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;8 billion, which could be far better used on the health, education and social services of the nation?</p>

<p>It would not be practicable to reduce the amount by the size that my hon. Friend suggests. It is worth pointing out that over the last five years defence expenditure in real terms has fallen by 4 per cent. while civil programmes have increased by 6&#x00BD; per cent.</p>

<p>The fact is that substantial reductions in defence have been made, as I have indicated. Some quarters have argued that too great a reduction has been made. My hon. Friend will know that from the long-term defence expenditure plans which we inherited very substantial reductions have been made. We have already moved from the position of around 5&#x00BC; per cent. of GDP to 4&#x00BE; per cent., and, as I have indicated, the other side of the equation was that in 1974 we perhaps did not anticipate the extent of the economic crisis that we inherited or the length and depth of the world recession which has been a continuing problem since then.</p>

<p>As I think the hon. and gallant Gentleman knows, the practice of the House under successive Governments, not only in defence but in all aspects of public expenditure, is to allow for pay and price increases additional to the Estimates.

have had to be placed in previous years on pay increases for the Forces. They have come directly from pay policy decisions.</p>

<p>The exceptional ability of the hon. Member for Stretford (Mr. Churchill) to exaggerate tends to cause him to use language which perhaps overstates the case. The main reason why

<p>I think that it would be unfair for them to criticise the Review Body, because it was not possible, in its view, to give detailed figures last year. I am sure the hon. Lady appreciates that the discrepancies will vary quite substantially as between different ranks and different trades. It is only by a comparison of the civil earnings of counterparts of Service men that we can learn the extent to which they have fallen behind. For that reason, average earnings could give a misleading picture.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Chingford (Mr. Tebbit) should cease to be the right hon. Lady's lapdog.<br/>
I have had a number of inquiries made into this matter. There have been specific examples of shortages of skilled men, but the result of the last inquiries that I made, which were literally only a week ago and were conducted on a pretty broad basis, is that, generally speaking, although there are specific shortages in a few areas, there is no overall shortage of skilled men. The Government's training programme&#x2014;the largest such programme ever undertaken&#x2014;is overhauling any specific shortages. That is one reason why the economy must be allowed to expand at a steady rate and not get into the spasm that we had during the early 1970's when we had the boom and bust. That is what I am determined to resist.</p>

<p>Is the Prime Minister aware that, if our problems are deep-seated, one reason is that the Labour

<p>I do not want to go as far as that at the present time. [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."] We must pay some regard to the views of the Premier, as well as the Opposition, in Belize about its future. Therefore, it would be improper for the House of Commons to make a declaration on anything connected with this matter, except to say, as I have done and I repeat, that we want the agreement of the people of Belize before we take any action.<br/>
The problem is very difficult and it is right that the Government should attempt to solve it. Belize wants independence. If it became independent without a guaranteed border and a proper peace treaty with Guatemala, in view of the disparate size of the two countries Belize would be in great trouble.<br/>
Our objective is to try to bring that country to full independence as soon as we can in conditions that will guarantee its future. The Premier of Belize and his colleagues must consider and take their decision on those conditions. Clearly, it would be difficult to ask the House or the country to assume responsibility for the defence of Belize after it became independent. Therefore, we must try to secure its frontiers before it becomes independent.</p>

<p>It is true that the decisions taken by the trade unions and their members over the past three years, including the 12-month rule that they voluntarily adopted this year, have helped to reduce inflation substantially, but have reduced the standard of life. I am glad to say that in the fourth quarter of 1977 the standard of life of the British people, for the first time for some time&#x2014;[<i>Interruption.</i>]&#x2014;since 1975&#x2014;began to improve and will continue to improve. That will continue during 1978, so I shall certainly take the opportunity of spelling it out on every occasion.<br/>
We all know what the Tory attitude is. Indeed, I was wondering this morning whether I could possibly devise, in addition to the retail price index, the TPI&#x2014;or Tory Party index&#x2014;to be published every month to indicate the result of the Tory Party's vote last night.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I wish to raise a matter concerning the consideration by the House of European Economic Community documents. The Scrutiny Committee on European legislation recommended some time ago that the House should discuss, amongst other documents, Document R/2461/75&#x2014;a report on an action programme for the aeronautical sector. On the Order Paper last night there was an order which enabled a discussion to take place.<br/>
However, the document concerned is entitled "A Commission Report to the Council on an Action Programme for the European Aeronautical Sector", whereas, according to the Order Paper, we were to discuss developments in the EEC civil aircraft sector on a motion in the name of the Prime Minister:
<q>That this House takes note of developments in the EEC Civil Aircraft sector as outlined in the Government's memorandum of 17th January 1978".</q>
You will have noticed, Mr. Speaker, the difference between the two matters. The document from the Community was on the whole of the aeronautical sector. The discussion last night on the Government's motion was on the civil sector. Hence, the Chair ruled that it was out of order to discuss any matters concerning military aviation. If one looks at the document from the Community one finds that pages 7 and 8 in particular and pages 6 and 7 of Annex 1 deal specifically with the military sector. In particular, there is a proposal to set up a European common procurement agency for military aircraft. [<i>Interruption.</i>] If the Liberals could go back to Blackpool for their discussion, I should be most grateful.<br/>
My point is that this sets a precedent by which the Government decide which parts of a European document should be discussed when the Scrutiny Committee has recommended that the whole of a document should be discussed. I should therefore be grateful for your advice, Mr. Speaker. Perhaps you might ask the Scrutiny Committee to reconsider how we should proceed and whether it would be proper to have a further discussion on this document so that we might cover


those matters which were ruled out of order last night.</p>

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker. Although the Chair has absolutely no control over what motion the Government choose to table, I suggest that the Chair might consider using its power not to put the Question at the conclusion of the debate, on the ground that the matter has been inadequately discussed, as a means of showing its disapproval of the Government endeavouring to restrict discussion on a document which a Committee of the House has suggested should be discussed <i>in toto.</i></p>

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker. Perhaps it would be as well if you ensured that others looked at the whole area of documents from the Common Market. Not only did we have this unsatisfactory state of affairs last night, but last week the Minister came to the Dispatch Box armed with certain documents. He did not know whether they came from the Commission or the Council. A debate took place for about one hour until approximately midnight, until my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing), who watches these matters closely&#x2014;and even he missed the mistake until the debate had continued for an hour&#x2014;found that the documents were false. Some of us, not including the two hon. Members who have just spoken, predicted that this situation might arise when Britain voted to go into the Common Market.<br/>
This whole matter should be examined to ensure that our affairs are conducted in a more satisfactory manner. But this can never be cleared up entirely until we get out of the Common Market.</p>

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker. My hon. Friend the Member for Chingford (Mr. Tebbit) argued that the documents in question covered both civil and military aviation. From my own experience at the old Ministry of Aviation I can assure him that it is impossible to separate the two aspects of aviation. For example, the engine that powers Concorde today was originally designed for the TSR2. This situation occurs in one project after another. One cannot separate one from the other. It is 
illogical to try to limit a debate to one or other of the two aspects.</p>

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker. I took part in the debate last night and it would be wrong for the House to get the impression that these documents were fully considered. The Chair had no alternative but to rule out of order debate on at least half of the documents.</p>

<p>I am deeply grateful to the hon. Member for Chingford (Mr. Tebbit) for his courtesy in giving me notice that he wished to raise this point of order. If I had been in the Deputy Speaker's shoes last night I should have ruled exactly as he did. He was entirely right in his ruling. He was bound by the title of the motion which was before the House.<br/>
I have listened with great care to points of order from both sides of the House. I understand the feelings of hon. Members on the whole question of these documents. Naturally I shall give consideration to what has been said, but I give no undertaking to make a statement.<br/>
The matter raised by the hon. Member for Chingford is not a matter for me. It is one for the Government, who will no doubt take into consideration what he and other hon. Members have said when bringing forward any further motions of this sort for discussion.</p>

<p>Further to the point of order, Mr. Speaker. Surely the fault last night lay not with the Chair but with the Government's motion. Surely that raises the point that if the Government are to be at liberty to exclude by their motion certain substantial issues contained in a document which the Scrutiny Committee has brought before the House, they would be breaching their basic undertaking not to allow matters to be decided in the EEC until this House has debated them. Therefore, should we not have an assurance from the Government that this device will not be used again?</p>

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker. If I recall the motion correctly, it referred explicity to the documents which the House was seeking to discuss, including the documents to which the hon. Member for Chingford (Mr. Tebbit) has referred. Does your ruling imply that if, in tabling a motion,


the Government refer quite correctly to the documents but do not spell out the precise titles of every one, the motion in some way becomes faulty?</p>

<p>Further to the point of order, Mr. Speaker. I fully accept that the Chair was correct in its ruling last night and was bound entirely by what was on the Order Paper. On the other hand, there are two long-standing traditions in this House. One is that the Leader of the House affords some protection to Back Benchers&#x2014;and that is a tradition that we can now forget entirely. The hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Heffer) knows that is true and he said so last week&#x2014;</p>

<p>I shall not speculate on the possibility of a non-aggression pact with the hon. Gentleman.<br/>
The other long-standing tradition is that you, Mr. Speaker, protect the House against the monarchy, the collective monarchy, the Executive, or anyone else who tries to usurp our power or throttle discussion, even by the use of the Order Paper in the manner adopted last night. It was clear that a Select Committee of this House recommended that the document should be discussed. Equally clearly, that has not been done. I suggest that there is a role here for the Chair in ensuring that what the Select Committee says should be done is in fact done.</p>

<p>As one who spoke last night in the debate and, I hope, kept within the rules of order as stated by the Chair, I feel that the basic problem is that for the full title of certain documents, especially those emanating from the EEC, to be set out might lead to a sentence of intolerable length. The problem for the Back Bencher is, I suggest, something on which you might exercise your mind, Mr. Speaker, and perhaps make a statement and give guidance at a later date. The problem concerns the extent to which the Chair can look at the content of the document and then allow the debate to continue relevant to that content.</p>

<p>Further to that point of

order, Mr. Speaker. In view of your ruling, the Government will look at the matter and see whether we should make a statement to the House on how best we should proceed. Hon. Members who have attended our numerous debates about how we seek to carry out the recommendations of the Scrutiny Committee will confirm I am sure, that we have sought to do so. The Committee itself has confirmed that on a number of occasions. In many respects we are seeking to deal with new matters and new difficulties often arise. But I will look into the matter in view of your ruling, Mr. Speaker, to see whether we can assist the House further in that.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. It concerns something which I think will be of great interest to the entire House and it relates to tomorrow's business. I understand that no request has been made to you by my right hon. Friend the Lord President for any statement to be made today about a very important addition which is likely to be made to tomorrow's business.<br/>
I believe that the House would wish to know now of this addition to the business, which is to be considered tomorrow if present plans go forward. This will be business in the House, not in Committee, and it will concern alteration of the timetable motion on the Scotland Bill in order to divide up tomorrow's session in Committee into three sections. I must not go into the substance of that or protest about it at this stage, but it is extremely important that the House should know that it is coming up. If we are not told now, hon. Members will know nothing of it until they see tomorrow's Order Paper. I therefore ask you and, through you, Mr. Speaker, the Lord President, whether we may be told of the motion which it is proposed should be tabled.<br/>
It could be that an amendment which might otherwise have passed, and I believe has a good chance of doing so, and which is designed not to kill devolution but to give effect to the assertions of many hon. Members that the overwhelming majority of the Scottish people want devolution, would be prevented from being debated and voted upon. If new business is being added to tomorrow's Order Paper the Lord President should not wait for us to catch sight of it by accident on the Order Paper tomorrow.

Am I right in thinking that any time taken upon that motion would come out of whatever abbreviated allocation of time might be brought about by that motion for a clause of enormous importance&#x2014;the referendum clause&#x2014;in the Scotland Bill?</p>

<p>I beg to move,
<q>That leave be given to bring in a Bill to amend the Hairdressers (Registration) Act 1964.</q>
Many right hon. and hon. Members with knowledge and seniority far greater than mine will recall that a former Conservative Member for Battersea, South, Mr. Ernest Partridge, piloted through the House in the 1963&#x2013;64 Session of Parliament a Private Members' Bill which led to the establishment of the Hairdressing Council, with the added requirement that it should establish a register of qualified hairdressers and set up suitable training courses and qualifications for those wishing to enter the craft.<br/>
It was the original intention of that measure that all future entrants should be required successfully to complete an approved training course before setting up in business. Unfortunately, that mandatory aspect of the original Clause 3 of the Bill of 1964 was withdrawn by the promoter, since it was felt by some right hon. and hon. Members at the time, some of whom are still here, as well as by Ministers, I believe, to be unduly restrictive of the rights of the individual.<br/>
Fourteen years have elapsed since the passing of the Act, and experience gained in that time has convinced the Hairdressing Council&#x2014;of which both the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, North-East (Mrs. Short) and I are members&#x2014;I declare that interest&#x2014;and has convinced nearly everyone else in the hairdressing trade to whom I have spoken&#x2014;I am sure that many hon. Members have received letters on the subject&#x2014;of the need to rectify the situation.<br/>
There have, unhappily, been too many cases of non-registered inexperienced operators using chemicals and other substances of which they have no real practical knowledge, with quite disastrous results. Some of these cases have been amply reported in the Press, and all of them have reflected badly on the 20,000 or so registered operators in the trade.<br/>
The Hairdressing Council, can, I believe, be said to be doing a first-class job in improving standards. That is a

fact which seems to be readily acknowledged by hon. Members on both sides. The right hon. Lady the Leader of the Opposition has attended the annual Student of the Year Award, as has the right hon. Lady the Member for Blackburn (Mrs. Castle), as well as my right hon. Friend the Leader of my party, the Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Mr. Steel).<br/>
I believe it to be true that the Hairdressing Council has performed a very useful role, but it is powerless to act in such cases as those to which I have referred. Serious skin diseases which, if treated properly, can be cured or at least contained, are sometimes not recognised and in the worst cases can be transmitted to other customers.<br/>
Over the past 15 years, there has been an enormous boom in the whole hairdressing business, especially on the ladies' side&#x2014;often to our own cost! To meet the demand, two-year courses have been established at no fewer than 150 local education authority technical colleges and colleges of further education throughout the country. Several high-class salons of world repute now run their own extensive apprenticeship courses. Vast sums of public money are being expended to ensure that those entering the trade have a thorough knowledge of their subject.<br/>
It therefore seems ridiculous not to give those people and the general public who use their services in vast numbers the protection from the inexperienced operator which they should surely have.<br/>
I urge that it is time that we joined most of our partners in the EEC as well as our colleagues in the United States of America and most Western countries and put our house in order, giving, incidentally at the same time, some protection to registered established hairdressers.<br/>
My Bill will be designed to cover five main points. First, all entrants should be required to take an approved course of training. Second, on completion of the course, they will be required to pass an approved examination or to have been assessed as satisfactory by their course tutors.<br/>
Third, registration in the statutory register of hairdressers on successful completion of training should be mandatory. Fourth, all persons wishing to open a hairdressing salon and to employ and


train staff and apprentices should be required to possess a master craftsmen's diploma or to employ a manager who possesses such a diploma. Fifth, all those teaching at technical colleges or colleges of further education should hold the master craftsman's diploma.<br/>
The Farriers Registration Act, which was passed by the House in two stages last year and the year before, now rightly requires people who shoe horses to be properly qualified. Surely it is time that we applied a similar criterion to those who treat our hair. Major organisations representing both employers' and employees' interests support the need for this legislation, and I trust that the House will do the same.</p>

<p>I am not myself an advertisement for the craft which is the subject of the Bill, but many and various are the invisible earnings of the City of London and Westminster, South. The Department of Trade includes hairdressing as an invisible earning. The placid and sensible motion introduced with sweet reasonableness by the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Ross) conceals turbulent eddies of disunited opinion within the craft. If anybody doubts this, I ask him to consider why it has taken 14 years for this matter to be brought back to the House.<br/>
Of the 15 members of the Hairdressing Council who were appointed under the 1964 Act to which the hon. Member referred, two were appointed by the National Hairdressers Federation and two by the Incorporated Guild of Hairdressers, Wigmakers and Perfumers. The hon. Member for Isle of Wight, as a member of the Hairdressing Council, will be aware that there has not always been sweetness and light between those two bodies during the past 14 years. The guild, in its open forum of September 1976, made a commendable effort to bring the whole craft together, but the National Hairdressers Federation would not attend on that occasion.<br/>
Outside the two bodies of the guild and the federation are the commercial schools, which are often part of a chain of hairdressing salons. These schools are not riding on the back of the two bodies to which I have referred, since

registered hairdressers everywhere contribute to the funds and finances of the Hairdressing Council. The best of these schools are among the leaders of the craft in the world.<br/>
It should be a matter of pride to the House that, though in past years the centre of this craft world-wide has been either in Paris or in Germany, and it has been Frenchmen and Germans who have carried off the prizes at international competitions, those prizes are now won by citizens of the United Kingdom, and the United Kingdom has become the centre of this craft. The majority of the winners of those prizes come from the commercial schools to which I have just referred.<br/>
In the trailer to this Bill in the House magazine, the hon. Member mentioned our wives. The names that our wives would recognise as the good and great of this craft are those that come from the commercial schools. The World Federation of Supreme Hairdressing Schools, which operates in 20 countries with its headquarters in Rotterdam, has one member school in each country. It used to have eight in this country but now has four. That itself is an indication of the importance of these schools world-wide. It is significant that it was the schools themselves that pruned their numbers from eight to four.<br/>
In terms of the schools' role and the relationship of the schools to the rest of the craft, in 1974 as many as 1,000 students came in from the State colleges to attend a teach-in at one of the commercial schools. There are sessions held on Sundays at these commercial schools at the request of teachers and students from the State schools in order not to interfere with the State schools' curriculum. The Training Services Agency makes use of the commercial schools for its TOPS programme.<br/>
Some 75 per cent. of the students, at least of the schools in central London, come from abroad, wherein lies the problem. If the United Kingdom represents the centre and cream of the craft, and if the commercial schools contribute to that cream, why should not these schools and their qualifications be included in the registration? Other crafts and trades have approved private enterprise training and retraining. Why should not hairdressing do the same?<br/>
First, the guild to which I referred recognises and approves the schools about which I am talking. But, second, the commercial schools approached the Hairdressing Council several years ago and asked it whether its examination would be acceptable as a qualification. The Hairdressing Council accepted it, thanked them and said that it would let them know. Nothing has been heard since.<br/>
The schools, 18 months ago, invited the National Hairdressers Federation to send two inspectors to have a look at the schools, and the schools said "If our standards are inadequate, of course we shall reform and revise them." The inspectors accepted the invitation. They came to look at the schools. They said that they would report back. Again, nothing has been heard from that day to this.<br/>
To be fair, there is a basis for disagreement. The Hairdressing Council would like to see a two-year full-time course or a three-year apprenticeship as the qualification for registration. The schools' course lasts seven and a half months and is, of course, more concentrated. It lasts 1,000 hours. The hon. Member for Isle of Wight referred to the European experience. I should advise the House that 1,000 hours or thereabouts is the length of time required for registration in the various individual states of the United States of America, which has seperate regulations for each state. The time spent in private schools in the United States is counted towards those 1,000 hours.<br/>
The Hairdressing Council feels that the course should be protracted rather than concentrated and that time plays a rose in the training of hairdressers. I am in no position to argue this academic point. The critics of the State scheme point out that, being two-thirds theory and one-third practical, there is too much theory.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-01-24a.1192.0" colnum="1192" time="">
<p>They say that a shorter, more practical course would achieve better results because students become bored with the amount of theory that they have to absorb.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-01-24a.1192.1" colnum="1192" time="">
<p>I am reluctant to oppose this Bill because the aims concerning general registration and the master craftsman diploma are those which the commercial schools themselves applaud and approve, and they should commend themselves to the commonsense of the House. But the inclusion of the commercial schools and their qualifications, given their standing, frankly, should also commend itself to the commonsense of the House.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-01-24a.1192.2" colnum="1192" time="">
<p>In all the 14 years since the Act was passed, the Hairdressing Council has done little to bring the commercial schools into the general fraternity of the craft. They have done nothing significant, in advance of the hon. Gentleman giving notice of the Bill this afternoon, to reach a compromise agreement on the qualifications that they offer.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-01-24a.1192.3" colnum="1192" time="">
<p>If the hon. Gentleman would take his Bill away and reach agreement with the commercial schools, I should be happy to withdraw any opposition of mine. Indeed, if he would have my name on the Bill, I would be glad to give it. But, given the experience of the commercial schools during the past 14 years, I do not blame them for not giving the benefit of the doubt to the Hairdressing Council. Therefore, I feel obliged to oppose this Bill.</p>

<p>On a point of order, of which I have given you notice, Mr. Murton. You have very helpfully had posted on the board your selection for tomorrow's amendments. May I ask you to reconsider your decision not to allow Amendment No. 556, in Clause 82, page 37, line 39, at end insert
<q>'but in the event of a General Election being announced before the holding of such referendum the latter shall not take place until a period of not less than three months from the polling date of the Election has elapsed'.</q>
The political editor of <i>The Times,</i> Fred Emery, wrote on 14th January:
<q>Consideration is also being given to having election and referendum on the same day.</q>
There may be many hon. Members on both sides of the Committee who want to give an opinion on what would be a totally new feature of British government&#x2014;the notion of a referendum and election on the same day. Further, should the referendum be scrambled up with a General Election, many people would not be voting on the merits or otherwise of 150 Assemblymen or Assemblywomen in Edinburgh but would naturally react to party loyalties.<br/>
The Government may care to give a categorical assurance that they would never contemplate such a thing as having an election and referendum on the same day, but in the absence of any such undertaking, I ask you to reconsider the amendment for selection, Mr. Murton.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving me notice of his point of order.<br/>
When I considered the amendment, it seemed to me that its substance would

more appropriately be placed in Schedule 17 than in Clause 82. Therefore, I felt that on balance it was out of order as being offered at a wrong place in the Bill. Reference to that point is to be found on page 523 in "Erskine May".<br/>
However, I understand that the hon. Gentleman received some advice from the authorities of the House about the terms of his amendment, and it may well be that his wishes regarding its position in the Bill were not completely understood.<br/>
I would point out to the hon. Gentleman that Schedule 17 does not fall to be considered by the Committee until tomorrow. Although in general I am disinclined to select starred amendments, I think that I can assure the hon. Gentleman that in the circumstances I would not rule out on that ground alone, an orderly amendment in the right place.</p>

<p>The point that I was going to raise, Mr. Murton, I would have raised in any case, but it is particularly appropriate following the point of order of my hon. Friend the Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell).<br/>
You have already posted your provisional selection of amendments for tomorrow, Mr. Murton, and you did so at a time when the arrangement of the business tomorrow was as provided for in a previous business motion. You will have heard the exchanges in the House before we went into Committee, from which it is clear that there will be a proposal to alter the business tomorrow, cutting it up into different short sections.<br/>
I do not seek any answer now, Mr. Murton, and I think that it would be improper for you to give me one now. but I put it to you that if there is an alteration of the guillotined sections you would be entitled and almost obliged at least to reconsider your selection of amendments, because the time available for the consideration of amendments is one of the


factors that you must take into account in deciding whether to select an amendment.<br/>

<p>I beg to move Amendment No. 602, in page 30, line 13, leave out 'accordingly' and insert:
<q>'subject to the consent and approval of the Minister for the Civil Service and subject to such conditions as he may from time to time impose'.</q>
The amendment is of great importance, because it seeks to ensure, in a way that the Bill does not, that no separate Civil Service is created owing loyalties exclusively to a devolved Scottish Government, and controlled by them, and that all civil servants, whether working for the Scottish Executive, the Scottish Office or another United Kingdom Department, are clearly members of a service operating as a United Kingdom service, with appointments to it and within it made by the United Kingdom Government, subject to conditions determined by the United Kingdom Government.<br/>
One of our fundamental objections to the Bill is that the creation of a separate Government for Scotland, and not merely an elected Assembly, puts at risk the maintenance of the United Kingdom. The attempt to create a separate Executive within a unitary State is an attempt to square the circle. The tremendous strains imposed upon the whole structure of the government of the United Kingdom brought about by the creation of a system of devolution of the kind set out in the Bill is nowhere made clearer than in the role of the Civil Service if and when a Scottish Executive, as well as a Scottish Assembly, is set up. The basic question can be summed up very simply: whose Civil Service will it be and who will control it?<br/>
There are two alternative approaches if one starts out on the road of setting up

an Executive for Scotland. The first, and in some ways the most logical, is to say "If we are having a Scottish Executive which is responsible to the Scottish Assembly, dependent on a majority in the Assembly for its existence, it is right that those who carry out the Executive's policy&#x2014;the civil servants&#x2014;should constitute a separate Civil Service for Scotland. That would be a logical resolution of the dilemma, but it has not been chosen by the Government. At least, they pretend that it has not.<br/>
I suggest that there are two reasons why that approach has not been followed. First, the Civil Service would loathe that solution. It would not like the creation of a separate Civil Service for Scotland, which would impose upon it the difficult choice of deciding where its allegiances lay.<br/>
Secondly&#x2014;and I suspect that, sensitive as the Government are to the feelings of the Civil Service, this reason has been dominant in the decision&#x2014;by creating overtly, clearly and expressly a separate Civil Service the Government would be taking a clear step on the path towards separation. With the creation of not only a separate Assembly and separate political Executive but a separate Civil Service, all the machinery, the infrastructure, of a separate Scottish State would be ready-made, available and at the disposal of Scotland. All that would be necessary would be a simple cut of the knot between the United Kingdom and Scotland for that separate Scottish State to come into existence. Therefore, the Government, claiming as they do that they believe in devolution and not in separatism, have eschewed that path, in form at least.<br/>
The alternative that the Government believe in, as they have told us in previous debates on the Scottish Executive, is set out in the Bill. It is a single Civil Service serving both the Secretary of State for Scotland and a Scottish Executive, presumably with a common system of entrance, a common promotion ladder and a single system of switching about from one section of the Civil Service to the other. That is what the Government's path purports to be. It is easy to state that in theory.<br/>
The purpose of this amendment is to illustrate, and to attempt to rectify, the fact that this solution of the problem of


the loyalties of the Civil Service is full of unresolved questions and that in practice it consists of a series of extremely nasty and sharp hidden rocks which the Government seek to obscure with a few bland, legislative words.<br/>
The realities of the situation keep creeping out. Given the unacceptable choices posed concerning what r&#x00F4;le the Civil Service should perform, we certainly prefer, if it were possible, that there should continue to be as a single Civil Service, loyal to the Assembly, the Executive and to the United Kingdom Government. I say, frankly, that I am doubtful whether the tremendous strains that would be imposed on such a Civil Service would make for a practicable and viable operation. At least let us make the necessary amendment to ensure that the Government's preferred solution, or the solution that the Government pretend to prefer, has some air of reality instead of being expressed in such gossamer-like threads which are obviously liable to break at the first strain.<br/>
As the Bill stands, there is nominally a single Civil Service. In practice, it would be all too easy for a separate Civil Service to be built up with a loyalty to the Scottish Executive which would be the obvious precursor to the creation of an independent, separate Scottish State. This is not a purely theoretical question because the numbers are pretty considerable. If the Bill is to be believed, we are talking about a staff of 240 for the Scottish Assembly and 750 extra civil servants. Some of us have great doubts about the accuracy of those figures and suspect that when it comes to it there will be rather more than that. But if the Government are to be taken at face value, it is a question of 240 extra staff for the Assembly and 750 extra civil servants.<br/>
At the moment we are loftily told by the Government that the Scotland Bill does not involve the creation of an extra tier of government. All suggestions that it does anything of the kind are treated as woeful distortions of the Government's intentions. This is not an extra tier of government, we are told. It is a question of the transfer of powers from central Government to a Scottish Assembly and Executive. We are told that this is not a question of local government reform. That can only mean a tremendous amount

of duplication, with the Scottish Executive doing the work and the Scottish Office providing in large part&#x2014;except for those few non-devolved functions&#x2014;a team of "shadow" civil servants making sure that the real civil servants with the Scottish Executive behave themselves and do not exceed their powers. If ever there was a recipe for conflict it lies in the creation of this dual structure which provides a conflict that is not just latent but patent.<br/>
If we examine this position a little further, the problem becomes even clearer. Clause 21 (3) says:
<q>Such of Her Majesty's prerogative and other executive powers as would otherwise be exercisable on behalf of Her Majesty by a Minister of the Crown shall, if they relate to devolved matters and are exercisable in or as regards Scotland, be exercisable on behalf of Her Majesty by a Scottish Secretary.</q>
That is the clear creation of executive devolution. If we examine Clause 21 (9). we find that:
<q>A Scottish Secretary may appoint such officers and servants as he may think appropriate for the exercise of such of the powers mentioned in subsection (3) of this section as are for the time being exercised by him.</q>
The Scottish Secretary is given the right to appoint officers and servants whom he thinks appropriate. Presumably not only does he appoint whom he likes, but if we read Clause 21(9), he decides how many people, and of what kind, are appropriate for that purpose. Those officers and servants are then by definition acting under him and are his agents.<br/>
That is the part of the Bill that is meant to be read by the devolutionists. But, as always, this Bill is two-faced. That is the bit for the people who want devolution. For the people who are not so keen on it, the non-devolutionist bit of the Bill comes in Clause 64, which we are now debating, conveniently separated by 43 clauses from that earlier clause, so that those who are not so keen on devolution might, with a bit of luck, forget what appeared in Clause 21.<br/>
In Clause 64, we are told, on the face of it, that:
<q>Service as an officer or servant of a Scottish Secretary or of the Scottish Comptroller and Auditor General shall be service in the home civil service of the state, and appointments to any position as such an officer or servant shall be made accordingly;</q>


What does that word "accordingly" mean? How does that square with the statement in Clause 21(9) that:
<q>A Scottish Secretary may appoint such officers and servants as he may think appropriate"?</q>
Does "accordingly" mean that, in spite of what Clause 21 says, the Scottish Secretary will be bound by the rules of the Civil Service, and he cannot have whom he wants, when he wants, and cannot pay them what he wants? Who is to do the appointing? If the idea is that the hierarchial structure of careers and appointments in the Civil Service generally is to be maintained, in spite of Clause 21(9), that is entirely dependent on the meaning to be given to the word "accordingly". Everything depends on that word.<br/>
In my submission the Committee will not be satisfied that the word "accordingly" is sufficient to do the trick. The problems are real. Will "accordingly" be sufficient to stop the Scottish Secretary exercising the powers that appear to be given to him by Clause 27(9) to choose whom he likes? As the hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) has often said, the key position in many ways is that of the permanent undersecretary to the Scottish Office. What will he do? Will he stay in the Scottish Office or go and work for the new Scottish Executive? Apart from his personal preferences, who is to decide? Will that be a personal decision on his part? Does he have to go where the head of the Home Civil Service tells him, or may the Scottish Secretary refer to Clause 21(9), which says:
<q>A Scottish Secretary may appoint such officers and servants as he may think appropriate</q>
and say "I want that man"? If that man is prepared to go, is that an end to it? It will not do to say that the word "accordingly" determines that everything would be service in the Home Service of the state and that that solves everything.</p>

<p>It would create great difficulty, even for the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, if it had to rule on such a matter&#x2014;as it might. In relation to the permanent undersecretary, can the hon. Member imagine a situation where a permanent secretary could, even if he wanted, opt for any-

thing other than the Prime Minister of Scotland's service?</p>

<p>I will not join the hon. Gentleman in his speculation of what the permanent under-secretary might do. That seems to be almost as difficult a question to answer as his first point about what the Judicial Committee would make of these two clauses. It seems to me to be an insoluble problem. There is not only the question of what the permanent under-secretary would do. Who is to decide the pay? What about the questions of transferability? Are they to be decided by the head of the Home Civil Service or by the Scottish Secretary?<br/>
This is typical of the whole approach of the Bill, and the point I stress to the Committee is that this is very much more than a question of inadequacy of drafting. I should not have taken up so much time if it were just that. The problem of loyalty is very real. What happens if a civil servant who is, for the time being, working for the Scottish Executive, is required to give information by the Secretary of State as to the operations of the Scottish Secretary? Does he then have to provide it, and does he have to provide it in the form dictated by the Scottish Secretary, or can he be required to do what the Secretary of State says because it is an appointment made by the Home Civil Service of the State?<br/>
These are very real and unresolved questions. It may be said that there are often interdepartmental disputes within United Kingdom Government Departments. There may be a civil servant who has loyalty to the Treasury and another civil servant who has loyalty to the Department of Education and Science or to the Department of the Environment, and there may be a dispute between the two. But that goes to illustrate the difference between what happens within the United Kingdom and what is proposed here.<br/>
If there is a conflict of loyalty between different Government Departments in the United Kingdom, there is clearly a machinery for resolving any dispute. At the end of the day there is one hierarchy, both administratively and politically. Administratively it leads to the apex of the permanent head of the Civil Service, and politically it leads to the Prime Minister. If the disagreement or dispute is


sufficiently important, it is resolved at that level.<br/>
Here an attempt is being made to square the circle. Nominally there is one administrative hierarchy&#x2014;the bald statement about service in the Home Civil Service of the State would seem to imply that&#x2014;but there are two quite separate political bosses. On the one hand, there is the Secretary of State for Scotland, with the United Kingdom Government behind him. On the other hand, there is the new First Secretary or Prime Minister of Scotland.<br/>
Whereas the resolution of conflicts of loyalty between different Government Departments of the United Kingdom can at the end of the day be achieved within a single administrative and political hierarchy and pyramid, that is not true when there is the possibility&#x2014;and perhaps even the probability&#x2014;of a political clash between the political heads of the two Departments. The unfortunate civil servants will be pulled between the two and they will have nothing to point to in the Bill which will give them the slightest assistance in determining what to do in a clash of that kind&#x2014;and nor will the Judicial Committee, as the hon. Member for West Lothian has pointed out.<br/>
This is a vivid illustration of the dilemmas and the essential fallacy arising from the Government's whole structure and system of devolution. Once again, when we explore a particular aspect of it, whether it is the legislative powers of the Assembly or the political nature of the Executive, or the Civil Service, the inherent unviability and illogicality of the whole structure become apparent.</p>

<p>There is certainly a problem of duplication, which I illustrated earlier. There may not be a problem of loyalty in the sense that, while working for a particular Minister, a civil servant may feel that the problem does not arise&#x2014;although one would venture to disagree on that&#x2014;but there

is in any event an ambiguity as to the question of control. Clause 21(9) states that
<q>A Scottish Secretary may appoint such officers and servants as he may think appropriate".</q>
Clause 64 does not square with that, because it all hangs on the meaning of the word "accordingly" in that clause, and that is a pretty thin peg on which to hang the maintenance of the unity of the United Kingdom, if that is what one wants.<br/>
I suggest to the Committee that the whole problem&#x2014;which I have sought to treat as being an illustration of the more widespread disease that is endemic to all the clauses of the Bill&#x2014;is typical of the short-sighted politically motivated approach of the Government, and the pusillanimous way in which the Government seek, at best, to evade the problem, and to provide, alternatively, a half-sized solution to a double-sized problem.<br/>
I am not at all sure that the problem is soluble, but the amendment at least seeks to make it clear that the Scottish Executive can indeed make its appointments. Those are not dictated to it by Whitehall. It is right that Whitehall should not be able to foist particular civil servants on a Scottish Executive to which they are unacceptable. But, at the same time, if we are to retain a Civil Service which is genuinely the Home Civil Service of the State, the United Kingdom as a whole, it is not unreasonable that there should be inserted the provision that such appointments should be
<q>subject to the consent and approval of the Minister for the Civil Service and subject to such conditions as he may from time to time impose".</q>
That means that he can say "I will not have Mr. X and Mr. Y poached from me by the exercise of the Scottish Secretary's powers under Clause 21(9)." He can say "I am not having more favourable conditions of service, whether in terms of pay or otherwise, granted by the Scottish Assembly." He can generally take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that, within the context of the choice of civil servants, genuinely made by the Scottish Executive, the unity of the Home Civil Service is maintained.<br/>
It seems to me that an amendment on these lines would be an entirely reasonable way in which to ensure the


unity of the Home Civil Service. In that way at least we should be attempting to secure the unity of the United Kingdom, in spite of the stresses and strains that this scheme of devolution will eventually be imposing upon it. I do not necessarily suggest that it would solve the problem&#x2014;I have tried to indicate that there are elements of the problem to which I do not see a solution&#x2014;but at least it is an attempt to retain the unity of the Civil Service against all the heavy odds imposed upon it by this wretched Bill.<br/>
It cannot be said that requiring the Minister for the Civil Service to consent and approve or impose conditions is fettering the power of the Scottish Executive in an unreasonable way, for later in the same clause we find powers for the Minister for the Civil Service in relation to financial matters, and elsewhere in the Bill&#x2014;I will not take up time by exemplifying them&#x2014;there are several provisions requiring the consent and approval of United Kingdom Ministers to acts of the Scottish Executive.<br/>
The amendment is in no sense subversive of the structure of the Government's Bill but it flushes the Government out, because it makes them stand up and show themselves in their true colours. Do they want to preserve the unity of the United Kingdom and give more than lip service to their belief in a single Civil Service, or do they wish to continue, as the Bill does in its present form, to face both ways, with Clause 21 as a devolutionist clause and Clause 64 as an anti-devolutionist clause?<br/>
The Government cannot fool all the people all the time. Let us try to reach a sensible solution to this dilemma, if it can be reached, and one which furthers and favours the continuation of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>It may be for the convenience of the Committee if I make a short intervention at this stage because there are several Government amendments to be discussed later. Perhaps I can deal with them in detail then. But for the moment it may be suitable to reply to one or two of the points that have been raised.<br/>
The hon. Member for Cleveland and Whitby (Mr. Brittan) said his argument

was not a drafting one but rather one or more substance. However, we got the usual set of adjectives from him that we have heard on nearly every clause. The same objections are made to all the clauses which the hon. Gentleman discusses from time to time.<br/>
We would maintain resolutely that the clause under discussion does maintain the unity of the United Kingdom Civil Service. A clear decision has been taken by the Government that there will be a unified Civil Service. That is achieved by Clause 64(1) and other parts of the Bill.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman argued that Clause 21(9), which provides that
<q>A Scottish Secretary may appoint such officers and servants as he may think appropriate for the exercise of such of the powers&#x2026;",</q>
was inconsistent in some way with Clause 64(1). At least, the gist of his argument was that they sat uncomfortably together.<br/>
If the hon. Gentleman is arguing that the power of appointment conferred by Clause 21(9), when read with the devolution of ministerial powers in Clause 21(3), somehow means that the need for consent or approval of the Minister for the Civil Service flies off, I think that he is wrong. We must read the Bill as a whole in order to ascertain its intention and effect.<br/>
In this respect, and in accordance with the ordinary principles of construction, the later provisions in the Bill take account of the earlier provisions. Thus Clause 64(1) serves not to confuse but to clarify the intention that officers appointed by the Scottish Secretary will be members of the Home Civil Service and that the normal procedures of appointment to that service shall apply to such officers. There are other clauses which the hon. Member for Cleveland and Whitby has not touched upon.</p>

<p>This will be done in the normal way through the normal entrance to the Home Civil Service. Conditions, salaries and the like will be dealt with


in the normal way if the Minister responsible is the Minister for the Civil Service. It is said in Clause 64(1) that appointments "shall be made accordingly". That means that they will be appointed in the normal way as members of the Home Civil Service. The hon. Member for Cleveland and Whitby made far too much of that point. It is quite clear.<br/>
So far as I am aware, no questions were raised by the Civil Service unions when they gave their opinion in response to remarks made by my hon. Friend the Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell). They dealt clearly with the question of divided loyalty and rebutted it.</p>

<p>There are lawyers and lawyers just as, I suppose, there are trade unionists and trade unionists.<br/>
The main point made by the hon. Member for Cleveland and Whitby was that there was some inconsistency between these two clauses. There is not. The number of people employed by the Scottish Executive is a matter for the Scottish Executive to determine. The Scottish Secretary will make appointments in the way in which Ministers can make appointments within the United Kingdom Government. But the salaries and conditions of the integrated United Kingdom Civil Service will continue to be dealt with in the way in which they are at present.</p>

<p>If the salaries are a matter for the United Kingdom Government, and the numbers a matter for the Assembly, is it not likely that there will be a situation where proportionately there will be a far greater cost with regard to the Scottish Assembly as it will have more civil servants than in the rest of the United Kingdom?</p>

<p>My hon. Friend's capacity for imagining all sorts of things that will happen as a result of devolution is almost unlimited. I cannot deal in detail with all the fantasies which he creates.<br/>
The point at the heart of this discussion is who shall determine the size or

number of the Civil Service to work with the Scottish Executive. The Executive will decide that. After all, the salaries that will be paid will come out of the block fund. It is for the Scottish Administration to decide how many civil servants are employed. But the conditions of service and the normal conditions surrounding the employment of civil servants will be those of the Home Civil Service.<br/>
There are two alternatives, as the hon. Member for Cleveland and Whitby said, if we move towards legislative and executive devolution. Either we retain the United Kingdom Home Civil Service or we have a separate Civil Service. We are not in favour of having a separate Civil Service. I understand that there is no dispute on that point and that the hon. Gentleman accepts the need for having a unified Civil Service. There are clear advantages in having that.<br/>
Especially in the beginning years of the new structure a unified service is likely to be more economical and efficient. If we had a separate service we would need more staff and greater expenditure on recruitment and training. A single service would provide the devolved Administration with a wide range of talent and experience that it might not otherwise attract. It would also provide a more proper and flexible career structure. This would be especially true of specialists who are employed in small numbers and who would otherwise have a limited chance of obtaining job experience.</p>

<p>I am neither a lawyer nor a trade unionist and I am rather confused by this whole argument. If a new post is created, say in the Department of Energy or the Department of Education and Science, who will decide on what particular scale it should be or on what particular designation of job? Will there be a separate Scottish Civil Service Department to choose what particular grade should be given to a particular new post in the Scottish Civil Service?</p>

<p>As I understand it, these matters within the United Kingdom Government are normally done in consultation with the Civil Service Department. In the case of the Scottish Department the same situation would arise because we want to keep posts on the same grades. With regard to creating a post, that would


be a matter which would be dealt with in the normal way by the Home Civil Service. It would not be a case of the Scottish Administration creating new grades. That must be so because there must be easy transferability for people who work in the Scottish Department and who might want to transfer to the Department of the Secretary of State or to another part of the British Civil Service.<br/>
The necessity for having this transfer in and out is desirable. It will increase the range of talent available to the Scottish Administration. That is very important, particularly in the initial years of the new system of devolution.</p>

<p>Where in the Bill is there any obligation whatever on the Scottish Executive to consult the Civil Service Department on the question of grading? I have not been able to find it. If the Executive took the view that a particular post which it chose to establish deserved a higher grade, there is nothing in the Bill to prevent it doing so. It is all very well for the Minister to say that this will be done in the normal way, but is there any obligation on the Executive to consult the Civil Service Department about the proper grading for a particular post?</p>

<p>The United Kingdom Government will not operate central control over the number of civil servants. The Scottish Secretaries would be free to create posts in respect of the Scottish Assembly, subject only to the approval of the United Kingdom Government as to the correctness of the grade in which those posts are set. That is contained in the power under Article 5 of the 1969 Order in Council controlling Civil Service classifications. It is not necessary to have this in the Bill because the normal controls operated by the Civil Service in respect of the Home Civil Service applies in this case.</p>

<p>Perhaps the hon Gentleman will allow me to make my case in my own way. I intend to refer to Amendment No. 602, but there are other hon. Members who have asked me questions. On the subject of a unified Civil Service, there was initially a great deal of argument about divided loyalties. That argument now seems to have disappeared. My hon. Friend the Member for West Lothian, diligent and persistent though he is, is not flogging that dead horse. He is now on the question of duplication&#x2014;that is his theme.</p>

<p>I think that it is neither. In regard to double loyalties, I see no connection either conceptually or in practical terms. They are two distinct matters.<br/>
The fact that there will be devolution means that there will be more civil servants, although this will not amount to an enormous extra number. The figure has been put at 750. One of the reasons that the increase in the number of civil servants is not higher than it is&#x2014;it is a fairly moderate increase&#x2014;is that the practice of administrative devolution has already gone a long way in the Scottish Office. For example, there is already a Scottish Education Department operating in Edinburgh. Devolution will mean for that Department that it will have a new political head, and it will be responsible to the Scottish Secretary instead of to the House of Commons. It will be responsible to the Scottish Assembly for the accountability which the Scottish Secretary will exercise through his Department.</p>

<p>After devolution there will be about 11,500 civil servants, taking into account the Prison Service, which is a large element in that amount. I am not sure of the exact figure, but that is the kind of number involved. Therefore


administrative devolution has gone quite far already. That will ease the problem. I concede that this is a more complicated system of government than that which is operated through a unitary State with its own legislature, and certain extra work is involved. However, it is greatly outweighed by the increase in the amount of democratic accountability which will exist in the Scottish Assembly because that body will have more time to consider properly legislation in devolved matters. It will be possible for Assembly Members to scrutinise Executive activities in Scotland more closely than we are able to do in this House. With the best will in the world, we in this House, because of various pressures, are unable to give the same amount of attention to those matters.<br/>
If I may now deal specifically with Amendment No. 602, I believe that the amendment would make very little difference to the situation. The effect of the amendment would be to qualify the Scottish Secretary's power under Clause 21(9) to appoint such officers as he thinks appropriate, subject to the approval of the Minister for the Civil Service. It is interesting to note that the amendment does not extend to recruitment or status.</p>

<p>We are talking about the powers of a Scottish Secretary, a person who will be a member of the Administration after devolution. Those he appoints to the Administration will be members of the Home Civil Service. I expect that substantially the people who will be employed in, for example, the Scottish Education Department, will be largely the same people who are now employed there. No doubt the vast majority will want to continue to undertake that useful public work.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman's amendment does not extend to recruitment or status. The civil servant as a member of the Home Civil Service would still be required under the Order in Council passed in 1969 to be certificated by the Civil Service Commissioners and would have to meet the normal criteria of classification.

The amendment would take away from the Scottish Secretaries their freedom to appoint particular people to particular posts. They will be able to do so only with the consent of the Minister for the Civil Service. Secondly, the amendment would enable the Minister for the Civil Service to control the number of civil servants serving in a devolved Administration. I do not know which is the primary purpose of the hon. Gentleman, but his amendment would have that effect.</p>

<p>On the subject of appointment, in the absence of such power of veto does the Minister agree that on the face of it, provided that the right kind of person is appointed from within the category approved, and provided he is paid the right amount, the Scottish Secretary will be able, in the absence of our amendment, to pick absolutely anybody he likes because he will have a statutory right to do so? If the answer to that question is "Yes", is it not unacceptable that he should make such appointments throughout the entire range of the Civil Service? If the answer is "No", what is the objection to the amendment?</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman is now slightly changing his tack. The effect of his amendment would bring in control by a Westminster Minister. That would have to happen before a Scottish Secretary made appointments in the Civil Service. The Scottish Secretary has power to make appointments but that is qualified by Clause 64, which says that civil servants who serve the Assembly and a Scottish Administration will be in the Home Civil Service&#x2014;namely, the United Kingdom Civil Service. In other words, Amendment No. 602 would mean that the Scottish Administration would lose control over the number of civil servants who serve a Scottish Administration. More civil servants might be required in some areas, and fewer in other areas. This depends on the capacity and policies of those who will be elected to the Administration. When we consider how many civil servants will be appointed by a particular Department, we must remember that they will be paid from the block fund, and that this will be determined by Westminster. The Opposition appear constantly to be seeking further Westminster control. They want to control the


finances and also the number of staff. That is our objection to the Westminster attitude adopted by the Opposition.</p>

<p>I am sorry to intervene yet again, but the Minister uncharacteristically has not answered the question. He appears to be asking me questions about numbers. I am concerned about the right of the Scottish Secretary to choose whom he wishes out of the pool of the Home Civil Service. Is the Minister saying that he is content that the Scottish Secretary should have the right to appoint any person he wishes to appoint, subject to that person's consent, without the Home Civil Service having any say as to whether a senior civil servant in, say, a United Kingdom ministry should be kicked out? If he recognises that such a course would be unworkable, unrealistic and wrong within a unified Civil Service, why does he object to the amendment?</p>

<p>I am trying to explain my objection to the amendment. I am saying that it would mean Westminster control over the number of civil servants employed by the Administration.<br/>
How will the Scottish Secretary go about appointing people to the Administration? He will do so in the way in which Ministers of the United Kingdom Government deal with these matters. We shall expect there to be close co-operation between those concerned in the devolved Administration and the Civil Service Department. It is reasonable to expect people to co-operate. Every time this matter comes up, I am told that every provision in the Bill is a recipe for conflict, but I cannot understand why there should be so many unreasonable people on the United Kingdom side of the line and on the Scottish administration side.</p>

<p>It is difficult to know what the Conservatives want because their policy on devolution is unclear. They are very good at telling us what they do not want, but they are remarkably unclear when it comes to producing a policy on devolution.<br/>
I notice that the right hon. Member for Cambridgeshire (Mr. Pym) wants Select Committees to deal with parts of the Bill. He imagines that the process of framing a devolution Bill will take three years. Speed is obviously not one of the characteristics in determining how their policy on devolution is arrived at. However, it is difficult enough being responsible for the handling of this Bill without being asked to take responsibility for the Opposition's confused position and I hope that the hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. MacCormick) will forgive me if I do not stray into that territory.</p>

<p>Can the Minister clarify one point before he leaves Clause 21(9)? Is he saying that we should add to that clause, which says that the Scottish Secretary may appoint such officers and servants as he may think appropriate, the words "being members of the Home Civil Service"?</p>

<p>I am saying that Clause 21(9) should be read together with Clause 64. It is common for two clauses to be read together. The later provision takes account of the earlier.<br/>
The hon. Member for Cleveland and Whitby insists that his amendment is desirable. If carried, it would mean Westminster control over matters which can reasonably be left to the Scottish Administration, including such matters as the number of civil servants required. We should bear in mind that the Assembly will be paying their salaries.<br/>
That is our serious objection to the amendment. The hon. Gentleman moved it with some extravagant arguments and fairly flowery adjectives, but I think that he put it forward in a reasoned way and I am trying to give a reasoned rebuttal and explain why I do not think that it would be a reasonable way of dealing with this matter.<br/>
The fundamental point is the concept of a unified Civil Service. There may be some hon. Members who think that there should be a separate Civil Service, but, for all the reasons that I have given, I believe that this would be undesirable and that we should have a common Civil Service.<br/>
Perhaps I have spoken for long enough. I shall be glad to deal later with contributions from other hon. Members.</p>

<p>When politicians discuss civil servants and their r&#x00F4;le and place in our structure of government, we generally hear a fair amount of gobbledegook. Before discussing the amendment, I should like to make some general assertions to bear out my contention.<br/>
The political inhibitions laid on civil servants are wildly excessive and I would go much further in freeing them than do the suggestions of the recent committee. I realise that this may not appear entirely germane to the amendment, but it is germane to what the hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) has said about the possibility of conflict.

<p>I think that the hon. Gentleman must have a latent level of irritability due to having to go through this whole process. He has chided the hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Mackintosh) and myself for daring to mention Germany in the context of the Bill. But these references were entirely appropriate because the German example in regard to the treatment of political views of civil servants deserves serious consideration in this country.</p>

<p>Yes, indeed. I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's intervention. It is not regarded in West Germany as wrong or prejudicial to the promotion

of an individual civil servant for him openly to be a member of one of the main political parties. That is something we should bear in mind.<br/>
The position of civil servants as administrators is no different from that of any other set of administrators. There is a fair amount of myth surrounding this point. Whether we talk of administrators in the Civil Service or in industry, education or anywhere else, the problems are essentially the same and I do not believe that difficulties should arise because of the personal views of civil servants. Indeed, they would be serving their superiors inadequately if they concealed those views.<br/>
Clearly, problems would arise if a civil servant were made simultaneously responsible to two people, for example, the First Secretary of the Scottish Assembly and the Secretary of State for Scotland, who might spend their time in dispute. In such circumstances, a good civil servant might end us as the mediator, although that would give far too much power to the bureaucrat. People sometimes forget that the mediator is in a better position to project his views than are the contestants and I would not wish to put Mr. Kerr Fraser, who has been referred to by the hon. Member for West Lothian, into that position, however estimable his qualities may be.<br/>
Given the need for civil servants to have only one master, we should remember that we are talking about only one master at one time. It is quite common for civil servants to change masters. The hon. Member for West Lothian has got into quite a froth about the terrible dilemmas which would rack and rend Mr. Kerr Fraser as he tossed and grunted in his bed trying to decide to whom he was responsible&#x2014;the First Secretary of the Assembly or the Secretary of State for Scotland. However, the hon. Member said implicitly that he did not see any problem in Mr. Fraser rendering due obeisance and sterling service to the First Secretary from February to July and to the Secretary of State from August to December. Apparently that is not difficult, but to do both those things at once is difficult. People are able to change from one circumstance to another and that happens now. The problem is really


one of timing and occasion rather than one of principle.<br/>
It is against that background that I should like to comment on the amendment. I agree with what the Minister has said. The amendment seeks to dilute, as one might expect considering its source, the basic object of devolution. It seeks to remove certain powers of decision from Edinburgh and to retain them here. That has been the consistent objective of the Opposition Front Bench throughout consideration of the Bill, and I do not complain about that. In that respect there has been no inconsistency on the part of the Opposition Front Bench. However, that is not a matter of serving the purpose of the Bill.<br/>
Secondly, the hon. Member for Cleveland and Whitby (Mr. Brittan) spent some time suggesting that the amendment is all about making things smoother and easier, whereas I think that it would be more likely to create conflict than the situation contained in the Bill. As the Minister of State said, and as the hon. Gentleman confirmed&#x2014;the hon. Gentleman was the first to use the word "veto"&#x2014;the purpose of the amendment is to enable the Minister for the Civil Service to exercise the power of veto in respect of appointments.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman suggested, in his admirably emollient fashion, that the idea that there might be conflict was an exaggeration. He said that the issue was simply about equivalent standards and other such matters, and that the likelihood of conflict between the Minister for the Civil Service and the First Secretary of the Assembly as regards the appointment of any person was remote.<br/>
Surely that was an odd inversion of the normal run of argument. As the Minister of State said in responding to one of the not infrequent interjections from the hon. Member for West Lothian, the hon. Gentleman has apparently a limitless capacity for imagining dire events taking place and terrible conflicts emerging between the Assembly and Westminster. The hon. Member for Cleveland and Whitby said that such conflicts would not take place. In that way we had an odd inversion of the traditional approach of the opponents of the Bill and devolution as a whole.</p>

<p>I think that the hon. Gentleman has misunderstood my argu

ment, or that I was guilty of not explaining myself sufficiently clearly. I was not arguing that which he suggests. I am saying that it should be made clear whether the Scottish Secretary may pick and choose whomever he wants from the Home Civil Service. I asked the question repeatedly of the Minister and he kept obfuscating the point. The Minister kept telling me that the amendment had consequences in terms of numbers. The problem about the Bill, never mind the amendment, is that it is not clear whether the Scottish Secretary may take anyone he likes from the pool of the Home Civil Service.

<p>It is hardly for me to adjudicate on the obfuscatory qualities of the Minister. However, it appeared from his remarks that it is clear that the proposition contained in the Bill is that the First Secretary has the right of appointment as regards individuals and numbers, and that the consequence of the amendment would be that before the First Secretary made appointments, either in the case of individuals or total numbers, they would have to be approved by the Minister for the Civil Service.</p>

<p>I take up the Ministers point about the hon. Member for Cleveland and Whitby (Mr. Brittan) taking advice from the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor). The hon.

<p>With respect, I do not intend that my speech should cast me in the r&#x00F4;le of a catalyst in bringing together the hon. Members for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) and Argyll (Mr. MacCormick). I shall continue in my own way, although I do not have a great deal more to say. However, I think that what I have said thus far has borne out the unacceptability of the amendment as it stands.<br/>
As the Minister of State will confirm, the Liberal position from the beginning was that the logical position was to establish a separate Scottish Civil Service. That was our view. I was interested in the remarks of the hon. Member for Cleveland and Whitby, who agreed that that represented "the most logical approach". That remains Liberal opinion.<br/>
I was disappointed by the Minister's brief reference to the issue of a separate Civil Service when, turning away from his own original comment, he turned to his supplied brief and read out a few traditional reasons for it being undesirable to have a separate Civil Service. The hon. Gentleman argued that a single service is more efficient and economical. He did so without a blink. He then said that it would provide a better career structure. He did so again without a blink. Both those arguments are arguments against devolution <i>per se.</i> They are against the duplication that in some degree the hon. Member for West Lothian is right to argue will happen. In some degree it is inevitable that duplication will take place, but the argument is that because of that duplication a better, more sensitive and more efficient method of Government will ensue.</p>

<p>I understand that the Liberal Party believes that there should be a separate Civil Service. Will the hon. Gentleman explain why his party has not put down an amendment to that effect?

<p>I am putting forward my point of view. I am aware that such an amendment would not gain acceptance. I am also aware of resistance within the Civil Service unions to any such proposition. Therefore, it did not seem a useful exercise to go through the procedure of putting down an amendment to that effect. We have discussed the matter at some length with the Government. It does not mean that we have been browbeaten. If I had been browbeaten, I would not be expressing any view. I am expressing the view that it is a logical position. I do not see the point of putting down amendments which would inevitably be rejected.<br/>
The Administration within the Assembly will have the right to choose its own civil servants and there will remain the opportunity for interchangeability within the United Kingdom Civil Service. If we had a separate Civil Service, interchangeability, which is the crucial factor, could be retained just as it will be retained in future in the European context. We shall have a flow in and out of the Community of British and other European civil servants. That is not an impossible situation. The amendment is unnecessarily restrictive. It reflects the general restrictiveness of the attitude of the Conservative Party towards the whole question of devolution.</p>

<p>I had not intended to speak in the debate. Indeed, I did not think that it would last for any great time.<br/>
I tend to approach this matter as a trade unionist. The word "accordingly" struck me as being eminently sensible shorthand for what most trade unionists understand to be the normal conditions of service that will apply to any group

within a bargaining unit, whether it be a small or a large bargaining unit. It is part of the normal negotiating machinery. The agreed conditions of service which operate for the whole of the Civil Service will apply to those employed by the Scottish Assembly. The conditions governing which grades may engage in local and national politics will apply in Scotland as they do elsewhere. The question of hours, conditions of service, and so on, is covered by the normally recognised trade union word "accordingly". My hon. Friend the Minister of State received no objections to this part of the Bill from the Civil Service unions, because we all understand the meaning of "accordingly".<br/>
When the hon. Member for Cleveland and Whitby (Mr. Brittan) moved the amendment, I was transported back in time to the Industrial Relations Bill. On the first day we had four lawyers from different parts of the Committee giving different interpretations of the word "reasonable". However, every industrialist and trade unionist had a fair idea of what it meant in practice. The difference between the two Front Benchers is that one is a Labour lawyer and the other is a Tory lawyer, and the Labour lawyer understands what "accordingly" means.<br/>
If we were foolish enough to accept the amendment, the position of those employed by the Scottish Assembly would be somewhat different from those employed by, for example, the United Kingdom Department of the Environment. The word "accordingly" gives the same negotiating power and coverage to those employed by the Scottish Assembly as to those employed by the Department of the Environment. If the amendment were carried, it would be left to the absolute discretion of the Minister for the Civil Service. I believe that the Civil Service unions would go hammering on the door of the Privy Council wanting to know what the Government and Labour Members of Parliament proposed to do about the matter on Report, because trade unions would want their members to be protected in future just as they are now.</p>

<p>If my hon. Friend were the Minister in a Scottish Assembly, would he meekly and mildly accept from the Minister for the Civil Service in


London an instruction on how to react to problems and conflicts which would inevitably arise in his Department? Would he meekly and mildly accept the diktat of a right hon. Friend in the United Kingdom Government?</p>

<p>I should be surprised if any United Kingdom Minister were to be so politically foolish as to issue a diktat to a senior member of the Scottish Administration in Edinburgh. My hon. Friend the Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) and others make the mistake of forgetting that we are dealing with the realm of democratic politics. We are all well accustomed to the resolution of conflicts by the normal procedure of dialogue and the exchange of views. If we ever reached the stage where a United Kingdom Minister isued strong diktats to Members of the Scottish Executive, we would indeed be at the parting of the ways. It would not matter two whits whether the civil servants were controlled absolutely by the Minister in Edinburgh or the Minister in Westminster. I think that my hon. Friend makes far too much of what the Minister of State described as one of his nightmare fantasies. I interpose the word "nightmare", but I think that is what my hon. Friend meant.</p>

<p>I think that the hon. Gentleman and I agree that we have been through quite a few nightmares with this Government. If we had a financial crises and instructions were issued to reduce the numbers of civil servants by 2 per cent., would the hon. Gentleman say that it would make for a unified Civil Service if the United Kingdom Secretary of State's Department, or whatever it might be called, had to reduce the numbers of staff and the Scottish Assembly Department, or whatever it might be called, did not have to apply similar reductions? Does he believe that it would make for a unified Civil Service if economic restrictions of that kind were to apply only to the United Kingdom Secretary of State's Department?</p>

<p>I do not believe that that would alter the character of a unified Civil Service. The basic fundamental characteristics of a unified Civil Service are whether similar conditions of employment and service apply from John o'Groats to the tip of Shetland when any

body enters the Civil Service in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dumfries, Carlisle, Liverpool or London. That is what makes for basic unification.<br/>
It does not worry me that there might be a different policy regarding numbers in the Civil Service in Scotland as opposed to England and, indeed, Wales any more than it worries me that we have a different approach to regional employment premium in Scotland as opposed to any other part of the United Kingdom. The whole essence of devolution is that different solutions may apply to different parts of the United Kingdom. Jobs in the Civil Service in Scotland are as much a part of the labour market as jobs in the engineering and shipbuilding industries.<br/>
Many people make far too much of the allegation that there will be a conflict of loyalties. Let us boil the situation down to hard, day-to-day facts. All those who work in the Scottish Home and Health Department have a prime loyalty to that Department. That has always been so and always will be so. If there is a political conflict between Edinburgh and Westminster, it is wrong to expect civil servants, irrespective of their grades, to try to resolve that problem, because that would invite them into the political arena. The way to resolve the conflict is by political dialogue between the politicians.<br/>
As I see it, the r&#x00F4;le of the Civil Service is to supply the information that is required and to administer policies. It would be undemocratic by definition to allow civil servants to impose their political view.<br/>
I do not see what all the problems are. Let us consider the hypothetical situation&#x2014;and it is one that should cheer the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor)&#x2014;that an election is to take place in a month's time and that there is a change of Government. In the Scottish Office civil servants who had given all their support to my right hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millan) would transfer their loyalties to the hon. Member for Cathcart within the space of 24 hours. One of those men is on the left of the spectrum and the other on the far right. Nobody believes that it is impossible for civil servants to transfer their support in this way.<br/>
If this debate were broadcast north of the border on the day that 203,000 people


have been declared unemployed in Scotland most Scots would wonder why so many of them were unemployed while people here were drawing a salary.</p>

<p>I am not satisfied that the Minister has answered the doubts that have been expressed from both sides of the Committee about the appointment of civil servants in Scotland. I shall deal with the wider aspects of the amendment. Each day when we consider clauses and amendments to this complicated Bill we find new areas where there will be confusion and conflict.<br/>
The independence and integrity of the British Civil Service has been the proud boast of this country for a long time. However, under the proposals in the Bill an intolerable strain of loyalties will be placed upon Scottish civil servants who will be pulled this way and that, on the one hand by their loyalty to the Secretary of State here and on the other by their loyalty to the new Assembly. If the Assembly makes claims for greater independence&#x2014;which it is bound to do beginning on day one, whichever party is in control&#x2014;the unfortunate civil servants in Scotland will be placed in an almost impossible position. Naturally they will be concerned about their future and career prospects. They are bound to be under strain if relations between the House of Commons and the new Assembly grow worse, as I fear they will. Giving unbiased advice will place an almost intolerable burden upon the civil servants.<br/>
I remember the strains and stresses which beset French officials in 1940 after the collapse of France when they had to decide whether they would stay with the Vichy Government or risk their all and join de Gaulle. We do not want that sort of conflict of interests here in this peaceful and, until now, united United Kingdom. If the activities of the Assembly are such that they have to be curbed by the Westminster Parliament it will place the Scottish civil servants in the most embarrassing and difficult situation. They will find that they are pawns in a political power struggle, the outcome of which no one can foresee.<br/>
5.45 p.m.<br/>
All these fears lead me to believe that in this clause we are embarking on the

most dangerous course. One may say that it is all right if we play ducks and drakes with our own lives and powers in this Chamber, but it is another matter to place the careers and the whole future of our civil servants at risk, particularly when they have no say in their destiny. Nothing less than the fundamental unity of the United Kingdom is at stake. If we put these sorts of pressures on civil servants nothing short of anarchy and chaos will break out. Who knows where the repercussions may end.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Halesowen and Stourbridge (Mr. Stokes) asked a rhetorical question&#x2014;where will it all end? I shall ask him a question. He comes from the West Midlands. Many Scots have important positions in the West Midlands. If there were this kind of break-up, what would be their reaction?</p>

<p>I have met not a Scot in the West Midlands, and few in Scotland, who is in favour of the Bill or even of an Assembly.<br/>
The Committee should really be concerning itself with the appalling and disgraceful figures for unemployment in Scotland and every part of the United Kingdom. It should not indulge in this dangerous tomfoolery. It is incredible that the Government, presumably for political ends, are prepared to risk the foundation of the State in this way.<br/>
Our Civil Service is the envy of the world. We may have failed in responsibility in government, we may not have produced the leaders that we used to produce&#x2014;and we were reminded of that today&#x2014;but in our administration we have something which no other country has. Why disturb it? Why make hundreds of civil servants anxious about their futures? What is it all for? What are we trying to do? What advantages will there be? I say again that we are playing with fire with this Bill.</p>

<p>The Committee is anxious to make progress, so I shall not detain it for long. I am at a loss to understand the persistent dogmatism of the hon. Member for Cleveland and Whitby (Mr. Brittan) in making the case for this amendment, particularly since time after time he has received positive replies from the Minister.<br/>
What surprises me is that he argues that one cannot have conditions of service for the Civil Service unless the Minister becomes involved responsibly in the application of these conditions in Government agencies throughout the country. The hon. Member says that unless the Minister becomes directly responsible for this aspect of Assembly administration it simply cannot work. This seems to be the hon. Member's argument, and it is completely illogical.<br/>
Surely we can have an Assembly with its own office bearers making appointments in accordance with the conditions that have been approved, not only by the Minister but by the Civil Service unions. They have not yet been mentioned. They are as deeply interested and as much involved as is any Minister in England. I listened very carefully to ascertain from the hon. Member for Cleveland and Whitby just how his dilemma arises regarding the relationship between the Minister and the operation of the conditions of service.<br/>
I have spent a long time arguing for and advocating national negotiations in which conditions of service covering the entire United Kingdom, should be laid down. They are applied not only nationally but locally without London being involved, and to argue that any Minister should be responsible for the employment, the placing and the salaries of staff is totally absurd, especially when an English Minister might exercise such responsibilities in respect of Scotland. That really amazes me.<br/>
The hon. Member should have done his homework. If he had done it correctly, he would have known of the devolved facilities for the health services in Scotland. I spent years in health services administration employing persons on the basis of the United Kingdom Civil Service scales and conditions of service without the involvement of an English Minister. Those people were moving from office to office and travelling between Scotland and England.<br/>
I have never heard so much nonsense as that spoken about the apprehension of civil servants as to what is to happen. They are moving between Scotland and England at present, and they will continue to do that after devolution, pro-

vided the salary is right, provided that the conditions of service are equally attractive and provided that they can get a suitable home, and so on.<br/>
At this stage, therefore, I advise the hon. Member that he is trying to take a sledgehammer to crack a nut. It has been made unquestionably clear by the Minister that any such engagements by the Scottish Secretary shall be in accordance with the conditions of service laid down by the Government for the Civil Service throughout the United Kingdom. Since that assurance has been given, I cannot understand for the life of me why it should not be accepted. When the Scottish Assembly becomes operative, all the protection that is necessary for civil servants will be evident to all who wish to appreciate that in this clause the Government are leaving no stone unturned to protect the conditions of service of such people and to give the responsibility of engagement, and so on, to the Assembly.<br/>
After all, the Assembly Members will be elected democratically, just as we are elected here. They will be answerable just as we are answerable to the general public. They will employ office bearers just as we employ them. If the Assembly is to pay the necessary salary, it is entitled to engage those it regards as the most suitable and able, and those people will be answerable to it and not to any English Minister. We in Scotland use the saying "He who pays the piper calls the tune". The Scottish Assembly will be paying the piper.<br/>
From the block grant which the tax-payer will pay&#x2014;and that includes the Scottish taxpayer&#x2014;sums of money will be made available in order to manage the Assembly. Part of the management will involve the engagement of suitably qualified staff to carry out administrative work. If those staff are to be responsible to the Scottish Assembly, the Scottish Assembly should employ them. Having listened to my hon. Friend the Minister of State, I am satisfied that they will be employed according to the conditions of service drawn up for the Civil Service throughout the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>We are losing sight of some of what lies behind this Bill, of matters that


are fundamentally of the utmost importance. The amendment seeks to improve on a position which can lead to very grave difficulty. The Civil Service is inevitably silent during a debate in this Chamber, and partly because of that I feel obliged to record my personal view. It is that the part of the Bill devoted to the future of the Civil Service is extremely small. I should have thought it appropriate for both Front Benches&#x2014;I do not excuse my own&#x2014;to have had on them the senior Ministers and their "Shadow" counterparts, who depend upon the Civil Service.<br/>
I believe that they would leave the debate knowing of the real difficulties that we are presenting to the Civil Service for the first time by introducing into the Home Civil Service a conflict, be it large or small, which we must resolve as best we can. Our duty is to resolve it by saying that the wording of the Bill should embrace as little difficulty for the future as possible. It is quite unrealistic and over-optimistic to suggest that there will not be difficulty through asking the Home Civil Service to uphold two points of view within the same appointment bracket. That is what the Minister suggested, although he did it pleasantly. He said he did not believe that people were unreasonable.</p>

<p>This is not only a question of people being unreasonable. It is also a question of a whole powerful group in the Assembly wanting something totally different.

<p>That is the point I am trying to make. It is not a question of being unreasonable.<br/>
It is over-optimistic to expect that there will not be occasions when two sets of perfectly honourable civil servants will have to provide advice which will conflict. The conflict will not be of their making. It would be quite improper, as the hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Sillars) said, for the civil servants to be involved in the political aspects. We shall be asking two groups of civil servants, recruited from the same source, to serve different masters in Scotland.</p>

<p>With respect, the Minister continues to narrow the matter, and I think that he is unrealistic in so doing. The official to whom he refers may quite properly put forward the point of view of his Department and his Minister. I was not quite sure whether the Minister was referring to the old Secretary of State or the new Scottish Secretary, but I assume that he meant the new Assembly Secretary of State. The Scottish Secretary has an advisory civil servant. The Secretary of State has an advisory civil servant. There are bound to be areas of conflict, whether they be in education or in some other matters.</p>

<p>All right&#x2014;there will be differences of opinion in some areas, to put it no higher than that. On such occasions, there will not be divided loyalty, because each set of civil servants will be loyal to their own masters, but their masters themselves will have conflict between them, and that situation will prove very difficult.<br/>
The Minister may argue that there can be no such difficulty, but I am sure that in reality there will be, and that is what some of us are trying to prevent.

<p>Now that you have so skilfully brought the Committee to order, Sir Myer, I shall gladly do so.<br/>
I take up the point just made by the hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell). We are not dealing with a situation which we have ever experienced before, although we keep trying to pretend that we are. In fact, we are dealing with a totally new situation in which, sitting in Edinburgh, there will be two sets of people perhaps with conflicting views. I say "perhaps", but when there are conflicting views difficulties will arise. We are talking of the same set of civil servants. I cannot express it more clearly. I know that they will be different people, but each will be recruited from the Home Civil Service. They will advise their masters and they will do so impartially. But in some areas a point of conflict will inevitably arise, and we are asking the Minister to take that into account.<br/>
The Minister is being terribly touchy about it. He says that it will be all right on the day. All we are saying is that it will not be all right on the day, and we are asking the Minister to take

heed now and try to improve the arrangements. If he does not like our amendment, let him think of a better and more convincing way to go about it. He must acknowledge the difficulty, and there is, or will be, an opportunity for him to improve matters.<br/>
Our plea is that the Government should make the r&#x00F4;le of the Civil Service possible, but many of us fear that we are about to pass a part of the Bill which will make the position of at least some civil servants very nearly impossible.</p>

<p>I hope that no one will use my brief remarks as a reflecting wall from which to bounce off questions to my hon. Friends on the Front Bench. I assure the Committee that, if anyone does that, I shall not respond, or, in so far as I might respond on behalf of my hon. Friends, I might mislead the Committee, so I hope that the practice which seems to have grown up in this debate will now stop.<br/>
I wish, first, to take up the line of argument advanced by the right hon. Lady the Member for Renfrewshire, East (Miss Harvie Anderson) and to say a few words about the problem of double loyalty and, indeed, of duplication, to which my hon. Friend the Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) referred.<br/>
When he opened the debate, the hon. Member for Cleveland and Whitby (Mr. Brittan) suggested that there was no parallel to the situation which we should have after the creation of a Scottish Assembly, saying that the situation as between two Government Departments was in no sense a parallel. One can take a much closer parallel, that of civil servants in the service of a quasi-governmental body. I shall draw on my own experience and refer to the University Grants Committee.<br/>
There are civil servants on secondment to the University Grants Committee from the Department of Education and Science and other Departments. Many of them subsequently return to their Department of origin or to other Government Departments. Never once in my many dealings with that body have I seen any problem of conflict of loyalty. When a civil servant is on secondment to the University Grants Committee, there is no doubt about where his loyalty lies; it lies


to that Committee and to that Committee alone.<br/>
If the hon. Member for Cleveland and Whitby thinks that that situation is not parallel because we shall have a political body in Scotland&#x2014;perhaps even a body dominated by the Scottish National Party&#x2014;I assure him that a body composed primarily of academics is just as difficult to serve and just as difficult to deal with as is any gaggle of politicians.</p>

<p>This is not a rhetorical question. My hon. Friend refers to the time when he was a Minister at the Department of Education and Science. With respect, that is not an exact parallel&#x2014;</p>

<p>The parallel is not with a Labour Minister in a Scottish Assembly. It is a question not of University Grants Committee officials being loyal to a Labour colleague but of their being loyal, say, to the right hon. Lady the Member for Finchley (Mrs. Thatcher), as Secretary of State. That is the parallel, and herein lies the difficulty.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-01-24a.1233.3" hansard_membership_id="4596" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29579" speakername="Mr. Fowler" colnum="1233" time="">
<p>That is the point I am making. Officials on secondment to the University Grants Committee are loyal to the Committee, not to the Secretary of State, whoever the Secretary of State may be. Indeed, there are often conflicts of opinion, and there have been conflicts of opinion between the University Grants Committee and the Department of Education and Science and the Secretary of State who heads that Department.<br/>
We know of one such conflict in recent years, and I give nothing away when I refer to it since the dispute was at least semi-public. It was over the proper level of fees for students in higher education. I saw not the slightest evidence at that time that officials of the University Grants Committee were not totally loyal to the Committee. Nor did I see any evidence that their colleagues within the Department, or within other central Government Departments, attempting to browbeat them or threatening them that their career in the Home Civil Service would be damaged were they to remain loyal to the viewpoint of the University Grants

Committee. No one else has seen any such evidence. It does not exist.</p>

<p>The parallel which the hon. Gentleman uses is utterly absurd, because the University Grants Committee is inevitably subject to the constraints of the Department of Education and Science. If the Department says "We intend to reduce university expenditure", the UGC is subject to that and has to find a way of carrying out that policy, so the Committee and its officials are just as much the servants of the political master.<br/>
Here, however, we are envisaging a situation in which there are two different political masters pulling in opposite directions. For example, if Westminster says that the school leaving age shall be raised and the Assembly says that it wants to lower it, how are the civil servants who have to deal with that conflict to resolve it?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-01-24a.1234.1" hansard_membership_id="4596" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29579" speakername="Mr. Fowler" colnum="1234" time="">
<p>With respect to the hon. and learned Gentleman, that is a much easier situation than the one which I have described, since in the one I have described the officials serving the University Grants Committee have simultaneously, on the occasion of a general cut in university expenditure, to advise the Committee on how that may be implemented&#x2014;the hon. and learned Gentleman is right as regards the general level of university expenditure in that it is the Government who in the last analysis decide that and to advise the Committee how best it may continue to present its own case against that decision. That is a much more difficult situation than the one which the hon. and learned Gentleman postulates, in which officials in the service of the Scottish Assembly have merely to advise their own Executive as to the implementation of their own policy&#x2014;not of somebody else's policy.<br/>
I have chosen a peculiarly difficult example which more than makes the point that I was trying to make, and indeed, what the hon. Member for Cleveland and Whitby is worrying about. It is a chimera&#x2014;a problem that does not exist in the real world.<br/>
As for duplication, let us take the same example. It has been the consistent policy of the Department of Education and Science that its university branch shall be very small. So it has remained over the years. It is of a size sufficient


to perform only its own proper functions that are concerned with the determination of university expenditure as a whole, and to act as a link with the University Grants Committee. I see no evidence, on that parallel, that we shall see a massive growth of the Civil Service in order to duplicate effort in both the Assembly and central Government.<br/>
Before I conclude, I want to comment on the amendment directly. Part of the argument of the hon. Member for Cleveland and Whitby was that the amendment was desirable in order to tie in the careers structure and membership of the Scottish Civil Service more closely with the Home Civil Service. The hon. Member painted a picture which I thought was quite remarkable. It was a picture of the Scottish Executive conducting a massive head hunt throughout the Home Civil Service looking for the most talented or the most biased members of that Home Civil Service and recruiting them under the noses of the Civil Service Department. I have rarely heard anything so absurd.<br/>
There is no possibility&#x2014;and the Bill brings it no nearer because it does not repeal the principles of the legislation that already governs the Civil Service&#x2014;that the Scottish Executive would be able to recruit in this head-hunting fashion. In the first place, it is extremely unlikely that civil servants at any level would be transferred to the service of the Scottish Executive against their will, without their consent. In the second place, it is inconceivable that any senior civil servant would be transferred&#x2014;recruited, as the hon. Gentleman would say&#x2014;to the service of the Scottish Executive without the consent of the Civil Service Department.<br/>
How is that supposed to happen? Here is a man in post in a central Government Department in London, and we are asked to imagine that a head hunter from the Scottish Executive descends on him and tells him that he will offer him an appointment next week in his service, and the Civil Service Department simply sits back and says "Oh, heavens, what a disaster. That is nothing to do with us, as the Department responsible in central Government for the employment of civil servants. You can just snatch him away from this Department and attach him to your own service." Of course, we cannot do that. If a civil servant were simply

to desert his present post, which is what hon. Gentleman implies, he would be dismissed from the Home Civil Service.</p>

<p>That is the point that I was making. The hon. Member for The Wrekin (Mr. Fowler) ought to be supporting the amendment, because Clause 21(9) provides:
<q>A Scottish Secretary may appoint such officers and servants as he may think appropriate.</q>
There is nothing to stop him doing what has just been described in somewhat graphic terms. It would be very difficult to sack a civil servant in the face of an express statutory provision of that kind.<br/>
If the hon. Gentleman wants the position to be as he describes it and for that to be made clear, he should vote for the amendment, which gives effect to exactly the procedure that he has described, namely, subject to the consent and the approval of the Minister for the Civil Service. Those are virtually the words he used a second or two ago.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-01-24a.1236.1" hansard_membership_id="4596" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29579" speakername="Mr. Fowler" colnum="1236" time="">
<p>The hon. Gentleman says that I am being graphic. I am merely describing the situation that he sketched in for us earlier. The hon. Gentleman invented it, not I. I am saying what has already been said from the Government side of the Committee&#x2014;that it will in practice be requisite for there to be consultation with the Civil Service Department. That is absolutely inescapable, whatever gory fantasies the hon. Member may invent.<br/>
6.15 p.m.<br/>
Turning to what the hon. Gentleman wants to see, it is quite clear that his amendment would produce Civil Service Department control in detail of the civil servants serving the Scottish Assembly and Executive, including control of numbers. The importance of that is that it is another financial control. It is a way of telling the Scottish Assembly how it shall spend its money.<br/>
Indeed, it is a way of telling it how it shall do that in a peculiar fashion which disjoins policy from the staffing necessary to implement that policy. To say that the Scottish Assembly shall determine its own policy in a series of areas, as we are saying in the Bill, and that it shall have no control over the


number of civil servants who will implement and administer that policy appears to be nonsensical. That is exactly what the hon. Gentleman is saying.<br/>
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) seemed to go further. He suggested that we should have the control built into the amendment so that when there was a reduction imposed by economic necessity in the size of the United Kingdom Civil Service, that reduction should bite upon the Scottish Assembly as well as upon all the home Government Departments. Yet the hon. Member for Cathcart knows perfectly well that no such control is applied to local authorities in that crude and direct fashion. What happens is that the rate support grant is adjusted. What would happen here is quite obvious. The block grant would be adjusted.<br/>
That would be devolution, because then it remains for the Assembly, on the advice of its Executive, to determine its priorities for the expenditure of the money at its disposal. Perhaps its priority will be&#x2014;I should think that it would be an unpopular priority in Scotland were it to be adopted&#x2014;that in conditions of severe economic restraint it should increase the number of civil servants who service it in the Executive. Were the Assembly to do so, it would be simultaneously deciding that there would be less money for other services, and perhaps its priority, more reasonably, would be the reverse. So the control would bite indirectly.<br/>
If we adopt the amendment, with the gloss put upon it by the hon. Member for Cathcart, we should again be saying that the Scottish Assembly and the Executive shall be subject to more detailed Whitehall and Wesminster control than any local authority in the realm. We would again be saying, as we have heard so often from the Opposition Front Bench, that the Scottish Assembly is to be a body that has less control over its own policies and their implementation than any local authority in the land.<br/>
I tire of hearing from the Opposition Front Bench the proposition that we should have devolution and that the Conservative Party is entirely in favour of the principle of devolution, but that in every detail of devolution which we debate we must observe the principle of

giving no freedom of action to any elected body in Scotland. That is what the Opposition stand for. It sticks in the gullet of many English Members as well as in those of many Scottish Members. It is perfectly honourable to be opposed to the principle of devolution. What is not tolerable is to advocate acceptance of the principle but to deny in every detail the practice of devolution. I very much hope that the amendment will be rejected.</p>

<p>I think that the hon. Member for The Wrekin (Mr. Fowler) has missed the point, because we are not talking about a scheme put forward by the Government which is analogous to local government. We are talking about a scheme under which the Government themselves say that servants of the Scottish Assembly shall be members of the State Civil Service. That is a different position. The hon. Member's passionate words on devolution seem to be irrelevant.<br/>
The Minister in his speech earlier this afternoon grumbled about the fact that we on the Opposition Benches and some Government Members spend a lot of time looking for flaws, looking for possible areas of friction, problems and so on. Of course we do, partly because we believe that that is what Committee stages are about, but much more fundamentally because we believe that the Bill is a scheme fraught with possibilities of friction and that it is our duty to bring it to the public and to the Committee. The fundamental reason why it is fraught with possibilities of friction is that it is a scheme that is welcomed and endorsed, in an ambivalent way perhaps, by the Scottish National Party which has said again and again that it sees it purely as a stepping stone on the path of a separate Scottish State.<br/>
One of my right hon. Friends was asked to give an example of where this dilemma of divided loyalties in education might lie. I suppose that it could run something like this. It is perfectly possible&#x2014;perish the thought&#x2014;that the SNP could get a majority in the Scottish Assembly, could form the Scottish Government and could then adopt an education policy to the effect, roughly, that what was taught in schools should be devoted to the creation of a separate


Scottish State. In other words, the SNP might use the Scottish education system in order to advance its political objectives. I do not know whether it would, but as education is to be a devolved power, it would be perfectly possible for the Scottish Assembly to use every possible means, not only through the education system but through anything else, to advance political objectives.<br/>
The Minister says blandly that this would pose no problems for the civil servants who would, as it were, be temporarily assigned perhaps to the Scottish Assembly. But they would be administering a policy which was completely at variance with the policy of the United Kingdom Government as a whole and with the policy of Parliament as a whole, and profoundly antipathetic to the views of those particular civil servants. It seems to me quite evident that there could be a very serious conflict of loyalty. One might say that it would still be the duty of those civil servants to do what their masters in the Assembly told them to do.</p>

<p>We in the SNP would never dream of turning people's minds towards a Scottish State through education. We do not have to do that. If the hon. Gentleman came to Scotland more often, he could do the job far better than any of us can do it.</p>

<p>That intervention seems hardly worthy of comment.<br/>
However, I do not know why Labour supporters of devolution seem to be completely committed to the view that they should make a speech and then completely disappear from the Chamber as quickly as possible. I suppose that it is to avoid defeat in argument, which they find painful.<br/>
I was about to say to the hon. Member for The Wrekin, who has just left the Chamber, that when he talked about the UGC he was talking about a very different sort of circumstance from that which I have described. It is a QUANGO, a semi-independent body. By and large, it pursues its own line. No doubt, by and large, the civil servants assigned to it do what it was said that they do. But they are really a different kind of thing from an Assembly that might be controlled by the SNP.<br/>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Cleveland and Whitby (Mr. Brittan) made a powerful case from the Opposition Front Bench, the most useful thing that I can do is to return to the starting point of the debate.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman has used the education example.

<p>Yes. As I say, the Scottish Secretary, the Scottish Assembly and the Scottish Executive might decide, first, to move away from the tradition that we have in England, anyway, that the curriculum should not be centrally laid down, and go to the other system, which is widely used in other parts of the world. There is nothing unusual about the notion of a centrally determined curriculum in education. They might make that decision and then construct the curriculum in such a way as to put repeatedly and explicitly the clear political objectives of the groups that build up the notion of Scotland as a separate country. Given that we then have a centrally laid down curriculum, the civil servants would have to administer it.</p>

<p>I think that the hon. Gentleman does not understand what the proposals are. Education is devolved to the Scottish Assembly&#x2014;and the decisions. It may be wildly different from what takes place in England. That is the whole point of devolution. One can have different choices. As the hon. Gentleman will know, the Scottish education system is radically different from the English education system. But where is the conflict? The official will be carrying out the instructions of the Secretary in the Scottish Administration. He will not have a relationship with the United Kingdom Government.</p>

<p>I am saying that the Minister is being quite impractical and quite unreasonable in thinking that that will happen. No doubt that will be the correct constitutional position. No doubt these civil servants will be meant


to do what they are told to do by their immediate masters of the moment, namely, the Scottish Executive and so on. I do not dispute that. Nevertheless, the Minister is being blind if he does not see that there will be profound conflict where those civil servants are ultimately the servants of the United Kingdom Government, because that is really the position.</p>

<p>If the Minister does not understand it, I cannot help that. The civil servants will be in the service of the Home Civil Service of the State. They are members of the United Kingdom Civil Service. Ultimately, their career prospects will depend upon their membership of the Civil Service of the State as a whole. Ultimately, too, they will have a profound loyalty to the United Kingdom. I hope that they will still have a profound loyalty to this Parliament. Our civil servants are imbued with a very deep sense of loyalty to not only the United Kingdom but this Parliament.<br/>
As a matter of hard fact, I believe that civil servants temporarily assigned to the Scottish Assembly will find it not only distasteful but, in some cases, morally impossible to carry out a policy that is in total opposition to that of the United Kingdom Parliament.<br/>
It is no good the Minister making faces, because what I am saying is true.</p>

<p>Does the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison) appreciate that we already have in Scotland a total administrative devolution of education and that no conflict arises at present?

<p>The hon. Gentleman would be wiser not to intervene, because he has just made the most fatuous observation. As the hon. Gentleman says, a very great level of administrative devolution and, indeed, a form of political devolution obtains at present in Scottish education. That is right and admirable.

I am delighted that it exists. I should like that to continue. But that is a totally different thing from the circumstances that would prevail with the Scottish Assembly. After all, the Scottish Office is still a part of the United Kingdom. It has a lot of administrative power, but it is still bound by United Kingdom policy as a whole.</p>

<p>I have been trying to follow the hon. Gentleman's point. Education is a good example of something that is destructive of his point. After devolution, the Scottish Assembly is to have sole responsibility for education. The hon. Gentleman might have a case if the United Kingdom Parliament were to have some responsibility for education. There might be a clash then. However, when it is clear that education is a devolved matter, I cannot understand the hon. Gentleman's point that the civil servants carrying out the policy of the Secretary for Education would have a divided loyalty, because I do not see that there is a conflict of loyalty. To which other Minister will they have responsibility?</p>

<p>I do not often accuse the Minister of being legalistic, but he is now being ridiculously legalistic. I conceded earlier that the civil servant who, for the time being, is working for the Assembly has a duty to carry out the wishes of the Assembly. That is the full legal position. But I also said that there was far more to it than that. If one reaches the stage that the Scottish Assembly, because of there having been elected an SNP majority, uses every endeavour to try to create a separate Scottish country, quite separate from the United Kingdom, those civil servants will be placed in a position of most profound unease, and I believe that in some cases the position will be intolerable for them.<br/>
The idea that civil servants do not chat to each other and that there is no kind of Civil Service network, stretched across the Civil Service, as opposed to the political network via Departments, is a myth.</p>

<p>Cannot the example that my hon. Friend is trying to give be found in Quebec, where, if the civil servants were still part of a Canadian Civil Service,


there would be conflict over a matter such as the Quebec languages Bill? There would be a direct conflict not simply in terms of devolved powers but over the Canadian constitution, which the civil servants are also pledged to uphold.</p>

<p>I agree. I do not know enough about the position of the civil servants in Canada, but it seems to me that there might be a position in which the consciences of civil servants would be tortured.<br/>
For some reason the Minister is in a bad temper today, but I should like to try to explain to him why we on the Conservative Benches believe that at the very least the scheme he is putting forward is hard to follow and very confusing. Clause 21(9) says:
<q>A Scottish Secretary may appoint such officers and servants as he may think appropriate for the exercise of such of the powers mentioned in subsection (3) of this section as are for the time being exercised by him.</q>
That is a clear statement that the Scottish Secretary may appoint. We then jump to Clause 64(1), which says:
<q>Service as an officer or servant of a Scottish Secretary or of the Scottish Comptroller and Auditor General shall be service in the home civil service of the state, and appointments to any position as such an officer or servant shall be made accordingly.</q>
What the Minister is saying is that the second clause qualifies or explains the first. But at the very least to use the word "appoint" in this way is a source of considerable confusion. What do we think when we read that
<q>A Scottish Secretary may appoint",</q>
with the qualification in Clause 64 covered simply by the word "accordingly"?<br/>
The Minister and other hon. Members who support his point of view have said that "accordingly" means that everything must be on the same basis as for the Civil Service in the rest of the United Kingdom. The hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Sillars) lectured us because we were not trade unionists and did not understand that "accordingly" meant that all terms and conditions had to be exactly the same wherever the civil servants were, and so on. If the Minister does not think that our amendment is the right answer, he might at least concede that there is cause of confusion and that it would be

helpful to make clear to the country by another amendment&#x2014;perhaps even his own amendment&#x2014;what this all means.<br/>
I am not a lawyer, but I believe that courts called upon to construe "accordingly" might have the greatest difficulty. They might well come up with very different answers, which would cause all kinds of confusion. "Accordingly" is made to carry an excessive load. I know that the Minister touched on these matters, but we need a clear idea how the word can be construed as covering the following matters. It is not enough for him to say "this is what it covers". He must explain how.<br/>
For example, how does the word make sure that the Assembly could not suddenly decide that the civil servants in Scotland should be paid an extra 20 per cent, or that they should be paid less than civil servants in the rest of the United Kingdom? How does it determine the process of selection and training for the Civil Service? The Assembly might want a separate college in Scotland for training Scottish civil servants in particular attitudes of mind, perhaps to do with approaching independence.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-01-24a.1244.0" hansard_membership_id="3159" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2618" speakername="Mr. Dalyell" colnum="1244" time="">
<p>It is not simply a question of the Scottish Assembly wanting a separate Civil Service college in Scotland. Surely, if the Assembly is to be as different as all that, it will have to have a Scottish Civil Service college which serves its own needs.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-01-24a.1244.1" hansard_membership_id="6757" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/19861" speakername="Mr. Raison" colnum="1244" time="">
<p>That is a fair point. There is a problem, which would disappear if there were a separate Scottish Civil Service. I do not want there to be a separate Scottish Civil Service, but if it existed there would be a different answer. We can get into a tremendous muddle over this.<br/>
There are other very important problems, but the problem on which we are particularly entitled to ask for elucidation is that of temporary appointments by the Scottish Secretary. The assumption so far has been that those who serve the Assembly will be drawn from the national pool of civil servants. I can see that nobody will force people to work for the Assembly if they do not want to, but the Executive may say, for example, "We wish to appoint policy advisers". It may want to have them on a bigger scale than the present Government have


policy advisers, and on different conditions. It may say "We want more experts&#x2014;more engineers, scientists, doctors".<br/>
It seems to me that those people, having been appointed by the Scottish Secretary, then become a part of the State Civil Service. When I read those two clauses in conjunction, that is what they appear to mean. If that is not so, the Minister must show not merely that it is his intention that that shall not be so but that the Bill ordains that it shall not be so.<br/>
The Minister has not explained the position over temporary appointments, certainly not adequately. He has a duty to tell us what it all adds up to. Can the Scottish Secretary say "I wish to appoint so-and-so"? As I understand it the hon. Gentleman will tell us that the Scottish Secretary can say that, that he can say "I wish to appoint Mr. McTavish to a particular position, maybe as my special adviser on this or that matter". Mr. McTavish might be a man of questionable security background. I imagine that the portmanteau word "accordingly" includes some kind of security vetting of Mr. McTavish. It could mean anything under the sun.<br/>
Let us suppose that the Scottish Secretary says "I wish to appoint Mr. McTavish to this sensitive post" and then the Civil Service Minister says "I can't have that. He is a security risk." That might well all be done in a gentlemanly way, with nothing ever coming out, with everything very peaceful and taking place with the kind of co-operation that the Minister believes will always prevail. But the whole thing could boil up into a flaming political row, and then somebody would be in an impossible position.<br/>
The Minister must tell us exactly what he has in mind about these difficult matters. We are trying to produce examples of things going wrong. That is what Committee stages are all about.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Cleveland and Whitby, who made an excellent speech, put his arguments with great force and clarity. He showed&#x2014;and this is always the theme&#x2014;that there are anomalies and discrepancies, that the whole matter is fundamentally a mess because we are trying to graft this devolved thing on to a unitary State and it cannot work.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-01-24a.1246.0" hansard_membership_id="3159" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2618" speakername="Mr. Dalyell" colnum="1246" time="">
<p>The hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison) and other speakers have revealed the fundamental truth about the nature of a unitary State, that we cannot have our cake and eat it, that we cannot have in the Civil Service, as in so many other aspects, only part of a unitary State and a subordinate Parliament.<br/>
Before I come to the details of the amendment, I want to refer to one other matter raised by my hon. Friend the Minister of State. He is for ever saying that of course we shall be dealing with reasonable people, that we should assume a sense of co-operation. I wish that we could, but it is not a question of individuals being reasonable or unreasonable or being co-operative or unco-operative. In the very nature of the situation in which we find ourselves, there are deep differences of opinion. There are a lot of people, not only in the SNP, who want something different from that which I and the Government Front Bench want. There is no way of reconciling these views and being reasonable and co-operative.<br/>
It is possible that a great many Members of the Assembly would be reasonable, on the proviso that we acquiesce in what they want. What they want is a separate State. They will be co-operative provided they get what they want. Such demands are unacceptable to a great many of my right hon. and hon. Friends. In parenthesis, I should say that my right hon. and hon. Friends should be acquitted on one score. Hon. Members may know that there is a crucial meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party going on and I do not believe that those who have spoken from the Labour Benches should be attacked on the ground that they have subsequently deserted the Committee.<br/>
I wish to put a direct question to the Minister of State, a question to which I genuinely do not know the answer. If civil servants are to be paid out of the Scottish Consolidated Fund, does that in any way affect the contract on which they entered when they entered the Civil Service? This is a new situation. I ask this direct legal question. Has any adjustment to be made in the terms of the contracts of those who entered the Home Civil Service, albeit many years ago?</p>

<p>I am grateful.<br/>
I thought that the hon. Member for Cleveland and Whitby (Mr. Brittan) made a thoughtful and pertinent speech. But I do not support his amendment and I wish to explain why. Basically, I do not think that the amendment would come near to achieving what the hon. Gentleman seeks. Even if the amendment were carried it would simply paper over the cracks in the unity of the Home Civil Service, cracks which are far deeper and far more structurally significant than many hon. Members have yet realised. The hon. Member spoke of an air of reality and I suspect, by the way he is looking at me, that he perhaps agrees with what I am saying.<br/>
The reality is that this amendment, even if it were carried, could not be delivered by a United Kingdom Government, even in good faith. On previous occasions I have expressed fears concerning the problems of double loyalties in the Civil Service. The Civil Service cannot serve both God and Mammon, Whitehall and Westminster or old and new St. Andrew's House. A little to the gleeful satisfaction of the Minister of State, I had to accept, and I did it willingly, from Norman Ellis of the First Division Association and Leslie Christie of the Civil and Public Services Association that they did not see the problem of double loyalties arising since each of their members would be working to a Minister, either a Whitehall Minister or Secretary, or an Assembly Cabinet Minister or other Assembly Minister.<br/>
Once the Committee accepts that there is no problem of double loyalties we have a problem of duplication with a vengence. The hon. Member for Cleveland and Whitby put it in terms of "shadow" civil servants within Scotland. Never will so many cooks have been paid so much to stir so frequently the Scots broth. The Assembly will have its retinue of civil servants as will, presumably, the Secretary of State. I do not accept for one moment that in those circumstances the parallel drawn by my hon. Friend the Member for The Wrekin (Mr. Fowler) concerning the small number of civil servants who work for the University Grants Committee is in any way valid. That is a totally different situation. If anyone says that the Secretary of State will not have a retinue I am entitled to ask, from

whom will the Secretary of State get his advice and information?</p>

<p>Can I give an example of something which might conceivably happen and which is topical? The Select Committees of the House have the power to send for persons and papers. Such a Committee could say that it wished to examine something happening in Scotland and could summon civil servants in the employ of the Scottish Assembly to give evidence. It may be that the SNP, or some other party controlling the Assembly, might say to the civil servants "No, you must not go and give evidence." Can anyone dispute that at the least such civil servants will be faced with the most appalling problem of divided loyalties? This is something which no words of the Minister of State can brush away.</p>

<p>Presumably the civil servants in question would ask their Scottish Assembly Minister, or the Scottish Prime Minister, according to the importance of the issue, whether they should give evidence and what information they should give. That may create conflict between Royal High School Ministers and Westminster Ministers. The conflict may be a ministerial one rather than one involving the Civil Service. It is simply transferring the conflict from the Civil Service to Ministers.</p>

<p>That is true in a constitutional sense but would the hon. Gentleman not agree that there is an extra dimension to this in that it is not just a question of the civil servant saying that he does what the Royal High School Ministers says? He also knows that he is a member of the Home Civil Service and may in two, three or five years' time be in a United Kingdom Department. What sort of effect would his resisting the command of a Select Committee have on his future prospects?</p>

<p>I am not, perhaps, the man to ask, because I have to get into the position of devil's advocate. My reply to the hon. Gentleman would be that such a person would have to ask about his future relations with, for instance, those in the Treasury and the Civil Service Department on whom his future would have to depend. One thing that is true


about most civil servants is that, understandably, they are naturally extremely concerned about what their senior colleagues think of their performance. It may be that senior colleagues will be generous and say of someone who was fighting for a Scottish Minister that he was only doing his job. This raises the most delicate questions of career structure. Any civil servant in this position would be, to say the least, in a quandry. Like everyone else, he has to be concerned about his future.</p>

<p>Is it necessarily the case that civil servants summoned to appear before a Select Committee, have to go to their superiors and ask permission? Is there some Act which says that a civil servant is bound, under those circumstances, to turn to his Secretary of State, his boss, rather than obey the summons of the House? What would he fall back on to justify turning to his boss rather than obeying the will of Parliament?</p>

<p>I do not know the rules but I imagine that if a situation arose in which a civil servant in Edinburgh, loyal to the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson), as a member of a Scottish Government, coalition or otherwise, decided off his own bat to give controversial evidence to a Select Committee of this House without so much as a by-your leave from his Minister, it would be human and natural for the hon. Member to have something to say about that&#x2014;or the hon. Members for Argyll (Mr. MacCormick) and Dunbartonshire, East (Mrs. Bain) if they were similarly placed.</p>

<p>Clearly, if we are to have in the Scottish Assembly a position in which members of the Scottish Executive appoint civil servants, they will also have a responsibility to dismiss them should the occasion arise. In such a case I would certainly sack them at once.</p>

<p>This is very revealing&#x2014;that the Minister would sack the civil servants. The civil servants, having heard what was said, would naturally be concerned, and therefore perhaps it would be a very unwary civil servant in Scotland who came to this House to give evidence to a Select Committee. But that raises very considerable problems for the House&#x2014;</p>

<p>I do not think that my hon. Friend can fairly attack the Government and the Bill in that way, merely because of some of the odd answers given by Members of the Scottish National Party. As the Bill stands, a Minister cannot sack a civil servant, nor would a Scottish Secretary be able to do that.</p>

<p>Is my hon. Friend suggesting that the hypothetical civil servant will give his own personal opinion or a departmental opinion? There would be a difference if he gave the departmental opinion, which is what tends to happen before Select Committees. Which set of circumstances is my hon. Friend talking about? If he is talking of someone coming to give his own personal opinion and revealing damaging information&#x2014;to use my hon. Friend's own words&#x2014;that would cause problems in relation to the present unified United Kingdom Departments.</p>

<p>Then bang goes his loyalty to the Home Civil Service, and here again it is a question of trying to have one's cake and eating it. I think that my hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Sillars) is on a very real point here. In these circumstances, we cannot surely talk about loyalty to the Home Civil Service, and that is the break-up.<br/>
Let my hon. Friend imagine, if he will, the position that would arise if he had a post of senior responsibility in a Scottish Administration. Would he tolerate for a moment civil servants who were not loyal primarily to himself? Indeed, would he not be concerned to choose certain civil servants who, shall we say, were not unsympathetic to his point of view? I am not saying that he would want toadies, but the truth is that most senior Ministers are concerned to have around them not political supporters necessarily but people who are not unfriendly to what they are trying to do. That has implications for a Scottish Assembly.</p>

<p>Would it not be the case that, in both the present circumstances


and in a future devolved situation, if a senior civil servant went to a Select Committee of this House and revealed damaging information from his departmental knowledge, there would be problems, whether he was a member of the Department of the Environment or a member of the devolved Administration?<br/>
Bearing in mind my hon. Friend's second point, is it not the case that under the Bill it is perfectly possible for members of the Scottish Executive, like members of the present Cabinet, to employ as civil servants their own political advisers? Of course, one would be liable to choose as political advisers those who were closest to one in terms of political ideology.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend made a remark about Ministers having friendly people around them. I deduced an implication that Ministers in Government like to have, as their most immediately involved civil servants, people of a similar political persuasion. I do not know whether my hon. Friend is in a position to know about this, but from my experience in this Government this is a completely absurd proposition. I think that my comment would be true of nearly every Government.</p>

<p>I have not sought to put it quite like that. What I say is that if there are Ministers committed to the idea and concept of a separate Scottish State, or to more devolution&#x2014;the idea of maxi-devolution&#x2014;they would not find it tolerable to have as their most immediate and close advisers those who were absolutely committed to a United Kingdom view. There are shades of meaning here which are rather important. The impression I wish to convey is not that Ministers want to have friends around them. It is that they do not want to have people around them who are intellectually deeply unfriendly to their point of view.</p>

<p>I think that there is another dimension to this and that we have to face up to it. Very sadly, there have been instances recently of civil servants

applying political pressure. One of the most shameful things to happen during the life of the present Government, in my view, was the way in which civil servants at Swansea said that they would not handle cherished number plates. I do not care a fig about these number plates, but I am very worried that civil servants in the Department said that they would not process them. For several months they were not processed. It was not the Government who said that it would not be done. It was the civil servants who said that they would not do it. That was, I think, the first ugly glimmering of something that I hope we shall not see again. It seems to me to be the kind of thing that is more likely to happen in the sort of general situation that we are talking about here.</p>

<p>In the absence of my hon. Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Mackintosh), I have to try to beware of not taking over his mantle and conducting a seminar. All I can say is that I listened to the hon. Gentleman's comment with interest. If it is contended that the Secretary of State will have a tiny number of civil servants, I suggest that his days in the Cabinet will be numbered, partly because he will not be anchored in Whitehall and will be known by his colleagues to have to depend for basic information on the civil servants responsible to the Scottish Prime Minister and his Cabinet colleagues in Edinburgh. "Why deal with the monkey", the London Cabinet members might say, "when we can talk directly to the organ grinder?".<br/>
In these circumstances, the office of Secretary of State&#x2014;to which apparently my Front Bench attaches considerable importance, and to which considerable importance has been attached in every Labour document on this issue&#x2014;will almost certainly wither away. I suspect that in that proposition I have the support of my hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire.<br/>
I say to the hon. Member for Cleveland and Whitby that inextricably and inevitably, if an Assembly is established, Scottish civil servants will look to that Assembly more and more and to the Secretary of State less and less. The hon. Gentleman asked whose civil servants they are. There are issues here such as a common promotion ladder. I wonder


how selection is to be done on the basis of the present Civil Service examinations. I am not quite sure that this promotion ladder and the promotion system can continue to exist. But when the hon. Gentleman asks this kind of question, surely he must recognise that his amendment, even if it is passed, will form no kind of lasting constraint in regard to the unity of the Home Civil Service.<br/>
It is at this point that we should consider the unreality of the amendment. Supposing there were an English Conservative Minister for the Civil Service&#x2014;perhaps the hon. Member for St. Marylebone (Mr. Baker). Supposing there were a Government on the Left, sustained&#x2014;heaven help us&#x2014;by coalition support from the Scottish National Party in Edinburgh. The Edinburgh civil servants would have a loyalty to their Minister in Edinburgh and they would see their future, provided they wanted to remain in Scotland, as being on the side of Edinburgh. I do not like the word "masters" which is sometimes used to describe those for whom civil servants work, but certainly they would acquiesce with Scottish Ministers, and in any conflict they would cock the proverbial snook at the English Minister for the Civil Service. There would be very little that the Minister could do about it.<br/>
It is all very well for my hon. Friend the Minister of State to say that there is a clear decision by the Government that in 1978 there will be a unified Civil Service, and that this will be carried out by Clause 64. It is fine to make those assertions, but the very reality of the situation will bring about a position of flux where inevitably civil servants in Edinburgh will have to choose between the one or the other. My guess is that in terms of their future they will choose to work with the Edinburgh Assembly and put their eggs in the Assembly basket.<br/>
7.0 p.m.<br/>
No less than my hon. Friends I feel that the whistling-in-the-wind assertions in Clause 64 about servants of a Scottish Assembly being in the Home Civil Service of the State are wishful thinking. So, no less, is the amendment of the hon. Member for Cleveland and Whitby. The idea that there can be control by the Minister for the Civil Service is just another of

those notions that could not possibly endure in the real world.</p>

I said that if an attempt were made to make it work, it would be necesasry to change the wholly inchoate, vague and inexpressive form contained in the present Bill.

I may be thick about this, but we are told that the salaries will be decided by the United Kingdom Government and that the numbers will be decided by the Assembly and that this will come out of the Consolidated Fund for which the Scottish Assembly is responsible. We are then told that the Minister for the Civil Service could control numbers.</p>

<p>I never said that the Minister would control the numbers. Indeed, I said precisely the opposite. I am afraid that my hon. Friend has misunderstood me in a very basic way.</p>

<p>I hope that we shall get some clarification on this point. If the salaries are decided by the United Kingdom Government and the numbers decided by the Assembly, the extra moneys will be found out of the Consolidated Fund at the expense of other matters.</p>

<p>In that case the cost of all those extra civil servants, be it 750 or whatever, will come out of the Consolidated Fund. One of the results of our great devolution caper is that more civil servants will have to be paid out


of the Consolidated Fund at the expense of existing services in Scotland. One thinks of all the different services which exist, such as home helps and others. If we are saying that there will be more civil servants and fewer home helps, that ought to be made clear, at any rate by the time we come to the referendum.</p>

<p>This is an important point and I am sure that my hon. Friend does not wish to be unfair to the future Assembly. Is it not just as fair to argue that once the Assembly administration examines the structure of the Scottish Civil Service it might well reduce the numbers? What we are talking about at the moment is a Civil Service in Scotland that is run basically from the Whitehall end of the United Kingdom. Things could get better instead of worse.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-01-24a.1255.1" hansard_membership_id="3159" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2618" speakername="Mr. Dalyell" colnum="1255" time="">
<p>I do not see the prospect of the Assembly reducing the numbers, especially when one thinks of the great Assembly committees on health, education and housing that are to be set up and all the functionaries who will have to serve those committees. The Government themselves concede that there will be many hundreds of extra civil servants in Scotland and Wales. Presumably, they will be paid for out of the existing allocation. Incidentally, I believe that the allocation will be far more to the disadvantage of Scotland because people will scrutinise the pro rata basis on which it is made.<br/>
The point is that we shall have more civil servants and be less well off as a result of our devolution plans. That does not seem to be a very challengeable proposition.<br/>
Reference was also made to the question of "in and out". The Minister of State said that this was an extremely important matter. That brings us to the whole issue of the Scots who want a United Kingdom Civil Service career. Surely questions have to be asked about what, an entrant to the Civil Service opts for. For example, one of the options will be to the Scottish Assembly Civil Service, even given that this Act sticks, which I do not think it will.<br/>
In passing I should point out that careers such as we have seen at the end of this decade of people such as Sir William Armstrong, Sir Matthew

Stevenson and Sir Alexander Johnston will be impossible if the Bill is passed, because there will surely be some kind of separation between those who go for the different system of an Assembly and the rest of the Home Civil Service. I believe that the hon. Member for Aylesbury was quite right in saying that many civil servants will be tortured in their consciences in this matter.<br/>
For time reasons I shall not raise the whole question of the Foreign Office, on which I have asked the Foreign Secretary various questions. I go on to reflect that a devolved Scotland will be a very internal place. I ask the SNP whether it would not want civil servants who were not basically unsympathetic&#x2014;I put it in the form of a double negative&#x2014;to its basic aims. If there were an SNP Government, or if the SNP at any future date formed part of a governing coalition, would it not be tempted to promote those civil servants, or further the careers of those civil servants, whom it deemed shared its beliefs? I do not ask this as in any way a smearing question. I believe that it is the reality of the position.<br/>
Ministers surely have the right to have people around them who are not uncongenial&#x2014;I put this point by way of a rather careful double negative&#x2014;and to have civil servants who have some sympathy with what they are trying to do. What happens when what they are trying to do is contrary to the continuation of a British State in general and the unity of the Home Civil Service in particular?<br/>
Therefore, by a different route, I arrive at the same conclusion as the hon. Member for Aylesbury. It is one thing to ask civil servants to be loyal to political masters who may have particular political policies at the time. It is quite another to ask civil servants to be loyal both to the Home Civil Service and at the same time to Ministers whose very <i>raison d'&#x00EA;tre</i> is the break up of the British State. Therefore, can it not be said that the very possibility of separatist Ministers in Edinburgh alters the basis of the discussion that we are having?<br/>
Yet again, as so often, we find ourselves driven to the heart of the matter &#x2014;that one cannot have a subordinate Parliament in one part, though only one part, of a unitary State and, as a rider to that proposition, one cannot have a


Civil Service that will come more and more to depend on one Parliament and expect that it can be obedient to and integrated with the ministerial orders of a Minister in another Parliament. Like it or not, this clause is the thin end of the wedge in the break-up of the Home Civil Service. We cannot have loyalties to one while at the same time having loyalties to the other.<br/>
Finally&#x2014;and I am seeking to be brief &#x2014;I hope that when the Bill reaches another place a great deal of attention will be devoted to this clause. I hope that the noble Lords Lord Armstrong, Lord Allen and Lord Trend, who have had distinguished careers in the Civil Service, will regard it as a sacred duty to pay great regard to the provisions of the Bill. I hope that those noble Lords, who have been senior permanent secretaries in the British Civil Service, will give their minds to these matters when they are dealt with in the other place.</p>

<p>I shall not detain the House for more than a few minutes in dealing with this important amendment on which the argument has ranged widely.<br/>
I do not subscribe to some of the higher nights of fantasy which have been indulged in on both sides of the Committee about the workings of the Civil Service in relation to the Assembly. I share some of the Minister's optimism rather than some of the pessimistic thoughts which have been expressed as to the degree of co-operation. Some hon. Members thought that there would be an utter lack of such co-operation. However, I believe that the Civil Service, by virtue of its experience and traditions, will show its ability to adapt itself to this new situation.<br/>
I do not believe that the situation is as serious or as desperate as some hon. Members make out. However, we shall be entering a completely new dimension in terms of Civil service loyalty when the Scottish Assembly is established. The Civil Service must work with the Scottish Assembly and also with the United Kingdom Parliament. I believe that there will be a split in loyalty. The hon. Member for The Wrekin (Mr. Fowler) instanced the analogy of civil servants who work on the one hand for the University Grants Committee and on the other hand for a

Government Department. However, I do not believe that that argument stands up. The crucial difference that we are now discussing is that civil servants will be answerable to two different Executives. The moment that one introduces an Executive into the form of devolution one intends to set up, one also brings in certain strains. I do not think that the Government sufficiently recognise the strains that will be introduced.<br/>
However, I do not think the situation will be as bad as some have made out. I do not question the impartiality of the Civil Service, or indeed of individual civil servants, and to some extent the system may work despite what I am arguing. But the strains will arise on practical grounds, such as in career prospects. I see that the Minister does not agree with that remark, but it must not be shrugged off.<br/>
The moment that one has civil servants operating in two different Administrations when those Administrations can be of two different political complexions, one is dealing with a new situation and a new dimension. It is one thing to have a Civil Service that is answerable to one form of Administration before a General Election and then to cope with an Administration of a different political complexion after the election, but in this case we are asking civil servants simultaneously to be loyal to two Administrations which could be of a different political colour.<br/>
7.15 p.m.<br/>
I should not be quite so worried about the situation if we had a clearer division of responsibility, but we do not have such a division in the Scottish Assembly. I would be more sanguine if we had a better idea of the division of responsibility, but we do not even have that at present. Drawing on my own experience in Government&#x2014;and I served in Departments connected with agriculture and fisheries&#x2014;I came to learn that the agricultural colleges, for example, in Scotland are administered by one division in the Scottish Office. That subject will now be part of a split responsibility. The same argument applies to teaching and to the educational aspects of agriculture and fisheries and also to research and advisory matters. This process is sure to lead to duplication. One division will


have to be sub-divided in answering on the one hand to the Scottish Assembly and on the other hand to the Secretary of State.<br/>
If I may take the question of fisheries as an example, the freshwater aspect will be the responsibility of the Assembly, while sea fishing will be the responsibility of the United Kingdom Parliament. That is an important division of responsibility. But that is bound to lead to the kind of duplication envisaged by the hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell). It will lead to a clash of responsibilities. In regard to the functions of the agricultural colleges as between the Assembly and the United Kingdom Parliament, there will be some overlapping and an increase in areas of possible conflict. The same argument applies to fishing. The fact is that certain freshwater fish do not confine themselves to fresh water. There will be an overlap in that responsibility, and that conflict will extend to the Civil Service.<br/>
I should like to deal with some of the arguments deployed by the Minister in favour of the Government's proposals. He said that the Bill would ease recruitment and smooth the transfer from the present system to the new one. However, we should not look at only the short-term advantages of moving into a new system. The question of continuity is most important, but the ease of transfer should not be made the main reason for change.<br/>
I do not accept the Minister's argument that a unified Civil Services gives better promotional and career prospects. I cannot help remembering wryly what happened when we discussed police amalgamation. It was proposed that the police force in Shetland should be amalgamated into the police force in the northern counties. It was said that such a move would increase promotional prospects for constables in Shetland because they would be joining a larger police force. But the opportunity to become chief constable in the northern counties was assessed as one in 200, whereas the opportunity of making a similar promotion in Shetland was one in 14. Therefore, that argument can be easily stood on its head.<br/>
I come to the nub of the matter. The Minister said that his method of proceed

ing was the easiest and most straightforward solution to service the Scottish Assembly. I do not regard that as the right approach. I believe that an approach that is based on what is easy will eventually lead to an unstable system. I do not wish to support an unstable process. If we are to undertake this course, the only sure answer is to have a Civil Service that is particular to Scotland and to the Scottish Executive and Assembly.<br/>
If we are to have an Assembly with an Executive, this is the logical way to proceed and the logical conclusion of most of the arguments that we have heard. The Minister argued strongly against that view. If we do not proceed in this way, we are pushed back to the amendment. We must reduce the difficulties and the areas of conflict, and although the amendment may be second best, it may still be the best option before us.</p>

<p>I have listened with great interest to the arguments deployed on the question of the loyalty of civil servants. As so often, the hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) has thrown up interesting and unusual nuggets which could almost have come only from him. The idea of those in another place who have had experience as permanent under-secretaries giving the closest attention to this part of the Bill is a particularly useful suggestion and I hope that they will follow it up.<br/>
I am more open minded on the question of loyalty than on any other part of the Bill. On almost every other amendment, my natural inclination is to take issue with the Minister and to support anyone who can find a way of blocking this ridiculous Assembly. However, I am about to undermine the Minister's intellectual self-confidence by saying that I slightly agree with him on this issue.<br/>
I do not accept that there will be a tug of loyalties between two masters. Each civil servant will have only one master, and it is the clear duty of civil servants to obey the politicians to whom they are attached at any time. There will, of course, be differing political views which must bind the Civil Service as a whole.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison) mentioned the example of Select Committees. Difficulties could arise there, but this is a one-off, ad hoc question and I do not think that it will be beyond the ability of this House to say, if a Select Committee summons a civil servant, that he must attend or that he need not attend. Indeed, there may already be an answer to this problem. I do not think that such a one-off argument should draw in the wider issue of the loyalty of civil servants.<br/>
The hon. Member for West Lothian thought that there would be a slight problem over whether civil servants would look more to the Scottish Assembly or to the rest of the United Kingdom Civil Service. Surely if people are interested in, say, housing or education they will want wider fields for their efforts.</p>

<p>Indeed, but they are wholly interchangeable at present. If there is a magnet, I do not think that it will be the Scottish Assembly.<br/>
As for the problem of conscience, surely civil servants already face that difficulty. No doubt some of the civil servants who drafted the Bill to nationalise the oil industry thought that it was a load of rubbish. This is one of the problems that they have to face when they become civil servants. They know that the chances are that they will have to serve Ministers with whose political views they disagree. I do not accept that serving a Labour Minister in Edinburgh and being switched to a Department in Westminster under a Conservative Government would place intolerable strains on the loyalty of civil servants.<br/>
However, there can be no doubt that within Government circles in Edinburgh there will be civil servants responding to Socialist pressures from the Assembly and Conservative pressures from a Conservative Secretary of State. There will not be individual tugs of loyalty, but there will be confusion over the general differences of loyalties between those responsible to a Conservative Secretary of State and those responsible to a Socialist Scottish Secretary.<br/>
There are problems over loyalty which cannot be dismissed out of hand, though I slightly side with the Minister, and there

is also the problem of duplication which we have not touched on yet. However, we can say that whatever else happens, there will be more bureaucrats and they will be receiving higher salaries. This is one of the arguments that will weigh strongly in Scotland against the Bill in the referendum campaign. We are not talking about piffling numbers. The Scotland and Wales Bills together account for more than 2,000 extra civil servants as things stand, and we all know that Government estimates tend to be underestimates. The possibility of another 2,000 civil servants cannot be just brushed aside.</p>

<p>They will be paid for out of the Scottish Consolidated Fund and that will therefore be to the disadvantage of other services in Scotland.</p>

<p>I was coming to that point. The Minister said that the Assembly will pay for these extra civil servants. In one sense, they will. The Assembly will pay for them out of the Consolidated Fund, but, in reality, it will not be the Assembly which is paying but the taxpayers of the United Kingdom, and that is why my hon. Friend the Member for Halesowen and Stourbridge (Mr. Stokes) is right when he seeks to put the view of someone speaking for an English constituency. What would SNP Members say if it were proposed to set up a Parliament for Mercia, the name of the ancient Kingdom, as ancient as Scotland, for the area my hon. Friend the Member for Halesowen and Stourbridge (Mr. Stokes) represents, and the Scottish taxpayers had to pay out more money from their pockets? Everyone in Scotland would rightly feel indignant, and the people in the rest of the United Kingdom should be feeling indignant that they are being asked to pay more taxes to set up a useless Parliament for Scotland alone.<br/>
As the hon. Member for West Lothian said, Scotland will be receiving overall less funds as a result of the Bill. At present, we get &#x00A3;500 million a year, which is more than our per capita entitlement. We are likely to lose this because of the attention that the Bill has focused on Scotland's financial advantages. Indeed, this decreased amount will be further decreased because the extra civil servants will have to be paid for out of it.<br/>
The Minister criticised some of us for saying that conflict arises out of every


clause. But it is our duty to point out that fact. Let me show him how conflict arises out of this clause. The Scottish Secretary may ask for more civil servants if he wants them. They will have to be paid for out of the Scottish Consolidated Fund. Suppose the Scottish Secretary demands more civil servants and they are granted. He will then say that when the Consolidated Fund was allocated, the Assembly did not know that it would have the extra civil servants and it therefore needed more money. The Assembly would then come to this House and to the taxpayers of the rest of the United Kingdom for more funds. Either those funds would be granted, in which case my hon. Friend the Member for Halesowen and Stourbridge would have the right to feel aggrieved, or else they would be not granted, in which case another financial conflict would arise. That would be a conflict of the worst sort between the Scottish Assembly and Westminster. Once again a conflict inevitably arises from the amendment.<br/>
7.30 p.m.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Cleveland and Whitby (Mr. Brittan) candidly acknowledged that the amendment is not ideal. However, I shall support anything that gives Westminster more control. Ultimately it is Westminster that should have control as it is Westminster that is providing the money. As the hon. Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie (Mr. Dempsey) said, the man who pays the piper calls the tune. That is as it should be. I do not see why a civil servant from the Assembly should be treated any differently from any other home civil servant if those in Scotland are to remain part of the Home Civil Service.</p>

<p>Surely the hon. Gentleman will accept that the whole point and purpose of the Bill is to give greater democratic control over the bureaucracy in Scotland than presently exists. I am sure that as an English Member he will accept that the degree of control that we have over St. Andrew's House through this House is inadequate.</p>

<p>Rubbish. The purpose of the Bill is to try to buy off a few Scottish National votes. That is the <i>fons et origo</i> of the entire Bill, and everybody knows it.<br/>
The proposition of my hon. Friend the Member for Cleveland and Whitby would give Westminster more control. It may not be a proposition that I would have put before the Committee, but it would give the British people more control, and it is the British people who are providing the money. Therefore, the British people through their British Members of Parliament, should have the right of control. I support my hon. Friend's amendment on the ground that it goes at least some way down that road.</p>

<p>I shall be brief&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] Do not taunt me. There are those who put the constitution before dinner or, shall we say, the British constitution before their constitution.<br/>
This section of the Bill probably illustrates as well as any other that the Bill is false and a fundamental political lie. If we are to have, as the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Johnston) calls it, more democratic control over the civil servants in the Scottish Office, and if we wanted that, we would have Parliaments in Inverness-shire and Perthshire, and no doubt in Brecon. If we are to have a separate Executive with a separate Prime Minister, a separate Government and a separate Parliament, which is what they would be and which is what the Scottish National Party intends them to become&#x2014;that is, utterly independent&#x2014;but which in the meantime will be temporarily disguised with such idiotic expressions as Scottish Secretary, First Minister and all the rubbishy terms that have been invented to disguise reality, and if there is a division of power, it is utterly improper not to have the logical and properly inevitable result of a Scottish Civil Service.<br/>
Why does the Minister not want a Scottish Civil Service? It is not because he does not think it is sensible in logic or in terms of power but because the Civil Service does not want a Scottish Civil Service. It is in the interests of the Civil Service that Assembly civil servants remain part of the United Kingdom Civil Service. That compels a conflict, and that is the fallacy of not dividing the Civil Service in two.<br/>
Once again we have a total political falsehood. We have a situation in which the Government would inevitably introduce a Scottish Civil Service if they had


the slightest faith and belief in this constitutional measure. They would undoubtedly divide the Civil Service into two parts. Instead of having civil servants who have to render unto Caesar the things that are Emperor Westminster's and unto God the things that are Assembly God's, they would have to represent only their own commander.<br/>
I know that the Minister of State has a simple mind and that he has frequently been unable to understand where I would end, especially when he was my junior at the Bar. However, it is important that the Committee should not overlook the fact that if we are to go along this road the only justifiable course is to have a separate Scottish Civil Service, which the civil servants themselves reject and the Government funk introducing. That might in itself lead us further along the road to independence, but let us understand that that is where we are going if we go along with the Bill.<br/>
Why disguise that which will inevitably result from the conflict of two parliaments and two nations? It is inevitable that there will be a conflict of loyalties. My hon. Friend the Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) properly said that it is inevitable that the conflict will be between those who have to try to behave loyally to the different requirements of two political Executives.<br/>
I raise another matter which has not been overlooked and which emerged from the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for North Angus and Mearns&#x2014;job opportunities. If there is a dispute whether a certain power lies with the Assembly or with Westminster, it is inevitable that the Assembly will claim it.<br/>
Civil servants are not other than human beings, and the enlargement of their power and influence, their office and staff, as regionalisation has shown, is something that occurs, however unmotivated it may be. If an example is required, it is necessary only to consider the Fife region. On reorganisation the region did not alter, but the chief executive of the region, the chief constable, the head of planning and the head of education managed, by doing the same job in the same region, to increase their salaries considerably.<br/>
That is what will happen if there is devolution. There will be an urge for

more responsibility, more offices and more power. That will inevitably result in a pull by the civil servants who happen to be employed in Scotland to draw back power unto themselves.<br/>
The logic that there should be a separate Civil Service with its own responsibilities, sailing in its own boat and, if necessary, sinking in its own boat, is one which civil servants do not dare to risk, and which the Government do not I dare to undertake. It is that dishonesty; that arises from the clause that causes me to feel that the conflicts of responsibility and interest that the clause demonstrates indicate the rottenness and corruption of the Bill as it stands.</p>

<p>The Minister of State sought to explain Clause 64, but as it is impossible to follow his explanation in the light of the devastating criticism of my hon. Friend the Member for Cleveland and Whitby, it is necessary to refer to the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum. It states:
<q>The staff of the Scottish Secretaries and of the Scottish Comptroller and Auditor General are to be members of the home civil service and their salaries will be paid out of the Scottish Consolidated Fund.</q>
But something quite different appears in Clause 64&#x2014;a distinction upon which no comment has yet been made. There is the phrase, which I have not come across in any other document,
<q>home civil service of the state".</q>
What is the difference between Home Civil Service and
<q>home civil service of the state"?</q>


I suggest that the use of the word "state" implies that we are talking about an independent Scottish State. Otherwise, I do not understand the purpose of including "of the state".<br/>
Again, as was pointed out by my hon. Friend the Member for Cleveland and Whitby, Clause 21(9) places no limitation upon those whom the Scottish Secretary may appoint to be officers and servants. The only qualification is anybody "he may think appropriate".<br/>
The Minister of State appears to believe that the wording of Clause 64 is such as to allow the Secretary of State to appoint as an officer or servant only someone who is a member of the Home Civil Service. Manifestly, that is not so. It would be possible for a Scottish Secretary to appoint as a special adviser someone who was not a member of the Home Civil Service. Indeed, Ministers in this Government have appointed special advisers who are not members of the Home Civil Service. I do not believe that Professor Lord Kaldor, who was special adviser to the Chancellor of the Exchequer during his worst period at the Treasury, was a member of the Home Civil Service. Is the Minister of State telling the Committee that it will be impossible for a Scottish Secretary to appoint as a special adviser someone who is not a member of
<q>the home civil service of the state"?</q>
I believe that the amendment will improve an incomprehensible clause. I hope that my hon. Friend will therefore press it to a Division.</p>

<p>I think that almost all who have spoken in the debate, which has been quite lengthy, have made clear that, unless we seek to amend the clause and clear up the confusion, we shall have an administrative nonsense in Scotland and a ludicrous situation which will be a recipe for conflict.<br/>
The Minister of State indicated that no great problems would arise if we accepted the clause as drafted. That advice was given on the basis of experience in dealing with problems between different Government Departments. I hope that he accepts that we are dealing with liaison not between one Government Department and another but between

civil servants serving different Governments. Indeed, as my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Sproat) pointed out, those Governments may comprise different parties pursuing totally different policies. The idea of having the kind of non-liaison that we have between Departments existing between two separate Governments is a nonsense.<br/>
This would be a difficult problem to resolve in any event, but the Government have tried to arrive at a halfway house which is not a logical constitutional stopping point. The Minister, in his initial reply, tried to create confusion about the responsibility of the Civil Service. First, he told us that the numbers of civil servants employed by the Scottish Assembly would be determined only by the Assembly, that wages for those civil servants would be determined by United Kingdom arrangements and that gradings would be determined by the Civil Service Department.<br/>
Is the Minister seriously suggesting that the Assembly will be entirely free to decide the numbers of civil servants, which will be variable, and that the CSD will come in on the basis of job specification, presumably applied by the Scottish Executive, and say what is the appropriate grading for the job? How is the CSD meant to do that without detailed knowledge not only of policies but of the staff complement and prospects of the Scottish Executive? My hon. Friend the Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) said that there could be a logical argument for a separate Scottish Civil Service but that there is no logical argument for this halfway house, which will be very messy.<br/>
If the Assembly is to be responsible for determining the numbers of civil servants to be employed in the Scottish offices, who will be responsible for supervising the efficiency of those sections and for making sure that the numbers are right for the appropriate responsibilities?<br/>
7.45 p.m.<br/>
Despite what has been said by some of my hon. Friends, Ministers do not employ and make sure that civil servants work hard and do not waste time. Ministers have nothing to do with such matters. At least, that was my experience. Unfortunately, Ministers do not


decide the numbers or determine who goes into different jobs. We assume that the Civil Service Department and other experts ensure that we do not have too many people doing the jobs that have to be done.<br/>
Are we to have a separate Scottish Civil Service Department to supervise the civil servants employed in the Scottish Office and to ensure that the numbers are right for the appropriate responsibilities? Will the Minister advise those who are employed in the Scottish Office now how matters will work out should this constitutional nonsense come into effect?<br/>
Will there be a separate building for the Secretary of State's Department and separate buildings for those civil servants who will be answerable to the Scottish Secretaries?<br/>
What will happen in areas of shared responsibility? For example, part of the responsibility for the appointment of members to the Scottish Development Agency will lie with the Scottish Assembly. The guidelines setting out what the SDA is to do are laid down by the United Kingdom Administration. The SDA has shared responsibilities in many areas of Government activity. We shall have civil servants with divided loyalties.<br/>
Civil servants employed by the Scottish Assembly, which will not be similar to any other Department, will be answerable to the Scottish Secretary. The Bill provides that any Minister of the Crown may ask any Scottish Secretary for information that he may require. That appears in Clause 34. What will be the position of civil servants employed by and answerable to a Scottish Secretary who are asked to prepare a brief for a big block grant&#x2014;I am sure the Minister accepts that civil servants working for Scottish Secretaries will be asked to prepare briefs for a big block grant&#x2014;and civil servants in the Treasury who will undoubtedly want the necessary information to argue for a smaller block grant? There is bound to be haggling over such a matter as the block grant. Where will the Treasury get information about the needs of the Scottish Executive but from civil servants employed by the Scottish Administration? Does the Minister accept that civil servants will be asked by Scottish Secretaries to prepare a brief for a big block grant and that, on the

other hand, others may be asked by the Treasury to prepare a brief for not such a big block grant? There is bound to be a conflict of loyalty in that event.<br/>
I hope that the Minister will at least accept that, irrespective of his assurances, we are dealing with a clause that is far from specific. It appears that the Scottish Executive will have power to appoint anyone that it wishes and that, having done so, the appointment will be made "accordingly". Unless we improve the clause by accepting the amendment, we shall create a constitutional nonsense.</p>

<p>Acceptance of the amendment would remove one obvious problem. As the Minister of State said, the numbers of civil servants will be determined by the Assembly, the gradings will be decided on the advice of the Civil Service Department and salaries will be fixed in United Kingdom negotiations. Acceptance of the amendment will to some degree achieve uniformity between Government Departments and the Scottish Office. This will make things a great deal easier and I am sure that the civil servants, whether they are working for the Scottish Assembly or for other Government Departments, will be thinking along the same lines.<br/>
The Government are creating a constitutional nonsense. They are about to appoint 1,000 extra civil servants which will cost a great deal of money and create more confusion and expense. This problem shows once again that the Government have arrived at legislation which does not make sense, which will create confusion and which will lead to constant strife and misunderstanding. That will not help Scotland.<br/>
It is sad that we are discussing this nonsense on a day when Scotland has been told that it has 203,000 unemployed &#x2014;the highest figure since the peak of the depression in the 1930s.</p>

<p>Hon. Members have asked a number of specific questions and I shall do my best to answer them&#x2014;as quickly as I can because I sense that the


Committee wishes to reach a conclusion as soon as possible.<br/>
The hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison) described a fantastic scenario of an SNP-dominated Assembly trying, with its education policy, to poison the minds of the children of Scotland with nationalist propaganda. He ought to give more credit to the Scottish people. He must know that they would not put up with such a situation for long. It is a democratic society, and I do not see anyone, of whatever political persuasion, getting away with that. To be fair to the Scottish National Party, I do not believe that even it believes that that would be a wise policy.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) is always talking about an SNP-dominated Assembly. He should have more confidence in the capacity of the Labour Party to win seats in the Assembly. It is our intention to do that. I do not know whether his distaste for an Assembly is such that he would be prevented from supporting the election of Labour Members to the Assembly. It is unrealistic to talk in terms of an SNP-dominated Assembly. The Assembly will be constituted according to the wishes of the electorate.<br/>
My hon. Friend tends to argue against separatism rather than devolution. He tries to switch the argument so that it corresponds with his feelings, but he went far too far, even for him, when he suggested that civil servants would be tortured in their consciences because of the conflicts. That does not square with his submission that there is no conflict of loyalties. My hon. Friend the Member for West Lothian latches on to a certain speech which he repeats whether or not it is relevant to a particular amendment. He overdid his argument about conflict.<br/>
I asked a number of hon. Members what would be the conflict for a civil servant working for the Scottish Education Department, post-devolution. I have not received an answer that convinced me that this will create conflict. This has been a parrot cry.<br/>
Compared with some of our other debates this has been relatively interesting and balanced. Not only did the amendment take a fair pounding but it emerged

that the supposed conflict is more chimerical than real.</p>

<p>I wanted to ask a specific question on the issue of the block grant. Is not a civil servant's responsibility to a Minister in the Assembly when preparing a submission on the block grant in conflict with what he might have to submit to a United Kingdom Minister?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-01-24a.1272.3" hansard_membership_id="4865" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2398" speakername="Mr. Smith" colnum="1272" time="">
<p>I shall try to answer my hon. Friend briefly. I do not believe that there would be conflict because those civil servants involved in compiling financial statistics for the Scottish Administration would be answerable to the Scottish Secretary for whom they worked, and not to other Ministers. With one or two minor exceptions, such as freshwater fishing and sea fishing, the big Departments' civil servants will be responsible to one member of the Executive and not to two. Only if their responsibility were to two sections of the Government would such a conflict arise.</p>

<p>The civil servants would be responsible to two Departments because of the right of United Kingdom Ministers to ask for information. Where will the Treasury get its information on the block grant unless it is from the civil servants?</p>

<p>That does not mean that there will be a double responsibility. The proposition that it would mean a double responsibility stretches the situation beyond the imagination of even the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor).<br/>
The hon. Member for Cathcart asked a number of questions about the r&#x00F4;le of the Civil Service Department. Civil servants are normally delegated by the Civil Service Department to different Departments under the supervision and control of the Civil Service Department. We expect that to continue after devolution. There will be discussions with the Civil Service Department about it. We expect the Scottish Administration to have its own staff. We intend that there shall be discussions with the CSD staff institutions about that matter.<br/>
There has been much argument about the appointment of civil servants by Ministers. There was a difference between the allegations of those who speculated about how it is done and the experience of those who have been in Government. Ministers have little influence over the civil servants who serve them. It is not possible for Ministers to dismiss civil servants without going through the agreed procedures. My hon. Friend the Member for West Lothian asked whether civil servants' contracts would be affected if they elected to go to the Scottish Assembly rather than to the Treasury for instance. Their contracts would not be affected because they would be members of the United Kingdom Civil Service.<br/>
I was asked if it would be possible for the Scottish Secretary to appoint political advisers. Yes, it would be possible. It would also be possible for the Scottish Secretary to appoint civil servants for five years on a temporary basis according to procedures which recognise short-term appointments. This could be done on the same basis as it is done by Whitehall Departments.<br/>
The basic point is how we organise the Civil Service for the Scottish Administration following devolution. It must be either a unified Civil Service or a separate Civil Service, as was argued by the hon. Members for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) and Inverness (Mr. Johnston).</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-01-24a.1273.0" hansard_membership_id="6757" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/19861" speakername="Mr. Raison" colnum="1273" time="">
<p>The Minister has devoted some minutes to explaining what this thing is all about. Does he really think that the single word "accordingly" provides an adequate summary of all that he has had to compress in his two speeches?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-01-24a.1273.1" hansard_membership_id="4865" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2398" speakername="Mr. Smith" colnum="1273" time="">
<p>I have had to compress my remarks because of the time. It is not just a question of the word "accordingly". There is more to it than that. The word "accordingly" is just the last word in the sentence which ends
<q>and appointments to any position as such an officer or servant shall be made accordingly".</q>
It does not hang on the word "accordingly". My hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Sillars) made an interesting speech. He understood the purpose of the clause. I believe, and I am certainly advised, that the effect of

the clause would be that each person who was appointed would require to have a certificate of qualification issued by the Civil Service Commissioners under the procedures we adopt.<br/>
8.0 p.m.<br/>
It is possible to consider a separate Civil Service. Stormont had separate civil servants, but I do not know whether that made a great deal of difference, given the common grades and entrance qualifications with those of United Kingdom civil servants. I discussed this matter with former civil servants of the Stormont Administration, and opinions amongst them were divided. Some of them preferred a unified system and others separate systems. It is difficult to be dogmatic about this.<br/>
Without being uncharitable to the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns, I must say that he was being a little bit too hard on some aspects of the proposal. The question of career prospects is a reasonable point. There is the difficulty with a separate Civil Service of the young person who, entering it, knows that he will have to work within that Scottish Civil Service and will not be able to move, if successful, to the Treasury or Foreign Office. He will not have the whole of the Civil Service open to him as it is open to those who do not serve under the Scottish Administration.<br/>
Some hon. Members said that one of the reasons the Government did not want a separate Civil Service was that the Civil Service was against it. We took into account the views of the professional associations and the trade unions which represent the civil servants. That was an elementary thing for a Government concerned with good industrial relations to do. They were strongly of the opinion that there should be a unified Civil Service. That view was not a determining factor, but was one that the Government took into account.<br/>
The absurdity of hon. Members' fantasies was shown when they were pressed to give practical examples of conflicts that would arise. The tone of the debate reinforces my recommendation to the Committee that we should retain the clause and reject the amendment.</p>

<p>The purpose of these amendments is to clarify the clause by ensuring that the status of staff of the Registrar General and the Accountant of Court as civil servants is put beyond doubt. Provision is made also that at a future date other staff may be designated as civil servants by Order in Council, which is one of the Orders in Council arising from the Prerogative.<br/>
The staff of the Registrar General and of the Accountant of Court may have been thought not to be covered by the terms of Clause 64 as originally drafted. In both cases, they are recruited by the Civil Service Commission and are treated as civil servants. But by statute, if not in practice, the Registrar General and the Accountant of Court appoint their own staff. Any anomaly which arises can be put right by administrative means in present circumstances. Since all are responsible to the Secretary of State. There was, therefore, doubt as to whether they could be termed staff of a Scottish Secretary and accordingly be civil servants within the terms of the Bill. These amendments will put that matter right.<br/>
I hope that that explanation, though brief, will be satisfactory to the Committee on a fairly minor matter.</p>

<p>I have no objection to the amendments as proposed, but I have a question to raise on a small matter of grammar. It seems curious that the proposed subsection (4) should provide that
<q>Her Majesty may by Order in Council designate any person for the purposes of this section".</q>
I should have expected these persons to be designated as something, but as worded the amendment seems to leave them in the air. What is meant is obvious, but I should think it preferable to put it in somewhat clearer form, since designation ought to be designation as something.<br/>
There is no matter of controversy between us, but perhaps the proposed subsection could be tidied up.</p>

<p>I wish to raise a question which I put on an earlier and, perhaps, not so apt occasion as this. I was a member of the Public Accounts Committee for three years, and I know of the great assistance given to that Committee

by the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff.<br/>
What is the Government's thinking about the establishment of the Comptroller and Auditor General's Department for the Scottish Assembly, and where do they expect all the necessary skill to come from? This is a highly specialised job. Would the Scottish Comptroller and Auditor General be appointed from the existing Comptroller and Auditor General's Department? It is not all that easy to hive off 40 or 50 people from an existing organisation, and one cannot imagine that the Comptroller and Auditor General's Department in Scotland could have many fewer than 40 if it were to do its job properly. For the United Kingdom, the number of staff is over 600.<br/>
I ask my hon. Friend the Minister of State, therefore, to tell us the Government's thinking on the mechanics of the provision of a Comptroller and Auditor General's Department at Edinburgh.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) raised this matter previously at a time when we were considering another question, and I think that this is the appropriate point for it. The proposal in the Bill is that the Scottish Comptroller and Auditor General will have his own staff, who will be members of the Home Civil Service. The detailed staffing arrangements will be for the Scottish Comptroller and Auditor General to consider in due course.<br/>
I should say that there has been representation made to the Government from the Exchequer and Audit Department Association suggesting that there might be a common citizenship concept for dealing with this matter. There is nothing in the Bill to prevent some form of common citizenship arrangement being devised. It is used by some Government Departments.<br/>
Obviously, in the context of different Administrations the question is slightly more complicated, but the Bill does not rule that device out. It is one of the matters which we should like to discuss with the Scottish Administration when it is in being.</p>

<p>I do not want to continue this discussion, but how exactly does the


concept of common citizenship enter into the matter? I ask that question in ignorance, because I do not understand. Perhaps the Minister would care to write to me.</p>

<p>I do not think I need write to my hon. Friend. It is, in effect, the sharing of a common pool of staff. Already the Departments of Transport and of the Environment have common citizenship, as do the Departments of Trade, of Industry and of Prices and Consumer Protection.<br/>
This is a matter which has to be discussed with the Scottish Administration. The Bill, as I say, does not rule out such a possibility, and the Government have it under active consideration in preparing for the new Assembly and Administration.</p>

<p>These amendments enable us to have a look, albeit brief, at the future of the rate support grant after the Assembly is set up. Our object here is to insert more clarity into the nature of the future relationship between those involved in the rate support grant order negotiations at every level.<br/>
In order to explain the amendment, we must look for a moment at the rate support grants in general and how they work relative to the new proposed system. As the Committee knows, the rate support grant is now the main, and in many respects the only, organ of Government support for local government in Scotland and England&#x2014;but as far as we are concerned, for local government in Scotland.

It is an immensely complex system. It involves a great deal of calculation behind the scenes by the Civil Service and by local government officials.<br/>
In general the system is that, in consultation with each other, the Civil Service and local officials draw up an agreed total of aggregate expenditure expected to be incurred in the years in question by the local authorities. They then, as a separate calculation, parcel this out, according to what I always regard as immensely complicated formulae, among the various local authorities involved.<br/>
I stress the complication of all this because I doubt whether anyone on the Government Benches will dispute that we who are not involved in these negotiations always find it extremely difficult to get into the swing of understanding the negotiations each year when they take place. I personally find that if I have to indulge in a period of study of them for some particular debate, by the end of it I think that I am beginning to understand something about it, but when I come back to it again in the next year, I might as well have started from scratch because it has all gone again.<br/>
In the future, the system will be further complicated by the fact that there are to be two completely different sources of local authority expenditure. In Schedule 15 there is a list of what are to be in the future the reserved functions of local authorities and other bodies. These are the functions which to be reserved entirely to the decision of central Government through the Secretary of State, although they are carried out by local government or other bodies either to a very great extent or entirely.<br/>
There is on page 28 a long list of functions. Some of them are fairly small ones and some are very big ones. The most obviously big one at the beginning is that of police, which is an extremely expensive service. It will continue once the Scottish Assembly is set up to be administered as it is now, by local government. It will be grant aided, of course, in the way that it is now, with the exception that the local authorities will have to rely upon getting the support for this, as of now, as part of the rate support grant settlement. But this will now be made up differently, in that the Secretary of State and central Government will have


to negotiate with the Scottish Assembly and the Scottish Executive to establish what element in the rate support grant will be relevant to these reserved functions.<br/>
This is where the necessity for our amendment comes in. If the Committee will imagine the situation, it will be that for, as an example, the police&#x2014;a very expensive service&#x2014;the Scottish Executive and the Ministers under the Scottish Secretary will be told by the United Kingdom Government, through the Secretary of State, what the Secretary of State thinks is necessary for running the police service, or running any of the other services mentioned in Schedule 15.<br/>
The words written into the Bill which I wish to delete by the amendment are that the Scottish Secretary shall
<q>have regard to such considerations affecting reserved functions as the Secretary of State may bring to his notice.</q>
That seems to be a pretty good euphemism for what I imagine will happen.<br/>
If the Scottish Secretary and the Scottish Executive are merely to have regard to such considerations as are drawn to their attention, surely what it means is that they will have to carry out what the Secretary of State tells them. If the Secretary of State says that &#x00A3;50 million will be needed to run the police service through local government in the coming year, the Scottish Executive will have no option. It will have to "have regard to" that, as it is put in the Bill. It will certainly have to accept that figure. No doubt it can argue if it wants to. But I cannot see&#x2014;I hope that we can be assured that this is not the case&#x2014;it being able successfully to deny the validity of the figure that is presented to it by the Secretary of State.<br/>
For this reason we think that the wording in the Bill ought to reflect the imperative nature of the requisition on the Scottish Secretary by central Government. Therefore, it would read from line 40 on page 30:
<q>The Scottish Secretary shall act in accordance with such directions affecting reserved functions as the Secretary of State may make.</q>
Our contention, therefore, is that the words that we wish to insert much more accurately convey what I believe will be the situation.<br/>
For that reason, I very much hope that the Government will accept the two amendments, because it is surely desirable that there should be no doubt in anyone's mind of the nature of the relationship.<br/>
I make one or two points about the relationship between the Secretary of State's interest and the Scottish Secretary's interest in the rate support grant order. The first point that I make is in the nature of a question. It is a fundamental question as to the drafting of the Bill, on which I would ask the Secretary of State for some advice. I may have got it wrong, but it appears to me that the nature of the wording may be defective.<br/>
8.30 p.m.<br/>
As the Committee knows, the Scottish Assembly will be empowered to legislate within the scope of many of the functions that we are giving to it. One of those functions is local government. The Assembly will be able to legislate on local government.<br/>
It follows from that that the Scottish Assembly will be able to change the rate support grant system in future if it wishes to do so. I presume that a Bill could be introduced into the Assembly, which could pass it and make it an Act of the Scottish Assembly, for an entirely new subsidy system.<br/>
The Scottish Assembly is not empowered to alter, repeal or amend the Scotland Act, as this Bill will become when passed. But it can alter, repeal or amend the Local Government Acts. Therefore, what will happen if in the future the Scottish Assembly were to decide to have a completely new subsidy system which was unsuitable, perhaps, or did not work in very well with the interests of the Secretary of State and the Government in the supporting of the reserved functions? We should then have two different systems of local government financial support&#x2014;first, the RSG system, which for the reserved functions would be continuing, I presume; second, a new system brought in by legislation of the Scottish Assembly.<br/>
First, I should like to know whether I am right in thinking that this complete difference could take place between the two bodies in the future. My second question follows from the first. If it is


the case that we could move towards two different systems because of the different political control of each part of the setup, would it not be wiser to operate this system as laid down in the Bill by having two RSG settlements instead of one that is bundled in with another?<br/>
I see no reason why the Secretary of State and the United Kingdom Government or the Scottish Office should not draw up their own RSG arrangements exactly as they do now for their own reserved functions, of which they are retaining control, and pass that to local government. The Scottish Assembly and the First Secretary and his Ministers have no standing in this matter at all. It is a central Government responsibility.<br/>
The Secretary of State could have his RSG settlement exactly as he does now, calculated and discussed as it is now, exactly as it has always been, and the Scottish Secretary could have his RSG settlement, again calculated as it is now, in negotiations between the Scottish Executive and Scottish Ministers and the local authority association, COSLA. If that were done, many of the undesirable features of the present joint system would be eliminated.<br/>
That brings me to my next point, which concerns the nature of the support in future that central Government will give for their central functions. It seems to me that we are working back&#x2014;not wittingly; I think unwittingly&#x2014;to the old system of specific grants, which we have been trying to get away with&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: 'Oh."] It was a Freudian slip. We have been trying to get away from that system.<br/>
I take again the example of the police, as it is, perhaps, the clearest and most obvious example. What will happen is that the local authorities will receive in future a specific grant for police. They will not be able&#x2014;I hope that I can be assured that this is true, anyway&#x2014;to pocket the portion of RSG which is earmarked for police support and decide to cut down the police force and spend the money on bigger hospitals. It is important that everyone concerned should be assured that that will not be so.<br/>
That again emphasises the absolute wall that we are building between these two chunks of the RSG. That wall is patently there, in my opinion&#x2014;unless I

have got all this wrong. I should be delighted to be corrected if I have it wrong. It seems to me that we are building in between the two chunks of the RSG a wall that absolutely demands that we recognise these two sections of RSG, negotiated by two sets of individuals, two different Government Departments&#x2014;the Scottish Executive's Department and the Secretary of State's Department representing the United Kingdom Government.<br/>
There is a great deal more to think and talk about and to cause concern in this innocuous clause. There is much more than at first appears. The amendments are designed to do quite a simple job on the face of it&#x2014;to represent as faithfully as we can in language the nature of the relationship between the Secretary of State and the Scottish Executive and Scottish Ministers when it comes to those subjects which local government administers but which central Government have the total interest in controlling and for which they proide the whole rate support grant money.<br/>
The two amendments are a genuine attempt to make the wording of the Bill more closely correspond to the reality of the situation. Going with them are the other questions, which go much wider. I shall understand if the Secretary of State cannot give a full answer tonight, because we shall have to return to the subject in another place, and if we are ever given time&#x2014;a matter about which we cannot feel confident these days&#x2014;at another stage in the House of Commons.<br/>
I hope that I shall carry every hon. Member with me when I say that the rate support grant system is in all conscience difficult enough to understand anyway. If we are to put into it two different sources and two different methods, with two different Government Departments dealing with COSLA and the local authorities in Scotland, the complexity that we find difficult now will become almost impossible. In the interest of clarity and correctness, to make it easier for all to know where they stand, I very much hope that the amendments will be accepted.</p>

<p>I made a long speech on the previous amendment, and it would be unfair of me to detain the Committee for long now. But the amendment raises


the question of the increasing disquiet felt by many local authority heavyweights in Scotland about the idea of having to deal with both an Assembly and the previous people with whom they have dealt.<br/>
Therefore, I repeat that people such as Councillor Charles Snedden of the Central Region and some of his colleagues who have to deal with finance, people such as Councillor Alex Bell in the Lothian Region, say to me more and more that they are extremely concerned about the future of local government as they have known it. They wonder whether the present Government have any idea how the Assembly will tie in with local government.<br/>
I leave it with one question: how do these arrangements fit in with the continued existence of the regions? If we keep them, there will certainly again be heavy duplication in the financial structures, which are difficult enough and which the Bill seems to make even more complicated.</p>

<p>The rate support grant is indeed of great importance and considerable complexity.<br/>
I notice in the schedule that it is not only police but ports that are reserved functions of local authorities and other bodies. I share the desire of those who want to see as much clarity in this matter as we can give. I hope that the Secretary of State will be able to spend a minute or two explaining how he sees the working of the clause. I am not so far convinced that the amendment will add to clarity. If it does, so much the better.<br/>
I should like first to ask whether the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger), who moved the amendment, is right in saying that it would be open to the Assembly to set up an entirely new subsidy system, as he described it. I am not clear that that would be so. That might be challenged, probably successfully, as going outside the Assembly's powers as stated earlier in the Bill.<br/>
My second question concerns the consultations with associations of local authorities and consultation generally. At present rather elaborate consultations go on. Although there are complaints about them, those who take part in them

usually come out from them feeling that they have made their point and that some attention has been paid to it. Is it the intention of the clause that this form of consultation will carry on? I follow that it may be with different people, but I take it that the same type of consultation is intended.<br/>
Such consultations will have to be tripartite. The hon. Member for Ayr spoke of building walls and of returning from the system of general grants to specific grants for specific circumstances. I was not certain whether he wanted the walls to be erected higher or removed altogether. If we have two systems the walls would be thicker and higher. It seems that the consultations must be tripartite to some extent. If, for instance, the police is a reserved subject, it will have to be a subject of which the consultations with the Scottish Secretary will take some account.<br/>
I should be grateful if it could be explained how these consultations will be carried on. Although I see that to have an absolutely firm direction, as the amendment suggests, might increase the size and height of the wall, it might clarify matters and make it easier for local authorities to understand with whom they have to deal. I hope that the Secretary of State will do his best to enlighten us on these points.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-01-24a.1288.0" hansard_membership_id="9156" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/11505" speakername="The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Bruce Millan)" colnum="1288" time="">
<p>The amendment deals with a complex and important matter. Although the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) said that he found difficulty at the best of times in understanding the rate support grant, he made a pretty good fist at it with his amendment. He has raised a number of interesting matters.<br/>
The rate support grant will continue. That does not mean that it will continue in its present form for all time. The Scottish Assembly could, to answer the question of the right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Grimond), decide to give financial assistance to local authorities in some different way. As a matter of practicality, the Assembly will probably find, in the early days, and possibly for a good length of time afterwards, that it would be sensible to continue with something like the present system.<br/>
Whatever complaints there may be about the rate support grant system, it is one that has been built up over many years. It has been refined through consultations between local authorities and the Scottish Office so as to meet individual circumstances and cope with the needs and resources of individual authorities. In my view, it is not something which would be lightly abandoned by any Scottish Executive. The system can be refined further, and made even more fair and equitable. A lot of thought has been given to it over the years, and no doubt the Scottish Executive would want to look at it carefully before making radical changes.<br/>
It would be within the power of the Assembly to make radical changes, but we are dealing with the situation as it is. The clause was drafted in such a way as to enable the necessary adjustments to be made if the system were radically changed. That might involve Assembly legislation, but, in so far as there might be an impact on reserved functions, Westminster legislation might be involved. That is something that could apply to anything in this Bill when there is a relationship between what will be done by the Assembly and the House of Commons. Alteration in the legislation of one place may require corresponding alterations elsewhere. In principle we are not in any different situation when dealing with the rate support grant.<br/>
8.45 p.m.<br/>
For the purposes of the clause it is assumed that the responsibility for the rate support grant negotiations will be taken over by the Scottish Executive. That is because the vast majority of local authority functions are devolved functions, and the individual Scottish Secretaries will, therefore, be responsible for these functions. The Secretary for Finance&#x2014;or whoever it is in the Executive who deals with these matters&#x2014;will presumably go through the negotiations with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, as I do at present. There is a system of consultation. We have, I think, three formal meetings, and an enormous amount of work is done behind the scenes through local government finance working parties, in which local authority officials and my own officials are involved.<br/>
I cannot give a guarantee that the Executive will run the system in exactly that way in the future, but I think that, as a matter of common sense and convenience, as these consultations and the system of consultations have been built up over the years, one must assume that things will continue in that particular way. The system basically will carry on as it is at present, with the very important exception that it will be the Scottish Executive, rather than the Secretary of State for Scotland, which will have the negotiations with COSLA.<br/>
That raises the important question of what happens about the reserved functions. Although it is true that the vast majority of the functions will go to the Scottish Assembly, there are certain reserved functions, outlined in Schedule 15, which will remain with the Secretary of State for Scotland and will have to be financially supported in the same way as the services are supported at the present time.<br/>
It is, of course, important to point out that rate support grant is a general and not a specific grant. It is something that provides for Government assistance to a whole range of services. Although certain discussions take place between Government and COSLA as to the development of individual services&#x2014;and certain estimates are made as to likely expenditure, so that there is an aggregate total of relevant expenditure on which rate support grant is calculated&#x2014;once the grant is paid the local authority is absolutely free to use it in any way it desires.<br/>
That is the essence of the rate support grant system, and it is something to which the authorities attach a great deal of importance. The general authority view is that it is better to have a general grant arrangement of that sort, which gives the authorities scope for deciding their own priorities, rather than to have a system of grants which are specific and which relate the Government help to individual services.<br/>
That is the general situation and we have tried to maintain that within the new framework that we are establishing here. In other words, we look on the general support to local authorities, even for the reserved services, as coming from the rate support grant negotiations


between COSLA and the Executive. That is why we require a clause which enables the Secretary of State for Scotland to be responsible for a certain amount of input, so to speak, into the system before the final negotiations are concluded. For that reason, in Clause 65(2) we say that
<q>a Scottish Secretary shall have regard to such considerations affecting reserved functions as the Secretary of State may bring to his notice".</q>
Why did we use that language rather than the language suggested in the amendment? The hon. Gentleman suggested that the language in the amendment is a more accurate indication of what will happen, but I do not think that that is true. Suppose that we were to direct, as was suggested&#x2014;the hon. Gentleman thought that we should have statutory authority for it&#x2014;that for a certain reserved function a certain amount of money should be put in as the relevant expenditure, and that this were decided between ourselves and COSLA without the Scottish Executive being involved, and the Executive then disagreed with that item of expenditure. If there were a specific direction it would not bite in practice, because an adjustment could easily be made by deducting the amount in dispute from some other item that was part of the total relevant expenditure&#x2014;or, for that matter, by deducting it from the total. The grant is not based on individual items but on a total. Therefore, if there were a practical difficulty the Executive could make an adjustment elsewhere. One would, therefore, be making a direction and establishing the wrong relationship, instead of consultations, which I hope will be carried out on a reasonably friendly level.<br/>
If one puts it in the sense that the Secretary of State is directing or dictating to the Executive we shall probably get more difficulty and more chance of dispute. At the end of the day the Secretary of State for Scotland would not be able effectively to dictate what would go into the settlement because an adjustment could be made elsewhere over which he would have no control. That is the reason we have drafted the clause in this way, although I fully understand why the hon. Gentleman has moved the amendment. I believe that he has raised some interesting issues in doing so.<br/>
I should like to go on and say something about the police, which is the main reserved function. Although there will be consultations between the Secretary of State and the Scottish Executive, the RSG negotiations will not be on a tripartite basis, as suggested by the right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland. The Secretary of State will have certain discussions with COSLA about reserved functions, specifically the police. The Scottish Executive will have the general RSG negotiations about the main generalities&#x2014;the 90 per cent, or more of local authority expenditure relating to devolved functions. It is not provided in the Bill that there will be a tripartite negotiation. Indeed, I would consider it improper for the Secretary of State for Scotland to be involved in negotiations about devolved functions.<br/>
Speaking for myself, whatever there was in the way of informal discussions on expenditure as a whole, I would not see myself&#x2014;if I were Secretary of State in those circumstances&#x2014;being involved in those negotiations. I am pretty sure that the Scottish Executive would not want me to be concerned, and nor would the local authorities. So far as I was dealing with reserved functions I would be having my own discussions; but those discussions, having taken place, the input has to go into the RSG negotiations, as I have already explained, because the generality of the RSG will still come through the Scottish Executive.<br/>
That raises the question whether in practice there might be some difficulty if there were a difference of view as to the correct level of relevant expenditure for the reserved functions. I am talking about a difference of view between the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Scottish Executive or a difference of view involving COSLA as well. If there were a real danger of that not only happening but making a substantial financial difference as well, the hon. Gentleman's solution&#x2014;which is to break the thing completely&#x2014;would have a considerable amount of merit, although it would almost mean making the reserved functions specifically granted rather than setting up an entirely separate RSG negotiation so that two separate negotiations would be going on.<br/>
In practice, I think that the amounts of money involved, in terms of the


generality of local government expenditure, are not so great that we would want to go for that system. I say that for two reasons. First, as I have already said, the reserved functions are rather less than 10 per cent, in terms of total local authority expenditure. Secondly, the overwhelming item is, of course, police and traffic warden expenditure.<br/>
I have figures for 1978&#x2013;79, although I should not like to be wholly bound by them because the reserved functions contain a number of minor items which we have not yet identified. We reckon that the identifiable reserved services amount to about &#x00A3;138 million, which is between 9 and 10 per cent, of total local authority expenditure next year. When we have identified some other items the figure might rise to &#x00A3;140 million, but it will certainly be a figure of that kind. Of that figure the police and traffic wardens represent no less than &#x00A3;129 million, and in addition to the police the Civil Defence and sheltered workshops are specifically granted. Out of that figure of &#x00A3;138 million, less than &#x00A3;10 million is specifically granted at present, and that will be reserved to the Secretary of State.<br/>
In regard to matters which are not devolved, the Committee will see that paragraph 5 of Part II of Schedule 10 reserves grants
<q>for specific purposes relating to reserved functions of local authorities".</q>
In other words, the specific amount of 50 per cent, for police services, which is the main reserved function, will remain with the Secretary of State for Scotland. Therefore, the Secretary of State for Scotland will not only decide the relevant expenditure in consultation with COSLA but will make a specific grant as well. What will come through the rate support grant will be the residual amount that comes through the normal RSG calculations. That will still come via the rate support grant even in respect of the police, but it will be a small proportion of what local authorities will be receiving in respect of the police. Therefore, in practice the difficulties to which the hon. Gentleman rightly drew attention will not be likely to make a great deal of difference.<br/>
We are not saying that this is the only way of dealing with this complicated matter, but we felt that it would maintain

the rate support grant system for devolved functions and for as many of the non-devolved functions as we thought we could legitimately grant. We believe that this will be for the convenience of everybody, including the local authorities. At the same time, with regard to the reserved functions, there is a safeguard in both financial and statutory terms. Therefore, the most important of these functions&#x2014;that relating to the police&#x2014;is not likely in practice to be neglected. I hope that with that explanation of this complicated matter the hon. Gentleman will be willing to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p>The answer is that the clause makes no difference to the situation. The general question of the relationship between local government and the Scottish Executive is a wide one. As Ministers have made clear on numerous occasions, it will be possible for the Executive to reform local government, if that is what the Assembly wishes to do. However, this clause as drafted does not have much effect on the wider issue.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the Secretary of State for Scotland for a most interesting reply, which has answered many questions and helped to clarify how the new system will work. However, it raises a few important points which should go on the record.<br/>
It appears that the right hon. Gentleman has in mind an extra stage in the rate support grant negotiations, which as a first step will take the form of bilateral negotiations. There would be the preparatory work, and there would then be bilateral discussion between the Secretary of State and COSLA on these reserved functions on the one hand, and between the Scottish Executive or the Scottish Secretary and COSLA for the non-reserved functions. Only after those two bilateral negotiations have been completed would they be put together, and the rate support grant negotiation would take place between the Scottish Secretary and COSLA. The Secretary of State would not be involved.<br/>
Therefore it follows that in the general rate support grant negotiations there


would be no chance of altering that section which related to reserved functions. That would be on the table as a fixed, agreed amount and, to that extent, the negotiations will be pre-determined as regards reserved functions.<br/>
9.0 p.m.<br/>
I take the Secretary of State's point that the vast majority of the expenditure on reserved functions relates to police and that the vast majority of that expenditure is specifically granted now and will be specifically granted in future by virtue of the provisions at the foot of page 50. In fact, we are leaving the vast majority of the responsibility for police, traffic wardens and so on with the Secretary of State. That should be clearly understood so that we all know where we are.<br/>
Two other things arise from what the Secretary of State has said&#x2014;and his explanations have been helpful. The right hon. Gentleman agrees that the whole system could be changed by the Assembly, though I take his point that the Assembly may not want to meddle with the system. Equally, it is possible that Whitehall might want to change its side of the bargain.<br/>
I understood the Secretary of State to say that the wording in Clause 65 is sufficiently flexible to cover any of these eventualities. If it is not, this matter should be looked at carefully before the Bill leaves the House so that we may see whether it can be improved. It is important that we should not let it go through in a form which fetters either side in changing the system.</p>

<p>Can the hon. Gentleman imagine a situation in which the Assembly would not want to change things, given that one authority&#x2014;that in Strathclyde&#x2014;will be half the size of the Assembly?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-01-24a.1295.1" hansard_membership_id="6748" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/22742" speakername="Mr. Younger" colnum="1295" time="">
<p>That is a good point. I agree with the Secretary of State that the Assembly, if it has any sense, will be chary of changing this complicated system because it will take Assembly Members some time to understand it. However, there will be strong pressures, and that brings me to my next point.<br/>
The Secretary of State made clear that it is possible for the Scottish Assembly to change the rules in the middle of the

game. It may be granted so many hundreds of millions of pounds under agreed calculations of what the money is needed for, and then spend it on quite different programmes. I accept that the specific element of the central Government grant cannot be changed, but there is nothing sacrosanct about the allocation of the sums agreed in the negotiations. The money approved for education, hospitals, housing or anything else could be used for different purposes. The Secretary of State has also admitted that the portion of the money provided for the reserved functions which is not specifically granted could be used for other things.<br/>
In making this legislation we must allow for the worst cases as well as for the best cases. If all concerned wish to make the system work, it could probably be made to work, but we must envisage the worst situations. We must think this through and take into account the possibility of a thoroughly hostile relationship between the two parties.<br/>
We must consider the clause in the light of accepting that it is possible&#x2014;some would say extremely likely&#x2014;that there will be strong pressures to spend the money that is granted for quite different purposes than those for which it was voted. Further, we would be unrealistic if we did not face the fact that there will be a bargaining system. Such a system is bound to develop from time to time. If the Assembly gets at loggerheads ideologically with central Government at Westminster, it will try to bargain something that it wants to get out of Westminster in return for spending money on certain things in certain ways.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman has fairly admitted that it will still be open for the money to be spent in ways quite different from those envisaged in the rate support grant calculations. That is something that he should recognise. I should like to know what he thinks he would do if lie went to next year's rate support grant discussions and found that last year's grant had been completely misallocated in the spending of it. Would he have any sanction that he could apply? What action would he intend to take, or would he think that it did not matter?<br/>
I ask the Secretary of State to tell us whether it would be possible for the Assembly quite deliberately to accept a rate support grant and deliberately to


underspend on important matters affecting local government, relying upon local government to raise the necessary shortfall by increasing the rates. If that were so, it would be tantamount to giving the Assembly a right of taxation, something which many have wanted it to have and which so far has been said to be impossible. Is the right hon. Gentleman able to allay my fears? It is my understanding that it would be possible for the Assembly to take a rate support grant settlement of &#x00A3;500 million and to ensure, for example, that it spent &#x00A3;50 million short on local government services, thereby forcing local government to raise extra money through the rates and altering the whole balance of the system between central Government and the Assembly.<br/>
I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will try to answer my questions. They are not raised with any destructive intent. I believe it necesary that we try to legislate for the worst situation. There is no problem with the best situation. If everybody happily goes along with the system, wanting it to work and determined that it shall be made to work, clearly it can be made to work. However, we must legislate after having taken into account situations which are bound to occur from time to time in which there is a deliberate intention not to make the system work.<br/>
I hope that I shall not tread on too delicate ground when I offer an example that I believe will wash out any rosy ideas that Ministers may have that everything will always be sweetness and light. There is no doubt that the Scottish Grand Committee and Scottish Standing Committee system in the House of Commons has, at various times during the past 15 years, been deliberately operated upon by those who did not wish it to work to ensure that it would not work. Incidentally, that is a great deal of the reason for our being where we are today.<br/>
I hope that the Secretary of State will regard my remarks as being constructive. I stress that we must ensure that we legislate for the worst situation as well as the best. I hope that he will now answer some of my questions.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-01-24a.1297.0" hansard_membership_id="9156" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/11505" speakername="Mr. Millan" colnum="1297" time="">
<p>I am glad to answer some of the questions of the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger).<br/>
First, the hon. Gentleman is formally right and accurate in how he describes the way in which the negotiations will take place. However, the discussions between COSLA and the Secretary of State for Scotland on the reserved functions will be a much less complicated matter than the discussions between COSLA and whatever Scottish Secretary is responsible for them at the Scottish Executive level. That is because they will be dealing not only with much less expenditure and a very restricted range of functions but with a simpler operation because of the specific grant for police. With that qualification, I accept that the hon. Gentleman accurately described what would happen.<br/>
Secondly, the hon. Gentleman asked whether the rate support grant system could be changed and whether the Bill as drafted would comprehend and deal with any other system that might be put in its place. We have drawn the clause in a way that we think will fit amendments to the rate support grant system as we know it. But if the system were replaced by something entirely different, the clause would not bite.<br/>
Legislation may be passed by the Assembly on many matters which affect relationships with Westminster, and we may have to make corresponding changes here. Equally, we may make changes here which have an impact on Assembly legislation. Therefore, it was impossible to draft a clause which would bite not only on the rate support grant system but on some other system, not yet invented, for supporting local authorities. But for this system and any variation within the limits that we know now&#x2014;we change the formula from one year to another in modest ways to affect redistribution and so on&#x2014;the clause is perfectly adequate.</p>

<p>We must envisage the Scottish Assembly changing the system and the Westminster Government not changing or refusing to change it. In those circumstances, would the clause still be operative as regards the reserved functions?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-01-24a.1298.1" hansard_membership_id="9156" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/11505" speakername="Mr. Millan" colnum="1298" time="">
<p>Yes. We shall have to assume that as a matter of common-sense where there is an inter-relationship. First, legislation does not go through the


House of Commons overnight and presumably it will not go through the Assembly overnight. There will be some informal coming and going. No one would want a system which did not fit together. The local authorities would have a strong view to express on this matter. As a matter of practical politics, we do not want a system, invented by either the Assembly or Westminster, that is so out of joint with what is happening at the other place that it does not work and local authorities are grossly inconvenienced. We must assume that that will not happen.<br/>
The last two matters raised by the hon. Member for Ayr rested on a misunderstanding not of the rate support grant but of the block fund system from Westminster to the Assembly.<br/>
The rate support grant that the Scottish Executive will pay to local authorities in Scotland will come out of the Scottish Consolidated Fund. The block fund from Westminster to the Assembly will not identify specific elements for rate support grant. Still less will it identify specific elements for individual services within the rate support grant.<br/>
The problem about which the hon. Gentleman was worried&#x2014;that the Assembly would get money for one item and use it for another&#x2014;will not arise, because the block fund is not specifically allocated to a particular service. The real problem, if it is one&#x2014;I am not admitting that it is&#x2014;is present now. The rate support grant, being a general grant, leaves it open to local auhorities to spend the money on other items, and they do.<br/>
When we discussed the rate support grant for 1978&#x2013;79 we noticed that the actual expenditure for 1976&#x2013;77 was, in a number of instances, different from the calculation of aggregate relevant expenditure. There was no reason why that should not be so. The local authorities were free to use the money in whatever ways they thought fit. They were not bound to use it on an individual service because it was identified at a particular level of expenditure in the previous rate support grant negotiations. There will be no difference in terms of local authorities using the rate support grant for other purposes when the Scottish Executive deals with the matter.<br/>
The hon. Member for Ayr was under a misapprehension about the block fund arrangements between Westminster and the Assembly. It will be possible for the Assembly to alter the general relationship in terms of expenditure between itself and the local authorities just as this Government have altered the RSG every year. Certainly, while I have had responsibility we have increased and reduced the RSG. That alters the balance of revenue raising between central Government taxation and local taxation. As regards the Assembly, it will alter the balance between what is raised by local taxation and what is paid out of the block fund.<br/>
The Assembly may be more generous&#x2014;that is, reduce the rate and pay more out of the block fund&#x2014;or less generous. In principle, that is what happens now. The decisions about the balance between local taxation and other ways of raising money are taken after consultation by the Secretary of State for Scotland. Those decisions will be taken in future by the Scottish Executive, but such decisions will basically be the same. They will be taken in the light of exactly the same kind of considerations that influence or determine the Secretary of State's decision at present.<br/>
The debate has gone slightly beyond the amendment into the clause as a whole, but I hope that it will have clarified some of the financial relationships which I agree are extremely important and in which the local authorities have a keen interest.</p>

<p>I apologise for not being in the Chamber for most of the debate but I hope that the Minister will answer a question. Perhaps this is one of the few opportunities that we shall have to raise the question of tourism, which is dealt with in the Bill. There seems to be little or no chance of debating it.<br/>
Are the rights within the Bill for the Scottish Tourist Board to advertise itself overseas and to take over the functions within Scotland, which are at present under legislative arrangements, reserved to the BTA, to be under the RSG arrangements or under the Assembly Fund arrangements? Would the Minister say something about this important matter? It is little short of a scandal that the constitution of the British Tourist

<p>I am grateful to the Minister for his answers. I have one important comment to make about them. Finally we have got out of the Secretary of State a matter of great importance. He has made it clear that in effect the Scottish Assembly will have a tax-raising power. It will be able to save money on its block grant, which will be given on the understanding that it will be spent on a range of services which will be discussed in detail during negotiations, and to spend that money on something quite different. It will then be able to recoup that sum by raising rates from the ratepayers of Scotland.<br/>
Can the Secretary of State confirm that there is nothing to prevent the Assembly from doing that if it so wishes? Can he confirm that there is no limit and no protection for the ratepayers?</p>

<p>This is an important matter. I am sure that what the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) says is correct, but if the Assembly saved money by not spending its total grant, it could spend its savings only on something within its powers. Presumably the Assembly would have negotiated the total grant. It cannot simply save money and do something which is not in its power.</p>

<p>That is exactly what I am saying. I hope that I am wrong. There are good arguments for saying that the Assembly should have a tax-raising power, but I am not arguing that tonight. I am saying that we have unravelled from the Secretary of State that the Assembly will have the ability to do this. It will be able to spend its block grant on matters within its powers. It will be able to spend more than is expected on one part of its functions and make up the shortfall by forcing local authorities to raise rates at a higher level. There is no safeguard for the ratepayers against that.

Hon. Members may regard that as good or bad, but at least in the debate we have unearthed the truth, and I hope that that will be noted and carefully considered before we proceed much further.</p>

<p>I hope that the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) is not seeking to give the impression that he has extracted some terrible admission. This fact has been clear all along. If he is only now appreciating it, that is too bad. This matter has nothing to do with the Government. The negotiations on rate support grant, and therefore the ultimate impact on ratepayers, will pass to the Scottish Executive. That has been crystal clear all along, and the local authorities understand it very well.<br/>
The point raised by the hon. Member for Christchurch and Lymington (Mr. Adley) does not arise on this amendment or this clause. But where tourism expenditure is involved with local authorities as distinct from the Scottish Tourist Board, that is relevant expenditure under the rate support grant and nothing in the Bill will change it.</p>

<p>Some of these points are rudimentary.

<p>Rudimentary though these points may or may not be, I hope I may be forgiven for wondering whether the members of Scottish local authorities realise that money can be raised in this way. Whatever my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State may say, this will be news to a number of them, I know. After all, we had an endless discussion on the question of raising money through a levy on the rates, and local authority members and people such as Dr. Cecil Stout, director of finance for the Edinburgh district, endlessly in seminars and elsewhere, argued the case how wrong it would be for the Assembly to depend on finance raised by the local authorities through traditional methods.<br/>
We seem to have stumbled, as we so often do in these debates, on truths which should have been obvious to some of us. It was not obvious to me from all the debates we have sat through. I see hon. Members nodding in agreement, so I think that I am not the only one who is puzzled.<br/>
We must, therefore, discuss at some length, though not perhaps on this occasion, whether it is right for a subordinate Parliament to be financed through ways which have been traditional to the local authorities. I shall be very interested to send a copy of the present exchanges to Mr. Graham Spiers, the secretary of COSLA, and to other local authority members to find out whether I have been as obtuse and ignorant as might seem to be the case. In my view, this must be cleared up.<br/>
I turn now to another matter. The hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) talked about ideological problems. It is not a matter only of ideological problems. On the last amendment we went over the ground regarding what would happen if there were a Conservative Minister in London and a Labour Scottish Secretary in Edinburgh, and vice versa. But the whole position is an adversary position. There is no chance of its not being so.<br/>
Sometimes a hypothetical model is produced, on the assumption that all are men of good will. If we had all been people of good will, we should not have been here in the first place, and this situation would not have arisen. In these debates, I do not accuse and have never, I believe, accused SNP Members of being men of ill will. No question of their being people of good will or ill will comes into it. But they happen, perfectly honourably, to want something which is entirely different from what others want.<br/>
My hon. Friends and I&#x2014;this goes for the Government Front Bench as well as for Back Benchers, including those who think as I do and those who do not, as well as most members of the main Opposition party&#x2014;want something fundamentally different from what the SNP wants. Therefore, it is not a question of ill will or otherwise. It is a matter of wanting to change things, not just settling in and being as co-operative as possible.</p>

<p>Is not the hon. Gentleman in danger of exaggerating his position? I accept, of course, that our aims in the Scottish National Party are defined in our policy, just as the aims of other parties are defined in theirs. But does he not accept that in many matters, such as detailed negotiation on the rate support grant and so on, positions can be negotiated? These matters are negotiable, and in many instances will be settled by negotiation.</p>

<p>Yes, but I must in all candour add that they will be settled to the hon. Gentleman's satisfaction only on his terms, which entail something approaching a separate State. He may be reasonable in his negotiations, and quiet as he was in his speech last week, but there are many members of his party who certainly would not settle for that kind of quiet negotiation. That is a fact of life which we have to face.<br/>
I do not want to take up more time, save to put a specific question on the wording of subsection (2) of Clause 65:
<q>&#x2026; a Scottish Secretary shall have regard to such considerations affecting reserved functions as the Secretary of State may bring to his notice after consulting with such associations of local authorities: as appear to him to be concerned and before the conclusion of the consultations required by that subsection.</q>


What is meant by "shall have regard to"? In any sort of adversary situation, it can be interpreted according to pleasure. In fact, the wording is very loose. This is a grey area. Once again, we come back to the problem of grey areas and of vagueness, which in itself is a recipe for conflict.<br/>
If the Secretary of State wants to rebut me on that, he will doubtless do so, so I put my question in these terms: to what extent is this a grey area, and does he accept the charge of loose wording?</p>

<p>I wish to record the fact that, like the Secretary of State, I am exceedingly surprised at the response of the hon. Member for Ay (Mr. Younger) and, perhaps, less surprisingly, that of the hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) to the self-evident statement by the Secretary of State that the Assembly will have the right to vary the rate support grant that it gives to local authorities. It is as if the hon. Members had just purchased a house and suddenly discovered a skeleton in the attic. [An HON. MEMBER:"A family heirloom."]<br/>
That is a most unrealistic response. It is not a question of the Assembly being given some sort of back door method of raising money. The whole basis of this devolutionary proposal is that the Assembly should have the power to disburse its resources, which come in the form of a block grant, as it feels appropriate. That is not an astonishing matter. It would be very alarming if it were otherwise.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) said that we could discuss this matter at a later stage. Quite frankly, there will not be an opportunity at a later stage. Therefore, I think it right to ask the Secretary of State on this important point, which has been referred to as so obvious by the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Johnston), for a few assurances as to what steps can be taken by the Secretary of State on his reserved functions if local authorities are deprived of substantial proportions of revenue because of the action of the Scottish Assembly in spending its block grant.<br/>
Although the hon. Member for Inverness says that this is something which has been obvious&#x2014;as, indeed, it has&#x2014;he must appreciate that we are moving into a new situation. At present, the Scottish Office pays about 71 per cent, of the expenses of local authorities.</p>

<p>Yes, 68&#x00BD; per cent. It was 71 per cent, under the Conservatives. So 68&#x00BD; per cent, of local authorities' expenditure is accepted as being his responsibility by the Secretary of State.

<p>If it were reduced to the English proportion, there would be considerable increases in rates in Scotland, and we would not want that. If the Secretary of State were to seek to do such a thing and if the Government did it, there would be great complaint. Hon. Members would understandably blame him and say "You are to blame. Something must be done." If, on the other hand, the Scottish Assembly or the Executive were to do such a thing, as they can, indeed, do&#x2014;as has been discussed &#x2014;is it the Assembly and the Executive which would be blamed? I very much doubt it. The Scottish Assembly and Executive would not be blamed. The Scottish Assembly or the Executive could say, as they no doubt would say," The only reason we have had to cut your money and why the rates have had to go up in Moray and Nairn, Dundee, Ayr and everywhere else, is that the Government and the Secretary of State, as our representative in the Cabinet, have been so niggardly in the block grant allocated to us."</p>

<p>Of course there was no vote, because nobody called a vote. I can assure the hon. Lady that she has a lot to learn. She knows a lot about Europe but not about the Scottish Grand Committee. One can divide the Scottish Grand Committee with one person seeking to do so. The hon. Lady is shaking her head. If she doubts what I have said, that shows how little she knows about Scottish affairs. All I can say is that on Tuesday this week, my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Hutchison)&#x2014;the hon. Lady can ask him about this&#x2014;alone divided the Scottish Grand Committee. I think that the vote was 13 to 1. That can be done in the Scottish Grand Committee.<br/>
If it did not happen in this case, it was because the nationalist representative so chose. However, we are discussing not the policy of SNP Members, who show an abysmal ignorance of Scotish affairs, but a serious issue that affects local authorities.<br/>
I hope that the hon. Member for Inverness will take the simple point that whereas if it happened directly people would blame the Secretary of State, if it happened through the Scottish Executive cutting RSGs the Scottish Executive would say that the Secretary of State had not given them enough.<br/>
Let us look at the situation as of today if the clause were in force. We have 203,000 unemployed in Scotland. Understandably, the Scottish Assembly would be under enormous pressure to do something about that. Doing something about it usually means trying to create employment, and spending money. If that were done from the amount allocated by the Government, the only way in which money could be saved would be to reduce the allocation to local authorities. Can we honestly say that a Scottish Assembly would be blamed for so doing? As usual, it would be the Westminster Government to whom all blame would accrue if this Bill came into effect.<br/>
Therefore, I suggest to the hon. Member for Inverness that it is not like the situation as of today. It would be a new ball game. There would be a man at Westminster to blame for all the problems.</p>

<p>I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman. I shall do so only briefly. Does he not agree that where we have local authorities at present whose rates are either raised or lowered by whichever party is in control of the local authority area, if the rates are increased it is very often the party in control of the local authority that rightly takes the responsibility, and that the blame is not necessarily transferred to central Government and the amount of rate support grant?</p>

<p>One usually finds that ratepayers are not daft. If rates rise because the authority has been spendthrift, the party in power is blamed. If, on the other hand, the rates rise in consequence of cuts in the RSG or cuts in the allocation, that is a different matter. I can give a good example. A strange Bill is being put through Parliament now. It will mean that some well-managed housing authorities will lose housing grant and some spendthrift authorities will get more housing grant. The result


of this in rate poundage has been explained to us. Councils should make absolutely clear to ratepayers why this has happened.<br/>
The Secretary of State may huff and puff, as he is trying to do. I am sorry that he does not attend our debates more often. If he did, he would learn of the shambles that we shall have if the Bill is passed. I just wish that the Leader of the House would attend even as regularly as the Secretary of State. It would not be much, but it would be something.<br/>
However, I put a straight question to the Secretary of State, which I hope he will answer "Yes" or "No". It concerns the reserved powers available to the Secretary of State, and I am thinking essentially of Clause 37. It appears to me that if&#x2014;for the sake of argument&#x2014;a Scottish Assembly were to use its powers in such a way as to reduce grant to local authorities in such a way that rates had to rise substantially, and in consequence jobs were put at risk&#x2014;as we know that they can be, because the rates in some of our cities so substantially affect jobs&#x2014;that could be regarded by the Secretary of State as something that would, indirectly or directly, affect a reserved function. Is that so?<br/>
We know that jobs, industry, employment creation and so on are reserved functions. It seems to me that if a Scottish Assembly were to reduce the percentage RSG to local authorities in such a way that rates rose substantially, and jobs were put at risk, that could be claimed to affect a reserved matter.<br/>
I turn to a question that the Secretary of State should have clear in his mind and we would want to have clear in our minds if a Conservative Government came to power with this astonishing Assembly to cope with. Does the right hon. Gentleman consider that Clause 37 could be used to protect local authorities against such action by a Scottish Assembly? If I am right in thinking that it could be used in that way, how would the Secretary of State give a direction for action to be taken? Would he give a direction to the Assembly that it must increase its percentage of RSG? If he did not do it in that way, how would he do it?<br/>
We have not had much opportunity to discuss the Secretary of State's reserved powers. He must accept that Clause 37

is there for some reason, but he has given us no indication how it could be used. It seems to me that it is one way in which the powers could be used by him. If the right hon. Gentleman tells us that even if the Assembly acted irresponsibly, by slashing the proportion of grant being made available for local authorities, he could not cope under Clause 37, the reserved powers are of little value.<br/>
There is no doubt that this is an indirect way of the Assembly's raising revenue. Therefore, I simply ask the right hon. Gentleman this. He may say that it will not happen, that he hopes it will not or thinks it will not, but if the powers were used in such a way, could Clause 37 be used to protect local authorities?<br/>
I have another question to which there is probably a simple answer. Has the Assembly any powers in relation to industrial derating? I should like clarification, and this seems a good place in the Bill to raise the matter.</p>

<p>Perhaps I should declare an interest in tourism. I want to probe a little further, because the closing remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) and his reference to Clause 37 are very relevant.<br/>
Tourism is clearly a matter which, in the words of Clause 37,
<q>concerns Scotland (whether or not it also concerns any other part of the United Kingdom)".</q>
Overseas tourists who come to the United Kingdom will have little desire to know what is or is not in this measure. Will the Secretary of State explain which powers, if any, he will reserve or hold concerning tourism policies carried out by the British Tourist Authority on behalf of the United Kingdom Government, as opposed to tourism policies carried out by the Scottish Tourist Board?<br/>

<p>What happens if the sums that the Assembly thought it would have available for tourism purposes are no longer available and the regions take unto themselves, using additional rates, the


decision to spend more on tourism? There may well be competition between Tay-side, Strathclyde and Lothian. The Secretary of State knows of the recent controversy over the activities of the tourism director in Lothian, who has been trotting all over the globe. What guarantee have the ratepayers of any of the regions that their money will not be used in a way that is not compatible with the policies of the Scottish Tourist Board?<br/>
It is only because there may be no other opportunity to raise the matter that I ask for a passing reference to tourism from the Secretary of State on this clause.</p>

What I am not quite clear about is whether it is the Scottish Secretary who does this consulting with the association of local authorities or whether it is the Secretary of State. It appears that it could be either. It is desirable that the Secretary of State should explain what is meant here and perhaps consider tabling an amendment to make the position quite clear.</p>

<p>The hon. Member was present earlier in the debate but one would not think so from that last comment. I explained at considerable length

the way in which the Secretary of State would be discussing with COSLA the matters concerning reserve powers.<br/>
The question of tourism is dealt with under Clause 67. If the hon. Member for Christchurch and Lymington (Mr. Adley) would keep quiet we might get to that clause.<br/>
To my hon. Friend the Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) I say that on all of these matters affecting the rate support grant a minimum amount of good will helps with the consultations. We have it at the moment and I see no reason why COSLA and the Scottish Executive should not establish the kind of relationship that I have, which is more or less cordial, with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities. We must not assume that the Scottish Executive will be so inept or provocative that it will not be able to deal sensibly with local authorities and other interests in Scotland. That would be an extremely arrogant and patronising attitude. I would not assume that I must be better, intrinsically, in dealing with COSLA than would be the Scottish Executive.<br/>
Dealing now with the remarks concerning the words "shall have regard to", that was the point of the previous amendment which was withdrawn. I pointed out that the Scottish Secretary would have matters drawn to his attention and would have regard to them and would take them into account. For reasons that I explained at length, it was not possible effectively to put that provision in stronger terms and dictate to the Scottish Secretary what he should do in that situation. We are not trying to tie him down absolutely. We could not do so. There has to be a form of words which gives the Secretary of State a statutory locus on this issue. The form of words we have seems to be as good as any other.<br/>
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) asked me about industrial derating. That is a matter for the Assembly. I have announced that I intend to continue the 50 per cent. industrial derating from 1st April 1978 and I shall be laying an order for the next three years quite soon. Thereafter, this will be a matter for the Assembly. I daresay that, again, the Executive will have the same balance of considerations in mind when


it makes decisions about industrial de-rating as I have had in making my decisions. I refer to such things as the interests of local authorities, of domestic ratepayers compared with other ratepayers and of the need to encourage Scottish industry.<br/>
The hon. Member for Cathcart also asked whether a Government would be likely to use their reserved powers under Clause 37 if a Scottish Administration started to slash the level of rate support grant. I make the general point that the only way to ensure that the present level of rate support grant, 68&#x00BD; per cent., was maintained for ever would be to write that into the Bill, but no one is suggesting that we should do that or tie the hands of the Scottish Executive in that way. But in any case, since I have already explained at great length earlier in the debates on the clause that they can change the whole system of rate support grant, it would be utterly pointless to put in a particular percentage and try to tie the Scottish Executive down to it.<br/>
I understand the hon. Gentlemena's worries. He recognises that the present level of rate support grant is very generous to local authorities and is worried that there might be an Executive which would reduce it to the significantly low level at which it stood when the Conservative Party was in power. That is a legitimate worry, and the local authorities appreciate that devolution might have that unfortunate effect.<br/>
It is conceivable that there could be a Conservative Administration in Scotland. It is not very likely, but I agree with the hon. Gentleman that we must look at every contingency, however remote. I suppose that it could happen, and it might have these effects. In that hypothetical situation, if a Conservative Administration in the Assembly were to behave in a wickedly damaging way, and this had an impact on the reserved functions&#x2014;which is what Clause 37 is about&#x2014;it would then be open to the Government in Westminister to intervene. But I consider that these are very remote matters indeed, and I do not believe that the normal matters of relationship betwen the local authorities, on the one hand, and the Scottish Executive, on the other, are matters in regard to which the reserved powers would be likely to be used. But if there were matters of great controversy

of that sort, I dare say that they would come up at the annual negotiation of the block fund. For practical purposes, therefore, I do not believe that Clause 37 would be relevant.</p>

<p>Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that a Tory Administration in Scotland is a real possibility?</p>

<p>That is the kind of thing that I would prefer to discuss with the hon. Lady at an earlier hour of the day. If we were to embark on such a discussion now we should get away from the debate on the clause. It would not amount to sense to have such a discussion with the hon. Lady at this time of night.<br/>
I repeat to the Minister that it was a serious point that I raised. The Government would presumably make their own assessment as to what percentage could be given to local authorities by way of a block grant. If there were to be considerable economic stringency, the present Government or a future Government might have to say that the block grant was to be a little lower. It might say that it considered a level or. 60 per cent, or 65 per cent, to be right, but it could tell the authorities that if they wanted to spend more on one thing and less on another, that would be a matter for them. If the Scottish Assembly, the Government in Westminster having made their calculation, reduced the amount available to local authorities, and a big


increase in rates followed, would it be possible for action to be taken? The Secretary of State has rather dodged the question.<br/>
Secondly, if such an intervention were called for, how would it be made? Having looked at the reserved powers, I do not see how it could be done. That is one of the most dangerous points. If we had an RSG order it would presumably be a Statutory Instrument placed before the Scottish Assembly. What can the Secretary of State do about that? Under Clause 38 he has the power to revoke a Statutory Instrument. But here we would find ourselves in exactly the same difficulty which hon. Members on this side find when discussing RSG orders. All we can do is either vote against it, in which case local authorities get nothing, or let it go through, in which case they get something.<br/>
If the Secretary of State used the power in Clause 38 it would not help at all because all he would do would be to object, and instead of getting 50 per cent, there would be nothing at all.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-01-24a.1315.0" hansard_membership_id="5950" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/15448" speakername="Mr. Harry Gourlay" colnum="1315" time="">
<p>Surely the hon. Gentleman will make an analogy with what happens in this House? His argument would then be that the Scottish Assembly would introduce another order just as we do in this House.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-01-24a.1315.1" hansard_membership_id="4204" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/3396" speakername="Mr. Taylor" colnum="1315" time="">
<p>That would be fine if we had co-operation. But what are we dealing with? Suppose for the sake of argument one had a Conservative Government in Westminster and some of the hon. Gentleman's wild Left-wing friends in control of the Scottish Administration; we could not have that degree of cooperation between the Government and the Assembly, particularly if we were to have the appalling level of unemployment which there is under the present Labour Government. In those circumstances Clause 38 would not work.<br/>
If we look at the reserved power in Clause 37&#x2014;that is the power to instruct the Scottish Secretary to do something&#x2014;it now appears that this particular power does not apply to legislation or Statutory Instruments. It would be a most unusual use of power if the reserved power in Clause 37 were used to direct a Scottish

Secretary to promote a Statutory Instrument.<br/>
We are then left with the reservation in Clause 36&#x2014;it is not a reserved power at all&#x2014;which relates only to legislation. But that would not happen except in very unusual circumstances. What the right hon. Gentleman has not said is how precisely he can use the reserved powers to do anything about the situation I have described. That was something about which we asked him specifically and it is a question which he has not answered.<br/>
While we accept that the right hon. Gentleman regards these as powers which would be used only in unusual circumstances&#x2014;perhaps in circumstances in which we had an irresponsible Administration either here or in the Assembly&#x2014;we are bound to ask how can reserved powers be used to resolve such a situation. I hope that the Secretary of State can give some indication of what the answer is.</p>

<p>I do not think it is either arrogant or patronising to say that the relationship between my right hon. Friend in his present position and COSLA is totally different from the relationship with an Executive that does not accept the guidelines which hitherto we have always accepted as between local government and national Government. That is a totally different situation and one is entitled to point it out.<br/>
As has so often happened in these debates over the past 10 days, whenever the Committee lifts a manhole, it seems to stumble on some kind of hornets' nest. That is a 10 o'clock metaphor, but it is exactly what happens.<br/>
I took down the words of my right hon. Friend which were "The people down here would intervene ". In which circumstances would they intervene and with what effect? That particular view ought to be explained. How would the people down here intervene, on what grounds and with what result?</p>
</speech>

<p>I do not want to go back over the question of reserved powers. We have already dealt with this matter in Clauses 36, 37 and 38. Clause 36 deals with the situation where it is an Assembly Bill, which I suppose could be conceiv-Clause 37 deals with Executive action able, with regard to rate support grant,


which could conceivably relate to rate support grant, and Clause 38 deals with subordinate instruments which is relevant in respect of RSG because it is expressed in an order. All these clauses deal with reserved powers which are related directly to actions, whether legislative or in other ways, of the Scottish Assembly which have a severe and detrimental effect on reserved powers.<br/>
10.0 p.m.<br/>
I gave an illustration relating to the reduction in RSG, but the Scottish Assembly equally could decide to increase RSG. I said that it was unlikely that that would be the kind of situation in which these reserved powers were appropriate to be used by a Secretary of State for Scotland and the Government down here. But if the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger), who is now muttering to himself, is asking whether the Bill contains all the powers that would be necessary if such intervention seemed appropriate, so far as I can see from this clause and from what has been said by way of explanation in the past, all the powers are available in the Bill.</p>

<p>I believe that the Secretary of State should take back this clause and re-examine it. He said he believed that the powers were there, but</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-01-24a.1318.0" colnum="1318" time="">
<p>I believe that the powers patently are not there in Clause 38. Clause 38 gives him power only to revoke a Statutory Instrument put forward by the Assembly.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-01-24a.1318.1" colnum="1318" time="">
<p>The situation which we have envisaged is that the Scottish Assembly, hard up for money, will say to the local authorities "I am sorry, but we need more money to help Scotland. Therefore, we shall have to cut your money." This will go into a Statutory Instrument, it will be put to the Assembly, and the Secretary of State in those extreme circumstances could say "I am sorry, but there will be no order. I am revoking it." What happens then? Has he power to insist on a new order with a new percentage? That will certainly not happen under Clause 38.</p>

<p>This is a situation which may prove to be a danger to Scottish local authorities and ratepayers. We do not appear to have the weapons to deal with it. In those circumstances let us throw out this clause as a warning to the Secretary of State that these matters should be thought out and that Ministers should be prepared with the proper answers.</p>

<p>I beg to move Amendment No. 412, in page 31, leave out lines 25 and 26.<br/>
The clause gives to a Minister of the Crown power, by order, to make provision for
<q><i>imposing any limits in addition to or in substitution for existing limits</i></q>
on the 19 statutory bodies which are set out in Schedule 13. Subsection (4) provides:
<q>A statutory instrument made under this section shall be subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament.</q>
The provision for further parliamentary control of the limit of borrowing of these 19 bodies confers upon the House of Commons the least authority. It is the most cursory of all provisions.<br/>
My right hon. and hon. Friends and I have tabled this amendment because we are deeply suspicious of a power which will enable Ministers, by order, to increase the borrowing powers of these 19 statutory bodies. We meet at a time when the control of Parliament over the Executive is passing from the House of Commons to the great advantage of the Government of the day. If ever there were a time when we needed to assert the supremacy of Parliament and to be vigilant about granting to Ministers power to increase, by order, the borrowing capacity of statutory bodies, it is now. The overriding need for the House of Commons to exercise increasing control over the Executive is demonstrated by subsection (2)(<i>d</i>) of Clause 66 because, without any explanation, the Government are seeking to confer upon themselves the power by order, subject only to annulment, to have an unlimited capacity to increase the borrowing powers of 19 statutory bodies.<br/>
There are three reasons why we believe that these powers are undesirable. The Government have said that they wish to control public expenditure. In the letter of 15th December 1976 from the Chancellor to Dr. Witteveen it was stated in the plainest terms that it was an objective of the Government to secure a

substantial reduction in the share of the nation's resources for the public sector. Yet if Dr. Witteveen reads the reports of these debates he would expect the Minister warmly to applaud this amendment. Anyone who is anxious about the control of public expenditure should welcome this amendment. Even if a case could be made out for Government powers to increase the borrowing capacity of 19 public bodies the case certainly cannot be maintained for giving the Government power to increase these limits by order subject only to the annulment procedure.<br/>
There is another astonishing feature of Schedule 13. Many of the bodies listed in this schedule have no relationship to Scotland. We start off with the British Waterways Board. Why do we need to include in the Scotland Bill a power which will enable the Government by order to increase the ability to borrow off the British Waterways Board? Certainly, as the Bill is drafted, any increase in the borrowing capacity of the Waterways Board could be wholly unrelated to Scotland. I believe that this is a device, which has not been thought through by some of the profligate members of the Government, to give by way of the back door powers which are wholly unrelated to Scotland and devolution. Only the vigilance of my right hon. and hon. Friends has identified the mischief which could be done by Clause 66(2)(<i>d</i>). There is no mention in that clause of financial limits. Indeed, the clause is reverse of specific, and yet, what else can it mean if it does not mean that these 19 statutory bodies are to have power to increase their borrowing limits if the subsection is not to be meaningless?<br/>
If we move on we find that the Forestry Commissioners, the Housing Corporation and the Inland Waterboards Amenity Advisory Council are listed.</p>

<p>Before my hon. Friend moves further down the list, we should stop at item 2, the Forestry Commissioners. The Forestry Commission, which is a United Kingdom authority, was devolved to Scotland on the sort of pressure for employment which one hears from many sides of the House. It is one of Lord Taylor of Gryfe's marvellous achievements as head of the Forestry Commission that its headquarters was


moved to Scotland. Now there is to be the magnificent effect for Scotland that there will be two Forestry Commissions and that one of them will have to be moved back to England as part of the benefit of devolution.</p>

<p>I can only hope that my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fair-bairn) will catch your eye later in the debate, Mr. Murton, because I am sure that his argument needs developing at considerable length. It is only the outrage of the guillotine that will prevent my hon. and learned Friend from making a very long and cogent speech.<br/>
We have reached only the fifth of the statutory bodies which will have their borrowing requirement extended by order. I come to the Advisory Committee for Scotland. I believe that 18 out of the 19 bodies here could happily be dispensed with without material damage to the United Kingdom or Scotland. We have a great superfluity of councils, authorities, tribunals, colleges, gaming boards and the rest. All the best libertarian instincts of the Tory Party are offended by this galaxy of nonsense.<br/>
Let us just reflect upon the cost to public funds of providing headquarters for these boards, commissioners, corporations and councils, and let us reflect upon the number of unproductive, wealth-consuming civil servants who man them. Let us then measure the expenditure involved against the value to the community. Even under the existing arrangements there is a sorry imbalance between cost and true output or value.<br/>
However, that is not enough for the Labour Party. The Government say that even the amount which these 19 bodies are able to spend is not enough. They are inviting the Committee to enable any Minister of the Crown to come to the House and, through the negative resolution procedure, extend the borrowing powers of each of these 19 authorities. It would be possible even for the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in his new incarnation as protector of small businesses to do so, perhaps to the very great detriment of precisely that part of the nation's activity&#x2014;small businesses&#x2014;which has been so grievously wounded by this Administration in its attempt to

give more money to bodies such as those in the Bill. Will the Minister of State say why the Civil Aviation Authority should be included in the Bill?<br/>
Let me say what pleasure it gives me to see the Lord Advocate occupying the Front Bench below the Gangway, a pleasure rivalled only by the pleasure it will give you, Mr. Murton, to see him there. I hope he will catch your eye and reply to the debate. I see that he has now been joined by the hon. Member for Bristol, North-West (Mr. Thomas) whose constituency has a great interest in the aircraft industry. I should like the Lord Advocate to tell the Committee why the Civil Aviation Authority and the British Airports Authority should be included in the Scotland Bill, and why the borrowing powers of those authorities should be subject to increase by ministerial order. We are discussing devolution to Scotland. There is nothing in this clause to tell us even that the borrowing must relate to Scotland.<br/>
10.30 p.m.<br/>
It is a trick. I am glad that the hon. Member for Bristol, North-West has come into the Chamber, because it may have been a trick implanted in the Bill by the most profligate overspenders on the Government side.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman&#x2014;I almost called him my hon. Friend&#x2014;adds to the weight of the argument. It is a patent absurdity to include a prospective increase in the borrowing powers of these bodies which have nothing to do with the Scotland Bill.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend has raised an important point which the Minister should not overlook. I direct attention for a moment to the precise provisions of subsection (2). Let us assume that we give the British Airports Authority the right to spend another &#x00A3;1,000 million. The provisions which may be made in relation to that United Kingdom body are provisions
<q>enabling powers to be exercised</q>


we need not trouble at this stage with
<q>duties to be performed"&#x2014;</q>
<q>by a Scottish Secretary instead of by a Minister of the Crown.</q>
Thus, if the Westminster Government wished to get out of the embarrassment of spending a lot of money on building the Channel Tunnel or a new airport, or whatever it might be, all they would need to do would be to say "We shall give the money to the United Kingdom statutory body and put on a Scottish Secretary the responsibility to spend it".</p>

<p>The Committee will be grateful to my hon. and learned Friend for that pertinent intervention.<br/>
I turn now to the next item on the list, the Council on Tribunals and its Scottish Committee. May we be told why it is necessary to confer power to impose in respect of that body
<q>limits in addition to or in substitution for existing limits"?</q>
We have been denied the guidance and assistance of the Lord Advocate. I think it right to put on record that the Committee has heard the Lord Advocate once only during the whole of our proceedings. I can only assume that he fails to address us on this occasion because it is beyond his comprehension how this clause and Schedule 13 got into the Bill at all.<br/>
We can all now heave a sigh of relief because into the Chamber has come the Under-Secretary of State for Transport. I do not wish to damage his brightening political career by paying tribute to him, but we all know that he is a very capable Minister. I was referring to his Department a moment ago. As the Lord Advocate has now left us and the hon. Gentleman has joined us, perhaps he can assist the Committee, and I shall address some brief remarks to him.<br/>
The British Airports Authority and the Civil Aviation Authority come under the Under-Secretary's Department's hand&#x2014;</p>

<p>That is the Department of Trade. Oh dear. What about water? That is Environment. I see. Well, we welcome the Under-Secretary of State for Transport although those matters are outside his responsibility.<br/>
Reading on down the list, we find that the Horserace Totalisator Board is to

have its borrowing powers increased. Nor do we stop there. The same applies to the Housing Association Registration Advisory Committee. What is the budget for that body? Why is it necessary to increase its borrowing powers?<br/>
It is quite astonishing that these 19 entities should be presented to the Committee as being ripe for further borrowing powers.<br/>
I wish to deliver a short word of advice to the Government Front Bench about borrowing&#x2014;particularly now that the Under-Secretary of State for Transport is present. I know that I have the hon. Member for Bristol, North-West with me in this matter. One of the evils that has fallen upon this country since 28th February 1974 is the way in which, in the view of the Labour Party, every problem that presents itself can be solved if only one borrows. Of course, the national debt has virtually doubled since the Labour Party last came to power. It is borrowing that is regarded by the Labour Party as the solution to all problems.</p>

<p>I do not subscribe to that view myself&#x2014;not every problem. But certainly we shall not solve our problems by giving unlimited powers to the Executive and to Ministers&#x2014;particularly when they are Labour Members&#x2014;to increase without limit borrowing powers by order. It will need all the vigilance of my right hon. and hon. Friends&#x2014;we shall not get much help from below the Gangway&#x2014;if we are to prevent a massive increase in borrowing powers. The only way in which we can prevent it is by the negative procedure under subsection (4).<br/>
I know that many of my right hon. and hon. Friends wish to address the Committee on this crucial amendment. We can look for no support from SNP Members. We have no support from the Liberal Bench. [HON. MEMBERS: "Where are they?"] There are present one or two representatives of the Tribune Group. They had a very interesting party meeting earlier today, but it would be out of order to go into that matter. The


only source of vigilance is to be found among my right hon. and hon. Friends.<br/>
I want to summarise the reasons why the amendment is of such fundamental importance, and I do so in the presence of the Shadow Secretary of State.</p>

<p>The hon. Member has made a very witty and amusing speech. He has tried to ridicule, in a blanket fashion, the inclusion of the list of bodies. However, he should be a little wary of doing that in the spirit in which he did. The whole future of the Forestry Commissioners of Great Britain depends on land in Scotland, because in England no land is left for forestry development. Given the situation that the development of forestry will basically be in Scotland, on the millions of acres left in Scotland&#x2014;give or take a little elsewhere&#x2014;it is reasonable that the body responsible for such a massive expansion should be credited with some particular powers. Simply to blanket all these bodies in the list and to ridicule it in the way in which the hon. Member has done may be amusing to hear but is a little unworthy of the hon. Member.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-01-24a.1329.1" hansard_membership_id="4901" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/11574" speakername="Mr. Gow" colnum="1329" time="">
<p>I entirely agree with the hon. Lady that the Forestry Commissioners do a very good job. I shall not argue about their worth. I was arguing against giving them power to borrow more money on the say-so of a Minister, subject only to our negative Statutory Instrument procedure.<br/>
There are three basic reasons why this part of the clause is objectionable and why we wish to leave out the lines with which the amendment deals. It is the House that should be able to control public expenditure, and to increase the power to borrow by order subject only to the negative procedure is a denial of the right of this place to control the executive.<br/>
Secondly, there are many items of expenditure which could be covered by these bodies which will all be south of the border. For this matter to be included in the Bill is an affront to its common sense and purpose.<br/>
Finally, we regard it as deeply offensive to include a provision to increase the

borrowing capacity of 19 bodies when this is nothing to do with the legislation before the Committee.<br/>
I hope that the Minister will calm all our fears and endear himself to his hon. Friend the Member for West Lothian and to me by accepting the amendment, which has been designed to carry the Government along the path plotted by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the famous letter to Dr. Witteveen of 15th December 1976.</p>

<p>I should like to take up what the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Gow) said about the Forestry Commission. He made an amusing speech, but forestry is not an amusing subject to the great mass of people who are interested in it, particularly in Scotland.<br/>
For once I agree with the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mrs. Ewing). Forestry is rightly centred in Scotland. Most of the land required for forestry is there and most of the work done by the Commission is there. The Commission has done a fine job over the years in bringing a great deal of this country into cultivation, helping to cut imports of timber. We want it to go on doing that job, and for that it needs to be able to borrow money and have funds made available to it to buy and plant land.<br/>
Among the strongest critics of devolving the Forestry Commission are the woodland owners of Scotland, who are helped by big grants from the United Kingdom Government. They fear that if the nationalists ever came to power in Scotland they would not be able to obtain the support that they have had in the past.<br/>
Two years after Scottish National Party Members first appeared in the House in any considerable number, I asked the Library what Questions about forestry they had tabled and what forestry issues they had raised in the House. They had not tabled one Question or initiated one debate on the subject in that whole period. When I made fun of them because of this, they poured forestry Questions on to the Order Paper, and it was only then that one SNP Member who is a former employee of the Forestry Commission took an interest here in the subject.</p>

<p>May I correct the record and say that I asked many Questions concerning forestry when I was in the House between 1967 and 1970. I did so again when I was elected in 1974. If the hon. Member looks at the record, he will find that to be the case. More seriously&#x2014;because that was obviously not meant to be a serious point&#x2014;although successive Governments of different political complexions have given the Forestry Commissioners powers of compulsory purchase, not a single acre has been acquired in this way. Can the hon. Gentleman explain this, bearing in mind how important this power is since there are 1 million acres producing a quarter of an ounce of grass per acre per year suitable for forward planting?</p>

<p>If the hon. Lady looks at <i>Hansard,</i> she will find that there was not one Question tabled by any Member of the SNP in the period I have referred to.<br/>
On the question of compulsory purchase, when Tom Williams was Minister of Agriculture, he introduced such powers to acquire land for forestry purposes but, because of the resistance encountered from many farmers, the powers were never exercised. Much land has been purchased by the Commissioners, but the rise <ob/> price has limited it in recent years.<br/>
Many of us interested in forestry are not satisfied with the scheme for devolution. While the Forestry Commission will carry out the will of the House, it is not happy and nor are those who own private woodlands in Scotland. I have found only one woodland owner in Scotland who supports the devolution policy on forestry.<br/>
While there is unity in the Forestry Commission at the top, the financial arrangements are split into three, with money allocated separately to England, Scotland and Wales. That means that the funds for Scotland's forestry work will depend upon the amount given by the Assembly. Upon that will depend the number of people employed in Scotland on forestry work. How can the Forestry Commission plan its programme properly if it does not know where the finance is coming from?</p>

<p>The hon Member for Dagenham (Mr. Parker) and I have been

on forestry visits together. Under Schedule 10, forestry and afforestation is devolved under Group 15. We have heard that one of the benefits for Scotland has been that those who work in the Commission's headquarters were transferred to Scotland to create employment. If forestry in Scotland is devolved to the Assembly while forestry in England remains the responsibility of the British Government, the Forestry Commission&#x2014;which has been devolved to Scotland to create employment in Edinburgh and because of the extent of forestry work there&#x2014;will have to return to England since it will no longer have any relevance to Scotland.</p>

<p>That is not the case at all. The Commission will, rightly, remain in Edinburgh. It will run forestry for the whole of the United Kingdom from Edinburgh. The employees of the Commission will be appointed by the Government here but the running of the work in Scotland, the financing of Scottish planting, and the harvesting of the timber will be done at the expense of the Assembly. The finance will be divided in an unsatisfactory way between the different parts of the United Kingdom but the central organisation will remain in Scotland. How can the Commission work effectively if it does not know ahead where its money is coming from? The organisation should not be devolved. All the finance should come from the United Kingdom Parliament. Each part of the country would then know what moneys it had to spend as part of a national policy. [<i>Interruption.</i>] I am objecting to the financial split at the centre. Most of the people engaged in forestry in England, Scotland and Wales disagree with the whole policy of devolution. They do not want it.</p>

<p>I fully agree that we have a far smaller area under plantations in this country than there is in any of the other important European countries. Ireland and Iceland are, I believe, the


only exceptions. I am strongly in favour of a much bigger planting programme, certainly in Scotland, but also in parts of England and Wales.<br/>
The Scottish nationalists have complained in the past that some of the activities in Scotland were out on a limb as compared with those in England. There is a danger here that forestry in England and Wales might be out on a limb because it is centred in Scotland. I think that the Assembly, if it is to have these powers, should have authority to ensure that funds are made available for the Forestry Commission to carry out its activities and to assist private forestry in any way that is thought necessary in the years to come.</p>

<p>Further to the point of order, Mr. Murton. The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Parker) made his entire speech on the assumption that my hon.

<p>My purpose in seeking to catch your eye, Mr. Murton, was in order to answer the points made by the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Gow), who moved the amendment. With respect to some hon. Members, I think it is the

duty of the Minister to seek to catch your eye so that he may endeavour to answer the points made on the amendment which is under discussion. The discussion has been wide-ranging, and the mover is entitled to a comment on it from the Government before the House moves to a Division. I will seek to be brief, although the hon. Gentleman expanded himself a little in moving the amendment. If there is some complaint about lack of time for other matters, I fail to see why the responsibility for that should be laid at my door.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman moved the amendment on the basis that he felt that the House of Commons would lack control over financing. I understand that point, but the effect of the amendment, I believe, would be that orders made by United Kingdom Ministers would not be able to alter the borrowing limits for public bodies operating in devolved fields in Scotland. The ministerial power is in the Bill, and we take the view that the House of Commons should remain responsible for approving the major financial limits on developed expenditure, in particular the annual block funds, dealt with in Clause 46, and the amounts&#x2014;[<i>Interruption.</i>] We believe that&#x2014;</p>

<p>I beg the hon. Member's pardon. I am sorry if I am inaudible. I shall try to be audible.<br/>
I was referring to other clauses where there is a general control by the House of Commons. I refer also to Clause 47 which relates to total levels of advances from the National Loans Fund to the Scottish Loans Fund for on-lending to State bodies such as the Housing Corporation and the British Waterways Board.<br/>
Under the amendment, Ministers would not be allowed to alter the financial limits. That would be unacceptable because it would prevent any change in arrangements for setting financial limits for individual public bodies, some of whose activities fall within devolved areas.<br/>
I remind the Committee of the general limits in other clauses. That is the effect of parliamentary control on the matter and it is not affected by the power of


Ministers to make individual requirements.<br/>
I understand that some hon. Members wish to catch your eye, Mr. Murton. Therefore, that is my explanation of the Government's reaction to the amendment.</p>

<p>Many of my hon. Friends will be disappointed that they cannot expand this matter further. I should like to ask the Minister whether I am wrong in assuming that Part V on page 29 of the Bill to which the amendments relate refers to matters other than merely financial matters? Part V is entitled:
<q>Devolved Matters and Determination of Questions Relating Thereto".</q>
You would tell me quickly, Mr. Murton, that I was out of order if I sought to discuss tourism. The Secretary of State for Scotland, on a previous amendment, sought to curtail debate on tourism and rate support grant, because, he said, we could discuss those matters under Clause 67. It is clear that in the next three minutes we shall not reach Clause 67.<br/>
I want to question the Minister on matters relevant to this amendment and referring to the Civil Aviation Authority. I refer back to a point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) in a previous debate.<br/>
Clause 38 was not discussed because of the guillotine but it relates to the power of revoking subordinate instruments. I am not wholly hostile to the general proposition of devolution. The Minister must realise that those of us who have tried to conduct this debate in a reasonable manner are being driven against the wall because we are finding we are not able to discuss seriously and briefly some matters which are relevant.<br/>
That is a criticism of the guillotine and not necessarily of the principle of devolution. I ask the Minister when the Committee will be able to discuss the activities of the Civil Aviation Authority in relation to this Bill, particularly in relation to the powers in Clauses 37 and 38.<br/>
The Minister will be aware that the subject of air services&#x2014;considering new ones or terminating current services&#x2014;arouses strong feelings. If he cannot do it in reply to this debate, I hope he will take the opportunity to write to me and tell me what would happen in the by no means hypothetical situation illustrated in the last debate by my hon. Friend the Member for Cathcart. We could have a Conservative Scottish Assembly and a Labour Government at Westminster, and the Conservative Assembly might want to license, through the CAA or its Scottish counterpart, a new private enterprise airline in Scotland. What powers will he invoke to prevent the Assembly giving powers to establish a new private enterprise airline in Scotland?<br/>
Alternatively, let us suppose there were a Socialist Administration in Edinburgh and a Conservative one here at Westminster. How would they physically expect to get through.&#x2014;</p>

<p>I am pleased to open this debate and to make as my first point the fact that, although we have just had Divisions on the Scotland Bill, in this debate there is all-party unity and support for the matter I wish to put to the Minister.<br/>
I am raising this question because hon. Members have received over 40 letters from their constituents on it. The hon. Member for Derby, North (Mr. White-head) and I have received the same letters because of our special interest in holiday caravans.<br/>
I am delighted also that listening to the debate is my hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham), who has taken an interest in the position of caravanners, and my hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke (Mr. Edwards) in whose constituency the case I wish to raise has taken place.<br/>
The complaints that I want to put to the Minister emanate from many parts of the country. They come from Oadby, Wednesfield, Tamworth, Uxbridge, Birmingham, Walsall, Smethwick, Stafford, Stockport, Bilston and many areas in Wales. I should particularly like to thank Mrs. Woods of the National Caravan Owners Association who has contributed so much work and interest to this matter.<br/>
The case concerns the Dinas Country Club and Caravan Park in Dyfed, which was until 1st January in the ownership of the Gailey Group Ltd., of Gailey near Stafford. Since then it has been transferred to the ownership of Trellis Scott Ltd., of Carlyle House, Cardiff.<br/>
Perhaps I should explain what has happened in 1978. What I have to say has been reinforced and confirmed by the investigation of the Welsh Consumer Council, and I thank Jean Bowler-Court for all the work she has done in this respect.</p>

<p>In addition, there were people such as Mrs. Higgins of Coventry, who purchased a caravan on behalf of her family from the same firm only four months ago

and who has not yet used it, or Miss Hughes, who purchased a caravan in September last year and has a receipt marked under the name of Gailey Caravans, as inclusive of rates and site maintenance for 1978. That would be the normal situation.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-01-24a.1346.0" colnum="1346" time="">
<p>The House can imagine the consternation when, on 3rd January, all owners received a letter from the company Trellis Scott Limited which, in effect, told them that this new company had taken over the site and it was no longer in the business of renting caravans but was now in the business of selling to individual purchasers on lease the 40 ft. by 30 ft. sites on which their caravans rested.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-01-24a.1346.1" colnum="1346" time="">
<p>The letter is a perfectly reasonable business letter spelling out the sort of improvements which the company sought to make upon the site, but the significant fact is that the last paragraph said that it was important for the owners of caravans on the site to let the company know by 14th January whether they would take on the lease and, in addition, pay the company &#x00A3;10 a year ground rent and &#x00A3;165 a year maintenance charge in addition to the rates. The form which people were asked to sign is quite simple, saying "I wish" or "I do not wish" to undertake this responsibility.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-01-24a.1346.2" colnum="1346" time="">
<p>To ask people in that situation to make up their minds over such an important issue in only 11 days is totally unreasonable. Those who requested details of the terms and conditions of the lease were told by staff of the company that they were not in the business of showing leases&#x2014;"Would you please sign the form?".</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-01-24a.1346.3" colnum="1346" time="">
<p>I have evidence in correspondence that many people were telephoned and pestered to sign the form, and when they asked "What is my position if I do not sign?" they were told that if they did not sign by 14th January their caravans would either be towed off the site or be towed on to a hard standing, where they would be required to pay &#x00A3;75 a week until such time as they made other arrangements.</p>

<p>I understand that even at this stage, in spite of the protests, and in spite of the matter being put by hon.


Members to the Minister, who has taken up the question in Wales, those who have not signed the document have had their services chopped off and their television aerials removed without any reference to them whatever. A copy of the lease has since become available.<br/>
Although it is not the first time that this sort of thing has happened, one can understand why Mrs. Higgins of Coventry wrote in the following terms:
<q>We have a Down's syndrome child, a mongol child, for whom we struggled to buy this caravan where we could take him and the family for holidays. Having had the van for four months and having had no holiday, we are now faced very suddenly with an immoral lease and a very large amount of extra expense. Trusting you can do something urgently for all people placed in an atrociously expensive situation through no fault of their own.</q>
The questions that I want to raise with the Minister are both local and national, because I am sure that he is aware, as we are all aware, that there is no protecion whatever for holiday caravanners by law from such site owners. My first question concerns the relative liability between the two companies on the basis of the documents that I have read to the House. First, what right could Trellis Scott have to issue such a short-term ultimatum, in spite of the commitment of the previous owners over the site, and to people who quite legitimately bought caravans from them only on condition that they could leave them and keep them on this site in 1978? Secondly, what right has the previous company, Gailey Caravans of Stafford, to sell the site without making sure in the conditions of sale to Trellis Scott that these people were protected?<br/>
The second matter that I want to raise with the Minister, and to call in question, is this practice of trading. I have been in business for the whole of my life since leaving school, and I have dealt with many caravan sites throughout the country. Never in my experience of 25 years in business have I seen such deplorable trading tactics.<br/>
We must consider not only the short-term nature of the time given to make the decision, and the scale, and the pressure that people have been put under to make this decision, but the choice of a time when there is an inability to look at alternatives, as most holiday sites are

closed in the winter. Many site owner-operators go on holiday at this time of the year. In addition, many site operators impose restrictive conditions which say "You cannot put a caravan on my site unless you buy a caravan from me." To put people who have invested &#x00A3;5,000 or &#x00A3;6,000 in a holiday caravan in a situation in which it becomes valueless overnight through no fault of their own is deplorable.<br/>
Also, there is a lack of information about interest rates in the letter, and there can be no knowledge of which company would be offering to buy the lease from Trellis Scott. The people had no knowledge of the leasehold terms before being requested to sign the paper. Considering the average person, one can understand why this is an enormous problem for those unwilling or unable to bear the financial burden. We must bear in mind that many are already committed to hire purchase in buying a caravan, anyway.<br/>
It is small wonder that one of the tenants has died during this period, possibly due to the pressure and the unfortunate shock of all this. There are other letters in the file, which I shall hand to the Minister, indicating the ill health and worry caused to these people.<br/>
Let us look simply at the financial aspects and the difference from last year. Last year, &#x00A3;165 covered all expenses&#x2014;rates, maintenance and profit for the site owner. But if people took these leases on the terms that the company offered, they would be paying &#x00A3;612 a year for the next five years, and all that they could claim at the end of that period would be that they owned the bit of land, 40 ft. by 30 ft., on which their caravan stood.<br/>
The third point that I wish to raise is the relative position of those who sign these leases between the owner and the tenant. First, I should like the Minister to ascertain whether the Price Commission would be interested in the fact that last year the Gailey Caravan people were paying &#x00A3;165, which included, as I have said, rates, rent and profit, and maintenance of the site and, presumably, it covered the running of satisfactory services, and overnight, with a new owner, people are required to pay &#x00A3;165 for maintenance only, a further &#x00A3;10 for ground rent, and rates and other charges on top of that.<br/>
Surely that exceeds any index that anyone has in terms of increases in prices, because the cost of services could not increase by that sort of rate, and it is considerably higher than the 10 per cent wage rises that most people are likely to get in the next year.<br/>
We must again look at the terms of the lease. The tenants are required to commit real capital. If they sign this lease, they undertake to make the regular payments in terms of maintenance, which, in the letter, the company suggests kindly will be index-linked with the Government's cost of living index so that it can go up automatically each year with the rate of inflation. If they sign this lease, they also undertake that they will get their insurance through the company and that they will get credit through the same company.<br/>
The tenants also sign that the company has the right to insist that they buy a new caravan from it at least every 12 years, at the full manufacturer's recommended price. Those of us who know something about caravans know that very rarely do people buy caravans at the full manufacturer's recommended price.<br/>
The tenants must pay the company at least one year's maintenance if they seek to assign the lease to anyone else, and, should they be unfortunate enough to default on the payment of any of the sums, they are required to pay 5 per cent, a month&#x2014;60 per cent, a year. The lease contains 20 conditions, some of which are normal but others of which I find totally unacceptable. In addition, almost as a joke, the tenants are required to pay &#x00A3;50 for the solicitor's fees to sign the lease.<br/>
What does the company undertake and covenant to do in return for the lease? It commits itself&#x2014;I emphasise "commits"&#x2014;merely to empty the dustbins, keep the site tidy and maintain the existing roads and services already connected to the caravans. In addition, out of the goodness of its heart, it offers to take back the land after five years from anyone who finds the lease unworkable or unsatisfactory&#x2014;at the original price he paid, although the charges are index linked. The promises in the letter&#x2014;of improving standards, a swimming pool, and so on&#x2014;are not commitments.<br/>
If I were signing such a lease which bought me a piece of land on a site for 49 years, the first thing I would do would

be to inquire into the nature of the company. I asked the Library to do this for me, and this is the Librarian's report:
<q>I am afraid I have had very little success in tracing information about Trellis Scott Ltd. I have contacted Companies House, who told me that the company was incorporated on 6th April 1976 and they had the registered office as 17 Church Street, Northampton, but this was apparently changed to Carlyle House, 507 Newport Road, Cardiff on 24th March 1977. Companies House have not received any annual reports for the company at all to date.</q>
All that we know of the company is what we see on its stationery. Mr. S. V. Dunstan is the managing director and a Mrs. Evans is the company secretary. We have no knowledge of its assets, standing or anything else.<br/>
What would be the position of someone who has paid the &#x00A3;1,500 for the lease if after, say, two years the company seeks to go into voluntary liquidation and sell to a new company what is left of the site, which can be only the common services? The new company could impose new conditions. What is the balance between landlord and tenant? Is such a company as Trellis Scott in a position to offer credit, as it did in its letter? Can it be licensed under the Fair Trading Act to offer credit?<br/>
I feel concern that this could be seen as an asset-stripping operation. A company with no parentage moves into a site and in one year can take off a cool &#x00A3;250,000 in cash, committing itself merely, for the maintenance charge that it will make in succeeding years, to maintain the site as it was. Should not the Price Commission look into the profits and charges relative to those of the previous owners?</p>

<p>I am sorry to say that I have not had that opportunity, because everything has moved so quickly, but I intend to do that.<br/>
What protection have the leaseholders should the company default?<br/>
I move on quickly&#x2014;because other hon. Members wish to support what I have to say&#x2014;to the inter-relationship between the various companies involved in this site


operation. On the previous occasion when this sort of thing happened in South Wales the buyer and seller companies were part of the Julian Hodge empire.<br/>
This case involves Mr. S. V. Dunstan who is managing director and who has long links with the same group. The credit is offered by the same group and the company offering and advertising holidays on this site in Sunday newspapers belongs to the same group. I understand, although it is difficult to check the complex matters of companies and their relationships, that Pyre Corner Caravans, Puppet Sands, Whiteford Bay, St. Dinat's Holiday Estate, and Howell Caravans all belong to the same group.<br/>
I am greatly concerned at this interlinking between credit, sites and holidays, which is a virtual monopoly. I ask the Minister whether it is possible for the Monopolies Commission to look into this lack of choice for holiday caravanners and into the position of a caravanner who signs the type of lease I have described, with such a total commitment. Such a caravanner cannot look outside for competition or for better value than that which this company is prepared to offer.<br/>
If, as I understand, all of this is legal, I am gravely concerned for the future of holiday caravanners. There are over 500 registered sites in the country and 245,000 holiday vans on static sites. I know from my own experience that many of these sites are well run by decent people. Many others, however, operate unacceptable conditions. I know that the Minister has evidence of this as a result of the mobile homes survey which is currently being conducted in different parts of the country.<br/>
Holiday caravanners are not necessarily wealthy people. I have read out a letter from one such person and I could read many more. Many caravanners, particularly in the Midlands, have a caravan because of special family circumstances. I urge the Minister to speed up the mobile homes survey and get work started so that in future there is some minimum protection for holiday caravanners. I consider that such minimum protection should comprise a proper period of notice before major changes render the caravanners' investment valueless, the

establishment of reasonable conditions for leases, and security in one form or another for a worried and defenceless group of people.</p>

<p>I echo what has been said by the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Edwards). I omit all of the usual courtesies in view of the lack of time.<br/>
As President of the National Association of Caravan Owners, I have received many letters saying that the Dinas affair is a public scandal. I should like to ask my hon. Friend the Minister of State whether he has had Mr. Dunstan in to see him and spelt out the grave concern felt about this issue. Has he been able, in conjunction with the Department of the Environment, to look at the ways in which those caravanners who have refused to sign the pledges demanded of them on 14th January have been treated? Has he been able to give any undertakings to them? What can he say to others throughout the country who fear that if the Dinas affair is allowed to go unpunished the same thing will happen to them, too?</p>

<p>I am extremely grateful to the hon. Member for Beeston (Mr. Lester) for raising this matter. The attendance in the House of so many hon. Members is a sure sign of the public concern felt over this problem. This is no small matter. It is big business. There are about 245,000 static holiday caravans. I must declare an interest as the owner of such a caravan.<br/>
The investment in a static caravan can run into several thousands of pounds. Those who buy such caravans are investing in British industry and helping British tourism so they ought to have some help from this House. Unfortunately, this business is bringing a good deal


of heartache and anxiety and a deep sense of injustice in a limited number of cases. The root of the problem is that a caravan owner cannot negotiate at arm's length and on equal terms because it is physically impossible in most cases for him to take his custom elsewhere by moving a static caravan.<br/>
I turn to the abuses of the operators' powers and emphasise that, although the volume of complaints is growing, the complaints are not universal. No holiday retreat ought to be a nest of stinging anxieties for those who possess a holiday caravan. I want to deal with the complaints about Trellis Scott and other similar complaints which have come mainly from South Wales&#x2014;Gower, Pembroke and Merthyr.<br/>
I think that the main complaint is about the time for decision. Inequality of bargaining is inevitable, but what I deplore is that any caravan owner should be bulldozed into making a snap decision in a matter of days. I understand that, allowing time for postage, some of these caravan owners have had about 11 days in which to make a major decision on taking a lease, at a substantial premium, which contains a number of dubiously reasonable terms and involves a good deal of expense.<br/>
I use the word "bulldoze" advisedly. These people were told that, if they did not make a decision by 14th January this year, in some cases their caravans would be removed and the services disconnected. I got in touch with Mr. Dunstan, the managing director of Trellis Scott, on the telephone immediately I heard about the matter. He declined to come and meet me, but I discussed the matter with him at length on the telephone. I cannot mention everything that he told me in confidence, but he will not mind my revealing that I expressed my hope that, in view of the concern expressed by the licensees and by many hon. Members, his company would not feel constrained to take precipitate action. In response, he assured me that he would give special consideration to any case of real need or discernible hardship.<br/>
I have no specific power to force a company to act in a particular way towards caravan owners. I am not sure what else I can do to relieve what is an extremely distressing situation for some

individuals. I hope that the company and its officers will respond to the deep-seated concern which I have expressed and which has been expressed by hon. Members.<br/>
There are many other abuses which I have not had time to deal with, but any owner of a caravan faced with this dilemma ought to take immediate action. A decision within a matter of 10 or 11 days could not have been within the wildest contemplation of people who had caravans on this and other sites. I hope that the company will heed my request and that the owners will take advice and seek to negotiate on that advice.<br/>
Although views could be expressed on the prudence of accepting certain clauses in the leases, I think it would be unwise of me to try to offer legal advice from the Dispatch Box in the short time available to me. I will, however, study very carefully all the questions of a legal nature raised by the hon. Gentleman and the documents which he proposes to send to me.<br/>
With regard to possible solutions, apart from that of persuasion, I have looked at the Fair Trading Act 1973, but there are problems there over the definition of a consumer transaction and other matters involving land. I have also looked at the possibilities of a code of conduct, but there are so many operations that it would be extremely difficult to get every one within the ambit of the code. These people are suffering from a mini-monopoly situation. There are problems, and I am looking at them very seriously.<br/>
I cannot give the House a view at the moment on whether it is possible to have a reference to the Monopolies Commission, but I shall examine that request very carefully indeed, because the situation shows many of the abuses which usually arise out of a monopoly.<br/>
The major long-term hope is the mobile homes review. The problems have been listed and my Department has asked 10 consumer bodies for their views on how the law might be changed following the review. About half of these bodies have replied. All of them are in favour of greater protection for holiday caravan owners. I am anxious, as are all hon. Members, that once consultations are complete we should push ahead as fast as possible with the implementation of


the findings of the review in so far as they are relevant to the problems of holiday caravan owners.<br/>
It has been suggested that there could be amendment of existing laws, but they have shown such loopholes that we probably need a new approach to the matter. Security of tenure is probably at the heart of the matter.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned the Price Code. We amended the powers of the Price Commission in the Bill which went through the House in the summer. Charges for site licences for holiday caravans in England and Wales are within the scope of the Price Code, although the Price Commission can merely control the profit margins of site operators. It cannot deal with individual transactions between the caravan owner and the site operator, but it can look at the profit margin of the operator.<br/>
The Trellis Scott case and the other cases drawn to my attention have been passed on to the regional offices of the Price Commission. In addition to the details of the case, the sense of urgency felt by hon. Members has also been conveyed.<br/>
There is, finally, the question of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Having read the letter which was sent to caravan owners, offering to arrange credit terms, I think that there is no doubt that the Director General of Fair Trading has power to grant or to refuse a credit broker's licence to the Trellis Scott company. Whether that happens or not must be left to the Director General. It would not be proper for me to express a view on the grant of a broker's licence since appeals from licensing cases will come to the Secretary of State. It is therefore a matter which I must leave to his judgment, for absolutely proper reasons.<br/>
I am extremely grateful for the speeches made by the hon. Gentleman and other hon. Members. I shall study them with the greatest urgency I hope that, even without the intervention of the law, there will be a change of heart on the part of those who seek to impose decisions in a very short time, involving a great deal of expenditure of money.</p>
