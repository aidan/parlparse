<p>The Appointments Department of the Ministry has on its register particulars of all journalists who care to enrol. Applications by any Government Department for the deferment of calling-up of civil servants whose duties entail journalistic experience are considered by Lord Kennet's Committee in the light of information as to the supply of suitably qualified substitutes from among persons upon the Appointments Register.

<p>asked the Minister of Labour whether he is aware of the unfair discrimination which at present exists in the treatment of workers directed to other employment in other areas, as between workers covered by a trade agreement and those not so covered, which latter, in many cases, suffer cuts in pay and disadvantages as regards regulation working hours; and what he proposes to do about it?</p>

<p>I am aware that workers who are employed in an industry in which an agreement is in operation providing for the payment of a transfer or dispersal bonus to workers sent to employment beyond daily travelling distance from their homes may sometimes be at an advantage as compared with workers in industries in which such an agreement is not in operation. I welcome the drawing-up of such trade agreements, but they are essentially matters for settlement by the industrial organisations concerned, and I cannot agree that in the absence of such agreements men should not be transferred to where their services are most urgently required in the national interest.</p>

<p>asked the Minister of Labour, in view of the fact that in a recent case, of which he has been informed, six ships' joiners from Tilbury were directed to employment, with the result that in the case of one elderly man the direction was later withdrawn and in three of the other cases appeals were upheld by the local board, with the result that only two of the directed men remained available for the work, whether he is satisfied that such cases are adequately considered before directions are issued and that no unnecessary disturbance and dissatisfaction is provoked?</p>

<p>I am satisfied that, in the light of careful general guidance which is given them, National Service officers may be relied upon to exercise proper care in issuing directions under Regulation 58A (1) and that adequate safeguards to prevent undue hardship are in general provided by my allowing appeals to Local Appeal Boards.

<p>asked the Minister of Labour whether he is aware that in certain cases, when a person employed under the provisions of the Essential Work Order is dismissed his employment and his local officers in due course decide against the employer, the employee is out of work for many weeks without income; that when the employer is made aware of the decision against him he may refuse to pay the back wages due to the workman; that the only redress open to the workman is to take proceedings for recovery in a court of law; that all this brings the Order into disrepute in the minds of the workers; and will he remedy this grievance?</p>

<p>I assume my hon. Friend is referring to cases where the employee is dismissed for serious misconduct, and I would refer him to the reply I gave to the hon. Member for Peckham (Mr.

Silkin) on 26th November, 1942, of which I am sending him a copy. The Order makes provision for expeditious settlement of appeals and I am not aware of any general difficulty. If my hon. Friend will let me have particulars of any specific case he has in mind, I will make inquiry into it.</p>

<p>Is the right hon.

<p>No, Sir. I have no evidence of this.

I am satisfied that during the course of the war no further comparison of this kind can usefully be attempted and the Committee ought not to be expected to make it. I propose, therefore, with the concurrence of the Treasury, to make a Regulation suspending for the duration of the war the provisions of Section 59 (2), and certain other parts of Section 59 which are dependent upon this Sub-section.

<p>I must apologise for the somewhat long reply: A considerable amount of information has already appeared in the Press. The following is a summary of the information available:<br/>
A heavy cyclone from the Bay of Bengal passed over the Districts of Midnapore and Twenty-Four Parganas on 16th October. It began about 7 a.m. and lasted 24 hours. A tidal wave, in places 26 feet high, penetrated over 10 miles inland. Approximate estimate of persons killed is 11,000; seriously affected 550,000; partially affected 1,000,000; cattle killed, 75,000; huts destroyed, 700,000; area affected, 3,000 square miles.<br/>
For the organisation of relief the affected area has been divided into 54 circles, each circle in charge of a full-time relief officer who plans and co-ordinates the work of Government and voluntary relief workers and organisations. The latter are undertaking the distribution of immediate gratuitous relief with food, clothing and other necessities, while Government attends to long-term relief such as loans to rebuild houses, reorganise businesses, and to purchase cattle, agricultural implements, and seed. The difficulties of relief work are intensified by lack of roads, flooding, damage to telegraph lines and also by the civil disobedience movement, which continues to obstruct Government workers. The Governor of Bengal has raised a fund for the relief of distress resulting from this disaster, and the High Commissioner for India, with the support of the Lord Mayor of London and others, has made an appeal here to which, I am glad to say, there has been a generous response.</p>

<p>The food situation in India is causing considerable anxiety. Last year's food crops were, in general, satisfactory, but the loss of the Burma rice crop, of which about one and a half million tons normally goes to India, coupled with increased demands for the Army, a serious failure of the millet crop in certain parts of the country, caused prices to rise and food to become in many parts of the country not only dear but scarce. A flood in Sind, and cyclones in Orissa and Bengal accompanied by flooding have been contributory factors but have not in themselves caused more than temporary and local shortages.<br/>
At first the problem was mainly one of distribution, but it must now be accepted that there is a shortage, though that shortage affects only urban areas and a few rural areas where crops have failed. With care and proper distribution there should be enough to go round, and there is no cause for alarm, but the distribution problem is undoubtedly difficult. The Government of India's first measure to meet this vital problem was to centralise in a Food Department a number of administrative functions hitherto spread over various Departments of Government. They have also arranged for purchases of wheat by Government agents from producing areas for the deficiency areas, and similar arrangements are being made for the purchase of other food grains, but the results so far have been disappointing, owing to hoarding and profiteering, which are particularly difficult to deal with. The possibility of individual rationing in urban areas is being seriously examined, and preparatory measures are already being put in train in some of the larger cities. But the administrative difficulties in a


country such as India are obviously great. The question of shipping wheat for India from overseas to tide over the difficult period before the new wheat crop comes on to the market in April is being urgently considered by His Majesty's Government, and I trust that it will be possible to make an announcement on the subject in the near future.</p>

<p>I am aware that a section of the Indian Press, consisting of the majority of the Hindu nationalist Press, refrained from publication on 6th January in protest against an order prohibiting publication of messages relating to the fast of Professor Bhansali, who was agitating for an inquiry into excesses alleged to have been committed by troops and police at Chimur last August. Professor Bhansali has since abandoned his fast and withdrawn his demand for an inquiry. The Press restrictions have in consequence been modified, and the Press on their part have withdrawn their threat of reprisals. The authorities, who were fully satisfied of the baselessness of the allegations against Government servants at Chimur, were obliged to impose the Press restrictions in order to prevent the possibility of a misconceived but dangerous mass agitation, and I see no reason to question their action.</p>

<p>asked the Home Secretary (1) whether he has considered the possible danger to the public of shelters which for any reason have become unsafe; and what action does he propose to take, especially, in view of the fact that the staffs employed by the local authorities have been greatly depleted by war;<br/>
(2) whether, in view of the responsibility that falls on local authorities who have built shelters which are, or may become, dangerous from being vaulted with lime, mortar, or other unsuitable materials, in the event of accidents, especially to unattended children playing in them, he will take steps to enable local authorities to insure against this risk, the premiums being recoverable from the National Exchequer?</p>

<p>In March, 1941, directions were issued for a comprenhesive survey of public and communal surface shelters built in ungauged lime mortar or lime cement mortar, and instructions were given that shelters visibly unstable should be demolished and that those which could not be certified as satisfactory should be either demolished or closed by means of some physical obstruction to prevent entry. It was verified in July, 1941, that all such defective shelters had been dealt with in accordance with these instructions. It is the responsibility of a local authority to keep under review the condition of the shelters in its area and to take steps to demolish or prevent access to any which become unsafe. The Department's technical officers are prepared to give all possible assistance to local authorities in the discharge of this duty. I understand that many local authorities make a practice of insuring their liability to the public for risks arising out of the performance of their statutory functions, but I have not felt able to recognise for purposes of Exchequer grant the cost of any additional premiums which may have been paid to cover the special risks attributable to Civil Defence activities. If the policy of demolishing or preventing access to shelters which become unsafe is duly observed, the need for insuring against the risk of injury to the public in this connection will not arise.</p>

The curtailment of these powers which it may be necessary to invoke at any time in the interests of national security is, however, another matter, and in the view of His Majesty's Government the time has not come when it would be safe to deprive the Executive of these special powers.</p>

<p>In June, 1940, Mr. Wilson, who was at the time detained under Regulation 18B, addressed a communication to the Divisional Court asking that he might be put on trial for some specific offence or offences instead of being detained under the Regulation. The letter was submitted to the Home Office by the prison authorities, and was stopped by an officer because he thought that this was not the proper way for the applicant to approach the Court; that he knew that the applicant was at the time in touch with his solicitors; and that he thought that any application of this kind should be made through the applicant's legal advisers in the appropriate way. This view was entirely mistaken, and my predecessor, who was in office when the mistake occurred, has expressed to the Court his regret that the letter was not forwarded. I am satisfied that the mistake, which occurred at a time when the Department was subject to exceptional stress, was entirely due to an error of judgment. Mr. Justice Humphreys, while strongly censuring any interferences with the right of a British subject who is detained to approach the Court, said in his judgment: "It does not appear that any actual harm accrued to Mr. Wilson from that document being detained"; and he added, "I cannot myself see the smallest justification for suggesting in this case that anything intentionally wrong was done by anyone in the Home Office."<br/>
As regards the particular officer concerned, I am satisfied that no disciplinary action is called for; the strictures passed by the High Court will serve as a valuable lesson to him, as to all officers. I need hardly say that steps have been taken to see that a similar mistake shall not recur, and I wish to express my regret and that of the Lord President that this grave error should have occurred. I must, however, bear in mind that if public business is to be done with proper despatch, appropriate responsibilities must be undertaken by officers. While there must be adequate methods of supervision and instruction, there must not be so elaborate a system of checks and counter-checks as will create intolerable delays and the over-burdening of higher authority.</p>

<p>Race meetings have been drastically restricted in the interests of the war effort and the reduction in the number of meetings may no doubt have resulted in the concentration of a large volume of bets on any particular meeting.

<p>May I put this point to the right hon. Gentleman? The Minister of Town and Country Planning Bill was only issued late last night, and few people have had any opportunity of considering it.

Although I should be the last person to interfere with or delay any Bill dealing with reconstruction, may I put it that to take the Second Reading on the first Sitting Day and complete all the stages on the following day is a little unfair to the House until it has been informed of the general background of policy which necessitated the Bill and has all the information which the House ought to be put in possession of before we can complete the remaining stages of the Bill on the second Sitting Day?</p>

machinery Bill. It is the Bill that we need to enable the Minister to examine the position, settle the policy, and carry on with it.

It is essentially only a machinery Bill.</p>

<p>I hope the right hon. Gentleman will forgive me if I press the point. The fact that it is a machinery Bill does not dispose of my point, that the attitude of the House will be determined by the policy lying behind the machinery that is set up. I am not certain, for example, in my own mind whether this Ministry is desirable or not until I know what lies behind it, and it would put the House in a difficult position to force the Bill through all its stages on two consecutive days.</p>

<p>The reasons that led to the Bill being brought forward were explained at some length in the last reconstruction Debate, in response to a number of questions which the right hon. Gentleman asked. That is the <i>fons et origo</i> of the Bill, and this is the machinery to give effect to what my right hon. Friend then said. I should have hoped we could get it during the next series of Sitting Days, but I am quite willing to consider it, and perhaps it can be discussed through the usual channels.</p>

<p>Perhaps on the next Sitting Day a Question might be put about it. In the interval I should like the Leader of the House to consider the possibility of getting the Workmen's Compensation Bill on the second Sitting Day, as I understand that agreement has been reached, and, if it were found agreeable to the Government to postpone the remaining stages of the other Bill, perhaps the Leader of the House might consider an open Debate on the transfer of labour that day.</p>

<p>In view of the willingness expressed by the Minister of Production to make a report to the House on his recent visit to America and on Government policy with regard to tanks and tank engines, and in view of misleading and disingenuous statements made on the subject recently by the Minister of Defence, will the right hon. Gentleman afford the House an early opportunity of debate?</p>

<p>I accept none of the hon.
