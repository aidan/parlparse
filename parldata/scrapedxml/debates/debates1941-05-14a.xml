<p>While all aspects of our relations with Ethiopia are being carefully considered, military operations in that country are still in progress, and I have therefore nothing at present to add to the statement of policy which I made on 4th February.

<p>I have indicated on recent occasions that Japanese discrimination against our interests in China is at variance with numerous assurances of the Japanese Government, and that in the view of His Majesty's Government the Japanese Government cannot divest themselves of responsibility. I have stated that representations have been addressed to that Government and to its representatives, the outcome of which has been unsatisfactory. To this I must add that I have now instructed His Majesty's Ambassador in Tokyo to reply to Japanese complaints of economic restrictions in British territories by saying that, while our main object is to conserve supplies for our war effort and to prevent these supplies from reaching our enemies, we are naturally influenced in deciding our economic policy by the attitude of the Japanese Government towards our interests in China.</p>

This will be continued. His Majesty's Government are convinced that the action of Rashid Ali and his supporters in launching an attack upon the loyal ally of their country, is not upheld by the Iraqi people as a whole. His Majesty's Government never have had, and have not now, any intention of threatening the independence of Iraq.

<p>The policy which has been adopted and declared by the French Government is collaboration with Germany within certain limits which have not, so far as I am aware, been clearly defined. The agreement with the German

Government of 5th May provides, according to the official announcement issued at Vichy, for the alleviation of the restrictive measures regarding the line of demarcation between occupied and unoccupied France and for the reduction of the costs of occupation from 400,000,000 to 300,000,000 francs a day. The line of demarcation would, according to the communiqu&#x00E9;, be open generally for the passage of goods between the two zones and also for persons in the case of serious illness of near relatives; the despatch of plain postcards from one zone to the other was also to be authorised and soldiers and airmen were to be allowed to pass from one zone to the other under the conditions which had hitherto been applied to sailors only. No official announcement has been made regarding what may have been conceded by France in return for these so-called concessions, but the agreement is described in Vichy as a new step along the path of collaboration.<br/>
Sir, whatever concessions Admiral Darlan may have agreed to, I find it hard to believe that the French people helpless though they may be to prevent the systematic German spoliation of their resources, will be so false to their noble traditions as to work actively of their own free will for the German cause, and thus to prolong the period of their own sufferings and to postpone the day of their own liberation.</p>

<p>Among the recent steps taken to enlist the support, advice and collaboration of the building industry, my Noble


Friend has arranged for an investigation to be made into the best means to secure a united body fully representative of all interests connected with building and construction work. Also, the Minister of Works and Buildings has, with the Minister of Labour, initiated discussions with the building industries which have now reached a stage when it will be possible to take effective action to secure the maximum effort of which the building industry is capable; and I would like to pay a tribute to the patriotic and unselfish attitude exhibited by many in the industry in this matter.</p>

<p>It varies. Of course, there is a controlled price at the works, but it varies, by units of 5 miles, according to the distance which it is conveyed from the works to the job.

<p>No, Sir; so far as the Ministry of Works and Buildings is concerned, the only responsible post in this Ministry connected with cement is that of Director of Cement, and the holder ceased to act as independent chairman of the Cement Manufacturers' Federation on appointment to his present position.

<p>Is it not a fact that the controller is still paid by the cement combine, and that the effective controller, who is usually in attendance with the Director, his immediate chief, is known, as has been pointed out in the Press recently, as the Danish Quisling, and does not the Minister of Transport think that that is a dangerous situation?</p>

<p>I cannot accept the implications of my hon. Friend's suggestion. I can only say that the Director of Cement


was appointed by my right hon. Friend the Minister, and he has no longer any effective control of the cement industry.

<p>In the course of its administration, the Ministry of Food is continually regulating by Order and Direction the prices and distribution of foodstuffs. In the year ending 4th April, 1941, 324 Statutory Orders were made with this object. These Orders cover all essential, and most other, important foodstuffs. Where the price of a commodity is controlled by Order, profiteering becomes a criminal offence. In the case of all commodities owned by the Ministry, distribution is carried out through approved wholesalers and other recognised distributors. In the case of other commodities I fully recognise that existing traders would, speaking generally, favour a system of licensing which would restrict distribution to firms already in business. My Noble Friend is not, however, satisfied that it is desirable in the national interest to make this restriction universal, although as control is extended the licensing or selection of distributors becomes more complete.</p>

<p>The Press notice issued on 1st May was issued on the


instructions given by my Noble Friend. The investigation referred to in the notice was conducted by officials of the Ministry based on information received by the Ministry from a member of the public. As information which was found to relate to the same transactions was received from the North Midland Price Investigation Committee some days after the investigation had started, a copy of the report was, as a matter of courtesy sent to that Committee. It is not proposed to publish the report on the investigation which was conducted in order to ascertain whether there had been any infringement of the Food (Current Prices) Order. In so far as the report disclosed <i>prima facie</i> infringements, the matter is <i>sub judice,</i> and in so far as the transactions took place prior to the Order&#x2014;which was made with the express object of stopping speculators' transactions coming into operation&#x2014;no useful purpose would be served by its publication. My hon. and learned Friend will remember that such investigations can only be made because of the emergency powers granted to Government Departments to compel traders to produce their records.

<p>My hon. and gallant Friend is under a misapprehension if he supposes that the sum payable by way of compensation in cases of this kind is arbitrarily fixed by the War Department.

<p>asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in cases where war damage has already been suffered, whether the insurance premiums, both for house property and chattels, will be debited against the claim, or whether the claimant has to provide premiums in cash in addition to the financial loss, direct and indirect, already incurred?</p>

<p>I will deal separately with the contribution in respect of house property and the insurance premium in respect of chattels. Under Section 33 of the War Damage Act, 1941, any instalment of contribution falling due in respect of a house which has suffered war damage will be allowed to stand over so long as the Inland Revenue are satisfied that the house is unfit for occupation. A claim to defer payment on this ground should be made when the notice of assessment is received. In cases where a "cost of works payment '' is appropriate the instalment will not become payable until the house has been made fit for occupation. If the Inland Revenue are notified by the War Damage Commission that a "value payment" and not a "cost of works payment" is likely to be made, collection of


instalments of contribution will be suspended unless and until the notice is revoked, and if a value payment is eventually made, the amount of that payment will be reduced by so much of the instalments as has not been paid. With regard to the insurance schemes under Part II of the Act, I understand that where war damage has been sustained before 17th April, 1941 (in the case of the business scheme),and before 1st May, 1941 (in the case of the private chattels scheme), the dates of coming into operation of these schemes, an amount in respect of premium will be deductible from the compensation allowance.</p>

<p>In addition to men called up under the National Service Acts the Army has been receiving volunteers up to the age of 50 and in some cases 55. My right hon.

<p>Surely, it is not the policy of the Government, as in 1914, to risk the loss of the very generation which we shall so urgently want at the end of the war for reconstruction? Why should not the Services take us, the 55's, and downwards, since it is far better to lose us, who are not much good?</p>
