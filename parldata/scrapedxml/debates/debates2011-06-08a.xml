	<p pid="a.151.2/1">My hon. Friend speaks for the whole House in what she says about those dreadful pictures of that poor boy. There are credible reports of 1,000 dead and as many as 10,000 detained. The violence being meted out to peaceful protestors and demonstrators is completely unacceptable. Of course, we must not stand silent in the face of those outrages, and we will not. The EU has already frozen the assets of, and banned travel by, members of the regime, and we have now added President Assad to that list. However, I believe that we need to go further, and today in New York, Britain and France will table a resolution at the Security Council condemning the repression and demanding accountability and humanitarian access. If anyone votes against that resolution or tries to veto it, that should be on their conscience.</p>

There is still, on all sides in Northern Ireland, and indeed in the Republic, huge concern about things that happened in past. Often, people ask for an inquiry, a public inquiry or a process.

What people wanted was the unvarnished truth, so then they can come to terms with what happened in the past. I have said that I do not want to see further open-ended inquiries; but I do think there is still more that we can do to uncover and be frank about the truth, and that goes for us on all sides of this debate.</p>

	<p pid="a.163.2/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="a.163.2/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to require the Secretary of State to increase parental involvement in provision of education for children with special educational needs; and for connected purposes.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.2/3">I am aware that the business following my ten-minute rule Bill is of great interest to the House, and so, knowing that you are ever the friend of innovation, Mr Speaker, I shall endeavour to make this a five-minute Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.2/4">The Department for Education&#8217;s current guidance is clear about what parents of a child with special educational needs should expect from their local education authority once a statement has been drawn up: to have their choice of school respected, provided it is a suitable use of LEA resources. In practice, this guarantee is often not worth the paper it is written on. I have met the evidence, so to speak: parents of children with dyslexia or a language disorder, struggling in the aftermath of short-sighted LEA decisions which undermine the principle of an education for all.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.2/5">In these cases, perhaps the LEA has accepted that a child&#8217;s needs should be assessed, but refuses to make an assessment or maybe the parents have pinned their hopes on an appeal against the LEA at the first-tier tribunal only to find that the tribunal panel is the LEA. Alternatively, the child might actually have a statement but the school does not have the right provision, and no one is prepared to provide the enforcement. Alternatively, the child might have a statement but no school place, because the LEA has refused the only suitable provision as it is in the independent sector, even though it would be cheaper than the total cost of state provision. In what is perhaps the cruellest of ironies, some parents, for want of a school place, try to home educate their child, not through choice, but through necessity, only to find that they are cut adrift by the LEA without any support or guidance, and their child&#8217;s name is also removed from all waiting lists. As far as the LEA is concerned, that is one fewer problem to deal with.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.2/6">These parents, some of whom have learning disabilities themselves, have no cards to play, no stick to wield and no hope of redress to ensure that their child has access to an education. In Portsmouth, Martin is due to take his GCSE options next year, yet he has never been to a secondary school. His disability is undiagnosed, and the remedial action required is unrecognised. Iris&#8217;s dyslexia was discovered by good teachers and demonstrated by an independent assessment, but the private school that would meet her needs was refused, even though it would involve the same cost as placing her in an LEA school without any dedicated special educational needs support. Joanne&#8217;s disabilities mean that she is unable to use public transport and so she has been awarded a travel grant to get her to school, but she must make her own way home. James, who is also without a school place, has been required to demonstrate his level of need by</p>
	<p pid="a.163.2/7">failing at school after school, to the extent that failure is now his state of mind. It is little wonder that when he was asked to describe himself by his last teacher, he said he was &#8220;unliked&#8221; and &#8220;alone&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.2/8">Change is needed to strengthen the hands of parents and teachers fighting for these children&#8217;s rights and entitlements. Five principal areas must be addressed and although the recent SEN Green Paper has made progress on them, improvements could be made. First, in the manner of the NHS constitution, the rights and entitlements of children must be established in law. We must have a document towards which parents can point stubborn local authorities. It is not acceptable for a child to fall through the cracks, and a clear assertion of children&#8217;s rights would help to hold authorities to account.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.2/9">Secondly, there must be means other than a statement by which a child&#8217;s needs can be demonstrated and verified. Statementing needs reform, but it can be the only ammunition that parents have. The Green Paper outlined plans for a single assessment process as a replacement for the statement, but to really strengthen parents&#8217; hands other forms of proof should be accepted as evidence of need, even if this simply guarantees that the child undergoes the new assessment. We must remove an LEA&#8217;s power to deny that a child has a special educational need despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. The third aspect of necessary change is closely associated with the second; the link between the assessor and the financer must be broken. Currently, local authorities sit in judgment on SEN cases with only one eye on the child&#8217;s future&#8212;the other is glued to its own bottom line&#8212;and that is not a tenable situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.2/10">Fourthly, all providers of appropriate schooling, including independent schools, must be listed by the LEA, as is supposed to happen already. The last area to address is funding. I applaud the Green Paper&#8217;s commitment to personalised funding, but for this to work properly funding must truly follow the pupil, as with the pupil premium. But unlike the pupil premium, it must include the per-pupil funding derived from the LEA. I urge the Government to consider, as part of their review, how school funding can become genuinely per pupil, whether on a total or top-up basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.2/11">On hearing about my speech today, Iris, whom I mentioned earlier and who is now being funded to attend an independent mainstream school with a specialist dyslexia unit thanks to the generosity of Portsmouth residents and a livery company, suggested that I should tell hon. Members what she told me, and I can think of no better way to conclude. She said:</p>
	<p pid="a.163.2/12">&#8220;At my old school I felt silly and sad because I didn&#8217;t understand. I really love school now. I feel so much happier and I understand everything a lot more. I get lots of help and they make it easy to understand. I have great teachers and lovely friends. Now I want to go to school.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="a.165.1/3">That the said Address be presented to Her Majesty by such Members of the House as are of Her Majesty&#8217;s most Honourable Privy Council or of Her Majesty&#8217;s Household.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.1/4">That a Message be sent to His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh, to offer His Royal Highness the warmest good wishes of the House upon the occasion of his ninetieth birthday, expressing the gratitude of the nation for his lifetime of service to the country and the Commonwealth and praying that His Royal Highness may long continue in health and happiness.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.1/5">That Mr Speaker, the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, Sir George Young and Edward Miliband do wait upon His Royal Highness with the said Message.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.1/6">This week we celebrate the 90th birthday of a remarkable man who has given years of service to our country. Someone who has defended his nation in time of war. A man who has stood alongside Her Majesty the Queen for more than six decades. A man who has given his time, effort and passion to many great causes up and down the country, across the Commonwealth and indeed around the world. I refer, of course, to His Royal Highness Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.1/7">Since the time of William the Conqueror there has never been a consort who has served for so long at the side of a monarch and, as such, Prince Philip has seen extraordinary events in life from the end of rationing to man landing on the moon, and from the end of the cold war to the beginning of peace in Northern Ireland. Of course, along the way he has had to put up with listening to the views of no fewer than 12 Prime Ministers. Through it all he has been there for Her Majesty the Queen as a constant companion and source of rock solid strength. Throughout it all he has served us, the British people, with an unshakeable sense of duty. He has conducted more than 300 public engagements a year and delivered more than 5,000 speeches.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.1/8">Over those years, he has also made more than 600 visits to more than 140 countries. In most of those, he is heralded and much respected as the consort of a monarch, but, of course, there is one&#8212;Tanna, part of Vanuatu&#8212;where he is treated slightly differently. In fact, no public event in that far off part of the Pacific Islands is complete without the islanders holding aloft pictures of Prince Philip, who they worship as a god.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.1/9">Of course, His Royal Highness served this country long before his royal duties began. The Duke of Edinburgh spent 14 years on active service in the Royal Navy. During the Second World War he served with the Mediterranean and Pacific fleets. He was awarded the Greek war cross of valour and was mentioned in dispatches when he manned the searchlights during HMS Valiant&#8217;s triumph at the battle of Cape Matapan. In a fitting tribute to his outstanding abilities, the late Lord Lewin, the First Sea Lord, said he would most certainly have gone right to the top of the Navy.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.1/10">Today the Duke of Edinburgh is a patron of more than 800 organisations. Looking through that long list, one passion shines through: supporting young people</p>
	<p pid="a.165.1/11">by giving them the confidence to stand on their own two feet. It was this passion that led him to initiate the Duke of Edinburgh awards, recognised around the world as the gold standard in leadership for young people. Since 1956, about 6 million young people in 120 countries have won awards by building skills for work and life and proving that they can take responsibility for themselves and their communities. To all of us in this Chamber who believe in the value of helping to change people&#8217;s lives for the better, that is an inspiration. His is a huge achievement for which this country and many others owe the Duke a deserved debt of gratitude.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.1/12">He also has an extraordinary passion for wildlife, nature and the environment. As president of the World Wildlife Fund, he helped to save many of the world&#8217;s most beautiful creatures from extinction, including the snow leopard and the black rhino.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.1/13">The Duke is also a passionate family man and I know that all of us would like to congratulate him on becoming a great-grandfather for the first time with the birth of Savannah Phillips at the end of last year.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.1/14">He has done all these things in his own inimitable way, with a down-to-earth, no-nonsense approach that I believe the British people find endearing. Of course, many of us who give public speeches would be honoured to have a book published of our most famous sayings. There have been several published of his. My own favourite was when, after a long flight, the umpteenth eager-to-please official asked him, &#8220;How was your flight?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Have you been on a plane? Well, you know how it goes up in the air and then comes back down again? Well, it was just like that.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.165.1/15">I would like to go on for a great deal longer but I am reminded of His Royal Highness&#8217;s remark about sermons that overrun. It is not just sage advice for clergy in the pulpit but, I think, probably for us in this place, too. As the Duke put it, &#8220;The mind cannot absorb what the backside cannot endure.&#8221; With that in mind, let me give the final say to the person who knows him best of all, Her Majesty the Queen. She said in a speech to mark their golden wedding anniversary that he had been her</p>
	<p pid="a.165.1/16">&#8220;strength and stay all these years&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.165.1/17">and that she and</p>
	<p pid="a.165.1/18">&#8220;his whole family, and this and many other countries, owe him a debt greater than he would ever claim, or we shall ever know.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.165.1/19">I am sure the whole House will want to join me in wishing His Royal Highness health, happiness and above all a very special 90th birthday.</p>

	<p pid="a.181.1/1">The hon. Lady does not seem to understand that most women do the spending for the children. That is why, originally, Beveridge wanted to ensure that women got some money. Right now&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> Government Members obviously do not talk to women in their constituencies about the way in which child benefit money matters massively as part of their income. Of course a lot of that money is spent on children, but however women spend it, the fact that it is they who get the income gives them choices about how it is spent.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.1/2">I suggest that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40184" name="Louise Bagshawe">the hon. Member for Corby (Mrs Mensch)</phrase> listens to the recording of &#8220;Woman&#8217;s Hour&#8221; from soon after the Government&#8217;s announcement of their plan to take child benefit from those on the highest earnings. A lot of women called in to describe how they were on a low income, even though their husbands were on a higher income. They spoke about the difference that it made to have some money that came to them and over which they made the decisions, even if it was then spent on the children and their future.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-06-08a.189.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40382" speakername="Theresa May" colnum="189"  time="013:47:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110608/debtext/110608-0002.htm#11060855001653">
	<p pid="a.189.1/1">As the hon. Lady knows, we have had a consultation on how we deal with the child maintenance issue. I hope that she would agree that despite the efforts of both Conservative and Labour persuasions over several years, we have not got the child maintenance system right in this country. There are too many people who do not see the absent parent paying child maintenance and we need to do everything we can to get a system that will work. As she will know, the Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40060" name="Maria Miller">the Member for Basingstoke (Maria Miller)</phrase>, is looking at this issue and the alternatives available under the child maintenance proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.1/2">As well as giving all women better opportunities in the workplace, we need to do more to help those who aspire to the very top. Last year, only 12.5 % of all FTSE 100 board members were women. That is simply not good enough, and that is why the Government commissioned Lord Davies to look at how we can increase the number of women on company boards. We have made good progress in implementing Lord Davies&#8217; recommendations. In May, the Financial Reporting Council launched a consultation on changes to the UK corporate governance code in order to help to achieve more diverse and more effective boards. The head-hunting industry has agreed a voluntary code on diversity, and we are building a strong sense of ownership and action in FTSE 100 companies. We have agreed with them a plan for how company aspirational targets should be published by September.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.1/3">The latest figures suggest there has already been an improvement in FTSE 100 companies, just by our shining a light on this area. Some 31% of new board members appointed since Lord Davies&#8217; report have been women, up from just 13% last year, and the number of male-only boards has dropped from 21 in October to 14.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.1/4">We are also helping women to break through the glass ceiling by providing an all-age careers service. The new service will be fully operational by next April, and will provide high quality, professional careers guidance that will be open to all young people and adults. That will help women to make the right choices for themselves and for their careers. For the lowest paid, we will raise the minimum wage to &#163;6.08&#8212;two thirds of those on the minimum wage are women.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.1/5">In other areas we are also making the right decisions to help the most vulnerable. On pensions, again we have had to make some difficult decisions. Yes, we have proposed accelerating the rate at which the state pension age for women becomes the same as the state pension age for men. With life expectancy rising&#8212;and one in nine women pensioners is now expected to live to more than 100&#8212;and with the overwhelming need to reduce the deficit, this was a decision we could not duck. But it means that at the same time we have been able to commit to a triple guarantee, which will increase the basic state pension by earnings, prices or by 2.5 per cent, whichever is highest.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.1/6">The right hon. Member for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford claimed that the earnings link had been restored by the Turner report. Of course the Turner review referred to the earnings link, but the last Government did not restore it. This Government have restored the earnings link and gone further with the triple guarantee.</p>

	<p pid="a.190.3/1">It is not the case that there is a simple link between the acceleration of women&#8217;s pension age and the expenditure on the triple lock. What is happening with pensions is more complex. Two things are happening in relation to the state pension age. The first is the overall acceleration for men and women, raising the age of state pension entitlement. That will bring in significant sums of money and is a reflection not only of Government finance issues but of increased longevity. When the state pension was first introduced, people lived for a very short period, comparatively speaking&#8212;a mater of two to five years&#8212;beyond their retirement. Today, people live for a significant length of time beyond their retirement. The Government therefore need to raise the state pension age, as has been recognised by previous Governments&#8212;the initial decisions to accelerate the rise and raise the state</p>
	<p pid="a.190.3/2">pension age were taken by previous Governments. We have had to take these difficult decisions. As I said, however, although women will experience the rise more quickly than previously planned, they will still draw the pension for an average of 23 years.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-06-08a.191.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40382" speakername="Theresa May" colnum="191"  time="013:47:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110608/debtext/110608-0002.htm#11060855001659">
	<p pid="a.191.1/1">My hon. Friend makes an important point that I was about to deal with. In the longer term, we want to take reforms even further. The state pension Green Paper proposed a single-tier state pension combining the state pension and the state second pension to provide an estimated &#163;140 per week, which would be of particular benefit to women who have had to take time out of the labour market because of their caring responsibilities. The coalition Government are not just talking about this&#8212;we have actually made proposals to help women in this regard.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.1/2">On health, we are pursuing policies that give real help to women. We have stuck to our promise to increase health spending in real terms; we are sticking to our coalition agreement commitment to increase the number of health visitors by 4,200 by 2015; and we are making available &#163;400 million over the next four years to support breaks for all those hard-working carers, many of whom are women.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.1/3">I have made it absolutely clear, as has my hon. Friend the Minister for Equalities, that tackling violence against women and girls is one of my top priorities, which is why in March we published an action plan to tackle the problem; it is why we have provided more than &#163;28 million of stable Home Office funding until 2015 for local specialist services; it is why we have provided &#163;900,000 until 2015 to support national helplines; and it is why for the first time we have put funding for rape crisis centres on a stable footing. We will provide more than &#163;10 million over three years to support their work, and we will open new centres where there are gaps in provision. This should not be a party political issue. It is about helping the 1 million women who suffer domestic abuse each year; the 300,000 women who are sexually assaulted; and the 60,000 women who are raped. As the right hon. Member for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford said, one in four women will experience domestic abuse in their lifetime, and that will often be accompanied by years of psychological abuse. That is why the Government take violence against women and girls so seriously.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.1/4">We will only change damaging behaviour, however, after we have changed the underlying attitudes that cause that behaviour. Those attitudes are fundamentally affected by the culture and society in which children grow up. We share the concern of many parents that children are now being exposed to sexualised images and an increasingly sexualised culture from an early age, which is why we commissioned Reg Bailey, the chief executive of the Mothers&#8217; Union, to lead an independent review of the commercialisation and</p>
	<p pid="a.191.1/5">sexualisation of childhood. He has listened to parents&#8217; concerns about explicit music videos, outdoor adverts and the increasing amount of sexual content in family programming on television.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.1/6">Reg Bailey&#8217;s recommendations call on businesses and broadcasters to play their part, and they include putting age restrictions on music videos, covering up explicit images on the front pages of magazines and newspapers and restricting outdoor adverts near schools, nurseries and playgrounds. He also recommends that retailers sign up to a code of practice that checks and challenges the design, display and marketing of clothes, products and services for children. There has been a great deal of goodwill from the broadcast, retail and advertising industries throughout this review. They know that family friendly practices make good business sense, and the Government will now look to work with business to implement the review&#8217;s proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.1/7">As well as helping women in this country, we are doing more than ever before to help women overseas. We are putting women at the heart of our international development policies, because in development there are few better options than investing in women. In Ivory Coast, for example, an increase of just $10 in women&#8217;s income achieves the same nutritional and health outcomes for children as an increase of $110 in men&#8217;s income. On international women&#8217;s day, the Department for International Development published its new strategic vision for girls and women. It sets out that, by 2015, our international development work will have saved the lives of at least 50,000 women in pregnancy and childbirth and 250,000 newborn babies; will have allowed at least 10 million women to access modern methods of family planning; will have supported more than 9 million children in primary education, of whom at least half will be girls, and 700,000 girls in secondary education; and will have helped 2.3 million women to access jobs and 18 million women to access financial services.</p>

	<p pid="a.195.1/1">I am very glad to be called to speak in this important debate. Let me start by saying how much I agreed with part of the concluding sentiments of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40427" name="Yvette Cooper">the right hon. Member for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper)</phrase>, when she</p>
	<p pid="a.195.1/2">said that this debate is not just about women, but about everybody. That, of course, is where all the Opposition&#8217;s arguments fall down, because they fail to perceive&#8212;she said this was ideological; I agree with her: it is ideological&#8212;that by returning the country to prosperity, we will be returning women to prosperity. She fails to perceive or acknowledge what the former Prime Minister and Member for Sedgefield, Tony Blair, has acknowledged&#8212;along with James Purnell and her right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40079" name="Frank Field">the Member for Birkenhead (Mr Field)</phrase>&#8212;which is that her Government failed to reform the welfare system, and in doing so, failed so many of the women and children in this country, who suffered from being below the poverty line.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.1/3">What a shocking indictment to hear from my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State that the right hon. Lady&#8217;s Government left office with 1 million women unemployed. We heard a list in the right hon. Lady&#8217;s opening arguments of all the ways in which women had fallen behind men in equality. I would say to her and other Opposition Members that Labour had 13 years in power to do something about the inequalities that women suffered, about the welfare system or about children below the poverty line, yet they signally failed to do so, just as they signally failed to tackle our structural deficit. Again and again, we heard her right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40348" name="Gordon Brown">the Member for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (Mr Brown)</phrase> talk about taking tough decisions for the long term, yet he never took any of them. It has taken the two parties on the Government side of the House to fix the mess that the one party on the other side left behind.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.1/4">How astonishing that the Labour party actually dared to call for an Opposition day debate on women&#8217;s issues. When I look at my research brief from the Government I see measure after measure designed to protect children and families. I see a relentless focus on women, children and the most disadvantaged among the dispossessed. This Government must try to perform the incredibly difficult balancing act of fixing the deficit while protecting the most vulnerable, and we are coming up with creative and flexible solutions to a problem that was left to us entirely by the Labour party.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.1/5">Labour Members talk of Sure Start provision. It is a fact that under Labour 50% of Sure Start centres were failing to reach out to the most disadvantaged children. It is a fact that Sure Start provision had moved away from its original purpose, and was failing to reach the most needy and the most vulnerable. Our proposals for Sure Start provision will include payment by results, and rewards for incredibly effective Sure Start centres such as the Pen Green centre in my town of Corby in east Northamptonshire, which has just received a massive amount of investment for research from the Department for Education. We will see extra health visitors, and we will see a relentless focus on children.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.1/6">I find it amazing that, yet again, what we are hearing from Labour Members is naked opportunism. My right hon. Friend the Minister for Women and Equalities made a point that has been made many times on the Government Benches and has always gone unanswered: Labour&#8217;s spending plans involved cuts of &#163;7 in every &#163;8. When asked for specifics, Labour Members always respond with platitudes. They get to their feet and say, &#8220;We agree that the deficit needs to be tackled&#8221;, but when Government Members ask them precisely how they would tackle it, they reply, &#8220;We would not make your cuts.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.195.1/7">The women of this country are not stupid. They know that a blank piece of paper is no answer, and they know that we are fighting at every level for women. They see that there are to be new rape crisis centres in Hereford, Devon, Trafford and Dorset. They see stable funding for rape crisis centres: &#163;10 million a year for the next three years. The Government are dealing with the important issue of violence against women, and they are taking action against rape. We are seeing deeds rather than words from this Government.</p>

	<p pid="a.197.1/1">I believe that the proposal to reduce legal aid funding was in the hon. Lady&#8217;s party&#8217;s manifesto. She will know, or she should know, that the legal aid system is incredibly inefficient and incredibly costly. Once again, we hear from Labour Members objections to a particular cut; once again, it is a particular cut that Labour also proposed in its manifesto; and once again, Labour Members have no specific proposals whatsoever to offer the women of this country on how they would implement their policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.1/2">As my right hon. Friend the Minister for Women and Equalities pointed out, universal credit is an attempt to tackle not the symptoms but the root causes of women&#8217;s poverty. According to statistics from the Department for Work and Pensions, it will take an estimated 350,000 children and 1 million people out of poverty. That is genuine progress. We know that women and children suffer in workless households, and we are finally grasping the nettle and tackling the problems that Labour refused to tackle.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.1/3">As I look through my statistics, I see programme after programme directed at women. We have talked about the massive investments in existing rape crisis centres and the new ones that are being built. We have talked about the increase in the minimum wage&#8212;and so many of the 890,000 people affected by the increase to &#163;6.08 will be women. Under Labour, it was perfectly legal for Jobcentre Plus offices to display advertisements for sex workers. It is absolutely appalling that Labour allowed that to continue, but this Government have stopped it.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.1/4">What about the extra investment in the national health service? Labour is very quiet about the fact that it would cut funding for a service on which women increasingly rely. How bizarre to sit here&#8212;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-06-08a.206.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40204" speakername="Claire Perry" colnum="206"  time="014:52:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110608/debtext/110608-0002.htm#11060855001710">
	<p pid="a.206.4/1">One might just take the hon. Lady&#8217;s intervention back a little. Sure Start was invented in the United States in the early 1990s, where it was targeted, as she knows, at the children who needed it most, and it was a great success. If I had been in Parliament when Sure Start was introduced I would have supported it in its early incarnation. It is a very sound idea, but of course it had to grow from something that was very useful when targeted to something that became a universal political point.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.4/2">Let us hear what happened. In 2010 the National Audit Office found that</p>
	<p pid="a.206.4/3">&#8220;there was no reduction in inequality between child development achieved in the 30% most disadvantaged communities and in the rest of England, against a target to reduce the gap by four percentage points&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.4/4">We must remind ourselves that Sure Start was introduced to intervene in the lives of the most vulnerable and needy children and families, and that that target was completely missed. Did any discussion take place about how to target Sure Start better? Was there any acknowledgement that one of the huge issues related to</p>
	<p pid="a.206.4/5">the lack of trust going out and reaching in to the most disadvantaged communities? We know that more than half of the Sure Start centres were failing to reach out to vulnerable families. What should people do in those circumstances? Should they think about how to change that, or should they keep spending and criticise a Government who want to target the money better? The 4,700 extra health visitors jobs&#8212;almost 5,000 of them, which will largely be filled by women&#8212;represent the way to get from the Sure Start centre out into the community and really help the most disadvantaged children, who absolutely need that intervention. That is what we are planning to do, but we hear no support for it. Again, that is because of the rank hypocrisy that we are hearing from Labour Members today.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.4/6">The other thing we are hearing today is that the Government have no policies in the area of equality. This is a House of very intelligent people&#8212;I keep saying that so it has to be true. There are Members in all parts of the House who work on a cross-party basis on unbelievably important issues, be it child protection or trying to stop the pernicious influence of pornography on the lives of our families. We should be working together on how to make Sure Start centres more effective &#8212;on what we can actually do to make a difference&#8212;instead of getting involved in this bandwagonism. I find it incredibly demeaning for the House to be participating in that.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.4/7">We are dealing here with unbelievable hypocrisy, given that it is coming from a party that maxed out on the nation&#8217;s credit card. Its approach means that we are spending 39 times the annual operating budget of Sure Start on servicing Labour&#8217;s debts. That is the legacy that we are having to deal with. Do we hear any innovative or sensible suggestions about how to deal with it? No, we do not.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.4/8">We have a benefits system has been created to trap many women in the sorts of poverty from which we would all want them to get out. We know that the benefits system is costing everyone &#163;3,000 a year, but do we get any positive recognition and support for our welfare reform policies and the universal credit that we are proposing? I do not think so. Let us put aside this bandwagonism and hypocrisy, and let us talk about what this coalition Government are actually doing.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.4/9">First&#8212;this is obviously the elephant in the room&#8212;the Government are taking action to pay off the previous Government&#8217;s crippling debts, which did not pop up overnight as a result of the credit crunch. The Labour Government spent more than they took in taxes every year from 2002, wishfully thinking that post-endogenous growth theory&#8212;I went to Nailsea comprehensive school and do not have a clue what that means&#8212;would somehow bring us out of the mess. Well, guess what: it does not. A Government have to live within their means if they are not to burden our children with debts, as the profligacy of the Labour Government did. This Government will live within their means. We are making the spending reductions that the Labour party left us with in a way that focuses the scarce resources on those who need them most.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.4/10">We are facing a public sector pay freeze, and that is tough. Some 35% of the employment based in my constituency is in the public sector, so members should</p>
	<p pid="a.206.4/11">not think that I do not get a lot of letters about that. However, I also hear from the women, many of whom work part time, who are grateful to be excluded from the pay freeze because they are low earners. They recognise that in these scarce times things have to change, but they think that it is important that the pay freeze excluded the lowest paid, and so do I. The Government have also taken 880,000 people out of taxation completely and definitively with a one-off move&#8212;it was not the fiasco of the 10p tax rate&#8212;and that benefits lower-income women and families in this country hugely.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.4/12">We have heard a lot from Labour Members about child tax credits&#8212;I am confused, because I thought that the Government were raising child tax credits in absolute terms and ahead of indexation for the most disadvantaged families, who need them the most. I believe that that benefits 4 million of this country&#8217;s poorest families. We are examining Sure Start centres, ring-fencing the funding and investing in 5,000 additional health visitors, who can stop Sure Start centres being a nice thing thrown on the wall and make them work.</p>

	<p pid="a.210.3/1">It hardly matters, I think. We are talking about three or four years of cuts and this year&#8217;s cuts will be followed by similar cuts next year and the year after. I am surprised that Government Members can look with such equanimity at something such as the 2,000 job cuts that are happening in Manchester.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.3/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40204" name="Claire Perry">The hon. Member for Devizes (Claire Perry)</phrase> talked about protecting the NHS, but in reality hundreds of jobs are being lost in the NHS, as they are in local councils. Jobs are being lost through the abolition of our primary care trust in Salford and that change is also causing turmoil to local services and decision making. At Salford Royal hospital, 720 jobs are being cut, including those of 146 nurses. The Christie, our regional council hospital, is to reduce its staffing by 213&#8212;one in 10 of the current work force&#8212;including 40 nurse-grade jobs and 50 health care support or assistant jobs. I am sure that none of us would look with equanimity at that level of job loss.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-06-08a.216.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40684" speakername="Debbie Abrahams" colnum="216"  time="015:37:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110608/debtext/110608-0002.htm#11060855001736">
	<p pid="a.216.1/1">I pay tribute to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40686" name="Jonathan Ashworth">the Member for Leicester South (Jon Ashworth)</phrase>, who is no longer in his place, for making his maiden speech. I will keep my remarks short and so will not take interventions.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/2">Some people may wonder why we are having this debate and considering the impact of the Government&#8217;s policies on the needs and issues facing women, rather than any other group, and they have a point. When we develop policies, we should consider the differential distribution of their effects on a range of different population groups, not just women, but obviously including them. Importantly, we should look at whether those policies improve the circumstances for those groups and how that might happen, whether by improving their educational and job opportunities, through access to minimum income standards or through opportunities to achieve a healthy life expectancy and so on.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/3">Most importantly, we should look at ensuring that those policies reduce rather than exacerbate the inequalities that persist between different population groups in our society. It is about ensuring that those policies are fair and that our society is fair. On that basis, it is appropriate for us to debate the issues that women increasingly and disproportionately face as a result of the Government&#8217;s policies. That is the crux of the debate. It is about how the policies are affecting women now. We should not be</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/4">harking back to the past. The policies are unfortunately affecting women in an unfair, unjust and even discriminatory way and we must be mindful of that.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/5">We have already heard that, more than 40 years after the Equal Pay Act 1970, women are still more likely to be paid less than men for the same work and to live in low-income households. Although Labour did much to address income inequalities in recent years&#8212;there is evidence to prove it&#8212;the pay gap between men and women remains, at around 16.4 %. We have heard different figures today for the pay gap, but it is even worse for women in high-paid jobs. Women are also more likely to work part-time, and half of all part-time workers, both men and women, are paid less than &#163;8 an hour. One in five women, compared with one in 10 men, earns less than &#163;7 an hour, but whichever low-pay threshold we use, we find that the number of low-paid women is approximately double that of men.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/6">On top of that, Equality and Human Rights Commission research shows that approximately 30,000 women a year lose their jobs as a result of pregnancy. Those income and other inequalities persist for women throughout their lives. Lone mothers and single female pensioners are more likely to be in low-income households than their male equivalents, although the evidence indicates that that situation improved under Labour.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/7">This is an unsatisfactory state of affairs, but unfortunately it has been exacerbated by the policies that this Government have introduced. Despite earning less and owning less, women are set to lose an average of &#163;8.80 a week, compared with &#163;4.20 for men, because of the Government&#8217;s deficit reduction programme. Reductions in tax credits, benefits, pensions and attendance allowance will all hit women harder, and, as the Institute for Fiscal Studies shows, last year&#8217;s regressive spending review saw families most detrimentally affected, with lone parents worst affected of all.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/8">This year&#8217;s Budget did nothing to compensate part-time working mothers, and women pensioners got nothing from the increase in tax allowance. The threat to universal, affordable quality child care, including the removal of ring-fenced funding for Sure Start, is a major hit to women as well as to their children. Child care is probably the biggest issue for women juggling work and family, and similarly the provision to exempt some organisations from the requirement to provide maternity and paternity leave is a retrograde step.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/9">The measure in the Welfare Reform Bill to incentivise separated parents who currently use the Child Support Agency to make private arrangements in the future for child maintenance, and to place financial penalties on them if they do not, is another example whereby support for women is being eroded. Ultimately, support is needed to address the latent discrimination that women face.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/10">Pensions are another crucial area where this Government have penalised women. In the past few weeks, hundreds of women in my constituency have contacted me about the Government&#8217;s decision last September to accelerate the equalisation of the state pension age for women to 65 years old in 2016 instead of 2020.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/11">The Government also announced an increase in the state pension age for men and women to 66 years old by 2020 instead of 2024. The Library estimates that in my constituency the changes will affect 4,300 women,</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/12">compared with 3,800 men, with a notional loss of income from state pensions of up to &#163;10,700 for approximately 200 women.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/13">We all agree that women are living longer, and that we need to change the state pension age, but the issue is about the time being taken to do so.</p>

	<p pid="a.221.1/1">This has been a lively and welcome debate, and a rare occasion on which women have outnumbered men in the Chamber. That said, it was a privilege to be here for the maiden speech of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40686" name="Jonathan Ashworth">the Member for Leicester South (Jon Ashworth)</phrase>. He will be a tremendous asset to the House, and he is one of my longest-standing friends in politics. I congratulate him on his election, and also on the birth of his daughter. It will be a busy time ahead for him.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.1/2">My hon. Friend feared that he would be the token male in today&#8217;s debate, and overall the debate has been sisterly, although when my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40427" name="Yvette Cooper">the Member for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper)</phrase> was referred to by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40204" name="Claire Perry">the hon. Member for Devizes (Claire Perry)</phrase> as simply the shadow Chancellor&#8217;s wife, that was language that one would perhaps have expected more from the Justice Secretary. <i>[Interruption.] </i>Members are saying that that is cheap, but I think it was the hon. Lady&#8217;s comment that was cheap rather than mine.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.1/3">One thing is clear: whether by ignorance or design, the Government are disproportionately hitting women with their cuts, their pensions policy and what is happening in the jobs market. Until now, every generation of women have enjoyed greater opportunity than their mothers or grandmothers. My great-grandmother was a cockle picker on the south coast of Wales, my grandmother worked in shoe factories and my mother is a primary school teacher. However, that expectation that women of the next generation will do better than</p>
	<p pid="a.221.1/4">those of the one before is now threatened, largely by the choices that the Government are making. They risk turning back the clock on women&#8217;s equality.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.1/5">I wish to address some of the specific points that have been made today. My hon. Friends the Members for Oldham East and Saddleworth (Debbie Abrahams), for Newport East (Jessica Morden), for Aberdeen South (Dame Anne Begg), for Wolverhampton North East (Emma Reynolds), for Worsley and Eccles South (Barbara Keeley) and for Edinburgh North and Leith (Mark Lazarowicz) all mentioned the state pension age for women, as did the hon. Members for Solihull (Lorely Burt), for North Wiltshire (Mr Gray) and for Belfast East (Naomi Long). Earlier today, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40395" name="Annette Brooke">the hon. Member for Mid Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke)</phrase> and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40278" name="Lindsay Roy">the Member for Glenrothes (Lindsay Roy)</phrase> challenged the Prime Minister about it.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.1/6">The changes that the Government plan will mean that women have to wait up to two years longer for their state pension, whereas no man will have to wait more than a year longer. They will mean a loss of income of up to &#163;15,000 for up to 33,000 women, yet the coalition agreement states that the parties agree to</p>
	<p pid="a.221.1/7">&#8220;hold a review to set the date at which the state pension age starts to rise to 66, although it will not be sooner than&#8230;2020 for women.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.221.1/8">Yet under plans in the Pensions Bill, the state pension age for women will start to rise to 66 in 2018.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.1/9">As the hon. Member for Belfast East said, MPs of all parties can show that they understand the fierce concerns and aspirations of women by opposing the Government&#8217;s proposals to increase the state pension age at such a pace. A petition with more than 10,000 signatures has been presented to the Prime Minister, and Age UK and Saga are calling on the Government to think again. I welcome the chance to hear what the Minister for Equalities has to say about that, and I welcome the fact that the Minister of State, Department for Work and Pensions, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40606" name="Steve Webb">the hon. Member for Thornbury and Yate (Steve Webb)</phrase>, is also in his place. I hope that they will listen to the concerns that women are raising.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.1/10">As for incomes, either by accident or by design the Government&#8217;s policies on tax and welfare changes will, as my hon. Friend the Member for Oldham East and Saddleworth mentioned, have twice as much of an impact on women as on men. All incomes are being squeezed during these difficult economic times, but some are being squeezed more than others. That is particularly the case for women and children. Does the Minister for Women and Equalities really believe that it is fair that women are paying the highest price for budget deficit reduction? If not, will she look again at some of the Government&#8217;s policies?</p>
	<p pid="a.221.1/11">My hon. Friends the Members for Leicester West (Liz Kendall) and for Worsley and Eccles South spoke passionately about Sure Start and its tremendous work in all our communities. Many mothers and children rely on the services that Sure Start and our children&#8217;s centres offer, and although <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40184" name="Louise Bagshawe">the hon. Member for Corby (Mrs Mensch)</phrase> thinks they are failing families, the women and children I talk to in Leeds West and across the country believe that they are making a massive difference. The Government say that that money is protected, but in reality, particularly in northern cities where there are cuts of up to 27% of total spending, it is not possible to ring-fence that money. I ask the</p>
	<p pid="a.221.1/12">Government to look again at ensuring that vital services such as children&#8217;s centres and the Sure Start offer are protected.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.1/13">The latest job figures show that jobseeker&#8217;s allowance among women is at its highest level since 1996. As my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford and Urmston said, 474,000 women are now claiming it. Those problems are only likely to get worse. Sixty-five per cent. of public sector workers are women, as are 75% of those working in local government. If the Office for Budget Responsibility&#8217;s predictions of 310,000 job losses in the public sector in this Parliament are correct, we can expect a large proportion of those to be among women, meaning that the highest unemployment among women since 1996 will get worse, not better, in the years ahead.</p>

	<p pid="a.226.5/1">No. I forgot that I was not going to give way. I was seduced by the siren voices behind me.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.5/2">An important point was made about the Government&#8217;s commitment to women. Extending the Sojourner project, and finding a long-term solution with the Department for Work and Pensions, mean that such women will not again be put in the position of not knowing where there support is coming from.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.5/3">My hon. Friend the Member for Solihull said that we should work together. Well, I am very happy to work with her, and I am happy to work with Opposition Members too, because we need to get past these attacks about blind spots and what they say the coalition Government are and are not doing to women. We all care passionately about the position of women in this country. I find it difficult to accept Opposition Members&#8217; criticisms, given how much we are doing. The Home Secretary laid that out quite clearly in her introductory remarks when she gave a long list of things that we are delivering for women.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.5/4">I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Corby on what was a powerful speech, if not a tour de force, in which she pointed out Labour&#8217;s failure to reform the welfare system. She talked of our relentless focus on children&#8217;s well-being, and the fact that we are taking 1 million children out of poverty. My hon. Friend the Member for Devizes talked about health visitors and the importance of Sure Start, and my hon. Friend the Member for Solihull pointed out that not a single Liberal Democrat council has closed any children&#8217;s centres&#8212;<i>[Interruption.] </i>Sometimes it is quality, not quantity. Much as I would like to work with Opposition Members, I am afraid that it might not happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.5/5">I wanted to respond to all the points that have been raised, but unfortunately I will not have time. The hon. Member for Worsley and Eccles South asked about support for carers. The Government have provided &#163;400 million to the NHS for respite care over the next four years.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-06-08a.232.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40382" speakername="Theresa May" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for the Home Department"  colnum="232"  time="016:33:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110608/debtext/110608-0003.htm#11060855002301">
	<p pid="a.232.1/1">With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a statement on the new National Crime Agency. Last year&#8217;s national security strategy recognised that organised crime is one of the greatest threats to our national security. The social and economic costs are estimated at between &#163;20 billion and &#163;40 billion per year, and its impact is seen on our streets and felt in our communities every single day. The drug dealing on street corners; the burglary and muggings by addicts; the trafficking of vulnerable young women into prostitution; the card cloning and credit card fraud that robs so many&#8212;all are fundamentally driven by organised criminals.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/2">Our law enforcement agencies assess that there are some 38,000 individuals engaged in organised crime, involving 6,000 criminal groups; and yet, Sir Paul Stephenson, the Commissioner of the Metropolitan police, said last year that law enforcement is impacting in a meaningful way on only 11% of those 6,000 organised crime groups. We must do better.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/3">For too long, central Government micro-managed and interfered in local policing, but at the same time national and international crime was neglected and our borders became porous. There was no cross-government strategy to tackle organised crime, no national tasking and co-ordination, and no co-ordinated border policing. Different agencies had varying responsibilities for policy, prevention and investigation, and there was a tendency to operate in silos. The overall effect was a fragmented and patchy law enforcement response, and we are putting that right.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/4">By introducing police and crime commissioners, we can get central Government out of the way of local policing. We are putting the Government&#8217;s focus where it should have been all along: on securing our borders, and tackling national and international serious and organised crime. So we will shortly be publishing the first ever cross-government strategy on tackling organised crime and we will establish a powerful new operational body&#8212;the National Crime Agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/5">The National Crime Agency will be a crime-fighting organisation. It will tackle organised crime, defend our borders, fight fraud and cybercrime, and protect children and young people. With a senior chief constable at its head, the NCA will harness intelligence, analytical capabilities and enforcement powers. Accountable to the Home Secretary, the NCA will be an integral part of our law enforcement community, with strong links to local police forces, police and crime commissioners, the UK Border Agency and other agencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/6">The NCA will comprise a number of distinct operational commands. Building on the work of the Serious Organised Crime Agency&#8212;SOCA&#8212;the organised crime command will tackle organised crime groups, whether they operate locally, across the country or across our international borders. Fulfilling a key pledge in the coalition agreement, the border policing command will strengthen our borders, and help to prevent terrorism, drug smuggling, people trafficking, illegal immigration and other serious crimes. It will ensure that all law enforcement agencies operating in and around the border work to clear, mutually agreed priorities. The economic crime command will make a</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/7">major difference to the current fragmented response to economic crime. Working to a new unified intelligence picture, the economic crime command will drive better co-ordination of cases, and better tasking of resources, across agencies such as the Financial Services Authority, the Office of Fair Trading and the Serious Fraud Office. That will mean that a greater volume and complexity of economic crime cases can be tackled. In due course, we will review the relationship between the economic crime command and the other agencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/8">Building on the significant contribution that the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre&#8212;CEOP&#8212;already makes within SOCA, CEOP will as a key part of the NCA be able to draw on wider resources and support to help protect even more children and young people. The NCA will also house the national cybercrime unit, which will have its own investigative capacity and help local police forces to develop their own response to the online threat. Each command will be led by a senior and experienced individual, and will manage its own priorities and risks, but, crucially, capabilities, expertise, assets and intelligence will be shared across the entire agency and each command will operate as part of one single organisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/9">Intelligence will be at the heart of what the NCA does. Learning from our experience of counter-terrorism, the NCA will house a significant multi-agency intelligence capability. It will collect and analyse its own and others&#8217; intelligence, building and maintaining a comprehensive picture of serious and organised criminals in the UK: who they are and who they work with; where they live; where they operate; what crimes they are involved in; and what damage they cause. The NCA will then use that intelligence to co-ordinate, prioritise and target action against organised criminals, with information flowing to and from the police and other agencies in support of tactical operations. Using this intelligence picture, the NCA will have the ability and the authority to task and co-ordinate the police and other law enforcement agencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/10">For the first time, there will be one agency with the power, remit and responsibility for ensuring that the right action is taken at the right time by the right people&#8212;that agency will be the NCA. All other agencies will work to the NCA&#8217;s threat assessment and prioritisation, and it will be the NCA&#8217;s intelligence picture that will drive the response on the ground. That will be underpinned by the new strategic policing requirement.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/11">As well as having the ability to co-ordinate and task the response to national crime threats by the police and other agencies, the NCA will also have its own specialist operational and technological capabilities, including surveillance and means to deal with fraud and threat-to-life situations. This is a two-way street; the NCA will be able to provide its techniques and resources in support of the police and other agencies, just as it will task and co-ordinate the response to national-level crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/12">NCA officers will be able to draw on a wide range of powers, including those of a police constable and immigration or customs powers. That will mean that NCA officers, unlike anybody else, will be able to deploy powers and techniques that go beyond the powers of a police officer.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/13">The agency will be an integral part of the golden thread of policing that runs from the local to the national and beyond. At home, the NCA will work in partnership with police forces, chief constables, police</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/14">and crime commissioners and agencies such as the UK Border Agency. Overseas, it will represent the UK&#8217;s interests, working with international law enforcement partners. It will also provide the central UK contact for European and international law enforcement.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/15">The agency will come fully into being in 2013, with some key elements becoming operational sooner. The total cost of the organisation will not exceed the aggregate costs of its predecessors. The combination of a single intelligence picture, the tasking and co-ordination function, the specialist operational support and the operational commands will result in a dramatic improvement in our response to national and international crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/16">Organised crime, border crime, economic crime, cybercrime and child exploitation are real problems for real people. All areas of the country suffer their effects&#8212;from the very poorest communities to the most affluent, from the smallest villages to the biggest cities&#8212;and it is often the most vulnerable in our society who suffer the greatest harm. We owe it to them to do more to tackle the scourge of drugs, better to defend our borders, to fight fraud and to protect our children and young people. The National Crime Agency will do all those things and more and I commend the statement to the House.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-06-08a.234.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40427" speakername="Yvette Cooper" colnum="234"  time="016:33:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110608/debtext/110608-0003.htm#11060855002302">
	<p pid="a.234.0/1">I thank the Home Secretary for providing an advance copy of her statement. We have already had another day, another debate&#8212;now it is another day, another statement. Once again, to listen to the Home Secretary one would think this was year zero, that everything failed in the past and that everything will be nirvana in the future. Yesterday, she told us that the Labour Government&#8217;s Prevent strategy had failed and her new strategy would make no mistakes. Today, she claims that there was no cross-Government organised crime strategy and no effective work on organised crime before, but that for the future we will see a dramatic improvement in the fight against national and international crime just as a result of these changes. There is no end to this Home Secretary&#8217;s hostages to fortune.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/2">The right hon. Lady also contradicts herself. She says that there was no cross-Government strategy on organised crime, but then she says the organised crime command will build on the work of the Serious Organised Crime Agency, which was set up by Labour in 2005 to take the fight to organised crime. It had a conviction rate of more than 90%. She says that the National Crime Agency will be a crime-fighting organisation with intelligence at the heart of what it does, with the combined powers of police, customs and immigration officers, but that is what SOCA is. Whereas yesterday we had control orders and son of control orders, today we have SOCA and SOCA plus. It is hardly year zero and hardly a new nirvana.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/3">We think we should build on SOCA. Sometimes, it became focused too purely on intelligence and it makes sense to do more to reform national policing. There are considerable benefits that can flow in this area, but reforms also need to be handled effectively or they can go badly awry&#8212;and they have already gone awry. Child protection experts have resigned, counter-terrorism plans have been publicly slapped down by the Met and the Serious Fraud Office has been put in a state of suspended animation. That has all happened at a time when 12,000</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/4">police officers are being cut across the country and the Government are pushing ahead with American-style plans for police and crime commissioners whom nobody wants. The truth is that these plans have been dogged by chaos and confusion. From her statement, there is no sign that the Home Secretary has a grip. Let us consider the individual points that she has made.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/5">The Child Exploitation and Online Protection Agency had good results this year, but Jim Gamble, its successful head, resigned from the agency after seeing the Government&#8217;s plans to merge CEOP with the NCA. He said today:</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/6">&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe that the rebranding or the submerging of CEOP within a far greater entity will allow the critical child protection focus that we need.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/7">He made the point that CEOP will also suffer a 10% per cent reduction in its budget by 2014 and said that he hoped the Government would release the submissions to the consultation on the merger, because they were overwhelmingly against it. We hope too that the Home Secretary will release them, because she has clearly not persuaded the experts on those plans.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/8">On financial crime, the grandly titled economic crime command is a far cry from the Home Secretary's plans to merge the Serious Fraud Office and parts of the Financial Services Authority. Instead, do we have a co-ordinating committee? Or is this just another agency to work with the many already in the field? Does this risk limbo for the SFO, whose director has already said:</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/9">&#8220;This is a distraction and it is important that a clear direction is made as soon as possible so that the SFO is focused on delivering results for the public.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/10">The Home Secretary has clearly not persuaded the experts or the Chancellor of her plans.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/11">On the border command, the Home Secretary says: &#8220;Fulfilling a key pledge in the coalition agreement, the border policing command will strengthen our borders, and help prevent terrorism&#8221;, but the coalition pledge was for a border police force, not just a command. In the Conservatives&#8217; manifesto, it was more boots on the ground. They were talking about 10,000 people a few years ago. Has that been replaced simply by a board to oversee better cross-agency working?</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/12">Plans to move counter-terrorism from the Met have been ditched after the commissioner said that national security is &#8220;too important&#8221; and</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/13">&#8220;must be based on more than mere structural convenience&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/14">Can the Home Secretary confirm that she does not plan to destabilise matters by revisiting this issue during the important period in the run-up to the Olympics?</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/15">On the National Policing Improvement Agency the Home Secretary has said nothing at all, but she is disbanding it in 2012&#8212;a year before the NCA starts. We still do not know what is happening to the DNA database or to a whole series of other functions. The chief constable of Derbyshire has said:</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/16">&#8220;We face an issue that there are absolutely critical services provided by the NPIA that, at the moment, have a date that is going to drop off, with nowhere to go.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/17">What will happen to them? The Home Secretary has not explained how tasking will work, what will happen if chief constables disagree and who will make the final decision when resources become overstretched.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/18">On resources, the Home Secretary says that the total cost of the organisation will not exceed the aggregate costs of its predecessors, but she has not commented on set-up costs. Peter Neyroud has estimated that this top-down reorganisation will cost between &#163;15 million and &#163;20 million. When that is added to the cost of police and crime commissioners we have &#163;120 million being spent on top-down reorganisations while 12,000 police officer posts are being cut, putting the fight against crime at risk across the country. There is a risk that chaos and confusion will make it harder for the police to cope given the drop in resources that they are experiencing.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/19">For this renamed crime agency to be successful, it needs steady leadership, clarity and the resources to deliver. In the end, reorganisation is no substitute for police officers on the ground doing the job on national and local crime and going the extra mile to catch criminals and keep communities safe. That means we need an end to the confusion and a bit more realism both about the past and about the detail of the reform. We need to start closing the gap between the rhetoric and the reality on the ground.</p>

	<p pid="a.251.0/1">The hon. Lady made the same point about local knowledge when speaking about the growth of shipping in the Clyde estuary. It is a crucial factor. While the technology on the larger ships will enable them to make the most of the new technology that the MCA is proposing to introduce, many smaller vessels&#8212;including fishing vessels and, in particular, pleasure craft&#8212;will not. It is particularly important to retain local knowledge in areas such as the Clyde, where there will be much more shipping than there is at present.</p>

	<p pid="a.251.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for his helpful intervention. In my constituency, a number of marinas have opened in recent years. We have the largest marina in Scotland in Largs. There has been a huge increase in the use of our seas for pleasure activities and sailing of all types, but with that come many inexperienced users, with whom coastguard station staff will find it more difficult to deal.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.1/2">Submissions put together by the Clyde staff, with the assistance of Inverclyde council, contain costings for a site at Greenock. The lease at Greenock will expire in 2012, and a number of other local options have been costed. I should be grateful if the Minister would confirm that they will be considered. The Driving Standards Agency recently decided not to close its Cardiff office after the Public and Commercial Services union was able to make proposals for a cheaper site, and I wonder whether a similarly open-minded approach will be adopted in this instance. Will the Minister ensure that the submissions from Clyde staff and Inverclyde council are given proper and careful consideration?</p>
	<p pid="a.251.1/3">As I have said, it is far from clear what criteria were used for the proposals that were announced on <phrase class="date" code="2011-12-16">16 December</phrase>. I hope the Minister agrees that it is only fair for there to be a transparent process, and for proper responses to be provided to questions such as those that I have asked today. The Clyde coastguard station has provided an excellent service, and I hope that once the Government have an opportunity to consider the issues in detail, they will decide to reconsider the proposals and keep it open.</p>

I have gone through redundancy, despite my union fighting to help me, so I understand where people are coming from.

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-06-08a.258.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40308" speakername="Michael Penning" colnum="258"  time="017:43:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110608/debtext/110608-0003.htm#11060855002392">
	<p pid="a.258.1/1">May I just place it on the record that I openly said at Crosby and as I went around the country that I wanted coastguards and the public to engage? I am quite careful about my words, even though I regularly read without notes, as I am doing now, and I did not say that those staff could give evidence to the Select Committee in oral session, but I did say that they could submit written evidence. I also said that to the Chair of the Select Committee when I went before it last week in what was also an interesting session.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.1/2">I have just been informed, a few moments ago, that there will be another Adjournment debate on this issue&#8212;on a slightly different subject very close to this one&#8212;for an hour and a half next Tuesday morning. It is key to this issue that we make sure that things are done correctly and I am willing to take into consideration all the submissions, but keeping the status quo is not an option. Nearly every detailed submission has accepted that and it was accepted by the previous Administration before I became the responsible Minister. I have been very impressed by the time and effort that many of the stations have taken not just to say, &#8220;Look after me, guv,&#8221; or &#8220;Protect me,&#8221; but to suggest what the service needs to look at and look like in the 21st century, and I pay tribute to everyone who has submitted evidence to the consultation. It will reopen just to allow the Select Committee report to be considered, and the Government will make an oral statement to the House before the summer recess on the future of the MCA.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.1/3" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.1/4" class="italic">House adjourned.</p>
