	<p pid="c.135.5/1">We are committed to increasing the use of restorative justice throughout the criminal justice system. Restorative justice should play a part in activities ranging from informal disposals administered by front-line police officers to enabling serious offenders to face up to the consequences of their actions. There is growing evidence of its potential to cut reoffending and crime, and to enhance the role of victims in the delivery of justice.</p>

	<p pid="c.135.6/1">Charnwood council&#8217;s reducing reoffending scrutiny panel has been considering how to promote restorative justice locally. One of the problems that it has identified is that offenders are often released on Fridays or at weekends with no practical support. Before it can get around to worrying about restorative justice, we need to know what the Ministry can do to ensure that offenders are given the practical support that they need when they join the community.</p>

	<p pid="c.135.7/1">My hon. Friend has raised a valid operational concern about Friday releases. However, holding prisoners whose statutory release date falls at a weekend until the following week is unlawful, and we do not think it right for prisoners to be let out early: they should serve the custodial period required by law. Our duty is to manage the operational issue of Friday releases. That includes ensuring that all prisoners are properly prepared for release, and implementing restorative justice as part of that preparation where appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="c.135.8/1">My constituent Gary Thrall was left for dead after a vicious knife attack last year. His first contact from Victim Support came five weeks later, when it was suggested that he might like to meet some knife attackers. Does the Minister agree that that is a gross misuse of restorative justice, and what can he do to ensure that the same thing does not happen to other people?</p>

	<p pid="c.135.9/1">I read about that case in the papers. It is plainly important for restorative justice to carry the confidence of victims. They should not be placed in a position in which they are required to take part in restorative justice disposals; restorative justice should be a right for them to exercise when they see fit, and when it is clearly in their interests to do so.</p>

	<p pid="c.136.0/1">Is the Minister aware that many victims greatly value the restorative justice process, because it brings the person who has caused them harm face to face with the harm that he has caused? Does the Minister recognise the need for it to be mainstreamed into the system rather more than it is at present? There are many areas in which it is currently not available to benches and courts.</p>

	<p pid="c.136.1/1">I entirely agree with my right hon. Friend. It is important to bear in mind that restorative justice is a right for victims. I believe that if, in the circumstances described by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40048" name="Gloria De Piero">the hon. Member for Ashfield (Gloria De Piero)</phrase>, a victim wished to exercise the right to engage in restorative justice and to demand an account from an offender who was pleading guilty or had been found guilty, he or she should have the opportunity to do so. The victim impact statement, as part of the restorative justice process for the benefit of the victim, must become a much clearer element of our justice system.</p>

	<p pid="c.136.2/1">I agree with the Minister that restorative justice can be a positive intervention, and I was pleased to be able to attend a restorative justice session in Wormwood Scrubs organised by volunteers from the Prison Fellowship on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-28">28 March</phrase>. Unfortunately, however, it was the last such session to take place in a prison in the London region. Can the Minister explain why that is, given that it is agreed that restorative justice can be an effective intervention? Is this yet another example of the gap between rhetoric and reality?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-17c.136.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40496" speakername="Crispin Blunt" colnum="136"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110517/debtext/110517-0001.htm">
	<p pid="c.136.3/1">No, it is not. The hon. lady is referring to a decision by the management of London prisons, which are principally local prisons, to focus on short-term offenders who are incarcerated in London as well as in local prisons supporting the courts. We are going to change the system so that restorative justice is embedded in the criminal justice process from beginning to end. The hon. Lady supported her party for a very long time in trying to get that done. I assure her that we shall absolutely deliver it.</p>

	<p pid="c.136.6/1">The Ministry of Justice currently holds some limited data on the numbers of injunctions applied for in the county courts, but they do not allow identification of anonymity injunctions. The Department&#8217;s chief statistician is currently considering how robust data on the number of anonymity injunctions issued by the courts might be collated in the future.</p>

	<p pid="c.136.7/1">Is my right hon. and learned Friend concerned about the possibility that the large number of injunctions that appear to be being granted on a routine basis suggests that the courts are paying insufficient regard to section 12 of the Human Rights Act 1998, which was intended to protect press freedom? Given that, and given the huge speculation on the internet</p>
	<p pid="c.136.7/2">about the identities of those who have obtained injunctions, does he feel that the time is approaching when Parliament may need to revisit the issue?</p>

	<p pid="c.137.0/1">I do not think any of us know whether the number is increasing. As far as I am aware, there have been two super-injunctions since the John Terry case, but the word &#8220;super-injunction&#8221; gets used very widely. I realise there is increasing concern, however. I personally have strong views on the secrecy of justice. We have a tradition of open justice in this country. Plainly, I believe in the freedom of the press and freedom of speech in this country, even when it is sometimes exercised provocatively, as it is supposed to be in a free country, but there are also areas where an individual is entitled to have their privacy protected. The time is certainly coming when the Government are going to have to look at this matter, although we will probably wait until we have had the report of the Master of the Rolls, who is looking rather more closely at the procedural aspects.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-17c.137.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40610" speakername="Sadiq Khan" colnum="137"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110517/debtext/110517-0001.htm#11051737000425">
	<p pid="c.137.1/1">The Lord Chancellor is right to remind us that it is important that we get the balance right between freedom of speech and an individual&#8217;s right to privacy, but he will be aware of the public disquiet about the use of the anonymity injunction or super-injunction, both in terms of its abuse&#8212;or alleged abuse&#8212;and its circumvention, for example by the use of Twitter. As he has said, the current situation is not satisfactory, but the Master of the Rolls is simply looking at the process, rather than the substance. What does the Lord Chancellor intend to do about that, so as to provide leadership on this issue?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-17c.137.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40513" speakername="Kenneth Clarke" colnum="137"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110517/debtext/110517-0001.htm#11051737000426">
	<p pid="c.137.2/1">First, I agree that the Master of the Rolls is looking at process, and I am sure what he says will be very valuable. As I have said, we will wait until he reports back before starting to take a proper look at the issue, but I think the Government will now have to study it and decide whether there is a case for intervening. There will never be unanimity on all these judgments, precisely because it is so difficult to balance the competing parts of the convention on human rights and the competing interests involved. There have been cases where we have certainly needed to know&#8212;such as where people are disposing of waste material by dumping it off the coast of Africa. That is easy in one direction, but in the other, every time I watch a football team I do not think I necessarily need to know about the sex life of each of the players.</p>

	<p pid="c.137.3/1">As is often the case, I find myself agreeing to a large extent with what the Lord Chancellor says, but let me say this. Super-injunctions are not granted by European judges using European law; they are granted by British judges using British law, and Parliament has supremacy over that law and those judges. If clarity and guidance is required and suitable, and bearing in mind the fact that we have the draft Defamation Bill and the forthcoming justice Bill, why does he not just say that he will use those vehicles to provide clarity and guidance?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-17c.137.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40513" speakername="Kenneth Clarke" colnum="137"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110517/debtext/110517-0001.htm#11051737000428">
	<p pid="c.137.4/1">We will consider these matters, and it is probably right that Parliament passing a privacy Act might well be the best way of resolving the issue, but we need to get somewhat nearer a consensus and to know</p>
	<p pid="c.137.4/2">exactly how we are trying to strike the balance before something is submitted for the judgment of Parliament. We may well not have to wait until the end of a long, controversial process such as that, and instead find some other way of tackling the issue, but we are considering it and we will come back with proposals in due course. If there were debate on a privacy Bill, there would be an interesting range of opinions even in Parliament, but I have not met many people yet who seem to have the perfect answer as to how to get the balance right.</p>

	<p pid="c.138.0/1">Some of these injunctions serve to prevent information from being passed to the police or other regulators. Does the Secretary of State believe the law should be changed so that regulators can always have information passed to them?</p>

	<p pid="c.138.1/1">That is one of the arguments which the judge who decides whether to grant the injunction will no doubt have in mind. Whether it is reasonable and in the public interest for the injunction to be granted is what the judge is meant to try to establish. The question for us is how we can make that clearer and more defensible, and how we can know more about what is happening so that we are all satisfied that injunctions are granted only in cases where the right to privacy of the individual is, indeed, being interfered with unjustly, but I know of the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s interest in this topic, and we will bear his views in mind&#8212;</p>

In supporting reforms that cut the backlog of cases and reduce the delays that many people experience in the Strasbourg Court, does he agree with Amnesty International and 270 other non-governmental organisations which have founded a petition to campaign against the introduction of fees in the European Court of Human Rights, as they believe those could, in some cases, represent an insurmountable barrier to justice?</p>

	<p pid="c.138.7/1">I certainly think that one of the things that needs to be tackled and can be tackled without too much difficulty is the thousands upon thousands of cases awaiting a hearing at the Court, many of which are completely outside the sphere of the convention and could be disposed of reasonably straightforwardly. The question of fees will have to be decided in due course by</p>

	<p pid="c.139.0/1">There would be very little problem with the jurisdiction of the Strasbourg Court if we repealed the Human Rights Act 1998, withdrew from the convention and replaced it with a British Bill of Rights. Does the Secretary of State agree that it is about time that that happened?</p>

	<p pid="c.139.1/1">If we repealed the Human Rights Act, which is one of the matters being looked at, we would just go back to having the convention applied directly by Strasbourg. The issue attracts a wide range of views, which is why we have set up a commission to consider them<i>&#8212;[Interruption.]</i> We have indeed set up the commission. It is composed of serious people who have expressed a very wide range of views in the past on the subject. They will strive to reach a consensus and it will be useful to get a properly informed and expert assessment of what the various options might result in. I am sure that the package of measures recommended by my hon. and learned Friend is one of the matters they will be considering in the course of their discussions.</p>

We will not take away from the judiciary and magistracy the ability to use short sentences when required, but we need to ensure that community sentences that are properly robust and properly punitive can carry public confidence as an appropriate option, particularly for women offenders who frequently have wider responsibilities in the community that would be lost if they were incarcerated.</p>

Prison Industries will have to be addressed and we will probably have to put it on a different and more commercial footing. We are looking for work that can properly be done in prison without jeopardising legitimate small businesses outside. A moment ago I was accused of rushing everything. The great thing about such reforms, which will transform the prison system, is that there is no point in delivering straight away experiments that have not been thought through.

	<p pid="c.146.2/1">I am very grateful for the hon. Lady&#8217;s invitation. I have visited all the prisons in Wales, but I have rather more of the estate to get around before I have seen them all. I am anxious to hear about the kind of scheme she describes. I see examples of good practice all over the country of people working very hard in both the prison and probation services to engage other organisations, as she has described, and help the rehabilitation of offenders.</p>

	<p pid="c.146.6/1">Between 2005-06 and 2009-10, there was a 24% rise in the number of drug offences committed in Warwickshire. There is clearly a need for improved levels of rehabilitation for those who have suffered from drug addiction. The charitable, voluntary and social enterprise sectors are often best placed to provide this support. Will the Minister therefore tell the House what work he is doing to engage with those sectors to deliver better support and improve rehabilitation while at the same time reducing drug-related crime?</p>

	<p pid="c.146.7/1">My hon. Friend has pointed clearly to a consequence of the failure to rehabilitate offenders effectively, which should have happened under the previous Administration.

	<p pid="c.147.0/1">Has the Minister seen the headline in a national newspaper today stating that drug addicts are pocketing benefits amounting to more than &#163;1 billion every year?

	<p pid="c.147.1/1">That is an extremely important part of effecting the rehabilitation of offenders. The number of offenders whose offences are drug-related is very substantial, so in conjunction with the Department of Health we are examining and introducing pilots on the whole treatment of drug addiction in the community. Many offenders will enter those pilots and then, I hope, the scheme when we roll it out system-wide by the end of the Parliament. We are also examining with the Department of Health how we treat people in prison in order to ensure that we are much more focused on abstinence as well. I fear I may exhaust the patience of Mr Speaker if I go on.</p>

Victim Support is also able to bid for additional money for local projects from the &#163;18.5 million victims general fund, for which we invited bids this year. Overall, the Ministry of Justice is committing more money to the victims voluntary sector this year than last year, which of course, in the dreadful financial circumstances that we inherited from the previous Administration, shows our priorities.</p>

We need to listen more to the victims of crime and put them at the heart of our judicial system, so can we have an assurance that the Secretary of State will reinstate survey questions or, indeed, improve on them, and not push under the carpet the experiences of victims and witnesses of how the British legal system operates?</p>

It makes an enormous difference to costs, police time and the involvement of unnecessary preparations for trial if everybody leaves guilty pleas to the last possible moment. As my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary rightly said, victims and witnesses are put through an ordeal if they are preparing for a trial where they expect to be accused of lying because the man has not been induced to plead at an early enough stage.

	<p pid="c.150.2/1">I absolutely agree with my hon. Friend. The evidence from Northern Ireland, where a statutory form of restorative justice has been working positively in the youth sector, shows 85% levels of victim satisfaction. The data are getting better regarding the effect of restorative justice on the rehabilitation of offenders, and appear to show at least a 14% improvement if we use it. That is a pretty convincing case for the proper use of restorative justice, quite apart from the financial benefits that my hon. Friend mentioned.</p>

	<p pid="c.155.1/2">At the last general election, each major party committed to a democratically elected second Chamber. The coalition agreement set out very clearly the Government&#8217;s intention to deliver that, but the roots of these changes can be traced back much further. A century ago, the Government, led by Herbert Asquith, promised to create</p>

	<p pid="c.155.1/4">There has been progress in the intervening years&#8212;the majority of hereditary peers have gone, and the other place is now predominantly made up of life peers. We should see ourselves as completing that work.</p>
	<p pid="c.155.1/5">People have a right to choose their representatives. That is the most basic feature of a modem democracy. Our second Chamber, which is known for its wisdom and expertise, is none the less undermined by the fact it is not directly accountable to the British people.

	<p pid="c.155.1/8">I chair that cross-party Committee, which reached agreement on many of the most important issues&#8212;not on all of them, but good progress was made&#8212;and those deliberations have greatly shaped the proposals that are being published today. I should like to pay tribute to all members of the Committee, particularly Opposition Members, who engaged with us in an open and collaborative fashion. Let me also thank those individuals whose past work on Lords reform has laid the foundations for what we are doing today, particularly <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40090" name="Jack Straw">the right hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr Straw)</phrase> and the right hon. and noble Lord Wakeham. Rather than start anew, the Government have benefited from their previous endeavours. Today&#8217;s proposals represent a genuine, collective effort over time.</p>
	<p pid="c.155.1/9">The draft Bill and White Paper will now be scrutinised by a Joint Committee composed of 13 peers and 13 Members of this House. The Committee will report early next year, and a Government Bill will then be introduced.</p>
	<p pid="c.155.1/10">The Prime Minister and I are clear that we want the first elections to the reformed upper Chamber to take place in 2015. However, although we know what we want to achieve, we are open minded about how we get there. Clearly, our fixed goal is greater democratic legitimacy for the other place, but we will be pragmatic in order to achieve that. We therefore propose an upper House made up of 300 members, each eligible for a single term of three Parliaments. Three hundred is the number that we judge to be right, but this is an art and not a science. In the vast majority of bicameral systems, the second Chamber is significantly smaller. That arrangement helps to maintain a clear distinction between the two Houses. We are confident that 300 full-time Members can cover the work comfortably. We are, however, open to alternative views on that.</p>
	<p pid="c.155.1/11">The coalition agreement committed the Government to produce proposals for</p>
	<p pid="c.155.1/12">&#8220;a wholly or mainly elected chamber.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.155.1/13">That debate is reflected in what we are publishing today. The Bill makes provision for 80% of Members to be elected, with the remaining 20% to be appointed independently. The 60 appointed Members would sit as Cross Benchers, not as representatives of political parties, and in addition bishops of the Church of England would continue to sit in the other place, but would be reduced in number from 26 to 12. The White Paper includes the case for a 100% elected House of Lords. The 80:20 split is the more complicated option, and so has been put into the draft Bill in order to illustrate it in legislative terms. The 100% option would be easy to substitute into the draft Bill should that be where we end up.</p>
	<p pid="c.155.1/14">There are people on both sides of the House who support a fully elected Chamber, believing that an elected House of Lords should be just that. Others, again on both sides, take a different view, and support having a non-elected component in order to retain an element of non-party expertise, as well as to keep greater distinction between the two Houses. Personally, I have always supported a 100% elected House of Lords, but the key thing is not to make the best the enemy of the good. That approach has stymied Lords reform for far too long. After all, 80% is a whole lot better than 0%.</p>
	<p pid="c.155.1/15">Elections to the new reformed House will be staggered: at each general election a third of Members will be elected, or a combination of elected and appointed. That is to prevent the other place from becoming a mirror image of this House. In the Bill we set out how those elections could be conducted using the single transferable vote. The coalition agreement specifies only that the system must be proportional, and what is most important is that it is different from whatever we use in the Commons. That is to ensure that the two Chambers have distinct mandates; one should not seek to emulate the other.</p>
	<p pid="c.155.1/16">STV allows for that, and would also give the upper Chamber greater independence from party control. Votes are cast for individuals rather than parties, putting the emphasis on the expertise and experience that candidates offer, rather than the colour of the rosette they wear. We want to preserve the independence of spirit that has long differentiated that House from this one. I know that some Members prefer a party list system, including Opposition members of the cross-party Committee I chaired. We are willing to have this debate, and have not ruled out a list-based system in the White Paper.</p>
	<p pid="c.155.1/17">The Commons will retain ultimate say over legislation through the Parliament Acts, and will continue to have a decisive right over the vote of supply. In order for a Government to remain in office they will still need to secure the confidence of MPs. The other place will continue to be a revising Chamber, providing scrutiny and expertise. Its size, electoral cycle, voting system, and terms will all help to keep it distinct from the Commons and a place that remains one step removed from the day-to-day party politics that, quite rightly, animate this House. What will be different is that our second Chamber will finally have a democratic mandate, and will be much more accountable as a result.</p>
	<p pid="c.155.1/18">Clearly, the transition must be carefully managed. We propose to phase in the reform over three electoral cycles. In 2015 a third of Members will be elected, or a combination of elected and appointed. The number of sitting peers will be reduced by a third, although we are not prescribing the process for that; it will be up to the parties in the other place to decide. In 2020, a further third will come in under the new system, and then again in 2025. There are other ways of staging the transition, however, and the White Paper sets out two of them.</p>
	<p pid="c.155.1/19">To conclude, history teaches us that completing the unfinished business of Lords reform is not without challenges. Our proposals are careful and balanced. They represent evolution, not revolution, and are a typically British change. I hope that Members from both sides of the House and the other place will help us to get the proposals right. The Government are ready to listen and are prepared to adapt, but we are determined, in the end, to act. I commend this statement to the House.</p>

	<p pid="c.157.0/1">I thank the Deputy Prime Minister for advance sight of the statement, and for how he chaired the working group&#8212;squaring the views of Lord Strathclyde with those of the rest of us was nothing short of a master class in conflict resolution. I am also pleased to see the Prime Minister here supporting the Deputy Prime Minister. The latter must feel like the manager of West Ham seeing his chairman after the final whistle on Saturday. I hope he has a better outcome than the chairman&#8212;I mean the manager&#8212;of West Ham had on Saturday.</p>
	<p pid="c.157.0/2">I agree that our politics and constitution are in need of reform. Like the Deputy Prime Minister&#8217;s party, Labour had a manifesto commitment to create a fully elected second Chamber. Let us be frank: Lords reform is not near the top of any of our constituents&#8217; priorities. They are more interested&#8212;[Hon. Members: &#8220;Hear, hear.&#8221;] I am grateful for that support; I am not sure whether the Deputy Prime Minister is. Our constituents are more interested in their schools and hospitals, and whether they will have a job at the end of the year. This is about how we write the laws that affect us, including laws on schools and hospitals, and who writes those laws, so if we are doing it, we have to get it right.</p>
	<p pid="c.157.0/3">The present situation is unsustainable. The Lords has more than 800 Members, and the Prime Minister intends to pack in another 200, at great expense to the taxpayer&#8212;117 have already been added since May 2010&#8212;while at the same time cutting the number of elected Members in this House. More unelected, fewer elected&#8212;and he calls it progress. I fear that the Deputy Prime Minister will soon realise that the Tories are the real obstacle to reform, just as they were when we were in power.</p>
	<p pid="c.157.0/4">It is important that we get the details right. The Deputy Prime Minister says that he supports a fully elected second Chamber, yet he is unveiling a Bill today that leaves at least 20% appointed, plus bishops, plus Ministers appointed by the Prime Minister. The Joint Committee will have a built-in Government majority, so the idea of it overturning anything of substance in the Bill by next year is unrealistic. These proposals risk being a dog&#8217;s dinner, with nobody happy at the outcome&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="c.157.0/5">not even the Lib Dem activists, whom the Deputy Prime Minister is trying to appease. After 12 months in office, he has nothing new to say on Lords reform, but is simply putting out proposals that kick the issue into the long grass.</p>
	<p pid="c.157.0/6">Before the Deputy Prime Minister delegates responsibility for the Bill to the Parliamentary Secretary, Cabinet Office, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40263" name="Mark Harper">the hon. Member for Forest of Dean (Mr Harper)</phrase>, who is the Minister responsible for political and constitutional reform, and to Lord Strathclyde, can he answer these 11 questions on the proposals?</p>
	<p pid="c.157.0/7">Bearing in mind that the country comprehensively rejected the AV system two weeks ago, is the Deputy Prime Minister seriously suggesting that he should impose a system of proportional representation for the second Chamber without consulting the electorate? What powers does he want a reformed House of Lords to have? How will he deal with the conventions that currently govern the relationship between the two Chambers? Does he believe that the relationship should be codified? What role does he envisage for the bishops in the second Chamber, and why 12? Can he set out the cost of a reformed second Chamber? If it is possible that no peers would be forced to leave until 2025, what does he predict the maximum size and cost of the second Chamber will be in the interim? Will he confirm that he wants reform on the statute book by the next election? Will he confirm whether he intends to use the Parliament Acts to force the proposals through? Will he also confirm whether coalition MPs and peers will be whipped to vote for the Bill when it comes out of the Joint Committee? Finally, will he allow a debate on his Bill in Government time before the summer recess?</p>
	<p pid="c.157.0/8">The Deputy Prime Minister has confirmed by the publication of this Bill just how irrelevant he and his party are in the coalition Government. I am afraid that the Bill, the White Paper and the whole process are a huge anticlimax.</p>

	<p pid="c.158.0/1">Not only did the right hon. Gentleman fluff the lines at the beginning, he also failed to rise to the occasion. This is an occasion when, for once, he could put aside his sour observations and try to work across parties, as we have in the cross-party Committee, to make some progress not only, I should remind Opposition Members, on something that was in their manifesto&#8212;by the way, so was AV, but a fat lot of good that did us all&#8212;but on something that we have been discussing as a country for almost 100 years. If that is not long enough, I do not know what is.</p>
	<p pid="c.158.0/2">Before I turn to some of the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s questions, let me address the vital issue, which he has raised once again, about a wholly or mainly elected second Chamber. It would be so much easier to take the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s admonitions in favour of 100% seriously if, during the 13 years under Labour, more had been delivered than 0%. Given that the country has been debating House of Lords reform for more than a century and that all three parties made a manifesto commitment on this issue last year, it is crucial not to make the best the enemy of the good. We have set out in the Bill how an 80:20 split would work, and we have maintained the option in the White Paper of moving to 100% if that is what people want. That is exactly what we will submit to the Joint Committee.</p>
	<p pid="c.158.0/3">Turning to the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s questions, the cost is almost impossible to estimate at this stage, without knowing precisely what the final composition of the House of Lords will be or the method of transition from where we are now to where we want to be in 2025. In the Bill, we have proposed a staged election&#8212;or election and appointment&#8212;by thirds in 2015, 2020 and 2025, alongside a staged reduction, commensurate with that, from the House of Lords as it is at the moment.</p>

	<p pid="c.159.1/1">We will leave it to the House of Lords itself to decide the precise method of reduction by thirds. We have set out two options in the White Paper. One would involve moving to the full reduction of the size of the House of Lords to 300 immediately in 2015; the other would be to do nothing until 2025, which would mean that the reformed House of Lords would have become very large indeed in 15 years&#8217; time. We would then make the reduction at that point. Those are exactly the kinds of issues that we will invite the Joint Committee to look at.</p>
	<p pid="c.159.1/2">I can confirm our determination to see the reform of the House of Lords reach the statute book in time for the elections in 2015. We want to see the first elections to a reformed House of Lords take place in 2015. We will treat this legislation as we treat all Government legislation. This is something to which both our manifestos&#8212;in fact, all the manifestos&#8212;are committed, and it is clearly set out in the coalition agreement. We will use all the legislative tools at our disposal to deliver on that commitment.</p>

	<p pid="c.159.5/1">We discussed this in the cross-party Committee. It is precisely to avoid competition between the two Houses that the Bill and the White Paper propose different systems of election, different geographical constituencies&#8212;the Lords would not represent constituencies in the way that we understand in this House&#8212;and non-renewable 15-year terms. Bicameral systems in other countries show that, as long as the mandate and the term in one House are very different from those in the other, an asymmetrical relationship can be preserved.</p>

	<p pid="c.160.0/1">I remind the right hon. Gentleman that the insight that it is best to have long non-renewable terms in the other place in a reformed House of Lords precisely to avoid such conflict with the other place was not established by the present Government or the cross-party Committee I chaired; rather, it is an idea that has enjoyed consensus from the days of the Wakeham commission onwards. If we look at the proposals from a cross-party group of MPs, which were given considerable support by the previous Labour Government in 2005&#8212;the &#8220;Breaking the Deadlock&#8221; proposals&#8212;we find that a preference was made not only for non-renewable terms of between 12 and 14 years, but for the single transferable vote. These are not new proposals: they are drawn from a lot of insights identified by others from all parties in the past.</p>

	<p pid="c.160.1/1">Given that this issue has been on the agenda of Parliament for so long and that reforming the second Chamber is now the settled will of the leadership of all three parties, is not the test of this Bill whether the leadership of those parties makes sure that the democratically elected Members of Parliament prevail in a reform that is long overdue and that the proposals are not derailed by people who are not elected, but are either hereditary or appointed&#8212;a completely unacceptable branch of a modern democratic legislature?</p>

	<p pid="c.160.2/1">I strongly agree with my right hon. Friend in the basic principle that people should be able to hold to account those who make the laws of the land by which the people of this country have to abide. That is a simple democratic principle: it is not new; it is shared by Members of all parties; it is widely recognised as a simple democratic principle across the democratic world. It is interesting to note that there are still people even in this democratically elected Chamber who seem to resist that very principle.</p>

Surely if it is to be elected, any self-respecting elected Members of the upper House will not feel themselves bound by the customs and practice that have applied to an unelected Chamber&#8212;and we will thus get conflict between this Chamber and the upper Chamber.</p>

This is an issue that we have been debating as a country for over a century. A very simple principle is at stake: do we believe, yes or no, that it is a good thing in a democracy for people to be able to hold those who make the laws of the land directly to account? According to our manifestos, all of us believe that that is the right principle; it is therefore right for this Government to try, on a consensual, open and pragmatic basis, to reach agreement so that we can finally put that principle into practice.</p>

	<p pid="c.161.3/1">Of course I accept that many issues that we discuss in the Chamber, and many issues with which any Government must deal, may not resonate on the doorsteps, but they may none the less be significant and important to our national life. I think we all agree that it is important for world trade rules to work properly, but that is not an issue that is raised with me on the doorstep very often. It is important for us to get local government finance right, and that too is not raised on the doorstep very often, but it is none the less significant and important. The fact that an issue is not raised with us by our constituents does not mean that it is not worthy of debate. If that is not the case, I cannot imagine why Government after Government have debated this very issue for nearly a century</p>

We will have constituencies&#8212;certainly, after the boundaries are changed&#8212;where each of us represents just over 70,000-odd; they will seek to represent half a million-odd.

He shakes his head, but let me read out to him this commitment from the Labour manifesto:</p>

	<p pid="c.174.0/1">I can certainly give the hon. Gentleman that assurance. I have sought to explain that we are determined to act to ensure that the first elections to a reformed House of Lords take place in 2015, but not for want of trying to create genuine cross-party consensus on the way to proceed. That is why we held the meetings of the cross-party committee and why we are putting the Bill and the White Paper out to the wider scrutiny of a Joint Committee.

	<p pid="c.174.2/2">are proposing. However, I acknowledge that the debate should now continue by way of the Joint Committee.</p>

	<p pid="c.175.0/1">Given that recent events demonstrate that the British people want to retain first past the post, why is the Deputy Prime Minister insistent that the second Chamber will not be elected under that system? Could it be because it is in his party&#8217;s interests?</p>

	<p pid="c.175.1/1">No. It really is worth looking at the history of the cross-party commissions and Committees that have considered this matter in the past, which by the way have been chaired by politicians from all the major parties. Almost all of them came to the conclusion that if we want to retain the precious difference between one House and the other, it should be reflected in a different electoral system.</p>

	Fourth Carbon Budget
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-17c.176.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40236" speakername="Christopher Huhne" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change"  colnum="176"  time="016:41:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110517/debtext/110517-0002.htm#11051737000664">
	<p pid="c.176.1/1">Today I am announcing that the Government propose to set an ambitious target in law to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in line with the advice from the independent Committee on Climate Change.</p>
	<p pid="c.176.1/2">Signing up to an ambitious fourth carbon budget will result in no additional costs to consumers during this Parliament. We will, however, undertake a review of progress in early 2014 to ensure that our carbon targets are in line with those of the European Union. We are working up a package of measures, to be announced by the end of the year, to help energy-intensive industries adjust to the low-carbon industrial transformation while remaining competitive.</p>
	<p pid="c.176.1/3">By agreeing to the level proposed by the Committee on Climate Change, we are demonstrating our desire to drive the changes needed to turn the UK into a dynamic, low-carbon economy that is attractive to investors in the new and growing low-carbon sectors. We are also sending a clear signal to the international community that the UK is committed to the low-carbon economy. That will help us to reach agreement in Europe on moving to a 30% emissions reduction target and build momentum towards a legally binding global climate change deal.</p>
	<p pid="c.176.1/4">The Climate Change Act 2008 sets a target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the UK by at least 80% from 1990 levels by 2050. It also requires Governments to set carbon budgets, which are limits on greenhouse gas emissions in the UK for consecutive five-year periods. Carbon budgets must be set at least three budget periods in advance. They are designed to put emission reductions on an appropriate and cost-effective pathway to our 2050 target. The first three carbon budgets were set in 2009, following advice from the independent Committee on Climate Change. The fourth carbon budget, which sets the limit on emissions for the five-year period from 2023 to 2027, has to be set in law by the end of June 2011.</p>
	<p pid="c.176.1/5">As advised by the Committee on Climate Change, the level that we propose setting in law would mean that net emissions over the fourth carbon budget period should not exceed 1,950 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, which is a 50% reduction from 1990 levels. As required by the 2008 Act, once the fourth carbon budget has been set in law, we will publish a report setting out the policies and proposals required in the medium and long term to meet the budget, building on the strong foundation provided by our existing policies. That will take the form of the revised Government carbon plan later this year, following the publication of the interim version in March.</p>
	<p pid="c.176.1/6">The Committee on Climate Change advised that we should aim to meet the budget through emissions reductions in the UK, rather than by relying on carbon trading, such as under the EU emissions trading system or the purchase of international credits from projects abroad. We will aim to reduce emissions domestically as far as is practical and affordable, but we also intend to keep our carbon trading options open, to maintain maximum flexibility and minimise costs in the medium to long term. Given the uncertainty involved in looking so far ahead, that is a pragmatic approach.</p>
	<p pid="c.176.1/7">Under the Climate Change Act, emissions reductions by the UK&#8217;s industrial and power sectors are determined by the UK&#8217;s share of the EU emissions trading scheme cap. That protects the UK industrial and power sectors from exceeding EU requirements. However, if the EU ETS cap is insufficiently ambitious, disproportionate strain could be placed on sectors outside the EU ETS, such as transport. To overcome that problem, and to provide clearer signals for businesses and investors, the Government will review progress towards the EU emissions goal in early 2014. If at that point our domestic commitments place us on a different trajectory from the one agreed by our partners in the EU under the ETS, we will revise up our budget as appropriate to align it with the actual EU trajectory. In line with the coalition agreement, the Government will continue to argue for an EU move to a 30% target for 2020, and for ambitious action in the 2020s.</p>
	<p pid="c.176.1/8">As part of the transition to a low-carbon economy, we need to ensure that energy-intensive industries remain competitive and that we send a clear message that the UK is open for business. Before the end of the year, we will announce a package of measures for the energy-intensive businesses whose international competitiveness is most affected by our energy and climate change policies. Rising electricity costs pose a risk to those businesses&#8217; sectors, which are critical to our growth agenda. We will therefore take steps to reduce the impact of Government policy on the cost of electricity for those businesses, allowing them to continue to play their part in delivering our green industrial transformation. In that way, we will ensure that those sectors remain internationally competitive and send a clear message that the UK is open for business.</p>
	<p pid="c.176.1/9">It is important to stress that the UK&#8217;s existing policies already put us on track to meet the first three carbon budgets. They also provide a strong foundation for the fourth carbon budget, implying no additional near-term costs. We are reforming the electricity market, making homes and businesses more energy-efficient through the green deal, ensuring that new homes are built to a high energy efficiency standard, encouraging the uptake of ultra-low carbon cars and setting up a green investment bank.</p>
	<p pid="c.176.1/10">Meeting the 1,950 million tonnes target that we propose for the 2023 to 2027 period is ambitious but achievable. By providing long-term clarity for investors, the fourth carbon budget places the UK at the leading edge of the global low-carbon industrial transformation. It will set Britain on the path to green growth, establish our competitive advantage in the most rapidly growing sectors of the world economy, generate jobs and export opportunities in those sectors, maintain energy security and protect our economy from oil price volatility. It is a framework not just for action on climate but for growth and prosperity.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-17c.177.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40290" speakername="Meg Hillier" colnum="177"  time="016:41:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110517/debtext/110517-0002.htm#11051737000665">
	<p pid="c.177.0/1">I thank the right hon. Gentleman for early sight of his statement this afternoon. May I make it very clear that we welcome the fact that the Government have finally made a decision on the fourth carbon budget? We know that it has been a rocky week for him, as his colleague the Business Secretary sought a very</p>
	<p pid="c.177.0/2">different decision on this issue. We also know the many battles that he has lost within Government on the green agenda, so I congratulate him on this progress. I welcome the fact that he has not, after all, ducked the chance to answer questions on this important matter and is here before the House today.</p>
	<p pid="c.177.0/3">I need to pick up on a point that the right hon. Gentleman made. He talked about our being on track to meet the first three carbon budgets, but I do not really think that is thanks to the current Government. We have seen a go-slow from him on green progress. Can he reassure us that he, the Treasury and the Business Secretary are united in delivering on these challenging targets? Can he be sure that he at least has the support of the Prime Minister?</p>
	<p pid="c.177.0/4">The importance of this decision cannot be overstated, and I shall not repeat what the Secretary of State clearly laid out on the rationale behind the Climate Change Act 2008, which was established under the previous Government. However, I am puzzled about the 2014 review that he announced, because it introduces new uncertainty for those investing in the country&#8217;s greener future and breaks with the five-year cycle. He has already failed to provide business certainty by delaying the green investment bank and pulling the rug from underneath the solar industry. It is therefore essential that the scope of that review is clarified so that it does not do the same.</p>
	<p pid="c.177.0/5">With those budgets now agreed, the Government must deliver on policies to meet them. As I have said, we have seen over the course of this year the Government failing to deliver on their green promises. The long-awaited green investment bank is unable to borrow till 2015&#8212;no rush there!&#8212;and it is the subject of yet more disagreements. Confidence in the renewables sector was shaken by a hasty and ill-conceived revision of the feed-in tariff, and of course, the commitment to zero-carbon homes was scrapped with no notice.</p>
	<p pid="c.177.0/6">The right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s confidence in his record belies the facts. He needs to focus on his Department and on the detail of this agenda, which is very important to the future not just of the UK, but of the world. For the UK to meet those targets, we need a clear plan from the Government. The right hon. Gentleman talked about a strong foundation, which we need, but he needs to get real and to deliver on that.</p>
	<p pid="c.177.0/7">We cannot meet our targets without a major reduction in domestic emissions. It is therefore critical that the Government make the improvements to the Energy Bill that the Opposition have demanded. Most importantly, they need to be clear on what carbon reductions the green deal will deliver, which, as we said last week, cannot be left to the market to decide.</p>
	<p pid="c.177.0/8">Policy needs to be joined-up if we are to have the green industrial revolution that this country needs. We are clear that there is cross-party agreement on the carbon-reduction trajectory, but I should like to ask a few detailed questions of the Secretary of State. What will be the purpose and scope of the 2014 review, which I have already highlighted? Is there a prospect that the Government will weaken the targets that he announced today, or is he suggesting that they can only be tightened? What are the Department of Energy and Climate Change and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills</p>
	<p pid="c.177.0/9">doing to support energy-intensive industries? When will he have more detail on that? He alluded to that, but we need more detail.</p>
	<p pid="c.177.0/10">Will the Government introduce clearer aims for the green deal, so that we can be clear on how it will contribute to the necessary emissions reductions? When will we see the national policy statements, including on nuclear? Will that happen before the summer? When will the revised carbon plan be published? Will the Secretary of State and his Department consult widely on that?</p>
	<p pid="c.177.0/11">After scrapping the grant funding for wave and tidal&#8212;we still await the renewables obligation certificates review&#8212;how will the UK gain a competitive edge in wave and tidal energy, in which we should be groundbreaking? Will the Secretary of State introduce an accelerated timetable for the trial and deployment of industrial-scale carbon capture and storage for coal and gas?</p>
	<p pid="c.177.0/12">Does the Secretary of State agree with the Committee on Climate Change that we need to be more explicit in our support for new nuclear and onshore wind? Finally, what plans do the Government have for introducing road pricing, as suggested by the Committee? Has he consulted the Transport Secretary? Is that a policy for the next Parliament, or is there an urgent need to legislate for vehicle use now?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-17c.179.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40236" speakername="Christopher Huhne" colnum="179"  time="016:41:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110517/debtext/110517-0002.htm#11051737000666">
	<p pid="c.179.0/1">Perhaps I would be forgiven for wondering whether the hon. Lady and I have been living in the same country for the past few years. Given the picture that she is painting of policies that have been put in place to deliver on carbon budgets, she should perhaps remember that our inheritance after 13 years of the previous Labour Government is that our renewable sector is 25th out of 27 EU member states. That is not a record of which the hon. Lady can be proud. As for efforts to be made, for example, on energy efficiency, it took this Government to introduce the Energy Bill, which legislates for the green deal, which is the most comprehensive attempt to deal with energy saving in future.</p>
	<p pid="c.179.0/2">Since the hon. Lady asked, I can assure her that the carbon budget has been approved unanimously by the Cabinet and has the support of the Business Secretary, the Chancellor and the Prime Minister. It is an important commitment by the Government, because it is the first commitment beyond the period for which the EU has legislated. Unlike the previous Labour Government&#8217;s three carbon budgets, this one goes beyond what the EU requires of us. We have set it according to our own domestic legislative framework and with our own domestic legislative agenda.</p>
	<p pid="c.179.0/3">The 2014 review will be simple and clear. On the traded sector, which is crucial to our international competitiveness, we will review what is happening in the rest of the EU, because it is appropriate that we move at the same pace as the sector there. The hon. Lady mentioned that the green investment bank can borrow in 2015, which is crucial because the second part of this decade will see the greatest need for borrowing powers to ensure the installation of renewable and other low-carbon energy. I am astonished by her description of what has happened so far under this Government. We have set aside more than &#163;800 million for a renewable heat incentive, and we are legislating for a carbon price floor.</p>
	<p pid="c.179.0/4">Despite the Opposition&#8217;s warm words, in 13 years of a Labour Government not a single piece of turf was turned in order to install a single new nuclear reactor, yet work has already begun at Hinkley Point. The sense of urgency in dealing with the climate change challenge displayed by this Government is of an entirely different order of magnitude. On clean coal and gas, about which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40098" name="Dennis Skinner">the hon. Member for Bolsover (Mr Skinner)</phrase> and some of his friends are particularly concerned, the Government, in an extremely tough and difficult expenditure round in which we have to clear up the mess inherited from the Labour party, found &#163;1 billion to set aside for the first commercial-scale carbon capture and storage project. In 13 years under Labour, no money was put aside and no planning was done for low-carbon growth.</p>
	<p pid="c.179.0/5">We will proceed with our national planning statements, and there will be an interim review by the nuclear regulator, Mike Weightman, which I anticipate coming shortly. The hon. Lady asked a detailed question about road pricing. We have made it clear already that there will be no plans for that in this Parliament. I repeat, however, that we are set on a road that will unlock enormous opportunities for British business, with a low-carbon economy and high growth.</p>

	<p pid="c.180.2/1">This is a most welcome decision by the Government. Does my right hon. Friend agree that there are considerable potential economic advantages for Britain in leading the world towards a lower carbon economy? Does he further agree that, although it is understandable that the Government should wish to retain the option of purchasing credits in order to achieve the target, the sooner that option is ruled out, the greater the incentive will be for British business to invest in low-carbon technology?</p>

	<p pid="c.180.3/1">I very much agree with the hon. Gentleman, the Chairman of the Energy and Climate Change Committee, who has made a powerful case in the past for a low-carbon economy. This is no longer a set of cottage industries. We are talking about a sector of the British economy that employs 910,000 people, which is growing extremely rapidly in a major world market, and which offers us enormous opportunities. I have no doubt that to those who move first and furthest will come the great advantages of the low-carbon economy. On the point about purchasing credits, having in a misspent youth practised economic forecasting and knowing about the difficulties of getting forecasts right one or two years in advance, I think it makes pragmatic sense to preserve a little flexibility when looking ahead as far as 2023-27.</p>

	<p pid="c.181.0/1">I am grateful to the right hon. Lady for her question. She has followed this area for many years and has enormous expertise in it. However, if she is going to claim the credit for meeting the current carbon budget on the back of the previous Government&#8217;s record, she should be aware that an important contributor to the 28% reduction in our carbon emissions since 1990 has been the depth of the recession. I am glad that she is at last owning up to the impact that those on the Opposition Benches had on our economy.

The energy-intensive work group that we have set up between my Department and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills will come forward with a set of measures by the end of the year. That is a clear commitment. As he knows, there are a number of ways to help energy-intensive industries, including the free allocation of units under the EU emissions trading scheme and encouraging a move towards the use of biomass and biofuels, for example. We are looking at all those measures to ensure that we can balance the concerns of the energy-intensive industries as well as make substantial progress towards the low-carbon economy.</p>

	<p pid="c.181.3/2">Many of the goods that we consume in Britain used to be manufactured in Britain. They are now manufactured in places such as China, thereby producing carbon emissions, and then imported into this country. Those carbon emissions in China and elsewhere occur only because of demand from western societies such as ours. Given that we are talking about a global phenomenon, does the Secretary of State have any ideas for how Europe as a whole can use its influence to bring about appropriate carbon reduction policies in places such as China, India and elsewhere?</p>

	<p pid="c.181.4/1">The right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s question is an interesting one, as I would expect, given his background as an Energy Minister and his expertise in this field. Wherever one goes in the world, people will say that everyone else is working much less hard on the low-carbon</p>

The five-year plan that the Chinese have just established is enormously ambitious. Six of the largest renewables companies in the world are now Chinese. The Chinese are making an enormous commitment to offshore wind, as well as in more conventional sectors such as nuclear. They are now the dominant player in solar photovoltaics, having taken the lead from Germany, so I simply do not accept that this is a world where we are moving ahead of other people. We are moving ahead together, but it will be the people who move furthest and fastest who get the best prizes.</p>

	<p pid="c.182.0/1">Will the Secretary of State confirm that, when he publishes the plan in the next couple of months, it will include an industrial plan that supports the green economy, not only in the energy sector but right across the manufacturing sector in areas such as white goods manufacturing and the production of electric cars? Will he also ensure that his Department and BIS provide the support to ensure that we have all the necessary skills and investment?</p>

	<p pid="c.182.1/1">My hon. Friend makes a good point, and I know that it is a heartfelt one because of her commitments to her constituency. I remember her being present when I opened the wind farm off Thanet. There will be enormous opportunities as a result of our proposals. We set aside &#163;60 million for port transformation in the comprehensive spending review, for example, and we now have some substantial commitments of interest, including from Mitsubishi in Scotland, from GE and from Siemens in Humberside. Vestas is also talking about an area close to my hon. Friend&#8217;s constituency in Kent. I believe that we will see an enormous amount of investment in those crucial industries. Our carbon plan will focus on meeting our carbon objectives, but the work that BIS, in particular, is doing to lead the charge for the carbon economy is very important, and I am backing it completely.</p>

I want to ask him about long-term clarity for investors. He mentioned that that was key, but he will appreciate that those wishing to invest in gas now risk seeing their investments stranded after 2025. It is extremely important, when addressing that question, that he review the proposals on electricity market reform to ensure that those investments can be maintained.</p>

	<p pid="c.183.1/1">We are determined that there should be enormous growth opportunities for low-carbon goods and services in the UK, and I would like to highlight two things that our Department can deliver. The first is the certainty required to enable investment in the replacement of ageing power plant that we will need over the next 10 years. Ofgem has estimated a figure of &#163;200 billion, which is roughly double the normal level of investment in the UK, so this will be important in powering the recovery over the next few years. The second is the provisions in the Energy Bill, the Second Reading of which took place last week. The green deal, which is set out in the Bill, will provide the opportunity for an enormous number of new jobs. We calculate that we will move up from the present figure of 27,000 jobs in the insulation sector to 100,000 by 2015 and that, at its peak, the policy will result in 250,000 jobs right across the industry, which will have to retrofit every home in the country. My hon. Friend is absolutely right to highlight the enormous job-creating potential for these industries, and we will keep that matter very much in the forefront of our minds.</p>

Does he accept, however, that according to the Climate Change Act 2008, a fourth carbon budget with a review in 2014 will not really be a fourth carbon budget in law? Can he confirm that a review in 2014 would not change the law as far as the fourth carbon budget was concerned? If that is the case, why should there be a review?</p>

	<p pid="c.183.3/1">The key point of having a review is to make sure that in the tradeable sector, where we have industries exposed to international competition&#8212;and we want them to thrive&#8212;industries are not exposed to unique costs that will not be imposed on the competition in the EU. That is what the review is designed to achieve.

	<p pid="c.184.0/1">I can assure my hon. Friend that we in the ministerial team are absolutely committed to low-cost, affordable electricity. The last assessment the Department made&#8212;at the time of the annual energy statement, and we will make another at the next such statement&#8212;is that the overall impact of our policies, including energy saving and the effects that my hon. Friend mentioned, will add 1% to the cost of household energy bills in 2020. As it happens, that was posited on a world oil price of $80 a barrel. As he knows, the oil price has moved substantially beyond that. With oil prices and associated gas prices higher than $100 a barrel, our estimate is that our policies will save money for the British household. I am not saying that British households will not face increases in the cost of gas and electricity in future; what I am saying is that the policy mix of energy saving and low-carbon electricity generation will give a better deal to British households than would reliance on imports of variable fossil fuels from volatile parts of the world.</p>

	<p pid="c.184.1/1">Does the Secretary of State accept that purchasing carbon offsets abroad as a means of meeting carbon emission reduction targets in the UK is deeply flawed on grounds of additionality, leakage and uncertain duration and that, in any case, they do not achieve the ostensible objective of decarbonising Britain? What precise proportion of the 29% cut in carbon emissions planned between now and 2027 do the Government intend or expect to be achieved via carbon offsets?</p>

We are, in fact, dealing with a period that is very far off&#8212;well beyond the normal range of economic forecasting&#8212;and it is sensible for us to exercise a measure of flexibility in the way in which we achieve our aim.

	<p pid="c.185.0/2">The hon.

	<p pid="c.186.5/1">We have not accepted a number of the other detailed recommendations in the committee&#8217;s report, but the trading one is an obvious example. It also asked us to set a target for 2030, and we do not see the need for that. I am not a great believer in intermediate targets when we have a very clear overall carbon budget, but given our commitment to a target figure of 1,950 million</p>
	<p pid="c.186.5/2">tonnes for the overall carbon budget for 2023 to 2027, nobody should be in any doubt about the thrust of our policy or our determination to meet our target. I have a very strong preference for achieving what we are actually trying to do, which is to cut carbon emissions, rather than for setting a whole group of intermediate targets, but that we will do.</p>

	<p pid="c.187.0/1">I warmly welcome the Government&#8217;s decision to accept the independent committee&#8217;s advice. Further to the question I asked my right hon. Friend on Second Reading of the Energy Bill, can he confirm that the Government report setting out the policies and proposals required to meet the budget will include an assessment of the contribution each will make so that the House can assess the value for money that they offer?</p>

	<p pid="c.187.1/1">I am concerned to ensure that all our policies offer real value for money. I believe the only way we will be able to hold public consensus behind what is a very ambitious programme of industrial change is if we show we are really ensuring that we get value for taxpayers in each policy we pursue. That is why we had to take the decision we took on solar feed-in tariffs. Although everything was unchanged below two tennis courts-worth, we have had to review the solar tariffs for the larger scale solar because we are determined to get good value for money. That is crucial. I also take on board the fact that the OECD&#8217;s latest country report urged us to look at the different implicit carbon prices in our policies across the board. I very much take that to heart and we will look at it. I can therefore assure my hon. Friend that we will address value for money, and that it is foremost among our considerations in delivering good policy.</p>

	<p pid="c.187.5/1">The most important way in which this Government can help local councils be innovative, creative and imaginative is to get away from telling them what to do from Westminster. We must remove ring-fencing and make sure local councils can take responsibility for their own decisions. As my hon. Friend knows, we have some robust debates about the priorities between different levels of government in Hampshire, and that is as it should be. Those priorities are determined by the councils&#8212;whether the county council at Winchester by the Conservatives, or the district council at Eastleigh by the Liberal Democrats. They make different decisions and it is proper that they should then be accountable to local people for those decisions.</p>

	<p pid="c.188.0/1">I, too, am pleased that we got a statement on this today, but I am anxious about the future and viability of energy-intensive industries, such as those in my constituency which have been the backbone of the north-east England economy. They have done much to reduce emissions already, but what will the Government do to help with transition funding, possibly through the growth fund or other mechanisms, to ensure that such industries can make further change and develop in the future?</p>

	<p pid="c.188.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is right to mention the growth fund, which is having a tremendous impact in bringing in a vast amount of private investment where it would not otherwise have been occurring; that is definitely a tremendous innovation. In addition, we are and will be developing the package for the energy-intensive industries, which I mentioned earlier. That is being done with our colleagues in the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, and it will be coming forward by the end of the year. We want balanced growth so that all parts of the economy can benefit from a robust economy.</p>

	<p pid="c.188.2/1">I, too, wish to add my thanks to the Government and welcome the steps being taken to move to a low-carbon economy. It is also encouraging to see the great work being done by community groups, particularly Macclesfield Transition Town and Food4Macc in my area, to support these ambitions. Can my right hon. Friend tell the House what steps he is taking to engage these community groups in helping to achieve these very important targets?</p>

	<p pid="c.188.3/1">We are keen to engage community groups; the ministerial team does a lot of visits and makes sure that we are talking to members of civil society and, of course, to non-governmental organisations, which have an important influence on community groups. This is also particularly crucial in an area that I know can be controversial, even among those on the Government Benches: proposals for onshore wind. I think that that is a beautiful form of renewable energy, although I know that that opinion is not always shared across the House. It is an important part of our strategy to get community groups involved and owning these policies, and some interesting proposals have been made. For example, the biggest proposal for onshore wind is the Viking proposal for Shetland and it is half-owned by the community group that supports Shetlanders. So I am very much in favour of the sort of engagement that my hon. Friend has rightly suggested.</p>

	<p pid="c.188.4/1">Given his comments today and previously, the Secretary of State is obviously keenly aware of the danger of carbon leakage, particularly if the Government proceed to reduce emissions through unilateral taxation on the energy-intensive industries. So what consideration has he given to an annual assessment of UK emissions on a consumption basis&#8212;an assessment taking into consideration imported goods&#8212;because that would act as a real incentive for us to reduce our emissions properly here in the UK?</p>

	<p pid="c.188.5/1">The hon. Lady raises an important issue that people periodically talk about, which is that no matter how well we do in the UK, we are not making a difference to the world as a whole if we are merely</p>
	<p pid="c.188.5/2">outsourcing production of carbon-intensive goods to economies such as China. However, I would make two points in response, the first of which is that we should not underestimate the progress being made in economies such as India and China to grapple with and move very fast on this agenda. The Department and the Government are working with the low-carbon pilot areas in China and the developments are truly impressive, so I urge her to look at them. We are aware of this issue, but I do not think that any time soon we will be able to move globally towards a situation where we are taking into account the embedded carbon emissions in trade. The reality is that most of the nearly 200 countries that are members of the United Nations are fiercely protective of their own territorial sovereignty, so it seems likely that our major efforts to tackle climate change will be based on states&#8217; control of their own territorial integrity.</p>

	<p pid="c.189.0/1">I congratulate the Secretary of State on accepting the ambitious fourth carbon budget recommended by the Committee on Climate Change. His statement highlights how vital it is to increase the EU carbon emission reduction target from 20% to 30% by 2020, so how will the Government redouble their efforts to secure that agreement and, in particular, to get a significant tightening of the EU emissions trading scheme cap?</p>

	<p pid="c.189.1/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that question. We have made substantial strides in the direction of securing an agreement and a number of countries in the EU are clearly signed up to the 30% ambition level for 2020. A number of other countries would like to go beyond 20%. The European Commission is the key player and one of the points that it is making&#8212;rightly I think&#8212;is that if we as a European Union were to deliver on just the energy efficiency commitments that we have already made, we could get to a 25% cut in carbon emissions by 2020 without any additional cost. There is a lot of progress to be made on this agenda and I and my ministerial colleagues are pressing that point at all the meetings we attend in Brussels and elsewhere. I believe that we are making good progress.</p>

Obviously, some effects on energy-intensive industry have nothing to do with policy and there are some macro-economic effects, such as the relative competitiveness gained through the improvement in the real exchange rate. We will take account of all those factors when we come to conclusions about the measures necessary to help energy-intensive industries.</p>

	<p pid="c.190.0/1">For every report that reaches the sort of conclusion that the hon. Gentleman is suggesting, I can point him to other reports that suggest exactly the opposite. The OECD, which is probably the most respected and authoritative of international economic organisations, has done some very good work on green growth. We have had a very important study from Potsdam in co-ordination with a number of leading economists from Oxford and elsewhere that suggests that there are positive growth effects through investment and learning by doing. Recently, I received a very important note from Professor Nick Stern&#8212;Lord Stern&#8212;arguing that the attempts to see his report as imposing costs on the economy were simply mistaken. He feels very strongly that the move to low-carbon goods and services involves enormous opportunities and that the increase in investment involved can help to power us out of an exceptionally deep recession. That is perhaps a long answer to show that when two economists are in a room, there are sometimes three opinions. None the less, the balance of argument is very much against the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s point.</p>

	<p pid="c.190.3/1">This issue should transcend party politics, but I regret to say that some of the Secretary of State&#8217;s actions do not live up to his rhetoric. This morning, I met representatives from East Midlands airport whose ambition is to make its ground operations carbon-neutral. The plan was to provide 36% of the airport&#8217;s energy requirements through a major photovoltaic scheme that has now been made unviable as a result of the wholesale butchery of feed-in tariffs. Will the Secretary of State tell the House whether he has abandoned photovoltaic cells as a way of generating energy and what advice can he give to East Midlands airport about its ambition to deliver a carbon-neutral target?</p>

	<p pid="c.190.4/1">The hon. Gentleman should perhaps be aware that the intention of the feed-in tariff scheme was to encourage microgeneration. Any proposal that involves less than two tennis courts-worth of solar photovoltaic cells will be completely unchanged by the review that we have announced, so he is clearly referring to a scheme that is very much bigger than that. All I would say is that we have to look at value for money. I am surprised that Opposition Members think that that is a revolutionary</p>
	<p pid="c.190.4/2">concept but it is important to consider value for money. If we had not announced the review, we would have found that a very large part of some of our finest shire counties would, instead of disappearing under oil seed rape or some more conventional crop, have been disappearing under solar photovoltaics. That was not, I am sure, the intention of the Opposition. It certainly is not our intention and that is why we have acted.</p>

I hope that we can bring that forward very rapidly and then the hon. Gentleman will be able to see for himself. He is right in one respect, on which I entirely agree with him: if there is to be, as the nuclear industry hopes, a nuclear renaissance, it is absolutely crucial that the nuclear industry shows that it can deliver on time and to budget. Investors will not come forward on a repeated basis if that is not the case.</p>
	<p pid="c.191.3/2">I can certainly confirm that we will not be providing public subsidy to nuclear and that we see nuclear as part of the energy mix for the future provided that safety concerns are met&#8212;we have the Mike Weightman review to be announced shortly&#8212;and provided that investors are prepared to come forward. At the moment, the indications are that investors are prepared to come forward provided that we put in place, as I believe the House has already done with the regulatory justification, the necessary steps to facilitate the normal big infrastructure spending that it involves.</p>

	<p pid="c.192.2/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="c.192.2/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to increase the maximum sentence for a conviction of dangerous driving from two years to seven years; and for connected purposes.</p>
	<p pid="c.192.2/3">Before my election to the House, I worked as a criminal barrister. One of the last cases that I was instructed in was defending a dangerous driver. I recall the grim expression on the face of the Crown Court judge when I got into the mitigation, not because I was wrong to ask for leniency, but because the law gave the judge insufficient discretion to mark the offence with an appropriate punishment. The driving was bad, but not the worst the judge had seen. Nevertheless, it was horrendous driving. I was keen to emphasise that it was not the worst of its kind. I finished my address by asking the judge to allow the defendant full credit for his guilty plea, and sat down knowing that I had done my best for my lay client.</p>
	<p pid="c.192.2/4">Coincidently, one of the first cases that I dealt with as a Member of the House concerned the victim of dangerous driving, Katie Harper. Her case motivated me to push for a change in the law. Dangerous driving requires the prosecution to show that the driving falls far below what would be expected of a competent and careful driver, and that it would be obvious to a competent and careful driver that driving in that way would be dangerous. There is no definition of &#8220;far below&#8221;, but the danger must be either that of injury to any person or serious damage to property. The offence is not made out where the driving is less than truly dangerous.</p>
	<p pid="c.192.2/5">The sentences handed down by judges leave victims feeling let down by the justice system when the offender is released from prison after just a few months, by which time the victims have not even started to come to terms with the damage that the offender has caused. Victims of dangerous driving are sometimes left brain damaged, paralysed or with amputations. The perpetrator will of course be punished, but the law does not currently allow the sentencing judge enough discretion to provide anything like the result that victims might expect. However, in the case of a serious assault, such as grievous bodily harm, the sentencing judge has at his disposal the discretion to mark the offence with a sentence that reflects the harm caused to the victim.</p>
	<p pid="c.192.2/6">My constituency case helped me understand the real effect on victims of dangerous driving where injury results. In 2009, Katie Harper was a healthy 23-year-old English degree student until she was hit by another car overtaking a line of traffic at seriously excessive speed. Her passenger was her mother, Christine. Katie suffered multiple breaks to her pelvis, two broken arms, facial injury and serious nerve damage to her right leg. Her mother has also been left with permanent injuries after the near-fatal incident. The entire family have suffered. Katie&#8217;s father, Paul Harper, retired early from his job as a primary school teacher to provide the round-the-clock support that his wife and daughter need. My constituents&#8217; case is by no means the worst.</p>
	<p pid="c.192.2/7">The House will remember the tragic case of Cerys Edwards, an 11-month-old toddler. The Edwards family were the victims of a dangerous driver in 2006. Cerys has needed round-the-clock care since the collision. The driver was doing 70 mph in a 30 mph zone. He lost control of his mother&#8217;s Range Rover while overtaking. Cerys was left severely paralysed, brain damaged and reliant on a ventilator to breathe. The dangerous driver was released from prison after just six months. Cerys&#8217;s father, Gareth Edwards, is reported to have said, &#8220;It just goes to show we don&#8217;t have a justice system in this country&#8221;, when he heard that the offender had been released.</p>
	<p pid="c.192.2/8">Many judges have described in their sentencing remarks their frustration at the inadequacy of the law. In researching my Bill I took the time to seek advice from the Recorder of Hull and East Riding, His Honour Judge Mettyear. Judge Mettyear told me that every judge in the country would, in his view, want to support this proposal. There is a clear anomaly in the law. Dangerous driving carries a maximum sentence of two years, whereas causing death by dangerous driving is worth 14 years.</p>
	<p pid="c.192.2/9">To highlight the disparity, let us imagine the following situation. Two young men who own powerful cars spend a Saturday afternoon with friends in a park. One suggests to the other that they should have a race. The friends warn them of the danger. One of them is not so keen, but he is heavily encouraged by his girlfriend, who offers to accompany him. He reluctantly takes up the offer and they race through the crowded streets, overtaking each other in the face of oncoming traffic, which has to swerve to avoid collision. They continue at great speed in order to escape the police. As they try to navigate a bend, they lose control. One of them ploughs into a bus stand, causing serious injury. The other manages to swerve to avoid the bus stand but hits a tree. His girlfriend, who is a passenger, is tragically killed. The other driver is lucky and does not cause death, but he leaves his victim paralysed and permanently brain damaged.</p>
	<p pid="c.192.2/10">The one who causes the death will face up to 14 years&#8217; imprisonment. The one who leaves the innocent victim paralysed and brain damaged will face a maximum of two years&#8217; imprisonment. This sentence must then be reduced by one third, as credit for pleading guilty, and then further because it is not considered the worst such case that the judge has seen. The offender will serve a matter of a few months in prison, but what sentence does his innocent victim face? In this scenario, the culpability of the driver who caused death was in some</p>
	<p pid="c.192.2/11">ways less than the one who was lucky and did not. How is that justice? My motivation is compounded by the forthcoming justice Bill, which proposes to increase the discount for an early guilty plea from one third to 50%, which means that even the worst example of dangerous driving will attract a starting sentence of only 12 months.</p>
	<p pid="c.192.2/12">I am grateful for the cross-party support I have received for my Bill. Over the past few weeks, I have spoken with right hon. and hon. Members from across the House, and their advice and encouragement has been gratefully received. I am grateful to Louise Casey, the Victims&#8217; Commissioner, for her support and invaluable advice. I have also discussed my proposal with my area chief constable, Tim Hollis, who fully supports my efforts. The charity Brake welcomes the proposals and the AA, Aviva and the RAC have also committed their support.</p>
	<p pid="c.192.2/13">I know that my proposal is unlikely to find its way on to the statute book in its current form, but I hope that those on the Government Front Bench will take on board the points that you, Mr Speaker, have allowed me to make. The Bill requires a simple amendment to paragraph 9 of schedule 2 to part 1 of the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988. The effect, however, would be substantial. The Bill would allow judges the discretion to redress the balance in favour of the victim. The proposed legislation addresses an anomaly in the law and offers a proper deterrent. I respectfully invite the House to support it.</p>

	<p pid="c.195.1/23">5. Proceedings on Third Reading shall (so far as not previously concluded) be brought to a conclusion at the moment of interruption on the second day.</p>
	<p pid="c.195.1/24">I will briefly introduce the motion. It is delightful to see that so many Committee members have come back for a second round. From the outset of our deliberations on the Bill, we said that we regarded the legislation as something that could benefit from the expertise that exists both within the House and outside.</p>
	<p pid="c.195.1/25">We have been true to that statement, and we had a very interesting set of sessions in Committee: 24 sittings and 64 hours&#8217; scrutiny. I probably spent more time during that period in the company of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40673" name="Barbara Keeley">the hon. Member for Worsley and Eccles South (Barbara Keeley)</phrase>, at least during waking hours, than I did with my wife&#8212;although <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40480" name="Alison Seabeck">the hon. Member for Plymouth, Moor View (Alison Seabeck)</phrase> sort of doubled up on that time. We considered every clause in the Bill and finished its scrutiny with a little time to spare, so we made good progress.</p>
	<p pid="c.195.1/26">During the Bill&#8217;s passage, we established an atmosphere that was constructive, usually harmonious and often uproarious, even. I do not know whether the remaining stages will live up to the high benchmark that we set, but we should aim to take matters in the same spirit&#8212;I certainly intend to&#8212;today, tomorrow and, indeed, when the Bill goes to another place. This is a Bill in which there are invested the hopes and expectations of many people outside this place, and we owe it to them to reflect seriously on the matters that are before us and, where we can be constructive, to be so.</p>
	<p pid="c.195.1/27">I hope Members will recognise that the large number of Government amendments is testimony to some of my commitments in Committee to reflect seriously on the points that were made and to come back to the House in a constructive way. There have been discussions across the House and with outside bodies in helping to shape that approach, and no doubt they will come out in our debates over the next two days.</p>
	<p pid="c.195.1/28">It is comparatively unusual to have two days on Report, but the Bill&#8217;s significance and extent justify it. Nevertheless, I hope that the hon. Member for Worsley and Eccles South and her colleagues will accept that it is appropriate to insert a couple of knives into our proceedings so that we can get on to talk about planning and, in due course, housing. It would be remiss if we did not secure that outcome.</p>
	<p pid="c.195.1/29">No doubt we will not agree on everything, and there may be cause for Divisions, but, as in Committee, constructive suggestions will have the opportunity to be reflected on and reflected in the Bill&#8217;s further progress in another place.</p>

	<p pid="c.197.0/1">I will be even more brief. As the Minister suggests, on Report the Government have tabled 234 new clauses and amendments, which is more than the number of clauses in the original Bill, so we have a lot to discuss. I would not say that we have two days. We have ended up with some concerns about the programming of these debates, but it would be more appropriate if we discussed them with the usual channels.</p>

	<p pid="c.204.0/1">New clause 12 refines one of the central elements of the Bill&#8212;the general power of competence. I shall say more about that shortly and also address the other new clauses and amendments in this excessively long group.</p>
	<p pid="c.204.0/2">The Government are committed to the radical decentralisation of power and control from Whitehall and Westminster to local government, local communities and individuals. We are pushing power back down to the lowest possible level, and this Bill is about shaking up the balance of power and revitalising democracy. It will give power to councils, communities, voluntary groups and the people, giving local authorities the power to take decisions that are right for their areas, and giving to local people the power to influence those decisions.</p>
	<p pid="c.204.0/3">This Government trust local authorities to know what is best for their areas, we trust local councillors to know what they are doing and we are freeing up local government from the shackles of central Government. The Localism Bill does just what it says on the label.</p>

	<p pid="c.204.1/1">I welcome the Minister&#8217;s opening remarks and wonder whether he is, therefore, just about to get on to the fact that he supports my new clause 8, which would give local authorities the opportunity to vary Sunday trading laws. If what he says is true and he wants to pass all such decisions down to the lowest possible level, that is surely what he is about to announce.</p>

	<p pid="c.204.2/1">I look forward to hearing my hon. Friend&#8217;s case deployed in the debate.</p>
	<p pid="c.204.2/2">I am pleased to report that there is a very broad measure of agreement, both inside and outside the House, on the Bill&#8217;s principles and, indeed, on many of its specific provisions.</p>
	<p pid="c.204.2/3">Local authorities will need to ensure the delivery of more responsive services in a more transparent way, so that their citizens can see what is going on. To do so, local councils will need to innovate, to work across traditional boundaries and to ensure clear lines of accountability to their residents. That will be characterised, above all, by the way in which local democracy is renewed.</p>
	<p pid="c.204.2/4">Within this very large group of proposed changes, there are a number of new clauses and amendments that hon. Members from all parts of the House have tabled, including the one to which my hon. Friend just referred. We shall debate them, I will consider carefully the points that hon. Members raise and I hope to have the opportunity to respond to them before the close of this debate.</p>
	<p pid="c.204.2/5">We had a consensual time on the whole in Committee, and I hope that we can carry that forward in our discussion on this group of proposed changes.</p>

	<p pid="c.205.0/1">Not wanting to become non-consensual at this early stage, I note that the Minister talks about limits on power, and we are still concerned about the Bill&#8217;s 142 extra powers for the Secretary of State. I am puzzled why new clause 12 specifies only the powers in clause 5(1), because they are exactly the same as those in clause 5(2). If there is a concern about limiting the powers of the Secretary of State, it should apply to both subsections. I wonder whether the Minister might cover that point.</p>

	<p pid="c.205.1/1">I hope to have satisfied the hon. Lady by the time I have completed my remarks. If not, I am sure that she will let me know.</p>
	<p pid="c.205.1/2">All the Government amendments and new clauses, one way or another, are designed to improve the effectiveness of the Bill, given the range of issues that were raised in Committee, as the Minister of State said, and given outside events, including in particular the passage of the Welsh referendum, which means that some of the provisions that were in prospect earlier on can now be made a reality. To that extent, I hope I can reassure <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40150" name="Jonathan Edwards">the hon. Member for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr (Jonathan Edwards)</phrase> that we are not inserting a whole lot of totally new provisions; we are simply making available to the Welsh Executive the same powers that are being made available in England. I hope he finds that somewhat reassuring.</p>
	<p pid="c.205.1/3">We have, where appropriate, taken into account feedback from the consultations that have been carried out on elements of the Bill and representations that we have received from a wide range of organisations that have been interested in&#8212;and, in some cases, very excited about&#8212;the prospect of the Bill coming into force.</p>
	<p pid="c.205.1/4">There was a broad consensus about the general power of competence, with the concerns that were expressed being about the scope of the powers and the role of the Secretary of State. New clause 12 and the related amendments address those points. Equally, there were debates and discussions about the position of fire and rescue authorities, because they will have similar powers. We have reflected on the concerns raised in Committee and the feedback that we received from industry partners, and we have tabled an amendment on that point. Several amendments make the fire and rescue authority powers applicable in Wales.</p>
	<p pid="c.205.1/5">There was much agreement in the Committee&#8217;s debate on the Standards Board for England, and we listened carefully and have tabled an amendment. On European Union fines, there was a lot of discussion about the practicalities, but we reached a position whereby people agreed that the intentions behind our proposals on EU infractions were broadly reasonable&#8212;I think those were the words of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40287" name="Nick Raynsford">the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr Raynsford)</phrase>&#8212;and the debate was more about how this would work in practice.</p>

	<p pid="c.206.0/1">I take note of that, and I will return to it in two or three minutes&#8217; time, if I may.</p>
	<p pid="c.206.0/2">The hon. Lady is of course right that there was not agreement on everything. I recognise, in particular, that there were different views on mayors, not only between Government and Opposition Front-Bench teams but among some of my hon. Friends. I will listen carefully to the points made today on the mayoral proposals in the Bill, particularly on such issues as shadow mayors and mayoral management arrangements. Overall, however, I was struck by how much we had in common and how much consensus there is about the need to change the power balance in this country in line with the direction that the Bill takes. I hope that the House will recognise that, through the range of new clauses and amendments that we have tabled, we have tried genuinely and thoroughly to address the points that have been raised.</p>
	<p pid="c.206.0/3">Let me turn in more detail to new clause 12 and some of the other Government amendments. I appreciate that I have to strike a difficult balance between using up the available time for debate and giving the House a reasonable explanation of the measures before it. I will steer as good a course as I can, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I am sure you will let me know if I go astray. New clause 12 and its related amendments impose conditions on the use of the delegated powers in clause 5(1) in relation to the general power of competence. Clause 5(1) sets out a power for the Secretary of State to remove or to change statutory provisions that prevent or restrict the use of the general power of competence. We have termed this the barrier-buster power.</p>
	<p pid="c.206.0/4">Amendment 64 is the equivalent provision for the general power of competence for fire and rescue authorities in England and Wales. The amendment imposes conditions on the use of the delegated powers in new section 5C(1) of the Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004, which is inserted by clause 8. New section 5C(1) sets out a power for the appropriate national authority&#8212;Welsh Ministers for the devolved matters relating to Wales, but otherwise the Secretary of State&#8212;to remove or to change statutory provisions that prevent or restrict the use of the general power for fire and rescue authorities.</p>
	<p pid="c.206.0/5">Concerns were expressed about the scope of the delegated power at clause 5(1)&#8212;the barrier buster&#8212;and the equivalent powers in relation to fire and rescue authorities. The Government reflected on those concerns and decided to introduce specific preconditions as to the use of the barrier-buster power and the limitations on its scope. These include a proportionality test and a requirement to achieve a fair balance between the public interest and the interests of any person adversely affected by an order. In addition to the current requirements that the Secretary of State has to satisfy&#8212;in particular, that he must think that a provision prevents or restricts the use of the general power and must consult on his proposals&#8212;subsection (1) now provides that he must also consider the conditions set out in subsection (2), in relation to the general power, and in section 5C(1) in relation to the fire provision to have been satisfied in relation to the proposals.</p>
	<p pid="c.206.0/6">The new conditions that the clause introduces ensure that the use of the provision is proportionate to the policy objective intended, that there is a fair balance between the public interest and the interests of any person adversely affected, that there is no removal of any necessary protection, that no person will be prevented</p>
	<p pid="c.206.0/7">from continuing to exercise any right or freedom that they might reasonably expect to exercise, and that any provision is not of constitutional significance. In the light of Opposition amendments 36 and 37, it is perhaps worth explaining the effect of these conditions in a little more detail. The first condition is that the effect of the provision made by the order is proportionate to its policy objective. It might be possible to achieve a policy objective in several different ways, some of which might be more onerous than others and could represent a disproportionate means of securing the desired outcome, so the Secretary of State must satisfy himself that that is not the case and that there is an appropriate relationship between the policy aim and the means chosen to deliver it.</p>
	<p pid="c.206.0/8">The second condition is that the provision made by the order, taken as a whole, strikes a fair balance between the public interest, on the one hand, and the interests of the person adversely affected by the order, on the other. While it may be possible to make an order that will have an adverse effect on the interests of one or more persons, the Secretary of State must first be satisfied that this is outweighed by beneficial effects in the public interest. The third condition is that the provision made by the order does not remove any necessary protection. The notion of necessary protection can extend to economic protection, to health and safety protection, and to the protection of civil liberties, the environment and national heritage.</p>
	<p pid="c.206.0/9">The fourth condition is that the provision made by the order will not prevent any person from continuing to exercise any right or freedom that he might reasonably expect to continue to exercise. To take a leading example, any right conferred or protected by the European convention on human rights is a right that a person might reasonably expect to keep. The fifth and final condition is that the provision made by the order is not constitutionally significant. That condition will allow orders to amend enactments that are themselves constitutionally significant, but only if the amendments are not constitutionally significant. The condition puts it beyond doubt that repeal of legislation such as the Human Rights Act 1998 or the European Communities Act 1972 is outside this power.</p>
	<p pid="c.206.0/10">In addition to these preconditions, we are seeking to amend the Bill so that an order under clause 5(1) or section 5C(1) of the 2004 Act may not make provision in relation to certain specified limitation. Subsection (3) prevents orders from being used to delegate or transfer a function of legislating, ensuring that a power to make legislation given by Parliament to the Secretary of State or to another body cannot be transferred to a local authority in the interests of barrier busting. It is right that those decisions should remain with Parliament. Subsection (4) gives a definition of the function of legislating&#8212;that is, legislating by order, by rules, by regulation or by subordinate instruments. Subsection (5) prohibits an order from abolishing or varying any tax. It could be argued that removing a tax payable by a local authority would be the removal of a barrier, but it is not our intention that clause 5(1) should be used in that way, so the new clause will prevent an order to vary tax from being made.</p>
	<p pid="c.206.0/11">Taken as a whole, the Government&#8217;s proposals will provide the protections that the Opposition seek in amendments 36 and 37, but without the inflexible and heavy-handed mechanism that they propose.</p>
	<p pid="c.206.0/12">Amendment 36 would amend the definition of a statutory provision by excluding from that definition a long list of statutes, which is set out in amendment 37. That appears to have been prompted by various strands of work that are being undertaken to gather information about local authority duties. This appears to be an attempt to make a point about front-line duties and the desirability of many things that local authorities have to do. Indeed, that is what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40673" name="Barbara Keeley">the hon. Member for Worsley and Eccles South (Barbara Keeley)</phrase> set out on her website as being her intention. She has fairly given me notice that she</p>
	<p pid="c.206.0/13">&#8220;will be pressing ministers in the Commons debate&#8230;to be clear about which other vital council services can be protected.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.206.0/14">I am happy to tell the hon. Lady that the general power is not designed as a means to do away with duties that Parliament has imposed on local authorities. The general power does not oblige local authorities to act in a particular way; it is not the same thing as a duty imposed by legislation. It will give local authorities real freedom to innovate and act in the interests of their communities. The Opposition seem to have developed a misunderstanding about the scope of clause 5(1). It provides the Secretary of State with powers to remove or change statutory provisions that prevent or restrict the use of the general power. That restriction or limitation is one that bites on the general power by virtue of clause 2. The provision is about removing barriers to the legal capacity of authorities to act innovatively and in the best interests of their communities. It is not aimed at removing duties, nor is it, nor could it be, a general-purpose tool to remove any legislation that places a burden on local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="c.206.0/15">New clause 12 and the connected Government amendments will increase the safeguards on the use of the power in clause 5(1). In addition, the Secretary of State must consult before exercising the power and the appropriate parliamentary procedure for scrutinising any proposed order will be determined by Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="c.208.0/1">Does the Minister accept that clause 5, when taken in conjunction with the review that his Department is carrying out into burdensome regulations, might lead to the fear, which many of my constituents have expressed to me, that important protections and duties that exist within local authorities might disappear?</p>

	<p pid="c.208.1/1">The review of statutory duties is a separate exercise. We have made it clear several times that the review of statutory duties will not remove duties to provide vital services, and that any changes to statutory duties that come about as a result of that review will subsequently be properly considered and consulted on. There is no connection between the two processes.</p>
	<p pid="c.208.1/2">I urge the House, when the time comes, to support new clause 12 and to reject amendments 36 and 37.</p>
	<p pid="c.208.1/3">I will turn to the other proposals in this group, on which I hope I can be helpful. When the Committee discussed the standards of behaviour required of councillors, we discussed whether a local authority should have to publicise that it has a code of conduct. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40108" name="David Ward">the Member for Bradford East (Mr Ward)</phrase> made a powerful speech on the difference between may and must. I think that was one of the Committee&#8217;s high spots. Although we consider it right that a local authority</p>
	<p pid="c.208.1/4">can choose whether to adopt a code of conduct for its members, it must be under a duty to disclose whether it has done so and whether it has revised or abolished its code. That duty will ensure that local people are made aware when their local authority adopts, changes or withdraws its code, while leaving it for authorities to decide how best to publicise and deal with these matters.</p>

	<p pid="c.209.0/1">The Minister is putting the completely absurd proposition to the House that the local authority will be under a duty to publicise a code of conduct that it may decide not to have. Will he please recognise that that is nonsense? Abolishing the requirement for a code of conduct in every local authority in the country is a serious, retrograde step, of which the Government should be profoundly ashamed.</p>

	<p pid="c.209.1/1">The right hon. Gentleman asked me a question and the answer is no, I do not accept that at all. When we exchanged words in Committee, I thought that this was an outrage, so I am glad that it has been downgraded a little. The important point is that the decision a local authority takes should be transparent, so that the local electorate are aware of it and the local authority are accountable to them. We have accepted the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford East put to the Committee, and Government amendments 130 and 131 deal with that.</p>

	<p pid="c.209.3/1">The Local Government Association has given notice that it sees itself as&#8212;I do not want to put words into its mouth and say the custodian&#8212;the focal point for ensuring that a standard code of practice is available. I would have thought that the huge majority of local authorities will continue to have a published and open code of conduct. Indeed, I should have thought that it would reflect adversely on the reputation of a local authority if it chose not to do so. However, the right place for that decision to be taken is in that local authority in the light of the views of its electorate; it is not something that should be imposed from above.</p>

	<p pid="c.209.4/1">In Northern Ireland, we have a stringent code of conduct for local authorities. Has the Minister had any discussions with local authorities in Northern Ireland on using that blueprint for a code of conduct under these proposals?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-17c.209.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40307" speakername="Andrew Stunell" colnum="209"  time="018:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110517/debtext/110517-0002.htm#11051753000135">
	<p pid="c.209.5/1">I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is aware that the Bill is not applicable in Northern Ireland. Currently, every local authority in England has to have a statutory code of conduct, so we are not for want of an example. We are saying that there should be flexibility about the shape and nature of the code, and that that flexibility should be exercised by the local authority.</p>
	<p pid="c.209.5/2">On EU fines and infractions, I assure the House and the hon. Member for Worsley and Eccles South that we will ensure that any process to pass on an EU fine is fair, reasonable and proportionate, and we will consult on that. We will pass on a fine only if an authority has clearly caused or contributed to causing it, and has the power to remedy the situation and can afford to pay. That is set out in new clauses 13 and 14 and in Government amendments 132 to 143. The measure is not about Ministers reclaiming every penny; it is about giving a strong encouragement not to incur fines in the first place. Local authorities must not be able to assume that if they make a mistake and are in the wrong, the UK taxpayer will pay their bill for them.</p>
	<p pid="c.209.5/3">It is perhaps worth rehearsing what the process is. EU grants are given with conditions attached. At present, the monitoring, and therefore the risk, falls to central Government and their agencies. In the new, devolved world, that will not always be the case, and with the transfer of control has to come a transfer of risk. The Government do not seek to offload risks that are beyond a local authority&#8217;s control&#8212;mention has been made of air pollution targets and so on.</p>
	<p pid="c.209.5/4">That will all be set out in a policy statement, and I can say today that we are making good progress on that. I am placing in the Library a paper from the Greater London authority that has emerged from some of our earlier discussions, and I would very much welcome comments on it. We do not necessarily agree with every single part of it, but it will provide a strong basis for discussion over the next few weeks and we are committed to taking that discussion forward. We have also engaged with the Local Government Association and will continue to do so.</p>
	<p pid="c.209.5/5">We debated fire and rescue authorities in Committee, and our amendments 92 and 93 are a response to the concerns that the Opposition raised and feedback that we have received from industry partners. They relate to authorities&#8217; powers to charge for attending persistently malfunctioning or wrongly installed automatic fire alarms. It is not in dispute that there should be such a provision for non-domestic premises, but the point was made that domestic premises would also be caught by that power, and probably wrongly so. The amendments simply remove that option from fire and rescue authorities.</p>
	<p pid="c.209.5/6">We also discussed pay accountability in Committee, and we undertook to return to the House on the matter of greater accountability on low pay in light of Will Hutton&#8217;s report on fair pay in the public sector. His report made some clear recommendations, particularly about the benefit of setting decisions on senior pay in the context of the pay of the rest of a body&#8217;s work force. Some of the Opposition&#8217;s amendments are in the same tone. We are sympathetic to that idea, particularly the potential for linking lower pay with senior pay, and we will consider the best way to take that forward. If necessary, we will return to it in the other place. As we do so, we will remain mindful of the level of burden placed on authorities and ensure that pay decisions remain ones for the appropriate local employer to take and are not dictated by us.</p>
	<p pid="c.209.5/7">On the other hand, we do not think it would be helpful to use the Bill to address the pay of contracting bodies. Councils, the voluntary sector and businesses, especially small firms, have called on the Government to remove unnecessary burdens and break down barriers</p>
	<p pid="c.209.5/8">in local authority contracting, not increase them. That does not prevent a local authority from developing a local policy to ensure that bodies with which it contracts are open about their rates of pay as a matter of contract. That should remain an issue for local decision making, not central determination.</p>
	<p pid="c.209.5/9">We have a very large group of amendments, and you no doubt have a large group of Members wishing to speak, Mr Deputy Speaker. I apologise to the House on the one hand for taking so long and on the other for dealing with some very important topics only in skeleton form. I am pleased to move new clause 12, and in due time I will wish to move the other Government new clauses and amendments in the group. I undertake to listen carefully to Members&#8217; contributions as the debate proceeds.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-17c.211.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40673" speakername="Barbara Keeley" colnum="211"  time="018:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110517/debtext/110517-0002.htm#11051753000136">
	<p pid="c.211.0/1">I am glad that Ministers are still so interested in my website&#8212;it makes it worth all the effort of keeping it up to date.</p>
	<p pid="c.211.0/2">I shall speak first to amendments 36 and 37, which are related to new clause 12. They are intended to protect a list of the most important duties of local councils from the powers that the Secretary of State wants to take in clause 5(1) and (2). I should remind the Minister that he did not answer my question about new clause 12 not applying to clause 5(2). I see that Ministers are looking at the Box and seeing if they can find some inspiration over there.</p>
	<p pid="c.211.0/3">As I said on Second Reading, the Secretary of State&#8217;s power under clause 5(1) and (2) is chilling, because it would allow him to</p>
	<p pid="c.211.0/4">&#8220;amend, repeal, revoke or disapply&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.211.0/5">any statutory provision. The Government can keep calling that barrier-busting, but it will still end up being the same swingeing power. The difficulty for those who are opposed to it is that it would leave local councils and the people who use their services at the mercy of the ideology of the current Government and Secretary of State. I know from the debates that we had in Committee that some of the Ministers were opposed to giving Secretaries of State such a level of power in previous local government Bills, and spoke against it. Perhaps they would like to think about why they have had such a change of heart.</p>
	<p pid="c.211.0/6">Since our debates on the Bill started, the Department has launched its review of the statutory duties of local councils. That means that the nature of the power in question, and how it will be used to sweep away what councils are starting to see as burdens, is now much more under the spotlight. The Government&#8217;s focus on duties as &#8220;burdens&#8221; has caused alarm and great concern to people who rely on the services of their local council. Their concern about the extent of the Secretary of State&#8217;s powers to sweep away councils&#8217; duties is greater because of the language that the Government are using to describe the vital duties on which people depend. In the review, councils and the public were asked to specify the bureaucratic burdens that they wished to throw away. In fact, Ministers have allowed all the duties of councils to be listed, and voted on, as &#8220;burdens&#8221;, &#8220;red tape&#8221; or &#8220;bureaucratic barriers&#8221;. In using that language, they do not appear to have considered the importance of many of the statutory duties of local councils.</p>
	<p pid="c.211.0/7">Strangely, we now find ourselves bartering to try to find out which particular duties might be safe and protected from the Secretary of State. The Department&#8217;s website states that the only duties that might be protected are those on libraries and child protection, but the Under-Secretary of State, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40127" name="Bob Neill">the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill)</phrase>, ventured in a recent letter to <i>The Guardian</i> that allotments were also safe. It is not reasonable to have only vague reassurances on three out of all the duties of local councils. We have therefore tabled amendments 36 and 37, and I say to Ministers that they must be clearer about protecting the vital duties of local councils&#8212;duties that legislation has created, which provide important protections and services on which people rely&#8212;from the power that the Secretary of State wants to</p>
	<p pid="c.211.0/8">&#8220;amend, repeal, revoke or disapply&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.211.0/9">any statutory provision.</p>
	<p pid="c.211.0/10">Members should make no mistake about it: there are real concerns about that power. Professor Luke Clements is a leading expert on community care law, and in an article about the statutory provisions that could be swept away by the new power, he stated:</p>
	<p pid="c.211.0/11">&#8220;The list includes large swathes of the Mental Health Act 1983, the Children Act 1989 as well as virtually every community care and carers statute. The suggestion that protecting children or frail elderly people from abuse could be&#8230;&#8216;burdensome&#8217; is further evidence of the coalition government&#8217;s disdain for the very notion of a welfare state.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.211.0/12">He said of the Government&#8217;s approach:</p>
	<p pid="c.211.0/13">&#8220;It is a contempt that has already created a largely lawless regime where fundamental rights, such as the right to a face-to-face assessment&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.211.0/14">and</p>
	<p pid="c.211.0/15">&#8220;the right to have assessed needs met regardless of resources&#8230;are openly flouted. It is a regime that fuels the daily news stories of disabled, elderly and ill people being failed by public bodies, and experiencing neglect and extreme indignity. In the face of this, the response of the coalition government is not to strengthen the law, but to suggest that it be trashed.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="c.212.0/1">I have really been disappointed by the hon. Lady&#8217;s remarks, which are a travesty of what is in prospect. I spent perhaps a little too long in my speech explaining precisely what new clause 12 will do and making it absolutely clear what it will not do. I am sorry to say that she is making it up, which is not good.</p>
	<p pid="c.212.0/2">Incidentally, I can answer the hon. Lady&#8217;s question about clause 5(2)&#8212;as she suggested, inspiration has arrived. It relates only to overlapping powers, so by definition it will not change local authority powers or duties because it will take away only one of the overlapping powers.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-17c.212.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40673" speakername="Barbara Keeley" colnum="212"  time="018:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110517/debtext/110517-0002.htm#11051753000138">
	<p pid="c.212.1/1">I am afraid that I am not convinced by that, and I am not making this up. I know Professor Clements, because he helped to draft much of the carers legislation that went through the House as private Members&#8217; Bills. He, among others, is very concerned.</p>
	<p pid="c.212.1/2">To respond to the Minister&#8217;s point, part of the difficulty is that the conditions set out in Government new clause 12(2) are subjective. It is another lawyers&#8217; charter, because they will have to settle the question of whether or not legislation fits those conditions. The key point is that all the decisions lie completely within the judgment of the Secretary of State. That is what is making people</p>
	<p pid="c.212.1/3">uncomfortable. There is great concern about sweeping away the laws, rights and protections for those who need care. Yesterday in the Palace, I attended a gathering of five all-party groups on disability&#8212;I attended as the chair of the all-party group on social care. Two questions were asked of the Bill and the review, and there was a chorus of concern in the room. Ministers can attack me if they want to, but I am representing concern from outside the House.</p>
	<p pid="c.212.1/4">Citizens Advice has told MPs that it is worried about the broad-ranging powers that clause 5 confers on the Secretary of State. It is worried that the power will be used to revoke or repeal a number of statutory provisions, such as the public sector equalities duty.</p>

	<p pid="c.213.0/1">The Prime Minister says that he wants power to be given back to local people. Does my hon. Friend agree that giving the Secretary of State 126 new powers contradicts that?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-17c.213.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40673" speakername="Barbara Keeley" colnum="213"  time="018:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110517/debtext/110517-0002.htm#11051753000140">
	<p pid="c.213.1/1">That is a contradiction. In fact, the 126 or 142 new powers&#8212;we can count them in different ways&#8212;are of great concern.</p>
	<p pid="c.213.1/2">The list of legislation that we propose in amendment 37 for protection from those new powers may not be perfect&#8212;I am sure people can find fault with it&#8212;but it is vital to get a clear steer from Ministers that they do not intend to continue to see important council duties as burdens. Does the Secretary of State agree that the Homelessness Act 2002, which is on our proposed list, creates a vital duty for councils to have a strategy for tackling homelessness, or does he agree with Hammersmith and Fulham council, which has asked for that duty to be scrapped? Hammersmith and Fulham also wants to scrap the rough sleeper strategy, and wants not to assess the sufficiency of locally available child care. It wants no requirements on its youth service. Do Ministers believe that Hammersmith and Fulham should be able to shed those duties? That is the key question.</p>
	<p pid="c.213.1/3">Councils such as Hammersmith and Fulham want to shake off what they view as burdensome duties, but the Opposition&#8217;s view is that those council services are vital and should be protected. A list of what is vital and to be protected is the key to that. In Committee, the Minister said:</p>
	<p pid="c.213.1/4">&#8220;Every local authority will retain duties enshrined in other legislation to provide services and not to charge for them, if charging is not allowed at present.&#8221;<i>&#8211;&#8211;</i>[<i>Official Report, Localism Public Bill Committee, </i><phrase class="date" code="2011-02-01">1 February 2011</phrase>; c. 184.]</p>
	<p pid="c.213.1/5">However, Hammersmith and Fulham wants not to have plans for homeless people, and Wandsworth council plans to charge children &#163;2.50 to use a playground. That is where we are. It is time for Ministers to end the uncertainty that they have generated with their sloppy plans for revising legislation on council duties. It is time for them to reintroduce certainty, so that people know that councils must provide land for allotments and an efficient library service, assess carers&#8217; needs, and have plans for tackling homelessness.</p>
	<p pid="c.213.1/6">I welcome the Minister&#8217;s partial sympathy on proposed new clauses 27 and 28 and the proposed amendments on pay transparency and very much look forward to developments. Much has been said in recent months on top pay in local government. I am sure that Ministers</p>
	<p pid="c.213.1/7">would agree that a great deal of that talk has been stoked by the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government. However, he has tended not to show the same concern for the lowest paid staff, or for levels of pay among consultants and contractors, who provide &#163;38 billion-worth of goods and services to local government, which is paid for out of the public purse.</p>
	<p pid="c.213.1/8">Our proposals aim to introduce pay transparency much more fully than the Government plan. We want to shine a light on top pay and low pay, and I welcome the Minister&#8217;s sympathy for that. However, the Opposition also want to develop the recommendations in the Hutton review on pay. Ministers said that they would reflect on that review, and I hope they take that seriously. All hon. Members agree that there has been some excessive growth in senior roles in the public sector, but there are also myths about public sector pay. The Local Government Association estimates that of 1.7 million employees in mainstream local government jobs, 60% earn less than &#163;18,000 a year. According to the LGA, more than 400,000 council workers earn less than the living wage, including more than 250,000 who earn less than &#163;6.50 an hour.</p>

	<p pid="c.214.0/1">My hon. Friend makes a strong point. As a former Unison trade union officer, I know that a high proportion of those low-paid workers&#8212;a big majority&#8212;are women.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-17c.214.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40673" speakername="Barbara Keeley" colnum="214"  time="018:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110517/debtext/110517-0002.htm#11051753000142">
	<p pid="c.214.1/1">Indeed, a quarter of those who experience in-work poverty are employed by the public sector. In addition, the average public sector pension, at &#163;4,200, is very far from the gold-plated pension that people talk about. Our proposals would introduce greater transparency and help the objective of curbing excessive pay at the top of the scale, because it will be harder for a highly paid council chief executive to defend his or her pay if the public can see what that council pays its lowest-paid members of staff.</p>
	<p pid="c.214.1/2">The Opposition believe that as well as an approach on top and low pay, we need a fair and consistent approach to transparency in local authority pay. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40081" name="Jack Dromey">the Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Jack Dromey)</phrase> said in Committee, Will Hutton&#8217;s report puts paid to the myths. Public sector employees earn only &#163;1 of every &#163;100 earned by the top 1%, or to put it another way, out of every &#163;100 that is earned by the top 1%, only &#163;1 is earned in the public sector. Therefore, the perception that the public sector is awash with fat cats is a myth, and it does not help when DCLG Ministers spend their time building that myth as a way of dealing with top pay.</p>
	<p pid="c.214.1/3">The Hutton report confirms that increases in executive pay have been a private sector phenomenon. That is why tackling excess pay should happen not just in the public sector. We should also focus on pay in the private sector when money is paid from the public purse&#8212;that is the test. Staff on outsourced local government contracts tend to be concentrated in low-wage sectors such as cleaning, catering, low-skilled manual work and care work. One key question for hon. Members is this: do we want cleaners, care workers and teaching assistants to earn a living wage? The Opposition believe that they should earn such a wage. We therefore hope that Ministers and Government Members agree that the implementation of a senior pay policy in local government would be a double standard if the same logic is not applied to contractors, not least because the local government procurement market is valued at &#163;38 billion.</p>
	<p pid="c.214.1/4">Will Hutton said in his report that</p>
	<p pid="c.214.1/5">&#8220;it is important that the Fair Pay Code and as far as possible the other recommendations of this Review are extended into the public services industry.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.214.1/6">I hope that Ministers&#8212;I welcome the Secretary of State to the Chamber&#8212;support Hutton&#8217;s proposals to extend pay transparency to those private sector contractors who are paid out of the public purse. Implementation of our proposals would help to ensure that executive pay does not spiral up, that low pay is challenged, and that people can be confident that their local council is spending their money fairly and wisely.</p>
	<p pid="c.214.1/7">Finally, I support amendments 39 to 41, which are in my name and those of my hon. Friends the Members for Plymouth, Moor View (Alison Seabeck) and for Birmingham, Erdington. The proposals would remove the power of the Secretary of State, who has just joined us in the Chamber, to direct or order the imposition of shadow mayors. That is one of the most controversial measures in the Bill, and it represents the Government at their most centralising. The Government want to order a local authority to cease its existing form of governance and begin to operate a mayor and cabinet executive. Ministers spent months denying that they intended to try to impose shadow mayors.</p>
	<p pid="c.214.1/8">I remind the Secretary of State that he gave the following answer to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40345" name="Diana Johnson">the Member for Kingston upon Hull North (Diana Johnson)</phrase> on <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-21">21 October 2010</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="c.214.1/9">&#8220;She seems to be suggesting that we would somehow impose mayors on those 12 cities, but of course we will not-that is completely out of the question. The proposals will be subject to referendums. Once we know the views of the people in those 12 cities, we will move on to the election of a mayor if people vote for that.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2010-10-21.1117"><i>Official Report</i>, 21 October 2010; Vol. 516, c. 1117</phrase>.]</p>

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40448" name="Mary Glindon">the Member for North Tyneside (Mrs Glindon)</phrase> asked him again whether it was his intention to turn council leaders into mayors before holding a referendum. He stood at the Dispatch Box and referred my hon. Friend back to the earlier question:</p>
	<p pid="c.214.1/11">&#8220;I ruled out the possibility that we would be imposing mayors. This will be subject to a referendum.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2010-10-21.1125"><i>Official Report</i>, 21 October 2010; Vol. 516, c. 1125</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="c.214.1/12">He was absolutely clear. However, the proposal in the Bill directly contradicts what the Secretary of State said on that occasion and on other occasions. It is further proof of a Government who say one thing and do another, and it raises further questions about whether what they say can be trusted at all.</p>
	<p pid="c.214.1/13">Since the debate began on the proposal to impose mayors on 12 of our largest cities, opposition has bubbled up and developed all over the place. Indeed, the day after the Localism Bill was announced, the leader of Bradford council, Councillor Ian Greenwood, told the Bradford <i>Telegraph and Argus</i> newspaper that he was uncomfortable with being given an office to which he had not been elected. In that article, he said:</p>
	<p pid="c.214.1/14">&#8220;My view is this is not the right thing for Bradford&#8230; I am uncomfortable about being given an office I wasn&#8217;t elected to. I don&#8217;t feel it&#8217;s the right thing to do. Leadership is not about dictating, it&#8217;s about taking people with you&#8221;.</p>

	<p pid="c.216.0/1">No, there is absolutely not. I thank my hon. Friend for making that point.</p>
	<p pid="c.216.0/2">Hon. Members will be interested to know the extent to which there is all-party opposition to these proposals in Bradford. The Conservative group leader on Bradford council also argued against the imposition of a shadow mayor in that city. In the same article, Councillor Anne Hawkesworth said:</p>
	<p pid="c.216.0/3">&#8220;My colleagues and I are not supportive of elected mayors&#8230; We do not think that the proposals are suited to the needs of&#8230;Bradford.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.216.0/4">Last week, the same issue was reported on again, when <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40108" name="David Ward">the hon. Member for Bradford East (Mr Ward)</phrase> said:</p>
	<p pid="c.216.0/5">&#8220;My view is that it should be for the councils to decide if they want to go down the referendum route. The referendum shouldn&#8217;t be imposed.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.216.0/6">The Opposition agree. Shadow mayors and referendums on having a mayor should not be imposed. In Bradford at least, it seems, there is Labour, Liberal Democrat and Conservative opposition to the Government&#8217;s proposals. However, there has also been opposition in other councils, including Leeds city council.</p>

	<p pid="c.216.1/1">While my hon. Friend is running through a list of authorities, will she also refer to Sheffield&#8212;now a Labour-controlled authority, of course? There has been cross-party agreement between Labour and Liberal Democrats, and all are opposed to any mayoral system at all, and certainly opposed to shadow mayors. I am sure that were there any Conservative councillors in Sheffield&#8212;which there are not&#8212;they would be joining in the opposition as well. Is it not a strange system in which a mayor&#8217;s legitimacy comes from being elected by the public, but a shadow mayor&#8217;s legitimacy comes from being the representative of most councillors on a council? In Sheffield, that majority of councillors are opposed to the proposals.</p>

	<p pid="c.216.2/1">Absolutely. I was not going to go through a complete list, but I welcome hearing about what has happened in Sheffield.</p>
	<p pid="c.216.2/2">It seems that Yorkshire is turning against these proposals en masse, and there has been opposition in other councils&#8212;for example, in Leeds city council. The <i>Yorkshire Post</i> quoted its leader, Councillor Keith Wakefield, as saying that these proposals are</p>
	<p pid="c.216.2/3">&#8220;not acceptable in today&#8217;s democracy&#8230; If people decide they want an elected mayor that&#8217;s what they should have, but do it following a vote&#8230; I think the idea of a referendum is OK where people have an opportunity to say yea or nay. What&#8217;s not right is putting you in a position where there&#8217;s been no vote.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.216.2/4">I understand that he would turn down the position whatever happens.</p>
	<p pid="c.216.2/5">I hope that the hon. Member for Bradford East and his colleagues will support our amendment 41, and vote against the imposition of shadow mayors and referendums on their local councils.</p>

	<p pid="c.217.0/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on Report on this important Bill. I appreciate that there are a lot of amendments, however, and that many hon. Members wish to speak, so I will be as succinct as possible. I would like to refer to amendments 2 and 3. They are small but significant amendments that deal with the election of elected mayors. Because of their significance, I hope to press them to a vote tonight, unless Ministers see their merits.</p>
	<p pid="c.217.0/2">I fully subscribe to the localism agenda. I believe that we have become an over-centralised state, with too much power at the centre, whether with Ministers or civil servants. The Bill will start to turn the tanker around. I accept that progress will be slow, but it will take the agenda in the right direction. On Second Reading, I said that a cultural change was required first in Whitehall, with less interference and prescription from the centre, and, secondly, in the town hall, with people there taking more responsibility. However, localism has three strands: the division of power; tax-raising powers; and governance. I would like to concentrate on governance, particularly elected mayors.</p>
	<p pid="c.217.0/3">I am a strong supporter of the concept of elected mayors. That is the direction in which we should be going. They are open, transparent and accountable, and I also believe that they will help to revive local government. I thought that there was broad cross-party support for them, because they were introduced by a Labour Government in 2000, and because, obviously, the coalition Government are retaining the concept and looking to introduce 11 new mayors in due course.</p>

	<p pid="c.217.1/1">I accept that elected mayors were a Labour concept, although I was not in favour of them. It is noticeable that across the country many local authorities have rejected the idea, and that many of those who voted for them now regret doing so.</p>

	<p pid="c.217.2/1">I accept that they are not universally supported by all parties, but I believe that there is broad support. The hon. Gentleman raises a separate point, though, because there are several reasons why elected mayors have not caught on. However, I want to concentrate on my amendment 2 about their actual election.</p>
	<p pid="c.217.2/2">At present, mayors are elected under the supplementary vote system, which is retained in the Bill. Effectively it is a form of the alternative vote. My amendment 2 would change that so that future elections are done under first past the post. That would provide a consistent approach to elections. Varying the voting system creates confusion and a lack of certainty for the average voter. Two weeks ago, this country went to the polling booth for a referendum on whether we wanted AV or first past the post. Had the voters supported AV, I would have withdrawn this amendment. I would have accepted the will of the people. In fact, there was an overwhelming and emphatic vote for first past the post. As one hon. Member said to</p>
	<p pid="c.217.2/3">me, &#8220;The people of this country did not say no; they said never.&#8221; I accept that judgment, but I believe there has to be consistency. I support the amendment on the basis that we should have a consistent approach to our elections and that elected mayors should therefore be elected under first past the post. I genuinely hope that the House will agree with what the people said two weeks ago and support the amendment.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-17c.218.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40327" speakername="Graham Jones" colnum="218"  time="018:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110517/debtext/110517-0003.htm#11051753000152">
	<p pid="c.218.0/1">I want to address new clauses 13 and 14 on EU fines. I believe that ministerial advice stated that individual fines to local authorities would be appropriate where there was a direct causal link, and where councils were guilty of action or inaction. One example is waste, on which I would like to address two key issues: EU directives on recycling and landfill taxes.</p>
	<p pid="c.218.0/2">The Local Government Association briefing is dismissive of the Government&#8217;s proposals. It states:</p>
	<p pid="c.218.0/3">&#8220;Moves to allow Ministers to force English councils to pay parts of fines imposed on the UK government by the EU are unfair, unworkable, dangerous and unconstitutional. This is an unprecedented power for Ministers to avoid Parliamentary scrutiny and will inevitably lead to legal battles as Government tries to apportion &#8220;blame&#8221; for EU fines.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.218.0/4">The LGA urges that the policy be scrapped, and continues:</p>
	<p pid="c.218.0/5">&#8220;In effect it means a Minister may simultaneously be prosecutor, judge, jury, and co-defendant, when Ministers themselves may actually be responsible for fines being levied. This is neither impartial nor localist.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.218.0/6">There are reasons why the Government are responsible for such fines perhaps being levied, but I want to address the confusion that seems to exist in Government. The Minister for the natural environment&#8212;the Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs&#8212;said in Committee in March that local authorities would not face what I describe as &#8220;bin taxes&#8221;, which are charges on local authorities and their residents for not reaching the EU&#8217;s 50% threshold. I asked him:</p>
	<p pid="c.218.0/7">&#8220;I want to press the Minister on EU fines for England and Wales on waste collection. Does he support the individual fining of authorities that do kerbside collection and that are struggling to reach 50%, as suggested by the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government?&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.218.0/8">The Minister replied:</p>
	<p pid="c.218.0/9">&#8220;I can tell the Committee that local authorities will not be fined individually for not achieving 50%. I can give that assurance&#8230;If we are failing, it will be lamentable&#8221;.&#8212;[<i>Official Report, Fourth Delegated Legislation Committee, </i><phrase class="date" code="2011-03-08">8 March 2011</phrase>; c. 9-10.]</p>
	<p pid="c.218.0/10">There seems to be a great deal of confusion between the Department for Communities and Local Government, and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs on this issue. To be honest, I would like the proposal scrapped, but we at least need some clarity on how to reach 50% recycling rates and avoid EU fines.</p>
	<p pid="c.218.0/11">The Bill does nothing to protect my constituents, particularly given that councils in east Lancashire have been hit extremely hard by DCLG cuts. Residents in my local authority, which was Conservative until last Thursday night&#8212;thankfully we now have a Labour authority&#8212;had achieved a 40% recycling rate, or just under. In effect, we are talking about a bin tax by any other name, and it is unfair. The message to the Minister this evening is that it is not the fault of the residents of Lancashire. The county council&#8217;s waste private finance initiative schemes would have resulted in a 90% recycling rate, but they were scrapped a few months ago. Up until a few</p>
	<p pid="c.218.0/12">months ago we had a strategy that would have enabled us to avoid EU fines, and we are talking about some of the most deprived communities in this country.</p>
	<p pid="c.218.0/13">There are also issues around recycling centres. If the Government will not invest in recycling centres, or if the spread of recycling centres across the country is disproportionate, that is not fair either, but that is a Government policy. It is not an EU policy; it is a policy that the Government will be answerable for. The LGA is quite correct to say that the Government will be held to account; indeed, this issue could end up in the courts.</p>
	<p pid="c.218.0/14">However, there is a second, more important reason why the scheme is not fair&#8212;a reason that I put to the Under-Secretary&#8212;and it concerns the difference between kerbside and co-mingled collections. Kerbside collection rates are around 30% to 40%, whereas co-mingled collections through recycling centres are hitting 80%, 90% and beyond. Local authorities in areas with co-mingled recycling will have high collection rates, but they will also have problems with contamination, which I accept. The Government are trying to encourage people not to co-mingle, but to separate. However, collection rates in areas with kerbside collections are much lower, so EU fines are unfair.</p>

	<p pid="c.219.0/1">I do not want to stop the hon. Gentleman in his tracks, but I think that I can reassure him. He is operating on completely the wrong premise. There is no suggestion at all that a fine would be levied on an authority because of its performance on recycling rates. The only suggestion is that if the authority does not adopt a plan as required&#8212;that is, something specifically required of that authority&#8212;and if it has been warned that it needs to have one, that will be the occasion for a fine. That authority&#8217;s performance is completely irrelevant, whatever it might be. I hope that that will reassure the hon. Gentleman and allow him to return to the issue at hand.</p>

	<p pid="c.219.1/1">I thank the Minister for that, because he is essentially saying that he has just ripped up his own new clause, which now has no teeth&#8212;he has just taken them all out. If local authorities are to come up with a plan, they will come up with one and carry on recycling at 30%. However, the Minister is not going to say to local authorities, &#8220;Well, actually, because you&#8217;ve got a plan, we&#8217;re going to do something about it.&#8221; Instead, he will be saying, &#8220;You&#8217;ve got a plan, so we&#8217;re going to do nothing about it.&#8221; He has taken all the teeth out of his own new clause, so why has he proposed it?

	<p pid="c.220.3/2">My new clause 8 would allow local authorities to vary Sunday trading hours in their areas. As hon. Members will know, under the Sunday Trading Act 1994, large shops over 280 square metres may open for only six continuous hours between 10 am and 6 pm on Sundays, excluding Easter Sunday, when they must remain closed. I think that this is rather anachronistic. Sunday trading is increasingly popular. I have no interest to declare, but I do have some experience to declare, as somebody who worked for Asda for 13 years. In my time there, Sunday trading hours were the busiest hours of the trading week. Contrary to common belief, Sunday trading hours were also the most popular hours that members of staff wished to work, because for many people Sunday was one of the few days on which they could do additional hours, as they had other people at home looking after their children and so on. If people want to shop on a Sunday or work for certain hours, I do not really see what business the Government have telling them what hours they can do.</p>
	<p pid="c.220.3/3">Members may be aware that Scotland has a different regime. Sunday trading is fully deregulated in Scotland, although, under the Sunday Working (Scotland) Act 2003, workers have the right to refuse to work on Sundays. I am not aware that the whole world has collapsed in Scotland as a result of deregulating Sunday trading hours. In fact, my experience is that it has proved to be incredibly popular with both customers and workers alike. I would like workers and shoppers in England and Wales to have exactly the same rights to shop or work in shops at a time of their choosing as people in Scotland have.</p>
	<p pid="c.220.3/4">My new clause 8 would not give local authorities the opportunity simply to extend Sunday trading hours, because I believe in true localism. My new clause also offers local authorities the opportunity to restrict Sunday trading hours further, if they so wish. If we believe that decisions should be taken locally, we should give local authorities the widest possible ability to make decisions to suit their areas. In areas that need extra regeneration, the opportunity to open for extra hours on a Sunday</p>
	<p pid="c.220.3/5">might be welcome, as it may benefit the local authorities in such areas. I do not see why the Government should stand in those authorities&#8217; way if they believe that to be an important part of their regeneration strategy. Other local authorities may wish to restrict Sunday trading hours. I would not advise them to do so&#8212;I do not think it would be very popular&#8212;but that would be up to them, as democratically elected local authorities. So I hope that the Minister will explain whether he agrees with my proposed extension of the principle of localism. If he does not agree, will he tell me what on earth his objection is to extending a right to the people of England that the people of Scotland already have?</p>
	<p pid="c.220.3/6">My other amendment is amendment 15, which relates to elected mayors. I fully support the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40149" name="John Stevenson">the Member for Carlisle (John Stevenson)</phrase> which proposes that such elections should be run on the first-past-the-post basis. I ought to declare a slight interest, in that my father is the elected mayor of Doncaster. He was elected under the system described by my hon. Friend, and he would not have been elected under first past the post, because he came second in the first ballot. Some might argue that my views are rather altruistic, in that I do not support a system that has benefited my dad; instead, I want to do what I think is genuinely the right thing for the country. Others might argue that my father being elected under the alternative or supplementary vote system could well be the best possible argument for first past the post. I would not like to comment on that; I will leave it to others to make that decision.</p>

	<p pid="c.221.1/1">I want to press on, because the Government have allocated a shameful amount of time for this debate and other people want to speak.</p>
	<p pid="c.221.1/2">I support first past the post, even though my father would have been disadvantaged by it. My amendment 15 proposes that there should be a two-thirds reduction in the number of councillors in local authority areas that have an elected mayor. There are already far too many local councillors; Bradford has 90, for example. The US Senate has only 100 people in it, for goodness&#8217; sake. Why do we need 90 councillors in Bradford? If we are to have an elected mayor as well, why on earth should we have an additional layer of bureaucracy, more expense and more levels of local politicians? If we are going to have an elected mayor, for goodness&#8217; sake let us reduce the number of local councillors at the same time and save the council tax payer some money. I hope that the Government will accept my rather modest amendments, but if they do not, I will certainly be interested to hear their reasons.</p>

	<p pid="c.221.2/1">I entirely endorse what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40531" name="Philip Davies">the hon. Member for Shipley (Philip Davies)</phrase> said about first past the post. I am not a supporter of elected mayors but, if we have to have them, they should be elected by the first-past-the-post system. He is absolutely right.</p>
	<p pid="c.221.2/2">I rise briefly to speak to my amendments 353 to 357, which would delete clauses 30 to 34. The clauses relate to fines to be imposed by the European Union. I find</p>
	<p pid="c.221.2/3">the whole idea of such fines complete anathema&#8212;[Hon. Members: &#8220;Hear, hear!&#8221;] I thought that I might get some support in the Chamber on that point. We could quite easily leave out all reference to the EU, and I would like to see that happen.</p>
	<p pid="c.221.2/4">I note that the Minister, in introducing the new clause, said that he had already had discussions with the Local Government Association. The LGA is very concerned about this issue, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40327" name="Graham Jones">the Member for Hyndburn (Graham Jones)</phrase> rightly said. I hope that the Government will think again and simply delete any reference to the EU. Rather than giving freedoms to local authorities, their proposals will put an imposition on them. They would place more central control on them, rather than leaving them to their own devices and giving them more freedoms.</p>
	<p pid="c.221.2/5">I hope the Minister will think about this and that the Government see fit, during the later stages of the Bill, to delete any reference to the EU. I strongly support the LGA&#8217;s view, which was ably set out by my hon. Friend, and I hope that the Minister will give this matter some thought. I shall not press my amendments to a Division, but I hope that he will bear in mind my feelings and those of many other Members.</p>

	<p pid="c.222.0/1">I am grateful for this opportunity to place my views, with which those hon. Members who served on the Public Bill Committee will already be familiar, on the record, and I apologise for any repetition. I fully support amendment 41; indeed, there are many amendments that I could support, and many more that I would like to have seen that no one else would have supported. I feel strongly about this one, however. It relates to elected mayors and shadow mayors, and to the executive powers of the mayors. Amendment 41 deals with something that symbolises everything that is wrong with the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="c.222.0/2">There is nothing worse than waste, and there is nothing worse than a wasted opportunity. The Bill is a colossal wasted opportunity for the House to consider the relationship between central and local government. We have profoundly let down the democratic system by not reviewing that relationship. We could have looked at what other countries do, and agreed some basic principles against which any measures relating to local authorities could have been evaluated. I agree with Professor Stewart and Professor Jones, who gave evidence to the Bill Committee, that this is a centralism Bill, rather than a localism Bill. How different it could have been if the will had been there to make it so.</p>
	<p pid="c.222.0/3">Opposition Members will no doubt be delighted to learn that, in my local authority, the Lib Dems lost a seat to Labour. We lost it in an election in which nearly seven out of 10 electors did not turn out to vote. At a time when politics is divided, and when big issues are dividing the nation, we again need to ask profound questions about why people are so reluctant to turn out and vote. We need to ask questions about the quality of the candidates, as well as about the turnout. We also need to ask what the measures in the Bill will do to address the serious democratic deficit in this country. We know the reasons behind the problem. We know that, when we knock on the doors, people say that we are all the same. The reality is that that is largely true. It is hard to be different in local government. The discretion and freedom to be different have disappeared, year by year, Government by Government.</p>
	<p pid="c.222.0/4">In Committee, I mentioned local authority budgets. Bradford has a budget of more than &#163;1 billion, yet we end up discussing only &#163;1 million or &#163;2 million. Local politicians expend a lot of hot air disputing those amounts, while the vast majority of the budget is beyond their control. Yes, we are largely all the same. The Bill could have removed barriers and restrictions. I do not understand why, when we are desperate to remove barriers to the private sector to encourage initiative, entrepreneurship, enterprise and freedoms, we do not do the same thing at local government level. Those barriers will remain after the Bill has been passed.</p>
	<p pid="c.222.0/5">The Government are still overbearing, arrogant and interfering. They are still ruling by stipulation, by compulsion and by bribery. They provide handouts that local government can spend, but on one thing only. How many times have Members who were formerly councillors known that the only show in town involved doing whatever the Government were funding? They were not given the discretion to spend that money as they wished. The funding would go only to the private finance initiatives or to academies, for example. We, as locally elected councillors, were not given the money and asked how we would like to spend it. Remember the bribery involved in the swimming campaign and the free school meals? The initiatives lasted for one year only, and we had to pick up the tab the year after. They were introduced simply to facilitate ministerial press releases.</p>
	<p pid="c.222.0/6">None of this will be changed by the Bill. Councillors are used and abused. The Treasury insists on controlling the finance, and without financial freedom, there is no democratic freedom. The low opinion of local government held by people in this place staggers me; I am appalled by it. An example is the outrageous front-loading of the cuts. Instead of local government being seen as a partner to help us through the financial crisis by contributing to the deficit reduction over a period of time and being asked for help to deal with it, the cuts have been imposed on it from above by a Government who claim to support localism.</p>
	<p pid="c.222.0/7">I support amendment 41. My views on elected mayors are, quite frankly, my business and they should be expressed in a ballot if my council decides that that is what it wants to do. I will participate in that debate&#8212;not in this place, but where it should take place: in council chambers up and down the country. Yes, we should set parameters and controls; yes, we should demand disclosure, which was mentioned earlier; but for goodness&#8217; sake, let us breathe life back into a vital part of our democratic system.</p>

	<p pid="c.223.2/1">I am conscious that many hon. Members wish to speak, so I shall limit my comments to a few. I applaud the hon. Member for Bradford East</p>
	<p pid="c.223.2/2">(Mr Ward) for his speech. I did not anticipate hearing comments like that from the Government side of the Chamber, but he is a man who says it as it is, and I respect his views and the way he put them.</p>
	<p pid="c.223.2/3">I shall focus on two aspects of this group of new clauses and amendments: senior pay policy, dealt with in new clauses 27 and 28, and powers to make supplemental provision, as set out in amendment 37 to clause 5. Bringing transparency to senior council pay is entirely right. I accept that some people might have been paid excessively in some circumstances, but this constant bashing of chief executives and senior council officers by Ministers does a complete disservice to people who do an incredibly difficult job in councils up and down the country. Some of these people will have worked their whole lives in local authorities; others might have left good private sector jobs to work there.</p>

	<p pid="c.224.0/1">The hon. Lady is adopting a strange position in defending the massive increase in pay at the top of the public sector. Does she accept that her Government could have done something about transparency? When she talks about a disservice, is not the real disservice to the electors of our communities who have to pay the bills for these people who have earned incredible amounts of money over the last few years?</p>

	<p pid="c.224.1/1">I am not sure that the hon. Gentleman was listening. I said that I accepted pay transparency is a good thing at both the top and the bottom of an organisation. I accept that the previous Government could have brought forward measures to insist on pay transparency and I know that some local authorities were transparent. Many have independent remuneration panels that would take decisions about councillor pay. I know that my own local authority is certainly looking at having an independent panel to review executive pay. My point is that we should shine a light on abuses, but that this constant barrage is disproportionate.</p>
	<p pid="c.224.1/2">These measures are, in my view, all about the Secretary of State getting a headline. Listening to him, anyone could be forgiven for thinking that if only 600-odd council chief executives were paid less, the national budget deficit would be dealt with. It will not. This is a complete red herring. Let us take the example of my local authority of Lewisham. The council&#8217;s overall pay bill is &#163;280 million, which pays for thousands of staff. The top 32 jobs of senior management account for &#163;4.1 million; the five executive directors and the chief executive cost the council in the region of &#163;1 million. Yes, &#163;1 million is a huge amount of money, but we have to take account of these individuals&#8217; responsibilities and the repercussions they might face if they gave bad advice, took bad decisions or implemented bad management. When politicians make a bad decision, they might lose an election, but council officers doing the same could end up in prison.</p>

	<p pid="c.225.0/1">I have no experience of that happening. I would be interested to speak to the hon. Gentleman after the debate to learn more about his experience.</p>
	<p pid="c.225.0/2">What puzzles me most about this Government&#8217;s obsession with senior pay is that it comes at a time when they seem spectacularly unwilling to tackle excessive pay in the private sector. I represent a London constituency and I know that there are bankers, lawyers and accountants who, within five or six years of graduating from university, will be earning &#163;60,000, &#163;70,000 or &#163;80,000 a year. That is not far off the wage of a head of children&#8217;s services. I ask whether it can be right to put all the focus on senior council pay.</p>
	<p pid="c.225.0/3">I agree with the amendments tabled by Opposition Front Benchers that deal with bringing transparency to low pay. Lewisham is an authority that has led the way on implementing the London living wage. As a result of its London living wage policy, 800 contracted staff are better off from the council&#8217;s insistence on seeking invitations from contractors that put in a London living wage bid as well as a regular bid. I am proud of the work that the authority has done on that and I believe that there are ways of encouraging the public sector and local councils to do the same.</p>
	<p pid="c.225.0/4">I had wanted to comment on amendment 37, but I am conscious of the time. It is strange how the Government are, drip by drip, telling us which duties they wish to protect&#8212;whether it be duties to provide a comprehensive and efficient library service under the Public Libraries and Museums Act 1964, or to provide allotments or whatever. Why did the Government not do this work before they put out their review of burdensome regulations? A couple of weeks ago, the Select Committee on Communities and Local Government heard the Minister for Housing and Local Government talk about the Department&#8217;s decisive leadership in abolishing the Audit Commission. I would urge the Government to show some leadership in saying which of the &#8220;burdens&#8221; they value and want to see protected. It seems to be one rule for one thing and a completely different rule for something else. I think it is sloppy and poor government&#8212;sadly, I think many of the Bill&#8217;s provisions are an example of poor government. I look forward to voting against some clauses and in favour of some amendments when we get the chance.</p>

	<p pid="c.225.1/1">We have so little time that I am going to cut straight to the chase; I hope not to take more than a minute or two.</p>
	<p pid="c.225.1/2">I speak in favour of new clause 10, which I tabled and which is supported by Members from both sides of the House. It concerns the recall of councillors. I view this as a simple, obvious, &#8220;no brainer&#8221; idea, which I hope will be met with a nod of approval by both Front-Bench teams. I will briefly make the case for it.</p>
	<p pid="c.225.1/3">As Members know, the Government are planning to introduce a recall mechanism for parliamentarians, whereby Members face being removed from office if their constituents so choose. The plans, in my view, do not go nearly far enough. MPs will be subject to recall only if a Committee decides that they have committed an act of serious wrongdoing. Recall is supposed to be about empowering people, not parliamentary Committees, so I shall seek to amend that provision when I have a</p>
	<p pid="c.225.1/4">chance. In the meantime, I was pleased that the Secretary of State promised to consider introducing into this Bill a recall mechanism for councillors. That has not happened, so I have done it for him.</p>
	<p pid="c.225.1/5">I am fortunate in that my constituency is served by some excellent councillors, but we all know that there are some councillors who do very little for their constituents, so there should surely be a mechanism whereby residents can hold councillors to account during the four years in between elections in the same way as employees are in every other field of human endeavour. It cannot be right to ask Members to vote for measures that will introduce recall for parliamentarians, but not for councillors in local government, which is just as important.</p>
	<p pid="c.225.1/6">My new clause would allow for</p>
	<p pid="c.225.1/7">&#8220;25% or more of the&#8230; voters in the constituency of an elected local government member&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.225.1/8">to petition for and trigger a recall election. I think that that strikes the right balance between preventing vexatious recall attempts and empowering local people to hold their elected councillors to account. The new clause would greatly empower local people and would keep councillors on their toes, and I hope that it can be put to the vote so that the House can support it.</p>

	<p pid="c.226.0/1">I wish to speak, very briefly, to amendments 365 and 366, which I tabled and which relate to standards.</p>
	<p pid="c.226.0/2">In his opening remarks on the programme motion, the Minister of State, Department for Communities and Local Government, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40617" name="Greg Clark">the right hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells (Greg Clark)</phrase>&#8212;who steered the Bill through its Committee stage&#8212;expressed a wish to listen to the views of people, whether they were members of the Committee, other interested parties, or people who had given evidence to the Committee. As he knows, an awful lot of people gave evidence, and many who gave evidence on standards gave very interesting evidence. Sadly, however, the Government did not listen to the evidence, including that given by the Committee on Standards in Public Life. The Government may be right in saying that there is a case for some streamlining of the standards procedure, and indeed I conceded that in Committee, but I am afraid that they are making a serious mistake in substituting for the existing machinery a framework that is incoherent, that is potentially extremely weak, and that will contain serious anomalies.</p>
	<p pid="c.226.0/3">Let us examine those three problems. First, clause 17 allows the Secretary of State to require local authorities to establish a procedure relating to the declaration of interests, a breach of which will involve a criminal liability. Clause 16 allows the establishment of an entirely voluntary framework within which it will be up to a local authority to decide whether to adopt a code of conduct. That could lead to an extraordinary situation. Someone who had failed, perhaps owing to a technicality, to declare an interest as part of the mandatory requirement imposed by Government would be liable for a criminal action, whereas someone who had behaved in a deplorable way&#8212;who had bullied people, been dishonest, or behaved shamelessly in the council chamber&#8212;could emerge scot-free because the council concerned had chosen not to adopt a code of conduct. That is clearly unsatisfactory.</p>
	<p pid="c.226.0/4">Secondly, there will be no code of conduct promoted by Government, like the model code that has existed in the past, that could serve as the default in the event of a local authority&#8217;s failure to adopt its own code.</p>
	<p pid="c.226.0/5">Thirdly, there is a serious risk that, under clause 16(2), a local authority that currently has a code of conduct could</p>
	<p pid="c.226.0/6">&#8220;withdraw its existing code of conduct without replacing it.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.226.0/7">Ministers claimed that they would leave this to local government&#8212;that they would do the right thing. At a time when we are all concerned about standards in public life, whether at national or local government level, it is extraordinary that they should produce a half-baked proposal which has not been thought through, which allows loopholes and anomalies to exist, and which&#8212;most seriously&#8212;undermines the substantial progress that has been made in recent years in improving those standards.</p>
	<p pid="c.226.0/8">Although Ministers appear unwilling to accept the case for amendments in the House of Commons, I sincerely hope that Members in another place with real experience of these matters will press amendments to ensure that there is a more coherent, more satisfactory and more demanding framework to maintain standards in public life.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-17c.227.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40119" speakername="Andrew Percy" colnum="227"  time="019:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110517/debtext/110517-0003.htm#11051759000619">
	<p pid="c.227.0/1">I served as a local councillor for 10 years under the previous standards regime, which was an abuse of and an assault on local democracy. As long as councillors do not break any criminal law, it is for the public who elected them to judge their behaviour. I was once referred to the standards board by a political activist for having dared to be a school teacher. The process wasted public money, because someone had to investigate, only to find it was all a load of old guff. It was a politically motivated referral, and there were countless examples of the same thing in my council chamber. Members on all sides reported each other for everything. That is a load of old nonsense, and the sooner it goes the better.</p>
	<p pid="c.227.0/2">As for pay policy, I cannot support the amendments tabled by the shadow Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40673" name="Barbara Keeley">the hon. Member for Worsley and Eccles South (Barbara Keeley)</phrase>. It is incredible that the Opposition should advance such proposals, having done what they have done to public sector pay at the top. I recall that when the Labour authority in Hull was seen as a failing council&#8212;I believe that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40287" name="Nick Raynsford">the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr Raynsford)</phrase> was a Minister at the time&#8212;we were inspected by officials who told us that we must pay our senior staff more. We ended up with five corporate directors on outrageous salaries of &#163;105,000 a year. <i>[Interruption.] </i>It is true: I was there at the time. We saw a massive explosion in pay. The suggestion that we should take lessons from the Opposition on the subject takes some swallowing.</p>
	<p pid="c.227.0/3">I do, however, agree that there should be more transparency in regard to private contractors who work for local authorities. My local council, which was Labour-controlled until two weeks ago but is now Conservative-controlled, has spent &#163;3 million on consultants in the last year, and spent millions of pounds in the preceding years. There should be more openness about how money is spent and how much people in the private sector are making. There is a good point behind the proposal, although, as I have said, it takes a little bit of swallowing given that the last Government presided over the pay explosion at the top.</p>
	<p pid="c.227.0/4">Having made those few comments, I will yield to other Members who, I am sure, are keen to make their own contributions.</p>

	<p pid="c.228.0/1">Let me first say how ably my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40149" name="John Stevenson">the Member for Carlisle (John Stevenson)</phrase> spoke to amendment 2, which concerns the first-past-the-post system for electing mayors. I shall certainly support him in the Lobby if he presses it to a vote.</p>
	<p pid="c.228.0/2">The Government are clearly in favour of the principle of elected mayors, given that they propose to allow 12 of them in the Bill. What I want to know is why they are making it so difficult for local authorities to initiate the process. Local authorities will rarely, if ever, vote for a referendum on the election of mayors. Because of the cosy relationship that often exists between councillors, they view elected mayors as a threat. However, elected mayors can provide leadership and transparency and revitalise local democracy, and we should do all that we can to encourage them. My amendment 1 would reduce the threshold of the electorate who can petition for an elected mayor from 5% to 2.5%. I hope that the Government will see the wisdom of my proposal, and will support it.</p>

	<p pid="c.228.1/1">I want to comment briefly on three of the amendments that have been discussed so far.</p>
	<p pid="c.228.1/2">I have a huge amount of sympathy for the arguments advanced by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40500" name="Zac Goldsmith">the Member for Richmond Park (Zac Goldsmith)</phrase> about a recall procedure for councillors, but, although I hope that the Government will reflect on the points that have been made and that such a procedure will be introduced eventually, I think it would be inappropriate for the House to introduce it before introducing a similar procedure for Members of Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="c.228.1/3">I found it incredible that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40673" name="Barbara Keeley">the hon. Member for Worsley and Eccles South (Barbara Keeley)</phrase>&#8212;who would not take an intervention&#8212;should criticise the Government for forcing referendums on the governance structure of local authorities, given that the Government whom she supported forced virtually every council in the country to adopt executive systems of governance with no recourse to referendums.</p>
	<p pid="c.228.1/4">Finally&#8212;I am conscious of the time&#8212;I strongly support the new clause about Sunday trading that was tabled by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40531" name="Philip Davies">the Member for Shipley (Philip Davies)</phrase>. He and I do not agree on many issues, but we agreed on two today, sentencing and Sunday trading. I also had a lot of sympathy with the point made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40149" name="John Stevenson">the Member for Carlisle (John Stevenson)</phrase> about first past the post. He spoke of the need for consistency, but his amendment would introduce a big inconsistency between the Mayor of London and other elected mayors. The Government should consider that issue in the context of the results of the referendum.</p>

	<p pid="c.261.0/1">It is a pleasure to be debating planning issues again. I am sorry that that is occasioning an exodus from the Chamber, as I think it is one of the most fascinating parts of the Bill. I cannot promise to emulate the winding-up speech of the Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40307" name="Andrew Stunell">the Member for Hazel Grove (Andrew Stunell)</phrase> who, in 30 seconds, gave the finest speech that I have ever heard him give, but I will endeavour to reach those high standards.</p>
	<p pid="c.261.0/2">I am delighted to see <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40081" name="Jack Dromey">the hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Jack Dromey)</phrase> in his place to respond. Those of us who served on the Bill Committee have missed our daily dose of historical education and elucidation, and I dare say that Members who were not on the Committee are in for a treat tonight.</p>
	<p pid="c.261.0/3">We have a large group of amendments to discuss and so as to avoid the fate of my hon. Friend, I will try to say something about as many as possible of them in my opening remarks so that it may not be necessary to expand at length later in the debate. We made good progress in Committee on this part of the Bill. There was a shared understanding that there were problems with the planning system that have grown up over time, which the Bill provides an opportunity to address. It is not a matter of party political contention that the persistently observed problems with the planning system centre around the fact that over recent years it has been too top-down. People have felt that planning is something that has been done to them, rather than something in which they have had a say or which they have had a chance to influence.</p>
	<p pid="c.261.0/4">There is something about the British people which means that if they feel imposed upon, bullied and hustled, they will kick out against that and use every means at their disposal to frustrate it. That has led to what all of us as Members of Parliament have seen over recent years&#8212;a rising sense of antipathy to the planning process, often leading to quite emotional exchanges and people feeling very bruised about the system under which they operate. The purpose of the Bill is to remove some of that top-down imposition and provide greater opportunities for communities to have their say.</p>
	<p pid="c.261.0/5">The second observation that most people share is that too often when developments take place in communities, there is inadequate provision for infrastructure and inadequate attention to accommodating the development that takes place. Again, that leads local people to be more inclined to oppose a development because they are fearful that their community will not have the capacity to resolve some of the difficulties that development will bring.</p>
	<p pid="c.261.0/6">The Bill attempts to address both those concerns. Among its headline measures, it replaces the regional arrangements that have been in place for some years and introduces instead a duty to co-operate that brings local authorities together in a more natural way. Rather than giving an administrative solution to some of the problems, it allows people to collaborate, discuss and come to resolutions of larger than local issues. It strengthens the requirements for pre-application scrutiny, introduces neighbourhood planning, abolishes the Infrastructure Planning Commission and returns powers ultimately to Ministers through a major infrastructure planning unit.</p>

	<p pid="c.262.0/1">On the abolition of everything that is regional, which is clearly Government policy and has been for some time, the Minister has just indicated that the duty to co-operate was the central plank that would replace on some sort of strategic basis the regional dimension. With hindsight, does he think the Government gave enough attention and thought to how the duty to co-operate should be formulated and how it should work in practice? There seems to have been an awful lot of criticism from everybody with an interest in these matters about the Government&#8217;s position in the Bill.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-17c.262.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40617" speakername="Greg Clark" colnum="262"  time="020:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110517/debtext/110517-0004.htm#11051770000162">
	<p pid="c.262.1/1">I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s remarks. I know that as Chairman of the Communities and Local Government Committee, he has taken a great interest in these matters. I have always been clear that the Bill represents a major change and it behoves any Minister from whatever party to listen to representations and to seek to improve what is a different way of solving a classic problem&#8212;planning issues that have a larger than local dimension to them. The previous Government attempted a resolution through regional arrangements. We formed a view, for better or for worse. Some of us on the Government Benches thought that those arrangements should not have been entered into in the first place. Those on the Opposition Benches would reflect, I think, that the arrangements have had their day and should be replaced with a means of addressing larger than local issues that is robust and captures the need for strategic planning. I will go straight to the amendments that relate to that&#8212;Government amendments 144 to 158&#8212;and say something about the Opposition&#8217;s amendments as I do so.</p>
	<p pid="c.262.1/2">We accepted that there was an opportunity to strengthen the duty to co-operate that was set out in the Bill as originally drafted. Indeed, I perhaps agree that a minimalist view was taken of that duty. We have replaced it with something that enjoys support from a wide range of groups, having reached a form that they endorse as a useful resolution to some of these matters. I pay tribute to the effort and work that many groups outside the House have put into strengthening the duty to co-operate. It would be churlish not to pay tribute to the hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington, who approached these matters in a similar vein; the amendments tabled by the Opposition in Committee provided a basis on which to discuss these matters and to make progress.</p>
	<p pid="c.262.1/3">The duty to co-operate will be significantly strengthened by the amendments that we, as promised, have brought forward. They are modelled closely on what we said was appropriate in Committee and what the Royal Town Planning Institute has proposed. As the professional planning body, it was the organisation that worked most closely on this, but a wide range of other outside bodies were involved, including the Wildlife and Countryside Link coalition, which includes the WWF, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and the Town and Country Planning Association. In particular, we have taken up their suggestions, which were echoed in some of the amendments tabled by the Opposition in Committee, to make clearer the application to cross-boundary issues and to the marine planning system, which needs to be addressed. We have also taken input from the Planning Officers Society, whose members will be charged with meeting the duty to co-operate. As a result of its suggestion, our amendment proposes to put</p>
	<p pid="c.262.1/4">a reference to county councils on to the face of the Bill. That deals with one of the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s amendments that he will no doubt talk to shortly.</p>
	<p pid="c.262.1/5">The combined effect has been to create a much stronger duty to co-operate that covers all authorities and a proposed list of prescribed bodies that themselves would be subject to that duty, because planning matters clearly concern not only local authorities, but other public bodies. I know from speaking with councils up and down the country that one of the frustrations is that they sometimes feel that they have not had the full and enthusiastic co-operation of other public bodies in producing plans that are clearly relevant to them.</p>
	<p pid="c.262.1/6">I have placed in the Library of the House our draft list of bodies to be included in addition to local authorities. They include the Environment Agency, the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission, Natural England, the Mayor of London, the Civil Aviation Authority, the Homes and Communities Agency, primary care trusts, the Marine Management Organisation, the Office of Rail Regulation, the Highways Agency, Transport for London, integrated transport authorities and highways authorities. I think that it is absolutely right that those public bodies should be required to give every co-operation to local authorities in producing strategic plans that are larger than local plans for their area.</p>
	<p pid="c.262.1/7">We also propose in these amendments an enabling power that will require all bodies that are subject to the duty to co-operate to have regard to the activities of other bodies when preparing plans that may not have a public character. Foremost among these are local enterprise partnerships. We intend to identify local enterprise partnerships as bodies that the prescribed bodies with the duty to co-operate must take into account and with which they will need to co-operate fully.</p>
	<p pid="c.262.1/8">The duty to co-operate applies to the preparation of all development plan documents and, in particular, it requires engagement to maximise effectiveness. This cannot be a minimal engagement that simply responds to a questionnaire, which it was feared the original formulation might lead to. There must be active engagement to maximise the effectiveness of all relevant development plan documents. It applies to all strategic issues, which will be interpreted as issues that cross at least two local authority planning areas. It refers to sustainable development, because we know that the environment, in particular, does not stop at local authority boundaries and continues way beyond them, so it is absolutely right that there should be a requirement to co-operate on that. Infrastructure requirements typically go beyond local authority boundaries as well. It requires consideration to be given to the preparation of joint plans and development documents. In particular, I hope and expect that local enterprise partnerships will use their planning powers to pool some of their policies relating to the development of the economy so that they will have attractive, appealing and clear pro-growth policies, especially in areas where there is a need to attract new employers.</p>
	<p pid="c.262.1/9">The crucial test of the duty to co-operate is the soundness of the plan. If the inspector finds that the duty has not been complied with, the plan will be unsound and cannot be adopted. Therefore, there is an absolute safeguard that this is not just a voluntary activity, but that it is absolutely at the heart of plan making, and rightly so, because the strategic level is very important to emphasise.</p>
	<p pid="c.262.1/10">The amendment, which is the product of extensive consultation with the professional bodies and some of the other representative bodies, anticipates and deals with many of the amendments that Opposition Front Benchers might be minded to move. If I have time at the end of our considerations on this group, I will respond to the remarks of the hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington. In particular, amendment 293 deals with the inclusion of county councils, and that is covered by our amendments. He will have heard me mention integrated transport authorities and the marine planning organisations in the list of prescribed organisations that I intend to publish. Sustainable development is very clearly marked there and is explicitly referenced, as are local transport plans and marine plans.</p>
	<p pid="c.262.1/11">On this new clause, I can do no better than quote the briefing on that which the Royal Town Planning Institute made available to Members:</p>
	<p pid="c.262.1/12">&#8220;The RTPI has worked closely with the Government on strengthening the arrangements for planning at the larger than local level and believes that the amended Clause 90 should be supported.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.262.1/13">It states that the Government are</p>
	<p pid="c.262.1/14">&#8220;to be congratulated for listening on this issue.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.262.1/15">I hope that we have been able to discharge the commitments that I made in Committee to establish a replacement for the regional arrangements that is rather more robust than the original version.</p>
	<p pid="c.262.1/16">Let me turn to some of the other new clauses and amendments tabled by hon. Members. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40582" name="Joan Walley">The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent North (Joan Walley)</phrase>, who chairs the Environmental Audit Committee, has asked that at this stage we consider the specific question of whether a definition of sustainable development should be included in the Bill. New clause 2 has been tabled by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40395" name="Annette Brooke">the Member for Mid Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke)</phrase> and her colleagues, and those on the Opposition Front Bench have tabled some amendments relating to this matter. I will give an indication of the approach I would like to take on this, because it is an area that, as many Members know, is close to by heart. I completely agree that the purpose of planning is to promote sustainable development and that all plans and decisions should reflect that.</p>
	<p pid="c.262.1/17">New clause 2 captures where we should be, and I certainly undertake to give my hon. Friend the Member for Mid Dorset and North Poole most of what she seeks. As was always intended, we will bring out a draft national planning policy framework in July, which will have sustainable development at its heart. It will set out what we mean by sustainable development.</p>

Friend anticipates the detail of the national policy planning framework, but at this stage all I would say on sustainable development is that the Government have no issue or disagreement with the classic definitions of it. The Brundtland definition, that development undertaken by this generation should not compromise the ability of future generations to live their lives, has stood the test of time and is very clear. Although I am foreshadowing the content of the</p>
	<p pid="c.264.1/2">framework, I want to give a clear signal to my hon. Friend and to all hon. Members that we intend to follow that approach.</p>

	<p pid="c.265.0/1">This is a little like having the winding-up speeches before the debate has started, but, in anticipation that there might not be much time to set out the arguments for sustainable development, may I ask the Minister, given what he has said, whether he agrees that there is no substitute for writing sustainable development into legislation? Here we are, yet we do not have the details of the statement that will come out next week or later, so how can we ensure that sustainable development is written into the legislation? Is not that the most important aspect of this exercise?</p>

	<p pid="c.265.1/1">I understand the hon. Lady&#8217;s point, but I hope she accepts that we have stated clearly that we are very comfortable with the classic definition of sustainable development, which will be prominent&#8212;in fact, it could not be more prominent&#8212;in the planning policy framework. She has no grounds for concern. Her Committee asked for an assurance that sustainable development would continue to be part of planning policy, and I take that point.</p>

	<p pid="c.265.2/1">I wish to return to the point that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40188" name="Henry Smith">the Member for Crawley (Henry Smith)</phrase> made about places of worship. From my discussions with the Minister, I know that he has spoken warm words, but will he use this opportunity to place on the record his broad thinking about how places of worship can be accounted for in planning policy?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-17c.265.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40617" speakername="Greg Clark" colnum="265"  time="020:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110517/debtext/110517-0004.htm#11051770000168">
	<p pid="c.265.3/1">I will resist the temptation to stray from the proposed changes before us. There are amendments that deal in particular with sustainable development, but I say in passing that the opportunity for communities to have and to promote places of worship is a reflection of their sense of community, and we would be wholly in opposition to the direction of the Bill if we had any intention of restricting that&#8212;quite the reverse. I do not think that my hon. Friend has any cause for concern.</p>
	<p pid="c.265.3/2">The previous Government promoted the five principles of sustainable development&#8212;living within environmental means, ensuring a strong, healthy and just society, achieving a sustainable economy, promoting good governance and using sound science responsibly&#8212;in the sustainable strategy. I have no difficulty with that, and without going into too much detail I would expect those principles to be reflected in planning policy, where they always have been. That has been the place for them.</p>
	<p pid="c.265.3/3">The challenge from new clause 2&#8212;to require sustainable development to be put forward after a period&#8212;also carries an important virtue. The national planning policy framework will be subject to consultation, and it is quite right that we should give people the chance to see our definition&#8212;I have given a pretty broad steer as to what it will be&#8212;and to comment on it, rather than simply capturing something in the Bill now. I would be</p>
	<p pid="c.265.3/4">perfectly relaxed about doing so, but we should give people the chance to reflect on and to add to the definition.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-17c.266.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40582" speakername="Joan Walley" colnum="266"  time="020:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110517/debtext/110517-0004.htm#11051770000169">
	<p pid="c.266.0/1">I hear what the Minister says, but would it not have been more appropriate if we had had that public debate alongside a White Paper, when sustainable development could have been looked at across the range of planning policy, not just as part of the framework to be published shortly? We could have looked at that first, but instead we are considering things in the dark.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-17c.266.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40617" speakername="Greg Clark" colnum="266"  time="020:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110517/debtext/110517-0004.htm#11051770000170">
	<p pid="c.266.1/1">We are not quite in the dark. I hope that I have illuminated some of the dark, given what I have been able to say about the proposed contents of that White Paper. At the time of the Budget, I said that we would try to bring forward the definition a little earlier than the rest of the document, because I know that there is an interest in it. That will at least allow the other place to have the benefit of that thinking. If a greater token of good faith than my words at this Dispatch Box is required, it will appear quite shortly.</p>
	<p pid="c.266.1/2">I think hon. Members will be satisfied with our approach. I have long regarded the matter as a personal interest, having shadowed the energy and climate change brief in opposition, and there is nothing in our approach that does anything other than enhance matters. By clarifying, and taking away much of the undergrowth around, planning policy, it will make more resonant the principles that the hon. Lady, the hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington and my Liberal Democrat hon. Friends so rightly want to promote.</p>
	<p pid="c.266.1/3">Neighbourhood planning is another important addition to the Bill. I freely accept that the initial version of our clauses on this could have been improved, and I made commitments in Committee that we would reflect on improvements that could be made. The hon. Gentleman was particularly exercised, and indeed lyrical, about the opportunities to improve some of these provisions. He was dismayed that a neighbourhood forum in which these issues could be discussed was liable to take place in the saloon bar of the Dog and Duck, thinking that too intimate a space for such a gathering and suggesting that it should be larger. We have reflected on the size of public houses across the country, and we think we need to enable more people to attend the forums.</p>
	<p pid="c.266.1/4">There is no Dog and Duck in Birmingham, as far as I was able to establish, which is a great disappointment. There was a Dog and Duck in Holloway Head, which is perhaps an area of the city that he knows, but sadly it was demolished some time after 1899. I have brought in this very appealing photograph of the pub, which I will give to the hon. Gentleman so that next time he is in his city he can research its antecedence. I have to say that it does not look the most salubrious of establishments, but then I do not know what his taste is in public houses, and he might regret its disappearance. He may also be dismayed to hear that another public house demolished in Birmingham in recent years was the House That Jack Built. I am sure that that is a source of regret to everyone in Birmingham, but perhaps it is an opportunity for him.</p>

	<p pid="c.266.2/1">While my right hon. Friend&#8217;s comments are amusing, does he understand the frustration of many of us, including members of the all-party save the pub group, that even</p>
	<p pid="c.266.2/2">after this Bill has been passed, it will remain perfectly possible for people to demolish free-standing pubs without the community having any right to have a say?</p>

	<p pid="c.267.0/1">I understand my hon. Friend&#8217;s point. I will say a few words about that in moment, and I hope to give him some comfort. He is absolutely right that one of the types of building that communities value most, whether in towns or villages, is their local pub. The frustration they feel in seeing some of these buildings demolished without the opportunity to do anything about it is a source of great concern. The Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40127" name="Bob Neill">the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill)</phrase>, who snaffled very sharpish the title of &#8220;Pubs Minister&#8221; when the portfolios were being handed out just after the general election, takes a particular interest in this and has been meeting representatives of the Campaign for Real Ale, as has my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40356" name="Greg Mulholland">the Member for Leeds North West (Greg Mulholland)</phrase> and his group.</p>
	<p pid="c.267.0/2">For Members of the House who were not in Committee, I should explain that we asked a series of questions about neighbourhood planning. First, is it right for neighbourhoods below the local authority level to be able to promote a vision of their future? We agreed that it was. This is easily available to areas that have parish councils or town councils: a standing democratic body is available, so it is easy to give it such powers. The next question is whether areas that do not have parish councils or town councils should be excluded from the ability to have a neighbourhood plan. There is an argument that they can apply for parish status, so we can provide a little bait to attract them towards doing that. Those on both Front Benches reflected on this and agreed that if some parts of the country decided that they did not want a standing parish council or town council but nevertheless wanted a neighbourhood plan, they should not be denied that.</p>
	<p pid="c.267.0/3">How can we bring together people in those places in an acceptable way to discuss these matters? In the Bill, that question turns on neighbourhood forums. We agreed to increase, through amendments, the minimum number of members of a neighbourhood forum from three&#8212;the number at which it was rather unfeasibly set&#8212;to 21. Landlords across the country can now count on at least 21 customers being in their snug to discuss neighbourhood plans rather than the minimum of three. The hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington argued strongly that we should increase the number. We have gone a little beyond the number that he suggested, and that is absolutely right. Government amendment 160 makes that clear.</p>
	<p pid="c.267.0/4">Amendment 160 also makes it clear that businesses should be involved. Clearly, any conception of a neighbourhood&#8212;certainly one that includes a high street&#8212;must reflect the fact that sometimes the people who have the interests of the community most at heart and who most epitomise the community are those who run businesses, because they are at the heart of the community. The fact that someone runs a business in a town but lives elsewhere should not preclude them from participating in the neighbourhood forum. We are happy to reflect that point, which again was urged by the hon. Gentleman, in Government amendments.</p>

	<p pid="c.267.1/1">On amendment 160, will the Minister clarify what will be the balance between residents and businesses? The amendment could be read to mean that</p>
	<p pid="c.267.1/2">businesses alone could drive an agenda, which might not be compatible with what the residents want. I wonder whether the wording needs to be looked at again.</p>

	<p pid="c.268.0/1">Order. Before the Minister resumes, I clarify that he is not supposed to have his back continually to the Chair. He is supposed to address the whole House, not just the Members behind him. I hope that he will bear that in mind.</p>

	<p pid="c.268.1/1">Of course, Madam Deputy Speaker. I certainly intended no discourtesy to you or anyone else in the Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="c.268.1/2">We do not want to be too prescriptive in the rules for neighbourhood forums, because we want as many people to participate as possible. Nevertheless, we have specified the requirement in the examination that they should be open to all. Part of the test that the examiner will make is whether there are sufficient efforts to involve all sections of the community, including businesses and definitely residents. Various types of residents must also be included, because it is important that the whole community is represented. We have also clarified that councillors have a right to be involved in the neighbourhood forum, even if they do not reside in the ward that they represent, as is sometimes the case. I hope that Government amendments 161 and 162 cover the point made by the hon. Lady. If they need strengthening, we are happy to look at them again. I think that they make it clear that forums need to reflect the community and should not allow any narrow interests to dominate. That is one of the most important tests.</p>
	<p pid="c.268.1/3">Good points were made in Committee by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40363" name="Heidi Alexander">the hon. Member for Lewisham East (Heidi Alexander)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40287" name="Nick Raynsford">the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr Raynsford)</phrase> about cross-border arrangements. I recollect that they share a border in Blackheath. It is important that Blackheath is able to have a neighbourhood plan, and I very much hope that it will. Government amendments, in particular amendment 168, will make that possible, and will ensure that there will be only one plan for the area. It would be wrong for competitive plans for Blackheath to be promoted from the Lewisham side and the Greenwich side. It is important that they work together.</p>

	<p pid="c.268.3/1">If residents so desire, the provisions of a neighbourhood plan can designate spaces that residents want to keep as green space.</p>
	<p pid="c.268.3/2">The right hon. Gentleman said in Committee that it should be possible for the examiners of plans to be planning inspectors or local authority officers. We perhaps erred too much on the side of reassuring residents that they had the right to promote their plan in the face of a recalcitrant local authority, and therefore excluded local authority officers and planning inspectors from being involved. We actually found, to our delight, that there is a great deal of enthusiasm on the part of many local authorities. Where a community and its local authority can happily work together, its officers should not be excluded from being involved.</p>
	<p pid="c.268.3/3">We have also addressed, in Government amendments 171 and 172, the need for the development of neighbourhood plans to be properly funded, recognising that the capacity of communities varies from place to place. Those amendments give the Secretary of State the power to arrange for payments to be made in support of neighbourhood planning, or for services such as training to be provided.</p>

	<p pid="c.269.0/1">My right hon. Friend gives many words of encouragement to those of us who have tabled amendments.

They would like to be able to include that matter in their neighbourhood plans.</p>

	<p pid="c.269.1/1">I was going to come on to my hon. Friend&#8217;s amendments, but since he raises the matter I will turn to them now. I will have to disappoint him. Neighbourhood plans are conceived as being about issues that just affect neighbourhoods. Although mineral extraction has consequences for particular neighbourhoods, it is clearly larger than a local matter. It has consequences for the wider authority and, in many cases, for national Government. It is not right to expect neighbourhood plans to govern mineral extraction, which goes beyond their scope.</p>

	<p pid="c.269.2/1">The issue of open-cast coal mining is critical, particularly in former coal mining areas. If there is going to be a presumption in favour of mineral extraction instead of that being balanced with environmental considerations, that suggests that there will be no commitment whatever to sustainable development at the heart of planning policy. If people cannot prevent open-cast coal mining, or have their view of it taken on board, that will send out a strong message to them that they will not have any say in future developments in their locality.</p>

	<p pid="c.269.3/1">No, the hon. Lady has got it wrong. We are talking about neighbourhood planning, but of course a whole panoply of other planning policy applies. There is absolutely no intention to remove the test of sustainability for mineral extraction or any other proposal, and that will be a matter for national policy. I do not underestimate in any way the importance of open-cast mining for the communities in which it takes place, but neighbourhood plans are not the mechanism to control it. I hope most hon. Members will see that.</p>

	<p pid="c.269.5/1">I will make some progress, and then perhaps my hon. Friend can come in again. I know that a lot of Members want to speak.</p>
	<p pid="c.269.5/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40520" name="Nicholas Dakin">The hon. Member for Scunthorpe (Nic Dakin)</phrase>, who made many helpful and constructive suggestions in Committee, has tabled two amendments. We will require the examiner of plans to take oral evidence if people want to submit it, but we will leave him or her to make the judgment about whether that is an attempt to delay the process or reflects a genuine appetite. Similarly, his amendment 12 is unnecessary because the Bill already</p>
	<p pid="c.269.5/3">allows prescribed steps to be taken in the examination of a neighbourhood plan, including the consideration of questions about participation. However, we will carefully consider whether an equalities impact assessment is appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="c.269.5/4">On heritage issues, our amendments correct a misdrafting that seemed to put in doubt the protection that conservation areas and listed buildings receive in the neighbourhood planning process. That was never our intention. Happily, working with the heritage groups, we have been able to agree a set of measures that address that problem.</p>
	<p pid="c.269.5/5">I wish to say a little about town centres, because I know that an amendment on the subject has been tabled. Policy on town centres has always been part of national planning policy, and I believe that is right. However, as I have done on the subject of sustainable development, I wish to signal clearly the importance of having robust policy, including the sequential test that is currently in planning policy statement 4. That will absolutely be in place, and it will be clear in the new national planning policy framework.</p>
	<p pid="c.269.5/6">The Association of Convenience Stores wants, to its credit, to keep this issue live and in the forefront of our minds. I am happy that it does so, but it need have no concerns. This Government&#8217;s attitude to town centres is absolutely clear: they are at the heart of our communities and nothing should be done that would disadvantage them or jeopardise that.</p>
	<p pid="c.269.5/7">Government new clause 15 deals with local finance matters, which has caused the hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington and his colleagues some concern in recent days. The proposal makes it clear that local finance matters that are relevant to planning considerations can be taken into account. It does not change the law in any way, and it is not some stealthy way in which to introduce a new basis for planning policy. Everyone knows that section 106 payments that are material in planning matters can be taken into consideration. The new clause reflects the fact that the introduction of the community infrastructure levy, and, potentially, other rebates to the local community, as I like to call them, can be used for planning purposes. It is important to be clear, lest there is any doubt on the part of local authorities, that such rebates, just like under section 106, can be made when they are relevant to planning considerations.</p>
	<p pid="c.269.5/8">Amendment 369, which was tabled by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40072" name="Simon Hughes">the Member for Bermondsey and Old Southwark (Simon Hughes)</phrase>, suggests that CIL should be used more widely for housing and other local infrastructure. It is important that planning committees, which are sometimes nervous and conservative about such matters, are reassured that the use of the CIL for appropriate planning purposes is perfectly legitimate and that it can be taken into account in planning decisions.</p>

	<p pid="c.270.0/1">The Minister implies that there is no change in policy as a result of new clause 15, but may I remind him that until three months ago, his Department&#8217;s stance was that financial matters could not be regarded as material considerations? His Department&#8217;s response to the consultation on the new homes bonus scheme affirmed that the new homes bonus cannot change the position that financial matters are not to be regarded as material considerations. New clause 15 changes that</p>
	<p pid="c.270.0/2">completely, and changes the presumption that planning permission cannot be bought and sold, which has been in the planning system for years. That is an extremely dangerous move, and I am astonished that the Minister has come to it only after 35 minutes of his speech. He has dealt with a lot of detail, but he has not addressed the fundamental threat that new clause 15 poses to the integrity of the planning system.</p>

	<p pid="c.271.0/1">The right hon. Gentleman should be reassured that the measure is not a fundamental threat. Rather, it is an incidental measure for clarification. As he knows, section 106 payments have always been taken into account. There is no change in the policy whatever. He misquotes the response to the consultation on the new homes bonus, which is as valid today as it was when it was published. The response states that</p>
	<p pid="c.271.0/2">&#8220;the new Homes Bonus is not intended to encourage housing development which would otherwise be inappropriate in planning terms&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.271.0/3">and that local authorities</p>
	<p pid="c.271.0/4">&#8220;cannot take into account immaterial considerations.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.271.0/5">Therefore, local finance considerations, like any other considerations, should be taken into account only if they are material to the application that is being considered. Let me give an example to the right hon. Gentleman. Obviously, if it is perfectly appropriate for a payment made under a section 106 agreement to be taken into account by the planning authority, it would be perfectly reasonable for the CIL, for example, to be used to provide investment in a road scheme that accommodates a development. If a planning authority considers that to be material, it is perfectly reasonable to take it into account. The measure simply clarifies that if payments other than section 106 payments can be used for matters that are material to the application, it is legitimate to take them into account.</p>

	<p pid="c.271.1/1">The Minister will have to do better. He should consider whether he is being absolutely open with the House about the significance of the change. The existing presumption is that planning permission cannot be bought and sold, and that financial considerations are not material. He will know that section 106 agreements are negotiated only after planning consent has been granted. There should be no question about that. However, he is clearly muddying the waters&#8212;his language implies that&#8212;and by making a financial consideration a material consideration, he is undermining the planning system. I urge him to reconsider.</p>

	<p pid="c.271.2/1">The right hon. Gentleman is disappointed that this is not the cunning plot that he sensed it might be. It is a straightforward clarification, and he needs to accept that it is not what he thought it was. It is a simple and straightforward clarification brought about by the fact that it has been suggested in the press that some of these payments cannot be taken into account. It is important that councils understand that, where it is relevant to the planning matter in hand&#8212;but not otherwise&#8212;they can continue to take it into account. That is no different from the present situation, and it is important to clarify that.</p>

	<p pid="c.272.7/1">The hon. Gentleman has got the wrong end of the stick. It is not required that the planning application should be determined on the basis of the financial flow. It is relevant only if it relates to the planning matter before the authority. For example, if</p>
	<p pid="c.272.7/2">the community infrastructure levy is to be used to pay for an access road, it is perfectly reasonable&#8212;this is clarified in the new clause&#8212;for that to be taken into account by the local authority.</p>
	<p pid="c.272.7/3">I want to make some progress, because I have spoken for 45 minutes. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40569" name="Stephen Gilbert">the Member for St Austell and Newquay (Stephen Gilbert)</phrase> has tabled a new clause&#8212;new clause 4&#8212;that would introduce what he describes as a limited right of appeal for third parties against planning applications, just as he did in Committee. Let me make a few points about that. In the first place, I fear that the drafting of new clause 4 is technically defective. The drafting of proposed new section 78(2B)(c) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 would allow any overview and scrutiny committee anywhere in the country to appeal against planning permission granted by a wholly different authority. Clearly it is not his intention that his planning committee in Cornwall should appeal against a decision in Tunbridge Wells, so whatever happens, he needs to take that into account.</p>
	<p pid="c.272.7/4">The second point is that new clause 4 does not address&#8212;as it would need to if it were accepted&#8212;the crucial point of what happens in the meantime if planning permission is granted by a local council. Is that permission to be held in abeyance, awaiting a possible appeal, or can planning permission be implemented in the meantime? If a development goes ahead and there is a successful appeal, would that development need to be demolished? If work is started on a development that needs to be interrupted, is anyone liable for compensation if the permission is overturned on appeal? There are therefore a few technical deficiencies with new clause 4 that would need to be considered.</p>

	<p pid="c.273.0/1">I am grateful to the Minister for explaining the technical deficiencies in new clause 4 to me, and particularly for doing so at 9 o&#8217;clock this evening. However, aside from the technical deficiencies, what is the Government&#8217;s view of the principle? I can work on the robustness of the new clause if the Government can give me their view in principle.</p>

	<p pid="c.273.1/1">I will explain, although I will shortly draw my remarks to a conclusion, as I know that other Members want to speak. As my hon. Friend and all other members of the Committee know, my view is that we should move away from a system of planning by development control, where recourse is made to the Planning Inspectorate rather than local decision makers, which is how the future of our communities has been developed. I want fewer appeals to the Planning Inspectorate and more decided locally. Doing that means plan-making becoming a much more prominent part of the process. Neighbourhood plans and pre-application scrutiny&#8212;and, incidentally, neighbourhood plans becoming part of the development plan, even if the local authority disapproves &#8212;along with the abolition of regional imposition and the prevention of the inspector from simply rewriting plans are all geared towards making the plan prominent and, indeed, sovereign. When we are dealing with the legitimate concerns of communities that feel that</p>
	<p pid="c.273.1/2">developments that they do not want have been imposed on them, my concern is to strengthen their ability to control the process by participating in plan-making.</p>

	<p pid="c.274.3/2">Taking away some of those appeals for determination by an undemocratic body, rather than by local authorities on the basis of a plan, is the wrong thing to do, and would also elevate the status of planning officers above members. Such an approach would essentially say to planning committees that they should either agree with their planning officers or risk facing an appeal. That is the wrong approach. My hon. Friend the Member for St Austell and Newquay will shortly see evidence in the national planning policy framework of my absolute intention to make plans sovereign, so that it is not possible simply to set aside democratically agreed local plans in response to particular pressures.</p>
	<p pid="c.274.3/3">There is also a case for looking at the fact that the costs of losing appeals can sometimes hang over local authorities. Sometimes the threat of losing an appeal dissuades a local authority from turning down an application that it might want to turn down. We should look at that, to ensure that it will be possible for local authorities robustly to stick to their local plans.</p>

	<p pid="c.274.4/1">My right hon. Friend will remember visiting my constituency to meet local residents who were fighting against unwanted developments in Micklethwaite and Menston.

One way or another, the plans should be equal between the developer and the local residents. On the basis of what he has just said, can he clarify whether he is going to stop developers having the right to appeal?</p>

They will correct some long-standing flaws, which have resulted in people not having an opportunity to have their say in plan making from the beginning. They will give neighbourhoods the opportunity to have their vision of the community promoted as part of the local development plan. I will conclude my remarks now, and I look forward to the rest of the debate.</p>

	<p pid="c.275.4/1">I will speak to Opposition amendments 293 to 299, amendment 301 and new clauses 29 and 32; and I shall deal with some Government amendments.</p>
	<p pid="c.275.4/2">On health, the Government gave not an inch in Committee, got it badly wrong and then paused for thought. On localism, the Government admitted in Committee that they had got it badly wrong. They committed to making changes and are now bringing forward 234 new clauses and amendments&#8212;more than the entirety of provisions in the original Bill.</p>
	<p pid="c.275.4/3">There are some moves in the right direction. The Government have, for example, accepted our amendment</p>
	<p pid="c.275.4/4">to protect our national heritage and our great historic buildings, which was warmly welcomed by English Heritage. This Bill, however, like the Health and Social Care Bill, remains a bad Bill.</p>
	<p pid="c.275.4/5">The Government have moved on the duty to co-operate, admitting that the original proposals did not go far enough. The Minister of State, Department for Communities and Local Government, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40617" name="Greg Clark">the right hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells (Greg Clark)</phrase>, a decent man with an open mind, acknowledged to the Committee that the Government needed to strengthen the duty to co-operate and, in his words,</p>
	<p pid="c.275.4/6">&#8220;to make it bite and to make it more encompassing than it is.&#8221;<i>&#8211;&#8211;</i>[<i>Official Report, Localism Public Bill Committee, </i><phrase class="date" code="2011-02-15">15 February 2011</phrase>; c. 599.]</p>
	<p pid="c.275.4/7">The progress made, however, is extremely limited. It is clear that the Secretary of State, a man with a closed mind, sat on his Ministers&#8212;a fate too awful to contemplate. Since the Committee stage we have had additional changes to digest emerging from the Budget and those 234 new clauses and amendments. I am afraid to say that the sum total of the changes proposed is confusion, chaos and nothing short of a car crash.</p>
	<p pid="c.275.4/8">Since taking power, the Government have moved at breakneck speed to demolish the planning system and to rebuild it within a matter of months. The demolition is nearly complete, with the end of sensible regional strategic planning, including the folly of the abolition of the regional development agencies and their replacement with local economic partnerships with no powers and no money&#8212;all because the Secretary of State gets out the clove of garlic and the cross at the very mention of &#8220;regional&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.275.4/9">As the dust settles, has it all been worth it? How does the Minister view the planning landscape? Are we about to see a new streamlined planning process delivering housing, economic growth, action on climate change and the environment, and transport and infrastructure while also empowering people? Are we going to see that rise from the ashes?</p>

	<p pid="c.276.1/1">With respect, I took many interventions in Committee, but now that the Minister has taken the best part of an hour, I am determined to get through my remarks so that we can hear the maximum number of contributions from Back Benchers on both sides.</p>
	<p pid="c.276.1/2">Ending up in a pickle, the Government have produced a system that is desperately unfit for purpose. It is important to remember the purpose of planning. Good planning is a vital tool for delivering the necessary development, while also delivering on sustainable development. Planning should integrate the needs of the economy with environmental and social goals to create sustainable communities and retain and enhance our cultural, historic and landscape assets.</p>
	<p pid="c.276.1/3">We support any sensible reform. We accept that the system the Government inherited was, like any planning system, capable of improvement. We agree that increased local input by local people and local communities for the future of their areas and their built environment is absolutely vital to the success of any planning system. The reformed planning system, however, must be able</p>
	<p pid="c.276.1/4">to meet key tests and objectives. The system must be able to meet our growing housing need and in the right areas.</p>

	<p pid="c.277.1/1">I intend to finish my speech soon, for reasons that I have already given. In a debate lasting less than two hours, a Minister spoke for the best part of an hour. I want to allow time for the maximum number of contributions to be made by Back Benchers.</p>
	<p pid="c.277.1/2">The Government propose to introduce a regressive system that will reallocate moneys away from low-demand areas, and will undermine sustainable development by encouraging growth on the most developable and profitable rather than the most sustainable sites. The planning system must deliver sustainable development, but instead of including a definition of sustainable development in the Bill, the Government indicated in the Budget that they intended a profound shift away from sustainable development as the objective of planning towards a market free-for-all.</p>
	<p pid="c.277.1/3">An effective planning system should contribute to the delivery of our future needs, and that includes helping us to meet our carbon commitments in the fight against climate change. The Government, however, have promoted a toothless duty to co-operate, which will not contribute one iota to the mitigation of climate change. A truly effective planning system should also be responsive to local needs, demands and aspirations, but the Government&#8217;s proposals in relation to neighbourhood planning are half-baked and a bureaucratic nightmare. They are also a sham.</p>
	<p pid="c.277.1/4">Like other parts of the Bill, the localism agenda with regard to planning is wholly undermined by the Government&#8217;s attempt to face in two directions at once. On one hand we have the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government trumpeting the devolving of power to local people; on the other hand we have the Chancellor, who wants to make it easier for developers to bypass the planning system altogether. I can only assume that in the battle between the Treasury and the DCLG, the Treasury has won the day. How else can we explain the introduction of new clause 15, which enables financial benefits such as the new homes bonus to be a material consideration in the determining of planning applications?</p>
	<p pid="c.277.1/5">Ministers and others on the Government Benches should be clear about what they are voting for today. The Campaign to Protect Rural England, the Royal Town Planning Institute and the Town and Country Planning Association all condemn the proposals. The CPRE has said:</p>
	<p pid="c.277.1/6">&#8220;We believe that this amendment would fundamentally distort the planning system by encouraging local authorities to base decisions on the financial implications rather than the spatial merits of the proposed development. It could also undermine the plan-led system and result in the spread of developments that go against the views of local people.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.277.1/7">That view is echoed across the planning community, and will soon be heard in Members&#8217; surgeries up and down the country.</p>
	<p pid="c.277.1/8">The new clause undermines the fundamental principle that planning decisions should be made in the long-term public interest, taking account of land use consequences and of what local people actually want, rather than being based on financial rewards for the decision-maker. It stands on its head what the Government said in the new homes bonus design document, referred to earlier, which was released on <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-17">17 February</phrase>. It also directly contradicts a written statement released on the same day by the Minister for Housing and Local Government who said:</p>
	<p pid="c.277.1/9">&#8220;The New Homes Bonus also sits alongside the existing framework for making planning decisions. Responsibility will remain with local authorities to work within this framework to continue to ensure that development is suitable and sustainable by meeting local needs and national planning policy.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.277.1/10">The new clause represents a fundamental conflict of interests within planning. We must therefore ask why the proposal was not considered earlier. Could it be because since <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-17">17 February</phrase> Ministers have been in receipt of a legal opinion saying that the proposed new homes bonus scheme would introduce an unlawful element into the planning decision-making process, and that any planning permission granted on the basis that the scheme, or a grant under it, is a material consideration would stand a good chance of being quashed in a claim for judicial review? Faced with the news that their cornerstone housing policy was doomed, Ministers have decided to disregard the public interest and have rigged the planning system instead. Their cries of &#8220;Localism&#8221; are sounding hollower by the minute. This new clause was not considered in Committee, and this profound change to the way in which planning works has been introduced with no consultation, dialogue or debate. We will vote against it.</p>
	<p pid="c.277.1/11">What of the Government&#8217;s amended duty to co-operate? Their most significant proposed change is to use the local development framework soundness test as a sanction to ensure that co-operation takes place. That sounds reasonable, except that it is a retrospective test. Unlike our amendments, the Government&#8217;s amendments do not specify what is meant by co-operation. It will be extremely difficult for any inspector to assess definitively whether there has been adequate co-operation. It could take several years to judge whether or not co-operation has been successful, a period we can ill afford given the pressing need to meet housing needs, to modernise our infrastructure and to respond to the increasing scientific evidence of climate change. In short, the Government&#8217;s proposed duty to co-operate remains essentially voluntary, does not specify a unified product in terms of plan or strategy, does not specify the issues to be dealt with, and does not create an effective boundary to shape the extent of co-operation. It is certainly true that the proposal in general is a step in the right direction, but this measure simply will not work.</p>
	<p pid="c.277.1/12">On the other hand, our measures go some way towards establishing the planning system the country needs. The duty we propose places sustainable development as a core objective of this co-operation, specifies the scope of the co-operation required, specifies a minimum number of issues to be the subject of co-operation including climate, housing, biodiversity and transport, and is based on a spatial area and not neighbouring authorities only, because that does not work for the most strategic planning issues. Our proposed duty also places a statutory requirement on local authorities to prepare a joint strategy that addresses a number of specified strategic</p>
	<p pid="c.277.1/13">issues. This duty will not repair the damage the Government are intent on inflicting on the planning system, but it may salvage something from the wreckage.</p>
	<p pid="c.277.1/14">What in terms of sustainable development can we retrieve from the wreckage? At a time when the country is facing unprecedented challenges in economic recovery, climate change and increased urbanisation, the need for us to achieve sustainable development and to address these issues effectively has never been greater. However, the abolition of regional spatial strategies has removed many of the mechanisms that have provided an impetus for action towards achieving sustainable development and helping to monitor progress.</p>
	<p pid="c.277.1/15">Looking to the future, achieving sustainable development must be at the heart of the planning system and the Bill, and we therefore welcome new clause 6, tabled by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40582" name="Joan Walley">the Member for Stoke-on-Trent North (Joan Walley)</phrase>, which does exactly that: it puts sustainable development at the heart of the Bill. It is also absolutely vital that the adoption of short-term measures to drive economic growth and the abolition of important Government advisers such as the Sustainable Development Commission do not lead us into making decisions that are unsuitable for the country in the long term. Somewhere in the planning system consideration must be given to the how actions we take now will have an impact on future generations. In short, the Government need to be clear about the purpose of planning sustainable development. The issue is even more imperative given that the Government&#8217;s intention under new clause 15, which would give financial payments a privileged status&#8212;first among equals&#8212;as no other issue, such as housing or climate change, is specifically identified in the primary legislation as material. In the light of that, there is no justification for not specifying sustainable development in the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="c.277.1/16">The proposed duty to consider climate change applies only to the preparation of local development frameworks and not to neighbourhood planning. Our proposals on climate change would ensure that, alongside our approach to strategic planning and the approach taken by my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent North to sustainable development, the mitigation of climate change would be at the heart of the local plan-making process.</p>
	<p pid="c.277.1/17">The new provisions in the Bill on neighbourhood planning have been drafted to avoid the climate change duty. Do the Government seriously expect the carbon emissions for each neighbourhood forum and each local development plan magically to add up to our national target on climate change?</p>
	<p pid="c.277.1/18">However, the climate change issues are the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the Bill&#8217;s clauses on neighbourhood planning. The Government have proposed a series of amendments to the neighbourhood planning process arising out of our debates in Committee. As on the duty to co-operate, the limited progress is welcome. The Government have agreed to increase the number of people needed to initiate a forum from three to 21, so there is no longer the prospect of three men or three women in the Dog and Duck constituting themselves as a neighbourhood forum. On our other proposals to ensure democratic accountability no concessions have been made. The Government clearly see no need to ensure that such forums are accountable, and so 35% of the country will be covered by democratic bodies&#8212;parish councils, which, at their best, are admirable institutions&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="c.277.1/19">while the remaining 65% will be represented by forums with no democratic legitimacy and no accountability. We want communities to have a greater say in planning and to have a say over their local area, but forums should be democratically accountable and involve at least one local councillor. It is simply wrong to downgrade democracy.</p>
	<p pid="c.277.1/20">We also want to give local communities a greater say over the future of their local high street. I see today that, as a result of Labour&#8217;s amendments in Committee, Mary Portas, who is described as a &#8220;TV retail guru&#8221;, is to carry out a Government-backed review aimed at halting the &#8220;decline&#8221; of the high street in England. Retail summits are fine, but they are not an alternative to practical action. The Government should therefore back the concrete proposals for change that we have put before the House today.</p>
	<p pid="c.277.1/21">In Committee, we moved amendments to enshrine the &#8220;town centre first&#8221; policy in primary legislation. We welcomed the all-party consensus that there clearly was on the importance of this issue and the Government&#8217;s commitment to placing the &#8220;town centre first&#8221; policy at the heart of the national planning policy framework. Although that was a step in the right direction, we need to do more to put the heart back into Britain&#8217;s high streets. New clause 29 would require a local planning authority to include a retail diversity scheme within its local development framework. Crucially, the scheme would be developed through a consultation process with the local community, with the voices of local people and of local retailers heard. The new clause establishes a vital goal: the promotion of retail diversity, striking the right balance between large and small businesses and, in particular, focusing on establishing and growing small and specialist retail businesses.</p>
	<p pid="c.277.1/22">Healthy and diverse high streets are the heart of local communities. High streets and neighbourhood shopping parades are the engine room of thriving communities and local economies. Hon. Members will be all too aware that our high streets have suffered in the downturn. The new clause is not anti-supermarket but we must ensure that the supermarkets do not succeed at the expense of the high street. We must harness their power to better the community as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="c.277.1/23">In short, Labour wants to give communities a real say in the future of their high streets and the power to make the changes that we want. I know that Ministers will tell the House that our proposal to put the heart back in the high street is not necessary since measures on the &#8220;town centre first&#8221; policy will be included in the long-awaited national planning policy framework, a document that has now attained near mythical status&#8212;nay, that of the holy grail. All that information is supposed to be contained within the document yet, like the holy grail, no one has seen it. I would submit that this matter&#8212;the future of our high street&#8212;is so important that it warrants specific legislation. The new clause ensures that communities and not central Government decide how their retail provision should change and grow to meet their needs.</p>
	<p pid="c.277.1/24">The Government&#8217;s planning Minister, the Minister of State, Department for Communities and Local Government, the right hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells, has said that he wants to give communities real power over their local areas and will look to strengthen</p>
	<p pid="c.277.1/25">the role of our high streets in our towns and cities. If the Government mean what they say, they should accept our changes to the Localism Bill and give local people a real say over their high street.</p>
	<p pid="c.277.1/26">On retail diversity, sustainable development, the issues incorporated in our duty to co-operate and many of the other issues raised today, I expect the Minister might tell us, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, it&#8217;ll be in the national planning policy framework.&#8221; Frankly, however, I would not be surprised if Ministers told us next that we could look forward to reading about the meaning of life in the NPPF. The NPPF has been trailed by the Government as a document that will streamline national planning policy guidance, but at every turn the Government have committed that something additional will be in the NPPF. The NPPF is clearly a document of vital importance to the proposed planning changes, but do we have a copy of it to read in draft alongside the Bill? No.</p>
	<p pid="c.277.1/27">There is considerable uncertainty about what the NPPF will be, what it will look like, its status within the planning system and the process for its development and adoption. Promises from the Government that it will all be okay when the NPPF is published simply will not wash. It is wrong that such a major document, so relevant to the radical changes in the Bill, has not been published alongside it.</p>
	<p pid="c.277.1/28">In conclusion, we have in front of us today a blueprint for a planning system that will deliver nothing but chaos. It is full of contradictions in its objectives and overloaded with inconsistencies in the policies designed to deliver those same confused objectives. The Government claim that the Bill will deliver balanced economic growth and the housing we need, safeguard the environment and increase local engagement in planning. In reality, it dismantles the strategic planning system and the means to meet our housing need, deliver sustainable economic growth, meet our energy needs and capacity, safeguard our environment and mitigate climate change. While Ministers claim the Bill delivers localism, the sum total of their proposals are neighbourhood forums that will be thoroughly opaque, undemocratic and unaccountable. Any hopes that the Government mean what they say about empowering communities, delivering on sustainable development or mitigating climate change are utterly discredited by their proposal to rig the planning system to make their regressive new homes bonus deliver housing in the wrong areas. I hope therefore that Government Members will support our amendment to strengthen strategic planning and give communities a real say on their local high street, and that they will vote against the Government&#8217;s new clause 15, which will fatally undermine our country&#8217;s planning system.</p>

	<p pid="c.281.0/1">I shall be very brief. I share concerns about Government new clause 15 even after the Minister&#8217;s assurances. If bringing financial considerations into the Bill is not going to make any difference, why include the measure? I am afraid that I have not got my head around that and I am very concerned that we do not have time to discuss this in depth and understand the impact of the change.</p>
	<p pid="c.281.0/2">New clause 2, which is tabled in my name and those of my hon. Friends, was inspired by a report of the Environmental Audit Committee and we have tried to pick up on its main points. I sincerely believe that we need a definition of sustainable development in the</p>
	<p pid="c.281.0/3">context of the Bill and I share some of the concerns about how we can get the right balance between the pursuit of economic growth and making sure that economic growth is sustainable. Wherever that definition falls, it has to be in such a form that it can be developed downwards and interpreted by local communities, but also, in a sense, developed upwards within the national planning policy framework. That is quite a challenge. I am pleased that the Minister is prepared to accept what is in the new clause, but I hope that, as he is reflecting, he will also take on board some of the points that were made within the context of new clause 6.</p>
	<p pid="c.281.0/4">On new clause 4, I welcome the Minister&#8217;s comments about strengthening the basis of local plans. Throughout my time as chairman of planning it was very frustrating when there were attempts to override the local plan and one felt that one had to give in under the threat of costs. At the back of my mind, I still think that there ought to be a community right of appeal as a backstop, perhaps on much more limited terms than in the new clause. Obviously, there is still time to reflect on that.</p>
	<p pid="c.281.0/5">I remain concerned about the wording of Government amendment 160 and I hope that will be looked at.</p>

	<p pid="c.282.0/1">Given what the Minister has said, I rise to speak to my new clauses 30 and 31. It cannot be right that there are nine betting shops on one stretch of high street in Green Lanes or that there are 10 betting shops within 300 metres of Ealing Broadway station. It cannot be right that there are 60 gambling establishments within just 300 metres of the pagoda in Chinatown. The gambling industry and bookmakers in particular are flouting the gambling rules; they are opening up right across London and it is unacceptable. That is not to say that we want to condemn gambling&#8212;I like to gamble&#8212;but it is to say that when it comes to diversity on the high street, local communities and local authorities should have the planning powers to say, &#8220;Enough is enough,&#8221; &#8220;No, thank you,&#8221; and &#8220;No more.&#8221; That is why I think, and I am supported by London councils on this, that betting shops should be in a sui generis class of their own in the same way as casinos and amusement arcades.</p>
	<p pid="c.282.0/2">I shall force new clause 31 to a vote because I am not satisfied that the Minister is not just kicking this issue into the long grass. There has been a campaign by London Citizens and there is a continuing campaign by faith communities on the issue. Right across London, people are sick to death of seeing one betting shop after another.</p>
	<p pid="c.282.0/3">It is a great shame that the old Hackney town hall has been turned into a Coral bookmakers. It is unacceptable that countless pubs across the country are being turned into bookmakers. That is the case for every single class use&#8212;A2, which is meant to be for building societies and banks, drinking establishments under A4, as has been mentioned, take-aways under A5, and restaurants and cafes under A3. That is why we need action, and why I had hoped the Minister would say that he accepted the amendment, as leaders of councils across London have requested. It is unacceptable to kick the matter into the long grass. I urge the Minister to think again.</p>

	<p pid="c.282.1/1">I shall speak briefly to new clause 5, which stands in my name. The new clause is designed to allow the Secretary of State to change, by order, any piece of planning legislation</p>
	<p pid="c.282.1/2">that is causing any planning authority problems in carrying out its statutory duties or where a particular piece of planning legislation is causing local public controversy. I appreciate that this is an extensive power for the Secretary of State, but I also propose, as part of the same amendment, a strong safeguard in that a variation in the law may be made only if it has been subject to a positive resolution of both Houses of Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="c.282.1/3">The need for such a power is evidenced by an issue in my constituency. Brighton Marina was built in the 1970s following the lengthy passage of the Brighton Marina Act 1968. The marina is located in an undercliff location on land that was reclaimed from the sea. From the coast road anyone looking at the marina can gaze downwards to see the boats, shops, restaurants, businesses and low-rise accommodation located there. For many years the 1968 Act has been taken to mean that any development above cliff height would be only for ancillary works, such as lamp posts and fencing.</p>
	<p pid="c.282.1/4">However, in recent years, that has been challenged by proposals for housing development that would rise well above the cliff height. One such scheme was agreed by Brighton and Hove city council but not acted on, and one was turned down by the council. That refusal was sustained last year by my right hon. Friend on appeal, for which I am grateful. Both these developments were highly controversial and there was a clear difference of opinion between residents and the planning authority as to the intention of the 1968 Act. If my amendment to the Bill had been in place, that difference of opinion would not have occurred, because the legislation would have been crystal clear. Instead, we have had years of wrangling and uncertainty and still have no clear view of the meaning of the 1968 Act even now.</p>
	<p pid="c.282.1/5">The thrust of the coalition Government&#8217;s policy is to simplify, eliminate and clarify the rules, regulations and legislation faced daily by the public and businesses. My new clause would add significantly to the practical implementation of that policy, and I commend it to the House.</p>

	<p pid="c.283.0/1">I shall speak to new clauses 30 and 31, with reference to Deptford high street in my constituency. It is one of the oldest and most historic in the country. Although the area is one of multiple deprivation, it has a diverse and vibrant community, a good retail offer and a thriving local market. In recent years we have seen a proliferation of betting shops, such as my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40615" name="David Lammy">the Member for Tottenham (Mr Lammy)</phrase>, who tabled the new clauses, described from his own constituency experience.</p>
	<p pid="c.283.0/2">The problem in Deptford started with Coral, which took over a shop that had been used as an art gallery and caf&#233;, and moved away only because it was so hugely successful that it needed bigger premises. There followed a succession of developments that took many of our most historic buildings and iconic pubs, such as the John Evelyn and the Deptford Arms.</p>

	<p pid="c.283.1/1">Does my right hon. Friend also accept that the Bill does not go far enough in protecting assets that are of community value from being transferred to the private sector and that this is something that the Government should have allowed time for us to debate properly tonight?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-17c.284.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40365" speakername="Joan Ruddock" colnum="284"  time="021:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110517/debtext/110517-0004.htm#11051773001137">
	<p pid="c.284.0/1">I very much agree.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.0/2">There have been the changes of use on Deptford high street that I have described, but at the same time there has been a determination to improve it, and after years of battling we secured the funds, with the co-operation of a Labour Government, for a new station at Deptford and we expected new development to follow. However, who will want to live where they will look out on such a high street? As local campaigner Sue Lawes has described, at No. 14 we have Better Betting, at Nos. 34 to 40 we have William Hill, at No. 44 we have The Money Shop, for payday loans, at Nos. 49 to 50 we have Ladbrokes, at No. 55 we have Paddy Power, at No. 60 we have Fish Brothers pawnbrokers, at No. 70 we have Coral and at No. 72 we have H&amp;T pawnbrokers. The final straw is Betfred&#8217;s application to take over the old Halifax building. There the change of use would have been required because it was restricted specifically to use by a building society.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.0/3">The council has of course turned down that application and said, quite reasonably, that there are already far too many betting shops in the area and that it is unnecessary. They say that within the designated core shopping frontage the number of betting shops has reached</p>
	<p pid="c.284.0/4">&#8220;beyond an acceptable level, detracting from the range of retail services available within the defined District Town Centre&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.0/5">Betfred has of course appealed. We await the result of that appeal with interest.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.0/6">I put it to the Minister that it cannot be acceptable that, in an area of great deprivation but great spirit, local residents, 700 of whom have signed a petition, have no say in what is done there. I suggest not only that local people must have a say, but that others need to be protected from this kind of proliferation. Surely this is a community that can ill afford to spend what little money it has in betting shops on this scale. I am not opposed to betting; none of us is. It is the cluster effect and the proliferation that must be dealt with, and I very much hope that he will see that that is done.</p>

	<p pid="c.284.1/1">I am surprised at the lack of faith that the right hon. Members for Lewisham, Deptford (Joan Ruddock) and for Tottenham (Mr Lammy) have in their own constituents, because betting shops of course go where there is a demand for them. If there was no demand for them on the high streets in Lewisham and Tottenham, presumably some of them would close down.</p>

	<p pid="c.284.3/1">No, because I do not have enough time.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.3/2">The fact that these betting shops have not closed down indicates that the right hon. Member&#8217;s constituents want to use them, which makes them viable. I commend the right hon. Gentleman in particular for leading with his chin on this issue, because of course it was the Gambling Act 2005 that removed the unstipulated demand test. He was not only a member of the Government at the time, but in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, which introduced the Act which he now finds so offensive. I hope that the Minister will resist the siren voices from the Opposition Benches calling on him to do something about the general principle of supply and demand, which I hope he, as a staunch supporter of the free market, will stick to.</p>
	<p pid="c.284.3/3">I want to touch on new clause 7, which I have tabled, which relates to casinos. It would give all 600 local authorities fairly and equally the power to decide whether to allow the licensing of casino premises in their areas. The location of casinos was determined by legislation back in 1972, which identified 53 permitted areas on the basis of population data as it stood at the time and added a number of seaside towns. That information is now woefully outdated and denies many local authorities access to investment and jobs and unfairly constrains and confines legitimate and licensed businesses. Despite the emergence of new towns and new centres of population, there have been no changes at all to those permitted areas in almost 40 years. A casino licensed in an existing permitted area can move premises only within the same permitted area in which it was licensed; it may not even transfer to another permitted area, even if a local authority wants it. Those anachronistic and ridiculous constraints have enabled casinos, ironically given our previous discussion, to be crowded into outdated permitted areas. Through my new clause I do not seek to allow any more casinos in this country, even though I probably would not object to that in principle; the same limit would apply to casinos throughout the country. All my new clause would mean was that casinos were able to apply to be outside the existing 53 permitted areas, if local authorities wanted them. We would be giving every local authority the chance to have a casino in their area, if they want it, rather than sticking to outdated rules from more than 40 years ago.</p>

	<p pid="c.285.0/1">I will be brief, because there were many references to sustainable development not only in the Minister&#8217;s introductory comments, but in the speech that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40395" name="Annette Brooke">the hon. Member for Mid Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke)</phrase> made.</p>
	<p pid="c.285.0/2">The Minister made what was effectively a winding-up speech at the outset, and I rather suspect that the whole debate about sustainable development will be discussed further in the other place, so I want to send the most powerful message that I can, stating that when that debate takes place we should not just be satisfied with legislation that relates to guidance or with a new framework policy document that might come out in the near future; we should make sure that Parliament defines sustainable development and sets it out clearly in relation to this Bill, in this Bill.</p>
	<p pid="c.285.0/3">My amendment is supported not only by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40526" name="Clive Betts">the Member for Sheffield South East (Mr Betts)</phrase>, who chairs the Communities and Local Government Committee, but by Friends of the Earth, the Campaign to Protect Rural England, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, the Town and Country Planning Association, the Wildlife and Countryside League, the Woodland Trust, WWF UK and many more.</p>
	<p pid="c.285.0/4">I simply say this by way of a message to the other place. The previous Parliament proposed that the Procedure Committee should allow the recommendations of Select Committees, when there has been a unanimous decision and report, to become material considerations as legislation goes through this place. Were that the case now, I have no doubt that it would have brought forward an opportunity to consider precisely what the Environmental Audit Committee&#8217;s short, sharp inquiry, which is tagged with</p>
	<p pid="c.285.0/5">today&#8217;s business, recommended&#8212;namely, that there should be a definition of sustainable development to allow for future progress, and that the Localism Bill should include a statutory duty to apply the principles of sustainability to the planning system and other functions of local government, and set out that definition.</p>
	<p pid="c.285.0/6">We have not got that far with our modernisation of parliamentary procedure, but in the interim I genuinely hope that those valid concerns will be taken into account, so that we have not a whitewash but a means of balancing what many Opposition Members think, and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40081" name="Jack Dromey">the Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Jack Dromey)</phrase> said, are now going to be financial considerations, giving developers free rein to do what they like, with the real principles of sustainable development.</p>

	<p pid="c.286.0/1">I will be literally a minute, because many colleagues wish to speak. This is not quite the way I would have chosen to spend my birthday evening, but there we go.</p>
	<p pid="c.286.0/2">I want to ensure that the Minister has not ignored my amendments 371, 372 and 370. The first two would require planning authorities to be more effective in their consultation on a planning application, and I suggest that within a quarter of a mile radius of the application site is a much more precise definition than just &#8220;the vicinity&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.286.0/3">I welcome the abolition of the Infrastructure Planning Commission, and the fact that the arrangements will be taken back into a democratically accountable planning system. In the case of a big scheme such as the one that we may have coming down the track in Southwark for the great Thames sewerage main, I hope that we can still allow local authorities the ability to make the planning decision where there is a large structure in a borough on a particular site that is a unique part of the development. Of course there must be a bigger authority taking a strategic national decision, but where there is a local site of significance, the local authority should have a supplementary power to make that decision too. I hope that at some stage I will get positive noises from the Minister and that we might get appropriate changes at the other end of the building.</p>

	<p pid="c.286.1/1">I rise to speak to my amendments 11 and 12, which are to do with the right to be heard and equalities. It is very important that individuals and groups have the right to be heard in neighbourhood planning. I am grateful for the Minister&#8217;s comments. I think he was saying that there would be a presumption in favour of this, but I would be keen to see what criteria people will be using to guard against that happening for a mischievous purpose, or whatever. If the Minister is saying that there is a presumption in favour of oral representation where people want to take that option, that is very important.</p>
	<p pid="c.286.1/2">On equalities, it is important, under the Equalities Act 2010, to demonstrate that certain people are under-represented in the decision-making process. In 2010, the Equality and Human Rights Commission published its first triennial review &#8220;How fair is Britain?&#8221;, which identified the decline in opportunities for individuals to contribute to decisions that affect their lives as a major risk factor in moving towards a fairer society. I think the Minister said that there is no need for concern about</p>
	<p pid="c.286.1/3">this but that he will consider it further and ensure that equalities legislation is operable in these terms. If that is the case, I welcome it.</p>

	<p pid="c.287.0/1">I will try to keep my comments brief; realistically, with four minutes to go, I probably cannot keep them any briefer. I know the age of my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40072" name="Simon Hughes">the Member for Bermondsey and Old Southwark (Simon Hughes)</phrase>, but I will not reveal it at this stage and just wish him a happy birthday.</p>
	<p pid="c.287.0/2">I support a levelling of the planning process either by a third-party right of appeal or by the abolition of a developer&#8217;s right of appeal. Had the amendment in the name of my right hon. Friend been one that would work, I would certainly have supported it. I have just been involved in a planning process in Adel in Leeds, where we had an absolutely farcical situation in which David Wilson Homes, the developer, withdrew its scheme halfway through an appeal, but the system still allowed it to reapply for outline planning permission, which it then got. That was an absolute farce&#8212;an entirely shoddy, underhand and anti-localist way of doing things. I want to bring that to Ministers&#8217; attention.</p>
	<p pid="c.287.0/3">On pubs, there has been a lot of talk about the Duck and Drake&#8212;the many Duck and Drakes in the country. There is no finer place to hold a neighbourhood forum than in a pub. However, in terms of what this Bill does to strengthen communities&#8217; hands in protecting pubs, the most appropriate pub name would probably be the Hot Air Balloon. As I have said to Ministers before, I am afraid that there is very little in the Bill, as it stands, to give communities a greater say. At the moment, although there have been changes, it remains perfectly legal to demolish a free-standing pub without planning permission. The Bill does nothing to change the fact that a pub can become a restaurant, a caf&#233;, a betting shop or a payday loans shop without communities having any say whatsoever. If the Bill is to do anything to strengthen the hands of local communities, there are simple ways of doing that that do not prevent pubs from being developed when they are genuinely unviable.</p>
	<p pid="c.287.0/4">On behalf of the all-party save the pub group, I have put this question to the Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40127" name="Bob Neill">the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill)</phrase>, who is the community pubs Minister, but I have not had an answer: do the Government, who claim to be a pro-pub Government, think it is right that profitable pubs that are wanted by their communities are being closed every single day? If the Government do not believe that that is right&#8212;I do not believe that any hon. Member in this House believes that it is&#8212;they must do something about it. I regret to say that at this stage, there is nothing in the Localism Bill that does that. I know that we will carry on this discussion, and I look forward to doing that and taking up the Minister&#8217;s offer of a meeting. However, at the moment, it is simply not good enough. If he, the ministerial team and the Government believe in pubs and in genuine localism, they must do more in this Bill. Otherwise, it will be a real opportunity wasted.</p>

	<p pid="c.314.2/1">I am grateful to have this opportunity to raise the very important subject of the future of our public health observatories, which are an integral part of the national health service. They are responsible for public health intelligence work&#8212;collecting the evidence base and directing how different agencies work to improve public health. It might be useful if I give a definition of public health. The best definition I have been able to find is one from the World Health Organisation&#8217;s expert committee on public health administration that was published as long ago as 1952. It defined public health as</p>
	<p pid="c.314.2/2">&#8220;the science and art of preventing disease, prolonging life, and promoting health and efficiency through organized community efforts for the sanitation of the environment, the control of communicable infections, the education of the individual in personal hygiene, the organization of medical and nursing services for early diagnosis and preventive treatment of disease, and the development of the social machinery to ensure for every individual a standard of living adequate for the maintenance of health, so organizing these benefits as to enable every citizen to realize his birthright of health and longevity.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.314.2/3">The Association of Public Health Observatories represents and co-ordinates a network of 12 public health observatories in Scotland, Wales, England, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. That body brings together joint public health intelligence work from all its organisations across the United Kingdom and Ireland and also works in collaboration with its counterparts across Europe. Without that range of high-quality and trustworthy knowledge, expertise and support from public health observatories, much of the work carried out by practitioners and, indeed, local authorities, policy makers and the wider community, would be carried out in the dark. That would, without doubt, result in a less focused and less effective service delivery. All that makes public health observatories central to both local and central Government health policy and decision making.</p>
	<p pid="c.314.2/4">Public health observatories were set up to monitor the state of the public&#8217;s health and the causes of poor health and health inequalities, with the information being used by a range of organisations involved in providing health care, including the NHS. The White Paper, &#8220;Saving Lives: Our Healthier Nation&#8221;, which was published by the Department of Health in 1999, proposed the establishment of the public health observatories that were then set up in 2000 by the Labour Government. The Association of Public Health Observatories was also established in 2000. That umbrella group provides a link between regional public health observatories and national arrangements. It comprises representatives from all the regional public health observatories, the Department of Health and other partners, and one concern that I wish to raise is the fact that its funding has been removed this year.</p>
	<p pid="c.314.2/5">I hope that the Minister will accept that improving the knowledge and evidence base behind health care was a key element of the previous Government&#8217;s policy and was instrumental in making progress in tackling health inequalities. The changes outlined by the Health Secretary in the Health and Social Care Bill move us</p>
	<p pid="c.314.2/6">away from a co-ordinated health service towards a competition-based health service. The public health White Paper, &#8220;Healthy Lives, Healthy People&#8221;, published on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-30">30 November 2010</phrase>, set out a new structure for public health in England. Its aim was to shift the balance of responsibility away from central Government to local authorities. There has also been much greater emphasis on the need for people to be supported in taking more responsibility for their own health&#8212;the so-called nudge philosophy.</p>
	<p pid="c.314.2/7">There are many public health issues that I would like to discuss but unfortunately do not have time to develop tonight because of the shortage of time. I want to press on and put some points to the Minister, particularly about public health observatories, and I hope she will have the opportunity to respond to them.</p>

	<p pid="c.315.1/1">I am grateful for that and I agree. It is fundamental to have a solid evidence base on which to plan health interventions.</p>
	<p pid="c.315.1/2">As I mentioned, the Government propose in the Health and Social Care Bill to transfer health improvement functions from PCTs to local authorities, and to create a new body, Public Health England, to be rooted in the Department of Health. Public Health England is expected to take on full responsibility for overseeing the local delivery of public health services, as well as dealing with national issues such as flu pandemics and other population-wide health threats from next year. The majority of public health services will be commissioned by local authorities. However, the revolution under way in the NHS is just as important to the future of public health in England.</p>
	<p pid="c.315.1/3">The Bill, which proposes the abolition of strategic health authorities and primary care trusts, raises more questions than it answers. The responsibilities currently held by PCTs could be moved to local authorities, to the Department of Health, to commissioning consortia or to the NHS commissioning board. How the important work of public health observatories will be safeguarded for the future is still unknown. The decision to divide public health responsibilities between the Department of Health and local authorities will fragment any cohesive approach to tackling health inequalities. Whether new commissioning consortia will carry out some functions is at this stage unknown.</p>
	<p pid="c.315.1/4">There are further concerns about whether Public Health England should be outside the Department of Health to protect its independence. If it was placed within the NHS, perhaps as a special health authority, surely that would better meet the Government&#8217;s own aim, often stated, of liberating the NHS from political control.</p>
	<p pid="c.315.1/5">The Minister will be aware of the response to the White Paper by the public health observatories in March 2011. That response calls for a sub-national level of organisation of Public Health England to be created, with sufficient critical mass to ensure that the outputs of Public Health England continue to be valuable locally as well as nationally. There are many examples where that is the case, not least in my own region, the north-east,</p>
	<p pid="c.315.1/6">where the public health observatory has done excellent work on addressing inequalities that affect people with mental health issues and inhibit their ability to access services. The lessons of that can be rolled out across the country.</p>
	<p pid="c.315.1/7">The important work of the observatories over the past decade has been self-evident. On <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-24">24 June 2008</phrase> the health profiles for every local authority and region across England were published jointly by the Department of Health and the Association of Public Health Observatories, an organisation which, as I mentioned earlier, has lost all its funding. Using key health indicators, public health observatories were able to pinpoint national health statistics at a local level, providing valuable information to address health inequalities and improve health outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="c.315.1/8">As the Minister at the time, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40124" name="Dawn Primarolo">the Member for Bristol South (Dawn Primarolo)</phrase>, now the Deputy Speaker, noted, the importance of those statistics was</p>
	<p pid="c.315.1/9">&#8220;to target local health hotspots with effective measures to make a real difference.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.315.1/10">In my constituency, Healthworks, an excellent clinic established in Paradise lane in Easington and opened by Sir Derek Wanless, is a prime example of how that information collected by the observatories was used to great effect to target the areas in greatest need.</p>
	<p pid="c.315.1/11">The Association of Public Health Observatories, with the Department of Health, also published a health inequalities intervention toolkit to enable every English local authority to model the effect of high-impact interventions on the life expectancy gap. As far back as 1977, the Department of Health&#8217;s chief scientific adviser, Sir Douglas Black, was asked to produce a report on the extent of health inequalities in the UK and how best to address them. The report proved conclusively that death rates for many diseases were higher among those in the lower social classes. It acknowledged that the NHS could do much more to address the situation. It called for increases in child benefit, improvements in maternity allowances, more pre-school education, an expansion of child care and better housing. A further report was subsequently produced by Professor Peter Townsend. Indeed, only last week I attended a seminar, in which the principal speaker was Sir Michael Marmot, on the impact of cold homes on health outcomes. The report indicated that the cost to the NHS of illness resulting from poorly insulated houses and cold homes is &#163;2 million a year.</p>

	<p pid="c.316.3/3">&#8220;Action taken to reduce health inequalities will benefit society in many ways. It will have economic benefits in reducing losses from illness associated with health inequalities. These currently account for productivity losses, reduced tax revenue, higher welfare payments and increased treatment costs.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="c.317.0/1">My hon. Friend mentioned the Black report, the Townsend report and the Marmot report, and I wonder whether Government officials and Ministers might in due course come to regard the Marmot review a little like Marmite&#8212;either loving it or hating it&#8212;in respect of its findings, because it is clear that the need to monitor what is going on in public health across the regions of England, such as the north-east, is vital for future policy developments.</p>

	<p pid="c.317.1/1">Absolutely. That is a critical issue. In some respects, the Government have taken their eye off the ball. I will develop that point a little later and would like the Minister to respond to it.</p>
	<p pid="c.317.1/2">As my hon. Friend pointed out, there is a clear and present danger of a reversal of health inequalities, which would be exacerbated by decisions taken elsewhere across Government. It is such an important issue, and one that I have long campaigned on. As someone who has worked in the health service and served on a local authority, I feel very passionately about it.</p>
	<p pid="c.317.1/3">Remarkably, we are now considering proposals that risk losing our greatest weapon in tackling public health inequalities: evidence-based health intelligence. More recently, as my hon. Friends have noted, the Marmot review has restated the link between socio-economic factors and health, which are known as the wider determinants of health. One of the more serious threats to the future of public health intelligence is its future funding under the new arrangements proposed by the Government. In my view, the Secretary of State has shown little interest in the functioning of public health intelligence under these proposed structures.</p>
	<p pid="c.317.1/4">Public health policies must take account of local circumstances as health inequalities remain stark, particularly in areas such as my constituency. For example, smoking-related deaths vary greatly across different parts of the country. Public health intelligence must drive public health practice. I appreciate that public health observatories self-generate revenue, alongside their Department of Health grant and moneys from primary care trusts and strategic health authorities. They also have opportunities to gain commissions from universities and charitable organisations, but it would be extremely risky to proceed down the Government&#8217;s proposed route without the certainty of their core Department of Health funding, which I understand is to be reduced by 30% this year.</p>
	<p pid="c.317.1/5">Staff and people associated with the service have reported to me that valued employees are already being laid off at the north-west public health observatory, which is based at Liverpool John Moores university, and there is a similar situation at the north-east public health observatory. Local authorities commission the majority of public health services from a ring-fenced budget. What assurances can the Minister give me on safeguarding through this hiatus&#8212;this period of transition&#8212;and for the long term under the new arrangements?</p>
	<p pid="c.317.1/6">I also thank David Kidney, the former Member for Stafford, who is now head of policy at the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health, for his assistance in preparing for this debate. The institute has stated its view that Public Health England must be established with a degree of independence, a point I made earlier, and with the ability to oversee arrangements for collecting, analysing and disseminating valuable data for public health services.</p>
	<p pid="c.317.1/7">In short, it is now time for Ministers to provide concrete assurances that the role of public health intelligence, the collection of the evidence base and, in particular, public health observatories will be safeguarded for the future.</p>

I, like everyone else in the Chamber, want to hear what the Minister has to say in response to the important points that he has made.</p>
	<p pid="c.318.4/2">One reason why my hon. Friend&#8217;s debate is so important is that, amid all the public anger about the health service reforms, the effects on public health have not received the attention that they should have. Speaking as an east end MP, I must say that the information that the public health observatories produce is important in ensuring that whoever commissions services commissions for the population, not just for GPs&#8217; lists. I live in an area where many communities are either not registered with a GP or in other ways socially excluded.</p>
	<p pid="c.318.4/3">My hon. Friend has raised the important issue of health inequality, and it is easy to talk about that in the abstract, but we should reflect on the fact that this is 2011, because the life expectancy of someone in the richest part of Glasgow is 10 years more than that of someone in the poorest part, and if we take the Jubilee line tonight we will find that the people living at every stop from Westminster going east until Canning Town lose a few years in life expectancy. This is a very real issue and an indictment of our society. I congratulate my hon. Friend again on raising it, and I will listen with interest to what the Minister has to say.</p>

	<p pid="c.319.0/1">I am grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40222" name="Grahame Morris">the hon. Member for Easington (Grahame M. Morris)</phrase> for raising the subject of public health observatories, and I should probably declare an interest, because my husband is a public health physician. Anybody who has an interest in public health knows how important the observatories are, but time is very short, and I will not get to all the points that the hon. Gentleman made.</p>
	<p pid="c.319.0/2">The public health observatories have been around for more than a decade, and they produce a whole series of high-quality data. Annual health profiles, for instance, of local areas allow for those comparisons that are so important, and there is no doubt about the importance of reducing inequalities. The reports of Sir Douglas Black, Peter Townsend and more recently Sir Michael Marmot are all key documents.</p>
	<p pid="c.319.0/3">It is important to remember that over the past decade or so health inequalities have become worse, but I point no fingers, because it is testament to the fact that it is extremely difficult to reduce inequalities. The hon. Gentleman mentioned several issues that contribute to that. There are a range of factors, not least changing people&#8217;s behaviour, which is not easy. The Government&#8217;s contribution of &#163;12 million to the observatories is testament to how important it is that we get good intelligence. He will have read the public health White Paper, in which he will see our commitment to this. For the first time, we will ring-fence funds for public health.</p>
	<p pid="c.319.0/4">The movement of public health into local authorities has been fairly widely welcomed. There are transitional arrangements that we need to get right, but it will be based on a direct line of sight from the Department of Health, as we need to bring some things together. We need clear responsibilities and a clear outcomes framework to ensure that local authorities give us what we need, with all that based on good and sound intelligence. Although the public health observatories have done a very good job, there are some areas&#8212;for instance, changing behaviour&#8212;where the intelligence is not good and we have not collected it together.</p>
	<p pid="c.319.0/5">We want the data and evidence from the observatories to be used to improve the health of everybody, regardless of age, ethnicity, gender, income or sexuality. The public health White Paper sets out a clear life-course approach to that. It is impossible to make these changes without good intelligence and information. Despite the wealth of data, the evidence of what works is not necessarily being used as effectively as it could be, nor is it as widely available as it could be, and it remains only part of the information that we need. In any system where there are numerous stand-alone organisations, there are always dangers of overlap and duplication, and we want to eliminate that as much as possible. In short, we want to move from a system where we have a complex web of information functions performed by multiple organisations towards a system where that information is fully integrated into the public health system.</p>
	<p pid="c.319.0/6">As the hon. Gentleman said, this is not about one Department&#8212;the Department of Health&#8212;doing it alone, but about public health being absolutely everybody&#8217;s business. The difference can be made from the top to the bottom in Government and right across the different Departments; it is an issue for us all. If we are truly to</p>
	<p pid="c.319.0/7">make inroads into these very persistent, difficult to move inequalities in health, we have to approach it in that way. There is no question of losing the main functions of the observatories; on the contrary, in fact. By transferring those functions to Public Health England, we will improve how they are used.</p>
	<p pid="c.319.0/8">The hon. Gentleman will be aware that we have consulted for several months on the new public health system, and we are continuing to listen. It is very interesting to see what we are getting back, with a warm welcome for many of the changes. There are always anxieties about difficult periods of transition. We have convened a working group on information and intelligence for public health, which is chaired by the regional director of public health for South Central Strategic Health Authority, Professor John Newton. It has representatives from the Department, the Health Protection Agency, the public health observatories and the cancer registries, and it is meeting fortnightly to develop our approach to public health information and intelligence. This is an opportunity to get it absolutely right.</p>
	<p pid="c.319.0/9">The future of the observatories is being very closely managed, and that includes their locations. Department of Health funding for the observatories has been agreed for 2011-12. Although there has been a reduction in the core contribution for each observatory, the Department of Health funding set aside as the core public health information and intelligence budget remains similar to previous years, and that will be supplemented by additional Department of Health grants, so overall funding will be about the same.</p>
	<p pid="c.319.0/10">I should like to thank the north-east public health observatory for its contributions, including in relation to the national library for public health and the learning disability specialist observatory. Its strong strategic relationship with the academic sector through its host, the university of Durham, has been particularly beneficial. Officials in the Department are in regular contact with both institutions so that financial and other pressures are addressed as they arise. Like most of its counterparts, the north-east observatory receives income from the Department of Health, the NHS and others. I understand that it currently has a working capital of about &#163;1 million, which is not insignificant.</p>
	<p pid="c.319.0/11">The university&#8217;s human resources policies require it to alert staff at least six months before any changes in employment, which is important for staff at this uncertain time. We are making sure that the university is aware of the ongoing need for the observatory&#8217;s work, and hence its expert staff. It is important that we do not see any loss in that.</p>
	<p pid="c.319.0/12">We are lucky in this country to have such a rich source of expertise. We must ensure that we maximise the benefit of that expertise, knowledge and intelligence. I hope that I have reassured the hon. Gentleman. I thank him for raising this issue and giving me an opportunity to say how much we value the work of observatories. Their functions remain indispensable, but they must adapt to the new system. We want to streamline the system and do what we set out to do, which is to reduce inequalities in health. We will base any action we take on sound evidence.</p>

	<p pid="c.321.0/1">I thank the hon. Lady for raising that point. In fact, we inherited that system. Time and time again, budgets for public health have been raided to meet short-term commitments. One point of ring-fencing public health funding is to ensure that public health is central to the work that the local authority does and that it informs the commissioning arrangements in a local area. It is not good having just one area looking at public health. We are ring-fencing that money and will have a clear outcomes framework that sets out what the Government expect.</p>
	<p pid="c.321.0/2">We will ensure that the consortia have regard to the public&#8217;s health. When we say &#8220;public health&#8221; it can sound a bit jargonistic. We are talking about the public&#8217;s health and about reducing the inequalities that have dogged society up to now and which successive Governments have failed to reduce. We have to do something different. We are moving from a system in which public health got sidelined and in which the work of public health observatories, although valuable, was not mainstream, to a system where that work is brought into the mainstream and into the direct line of sight. All those who make commissioning decisions and all local authorities should hear the clear message from Government that public health is everybody&#8217;s business.</p>
