<p>Is the hon. Gentleman aware that not only the Members of this House but also the leaders of the Basutoland African Congress deplore these practices just as much as anyone, and would the hon. Gentleman consider the facts that the amendment to the Proclamation, which has substituted South African principles of law for British principles, and this one-man inquiry, have tended to worsen the position rather than better it? Would he also consider appointing a commission which would include representatives from other African countries, which would have the confidence of the Basuto people?</p>

<p>I accept that there is a strong feeling of horror, both here and in Basutoland, at these incidents, but I cannot accept the strictures which the hon. Gentleman directs against the Jones Commission which, after all, was appointed by a Labour Government, who were satisfied with the results, as, indeed, we are satisfied that it was an able and effective investigation. I would say to the House, however, that this is a problem which touches very closely the interests of the Basuto people. It is a complicated one and, therefore, I am sure that the House would wish my noble Friend and the High Commissioner to give the fullest thought to a particularly difficult legal problem.</p>

<p>Is the Minister aware that the future of the Protectorates, as indeed of the whole of Africa, depends on the expansion of the numbers of technically skilled and responsible citizens?

<p>Thirteen African students from the High Commission Territories are now studying at universities in the Union of South Africa and it is understood that they can complete their courses.<br/>
After 1958 no new African students from the High Commission Territories will be admitted to universities in the Union of South Africa.

<p>Is the Minister aware that educated opinion throughout the world condemns South African education policy of segregating black students and even excluding them from education?

<p>asked the Under-Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations (1) to what extent he has consulted Commonwealth Governments in the last six months about the relaxation of strategic controls on trade with China;<br/>
(2) if he will consult with the Governments of the Commonwealth with a view to arriving at a common policy on the subject of trade relations with China.</p>

<p>Some Commonwealth Governments do not maintain strategic controls on their trade with China and I do not think that a common policy for all Commonwealth Governments is feasible. Those which do maintain such controls are fully aware of the United Kingdom Government's practice and of our policy. There has therefore been no need for formal consultation with them during the last six months. Canada is


represented on the Consultative Group at Paris and there is close and continuous contact between Canadian and United Kingdom representatives in that body.</p>

<p>Is the hon. Member aware that the Prime Minister of Canada recently told the Canadian House of Commons that there had been no official consultations between the United Kingdom representatives and the Canadian representatives on this subject and that he knew nothing of British representations in favour of relaxing the controls?

<p>As Sir Pierson Dixon said in the Security Council on the 20th February,
<q> We approach the Kashmir question in the simple spirit of wishing to see a just and fair solution. We stand ready to consider our attitude to Kashmir on the merits of the cases put forward by both parties and in examining the cases put forward are deeply conscious of the vital necessity of making a positive contribution towards peaceful progress in the subcontinent. Her Majesty's Government's attitude is based on no other considerations whatsoever".</q>
This continues to be the attitude of Her Majesty's Government in relation to the Kashmir dispute. I think that as this is more fully understood many of the present misunderstandings will be dispelled.</p>

<p>Is the hon. Gentleman aware that British-Indian relations were strained enough as it was over Suez and that the new situation places yet another strain on them? Is he aware that there is a widespread feeling that it arises out

of British commitments under the Bagdad Pact? Is he aware of the dangerous implications of the present drift? What is he doing to halt the drift, in view of the misunderstandings which exist?</p>

<p>I would not accept the hon. Member's contention. No doubt he has seen, as I have seen, a statement within the last few hours by Mr. Nehru on the subject of India's relations with the Commonwealth. In the circumstances of Mr. Jarring's presence in the subcontinent&#x2014;we all hope that his mission will have a successful outcome&#x2014;I think it will be best to leave the matter at that point at present.</p>

<p>Contrary to the implications in the last question, is not it a fact that the policy of Her Majesty's Government in this matter is nothing more than an endorsement of the policies carried out by successive Governments, both Labour and Conservative, as a result of the 1948 and 1949 substantive resolutions in the United Nations, agreed to by Great Britain, India, Pakistan and all countries represented there?</p>

<p>In view of this country's position in the Commonwealth, have the Government considered whether it is wise to intervene so actively in this Kashmir dispute?

<p>It is perfectly true that considerable work has been done on estimating the raw material resources which are available in the Commonwealth, but what is at issue here is a question of financial policy which poses different problems as far as the Commonwealth Governments are concerned in so far as it is a question of providing the capital which is required.

<p>Is the President aware that that Answer cannot apply to this Question, because that was before the Fair was held? I am now asking the Minister what steps he took to have someone there.

we have no diplomatic relations with Eastern Germany, is not it a fact that the Leipzig Fair is attended by sellers and buyers from all over the world? Are not we losing export trade by the rather slack attitude which the Government take about East German relations?</p>

<p>The Prime Minister, when Chancellor, made a statement on 1st August, 1956, setting out an immediate programme for the improvement of economic statistics. I am glad to say that with the co-operation of business and the public, considerable progress has been made in getting more comprehensive and up-to-date information. For example, a larger sample of firms now provide quarterly figures of capital investment and of stocks, and also, for the first time, of profits. Quarterly estimates of national expenditure and its components were published for the first time in January, 1957.</p>

<p>Since my statement to the House yesterday, I have seen representatives of the Engineering Employers' Federation. They informed me that they are willing to go to arbitration and accept the award if the unions will do the same. The unions, have, however, made it clear that their attitude towards arbitration is unchanged.<br/>
I have just come from a meeting with the representatives of the Shipbuilding Employers' Federation and I am meeting the union representatives later this afternoon. The House will appreciate that, as I am in the middle of these discussions, it would not be appropriate for me to make any further statement.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman's statement means, of course, that there is no change since he injected the idea of a single arbitrator into this matter. Is it not the case, since he has now so well stated the employers' view that they are willing to go to arbitration, that the unions are willing to negotiate with the employers and end this strike?<br/>
If the Minister wants to see the end of the strike, is it not necessary for him now&#x2014;and I urge him again, now&#x2014;to call the leaders of both sides together and to suggest that negotiations should take place? Is it not a fact that the employers also feel that they have some views about the efficiency of the industry and that the union leaders would be quite willing to discuss these matters if the question of negotiations on matters of wages were reopened?<br/>
The second aspect of this matter is a by-product of the strike and refers to the sailing of the "Queen Mary" from Southampton. I do not want to make the situation more difficult and, therefore, I want to ask the right hon. Gentleman, in as measured terms as I can, whether he will not use his influence within the Cabinet on the Government not to use Admiralty tugs for the purpose of moving a ship about which there is a dispute, giving the impression that the Government are taking sides in this matter, which would have very serious repercussions upon the whole Port of Southampton and the shipping ports in the country as a whole?<br/>
As we are very anxious to get this strike settled and to prevent the engineering strike taking place, has not the right hon. Gentleman a golden opportunity today to arrange for the meetings which have been suggested continuously from this side, under his personal chairmanship, to start negotiations, so that the strike could be ended within a few hours?</p>

<p>As the right hon. Gentleman said, it is true that the unions wish to negotiate direct with the employers. I and my officials are really only a means to that end, and, of course, that would be the end that we wish to see.<br/>
The present position is that I am now in the middle of discussions. I must ask to be forgiven for not going into details. I have just seen the employers. The unions are coming to see me at six o'clock tonight. I intend to open with them the field to which the right hon. Gentleman referred, as I have made clear on a number of occasions to the House. I do not quite know yet what response I will get.<br/>
When I spoke about a meeting under my chairmanship, I said that I rather hoped that such a meeting would take place tomorrow, that is, today, and I still hope that. I hope to have meetings throughout this day. I do not know how long they will go on. The position remains as it was, but when I meet both unions and employers I will try to move in the very fields to which the right hon. Gentleman refers.<br/>
On the question of the "Queen Mary," I am aware of the position and of the repercussions. As I explained to the House yesterday, and as I am sure the

right hon. Gentleman knows, questions about executive decisions on the sailing of the liner are not questions which should be addressed to me.</p>

<p>No, Sir; that is not a matter that would concern the Ministry directly. We have, in another context, moved, through the National Joint Advisory Council, for action in the field of restrictive practices as far as the union side is concerned, and a great deal of progress has been made.

<p>The first thing is to publish the Defence White Paper. From it will emerge the nature of the defence plans on which hon. Members can form their opinions. The Prime Minister said on 7th March:
<q> There will be the debate on the full Army Estimates later in the year, for which, I should imagine, our ordinary procedure would apply." &#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 7th March, 1957; Vol. 566, c. 540.]</q>
I understand that we can make agreements with the Opposition, through the usual channels, to see that there is an opportunity for full discussion of the main Estimates. I make the offer to the Leader of the Opposition so that there can be an opportunity for full discussion.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-03-21a.559.1" speakerid="unknown" speakername="The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Derick Heathcoat Amory)" colnum="559" time="">
<p>With your permission, Mr. Speaker, and that of the House, I would like to make a statement on the statutory annual review of the economic condition and prospects of the agricultural industry which has now been concluded.<br/>
The Government have made their determinations on the guarantees to the industry in the light of the review and of the long-term assurances announced last November. The details are set out in a White Paper which is now available.<br/>
The general production policy of the Government continues to be to foster economic production, by encouraging the maintenance of a large arable acreage with the main emphasis on feed crops, the maintenance of a large livestock population with greater reliance on home-produced feeding stuffs, the production of more good quality beef, and lamb, but no more milk, eggs, pigmeat or wheat.<br/>
The net output of the industry in 1956&#x2013;57 is forecast at 59 per cent. above pre-war as compared with the revised figure of 56 per cent. for last year, largely as a result of a rise in output of livestock products. This is the highest level of net output so far recorded. I am sure that the House will agree that this reflects credit on everyone concerned, particularly when one recalls the difficulties of the harvest.<br/>
The actual net income of the industry, which is forecast for 1956&#x2013;57 at &#x00A3;317 million out of a gross income of nearly &#x00A3;1,500 million, is slightly below the revised figure of &#x00A3;325 million for 1955&#x2013;56. The forecast of net income adjusted for normal weather conditions, on the other hand, at &#x00A3;334 million, is about equal to the highest previously recorded, in 1952&#x2013;53.<br/>
There has been a substantial further increase in costs, of about &#x00A3;38 million in a full year for review commodities. Although there will be a considerable offset in continuing improvements in the efficiency of the industry, on balance the industry requires an increase in the value of the guarantees if it is to continue to make its proper contribution to the economy.<br/>
On the other hand, the Exchequer cost of agricultural support is rising and the national economic situation demands a strict view of the needs of the industry. The new long-term assurances to which the Government have undertaken to give effect require this year an increase in the total value of the guarantees. The Government have considered all relevant factors, including these assurances, the cost to the taxpayer and the place of the industry in the national economy. They have decided that the essential needs of the industry can be met by an increase in the total value of the guarantees of about &#x00A3;14 million. This is about &#x00A3;6 million above the minimum required by the long-term assurances.<br/>
The determinations now made are for livestock products for the year April, 1957, to March, 1958, and for crops of the 1957 harvest. The most important aims of the determinations for individual commodities and production grants have had to be to reduce the profitability of egg and milk production, to maintain that of fat cattle and fat sheep production, to encourage continued stability in output of pigmeat and to encourage production of home-grown feeding stuffs.<br/>
The determinations for livestock and livestock products accordingly comprise a substantial reduction in the price guarantees for eggs; an increase of no more than &#x00BC;d, a gallon in the guarantee for milk&#x2014;which, in view of the increased costs, will mean a net reduction in profitability per gallon; no change in the price guarantees for pigs and wool; but increases in the price guarantees for fat cattle and fat sheep, including a higher rate of guarantee for the better quality cattle.<br/>
The determinations for crops include and supersede those previously made after the 1956 Annual Review under previous procedure. They comprise reductions in the price guarantees for wheat and rye and increases in those for barley, oats, potatoes and sugar beet. It has also been decided to increase the subsidy on nitrogenous fertilisers and to make minor extensions in the scope of the ploughing grants and the lime subsidy.<br/>
The Government are satisfied that the determinations now made will enable the industry to maintain its progress in improving efficiency and to secure a


reasonable level of remuneration for economic production, and, at the same time, accord with the present stringent requirements of the national economy.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-03-21a.561.0" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. T. Williams" colnum="561" time="">
<p>May I ask the right hon. Gentleman first, whether, as I hope is the case, this was a happily agreed decision? I think the right hon. Gentleman said that the increased costs of production amounted to &#x00A3;38 million in the year, of which &#x00A3;14 million are to be recouped. I assume that we take it from this statement that the industry is expected to bear &#x00A3;24 million worth of the increased costs over the year. Secondly, will the Minister say what is the "substantial reduction" in the price for eggs? Thirdly, can he tell us how much of the &#x00A3;38 million increased costs are due to increased fuel prices?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-03-21a.561.1" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. Amory" colnum="561" time="">
<p>I am glad to say that the determinations have been agreed with the leaders of the farmers' unions. In the light of the national considerations at the present time, the leaders of the farmers' unions have agreed that the Government's determinations give due weight to the relevant factors at this Review and are in full accord with the Government's long-term assurances.<br/>
The cost increases for Review commodities amount to about &#x00A3;38 million. An addition of &#x00A3;14 million has been made to the guarantees, which leaves a net figure of &#x00A3;24 million, as the right hon. Gentleman says, but a substantial part of that figure has been absorbed already in the net income of the industry. As for the remainder, we believe that to be more than fully covered by the normal increase in efficiency in the industry, which we estimate at about &#x00A3;25 million a year and which, I am glad to say, looks like continuing.<br/>
The reduction in the figure for eggs is 1&#x00BE;d. per dozen.<br/>
On the question of fuel prices, I think that the figure is about &#x00A3;4&#x00BD; million, represented by the tax increase and something additional for other increases. We hope that the tax increase will be of a temporary nature.</p>

<p>While congratulating my right hon. Friend upon the general result achieved, and also upon the specific changes he has made, particularly the increased guarantees for fat cattle of good

quality and for barley and oats, may I ask him whether he thinks that these annual bouts of horse trading between his Department and the National Farmers' Unions, of which the House knows nothing until the final bargain is announced, will prove in the long run the best way of conducting the agricultural policy of the country? Will he give his mind to devising a better method in the future than this regular wrangle which takes place&#x2014;I admit, usually with fairly satisfactory results&#x2014;in order to get a long-term policy which will suit the needs of the country better?</p>

<p>I could not accept my hon. Friend's description of the Annual Price Review. I ant glad to say that it was held in a very friendly atmosphere this year. I think I can say that as a result of the long-term assurances the field for argument and discussion has proved, as I hoped, to be considerably narrowed, but as the hon. Member knows, the Annual Review is at present a statutory provision under the Agriculture Act.</p>

<p>Is it not the case that a year ago the right hon. Gentleman guaranteed that the price of the 1957 wheat crop should be 28s. 3d. a cwt. on average throughout the year? Do I understand him to say today that he is reducing that figure after the crop has been drilled? If so, is not this the first time that any Government have dishonoured a guarantee in respect of any agricultural crop?<br/>
Secondly, may I ask the right hon. Gentleman about the price of milk? Is he aware that for January this year the producer received 8d. a gallon less than for January of last year, but that the consumer is charged more? Are we to understand that there is a further reduction in the average price of milk, but that the price to the consumer may be still further increased?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-03-21a.562.2" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. Amory" colnum="562" time="">
<p>In reply to the first part of the hon. Member's question, the results are the opposite to what he thinks. At our last Price Review we reduced the price of wheat for the 1957 harvest by 1s. 6d. At this Review we have put it up 4d. on that, making a net reduction of 1s. 2d.<br/>
As to the second part of his question, as the hon. Member knows, the guaranteed price is related to a standard quantity only, and above that standard quantity


the main part of the loss that results, unfortunately, from the sale of milk at a considerably reduced price falls, and is bound to fall, on the producer.</p>

<p>Can my right hon. Friend give an assurance that this Review carries forward the Government's policy of assisting the small producer by way of production grants, and so on, and to improve their efficiency and economy so that, over all, the industry will progressively need less subsidy? Will he also tell us whether the price arrangements now made will result in any increase in prices to consumers in the shops?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-03-21a.563.1" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. Amory" colnum="563" time="">
<p>We bear particularly in mind the position of the small farmer, who is quite heavily dependent, in many cases, on pigs, eggs and milk. As my hon. Friend will have noted, we have, in our determinations, increased the price of oats, beef and sheep, and we have increased the value of the fertiliser subsidy. We have maintained, we believe, the profitability on pigs. Part of the reason that led us to give the &#x00BC;d. extra on milk was consideration for the small producer, who must inevitably base his husbandry, in many cases, on the production of milk.<br/>
As to the second part of my hon. Friend's question, which I understood to refer to the consumer, the increases which we have made in the guaranteed prices should not affect the consumer in any way directly at all, because the prices of the products in the shops depend on the market price and not on the guarantee price.</p>

<p>Since the most disturbing feature of the whole situation is the persistent increase year by year in the overall costs of production, apart from wages, may I ask the Minister whether his Department is looking into those persistently increasing costs of every kind, increases which help to capsize the best-run ship?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-03-21a.563.3" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. Amory" colnum="563" time="">

<p>May I ask whether my right hon.

<p>I hope that horticulture will benefit directly from the increase in the nitrogenous fertiliser subsidy&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "Potash."]&#x2014;made in this Review. Of the two, there are a good many grounds for saying that nitrogen is more important than potash, even to horticulture.</p>

<p>May I ask my right hon. Friend whether he will bear in mind that, although none of their commodities are Review commodities, horticulturists have from time to time been able to benefit from production grants, fertiliser subsidies, and so forth? Is he aware that all growers are united in believing that the subsidy on potash is far more important than that on nitrogen? Finally, will he bear in mind that during the past year increased costs to growers have been particularly heavy owing to fuel price increases?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-03-21a.564.3" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. Amory" colnum="564" time="">
<p>I must have an argument with my hon. and gallant Friend about the rival importance of potash and nitrogen fertilisers. As he knows, the main method of support for horticulture is through tariffs. I am very conscious of the considerable increase in cost&#x2014;part of which, I hope, will be very temporary&#x2014;which has fallen on the glasshouse section of this side of the industry owing to the increase in fuel costs over recent months.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.<br/>
The Bill derives very largely from the review of the working of the National Insurance scheme which was initiated by my predecessor, the noble Lord, Lord Ingleby. It would, perhaps, not be inappropriate if I began by saying how impressed all who have studied this very intricate subject have been by the care and skill which the noble Lord devoted over a considerable number of years to the efficient working of the scheme.<br/>
The review which he initiated, and from which this Bill in large measure derives, was undertaken with the help, and very largely through the medium of, the National Insurance Advisory Committee, the statutory body which, as the House knows, was set up under the original Act. The country owes a great deal to the former Chairman, Sir Will Spens, who served until the end of last year, and a number of whose reports have their conclusion in this Bill. I should like, if I may, on behalf of Her Majesty's Government to say how grateful we are for the help given by the extremely busy men and women who are members of the Committee, and that we do welcome the new Chairman, the Provost of University College, London, Sir Ifor Evans.<br/>
I am afraid that any Bill on National Insurance must inevitably, in present circumstances, present a highly untidy, and, if I may say so, almost incomprehensible appearance. That is the inevitable price which we pay for the fact that legislation is, I think rightly, required for the making of substantial changes in a scheme which is still a very new one, and which is an immense one covering the whole of the country.<br/>
Most of the proposals contained in this Bill result from practical experience of the working of the scheme. Therefore, I am afraid that National Insurance legislation still has to present a form which is


to lawyers, perhaps, particularly disagreeable&#x2014;that of legislation by reference. That is because we are still engaged, in substance as well as in form, in amending and adjusting in the light of experience the original Act and those immediately following it. Although the time may come when it is possible to consolidate this legislation, I think that that time is probably still some way off, because there are still obviously adjustments which will have to be made from time to time in the scheme, and which involve legislation.<br/>
I should also like to say that while this Bill embodies a good deal of the advice given to us by the Advisory Committee, and though it contains, in a number of cases, also the decisions of the Government upon it, it does not cover the whole of the advice of the Advisory Committee which we are accepting. In other directions, where we are able to proceed by regulation, regulations are being prepared and submitted through the Advisory Committee to Parliament in the normal way.<br/>
The Bill itself covers a variety of topics. Indeed, there is an inevitable risk in connection with Bills of this kind that a Second Reading speech will consist solely of a consolidation of the notes on Clauses, a speech which it would be as tedious to deliver as it would be insupportable to listen to. I will, therefore, if I may, confine myself to referring to sonic of the main features of the Bill, leaving to my hon. Friend the Joint Parliamentary Secretary the responsibility for dealing at the end of the debate with specific points which hon. or right hon. Gentlemen may care to raise.<br/>
Plainly, there emerge from the considerable mass of proposals in the Bill three which are of greater importance than the rest. They are those providing for retired persons to go back into employment and earn increments, which are dealt with in Clause 1 and, to some extent, in Clause 2, those dealing with an increase in the earnings limit for dependent wives, in Clause 3, and the provision for a change in the law with respect to unemployment benefit in connection with certain short-time workers, which is dealt with in Clause 4. I will, if I may, confine the greater part, though not all, of what I have to say to those three topics.<br/>
In Clause 1 we deal with&#x2014;I apologise to the House for the word&#x2014;" de-retirement ". It is an inelegant word which, when I first used it in this House, produced a highly adverse reaction from both sides; but subsequent study has convinced me that, though the word is inelegant, there is no alternative word which precisely expresses what we here have in mind. I have attempted to elicit suggestions from other quarters, but have been wholly unsuccessful.</p>

<p>The theological implications of that word might, perhaps, cause a certain confusion in lay minds. I was about to say that only the fact that the House of Commons Disqualification Bill is going through Parliament prevents me from offering a prize this afternoon; though I am sure that no hon. Member would be displaced from his seat in the House if during the course of the debate &#x2014;I mean this seriously&#x2014;he were to offer further suggestions for suitable nomenclature.<br/>
The idea is important, and it is an idea which, I think, commends itself to opinion generally. The present position is that there is, of course, nothing to prevent the retirement pensioner when he has retired from ordinary work resuming full-time work, but, if he does so during the first five years from 65 to 70 in the case of a man&#x2014;or 60 to 65 of a woman&#x2014;he forfeits under the earnings rule his pension and does not obtain by way of compensation an increment on his pension when he stops work. Putting it quite frankly, he therefore gets the worst of both worlds.<br/>
The difficulty which experience has shown springs from the fact that the decision to retire is, under the present law, an irrevocable one. It is the common experience of hon. Members, in their own lives and contacts, to meet people who, not being very well perhaps or being a little tired, have retired from regular work and gone on pension at or soon after reaching pensionable age, but who, after a few months, have changed their ideas; they became rested, they perhaps feel better, they may perhaps be a little bored by the absence of regular work, or there may even be domestic factors such as the wife's enthusiasm for having the "old


man" at home all day being not restrainable within the limits of decorum&#x2014;there may be many human factors. Therefore, we want to give an opportunity for such a person not to be bound by an irrevocable decision to retire.<br/>
What is proposed in Clause 1, and there is a consequential provision in Clause 2, is to give to such people the option to revert to their previous position, that is to say, not to draw the pension but to earn increments or increased increments so that when they finally retire they will enjoy an incremented pension.</p>

<p>Will the right hon. Gentleman clear up one point? A person who retires and who then may undertake full-time employment and be caught by the earnings rule is presumably not paying contributions when at work again whereas the reentry into employment under this Clause would, as I understand it, entail the payment of contributions. Is that difference a real one?</p>

<p>Yes, undoubtedly a re-entrant under this condition, in order to earn increments, would pay the full contribution. After all, as the hon. Gentleman knows, the increment is calculated on the assumption that contributions are paid.</p>

<p>I have worked out, though my arithmetic may be wrong, that if a pensioner re-enters employment for six months it will take him fourteen years to make good his loss of benefit and the cost of the contributions.</p>

<p>I would never dispute the hon. Gentleman's mathematics, for which I have a profound respect, without an opportunity to recalculate the figure. On the other hand, I know his skill in debate sufficiently well never to accept any proposition he puts without further study.<br/>
The fact remains, of course, that what we are offering here is an option. There is no compulsion about it. If any person is interested&#x2014;I shall come in a moment to the categories of people who, I think, may be interested&#x2014;the option will be available for him. If people are not interested, there is nothing whatever to compel them to exercise the option. It is

an additional right, not a diminution of any right. As regards the hon. Gentleman's calculations, as I say, I reserve my position, meaning, in other words, that I shall put cold towels on my head and take some black coffee later tonight.<br/>
The proposal is to give an option. Those to whom it is most likely to appeal are those&#x2014;of whom there are 25,000 at the moment&#x2014;who have retired and have subsequently resumed full-time work, losing the whole of their pension under the earnings limit. Some of those 25,000 people will, no doubt, be interested. It may well be that others also who, though not losing the whole pension under the earnings rule, are losing something, may be interested.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman's intervention has really led me to one point which I was going to discuss. Until this has operated, we cannot know how much it will be used or the extent of the interest it will prove to have. That has a bearing on one of the two problems which must be solved, namely, the problem of whether we are to permit simply one act of de-retirement, and, if the pensioner thereafter retires a second time, not allow him a further option, or whether we should go further than that and allow not one, but a number. It must, inevitably, be limited in some degree, but a number of further de-retirements could be envisaged.<br/>
I would suggest that the best way to handle the matter is this. As hon. Members will see, the Clause is drafted on the basis of conferring a regulation-making power. What I would propose to do would be to make regulations, in the first instance, providing one opportunity for de-retirement, but with the full intention, after having seen how that works, of providing, if it seems desirable, for further de-retirements by subsequent regulations. That experimental method, which is one which has been followed more than once in connection with the National Insurance scheme, is probably the wisest; and, of course, the extent to which it is possible to operate it depends upon the factor mentioned by the hon. Member for Sowerby (Mr. Houghton) as to the extent to which it is used.<br/>
The other problem is this. If a man "de-retires", that will affect his wife's


pension if it is payable on his insurance. The National Insurance Advisory Committee, in facing that problem, recommended that the act of de-retirement should be a joint one in the case of married couples where the wife was drawing pension on her husband's insurance. That, in practice, of course, would involve, as it were, a veto in the hands of the wife; but in the vast majority of cases that would not matter because this is just the kind of thing a married couple would talk over together and come to a joint decision about.<br/>
There may well be a minority of cases, however, where, perhaps, a couple have quarrelled and separated, in which the wife's consent might be withheld for inadequate reasons. Therefore, in the Bill, as will be seen from the proviso to Clause 1 (1), we have gone a little further than the Advisory Committee and, while proposing that the act of deretirement shall be a joint act, we have said that there shall be an opportunity to go to the statutory authorities if in the husband's view the wife's consent is unreasonably withheld. The statutory authorities&#x2014;that is, the local insurance officer or the local tribunal&#x2014;will have the opportunity to decide the matter. That seems to be the fairest way of dealing with that difficulty, which could arise in only a small number of cases but which, it appears, could arise in them.<br/>
Clause 2, as I have said, follows on from Clause 1, because its most important provision is to open this same opportunity to widows who up to the age of 60 have been on widow's pension. The Clause provides that they also shall have the opportunity, if they wish, instead of automatically going on to a retirement pension, to earn increments and draw, therefore, the higher pension at a later date. This treatment of them is to place them in the same position as other retirement pensioners. That is the first of the three major points to which I referred a moment ago.<br/>
The second, which I can deal with more briefly and which is covered in Clause 3, relates to the earnings limit&#x2014;or, to put it more accurately, the earnings disregard&#x2014;for dependent wives of National Insurance beneficiaries. The House will recall that this matter was dealt with by the Advisory Committee in its Report on the Question of Earnings

Limits for Benefits, published early last summer, and that the other earnings limits&#x2014;those relating to retirement pensioners and widowed mothers&#x2014;were dealt with in a Private Member's Bill, now a Private Member's Act, which was taken through the House by my hon. Friend who is now Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Health and my hon. Friend the Member for Somerset, North (Mr. Leather). That Bill, however, did not deal with the position of dependent wives.<br/>
The National Insurance Advisory Committee considered the previous position, in which wives of very long-term chronic sickness beneficiaries had a limit of 40s., whereas wives of recipients of unemployment benefit or of sickness benefit for shorter periods had a limit of 20s. After considering the matter, the Advisory Committee recommended, and we have accepted its recommendation, that there was really no case for a differentiation between the two and that the limit in both cases should be 40s. That, among other things, will involve doing away with what has been a cause of some difficulty.<br/>
The higher limit in respect of long-term sickness has been available where the man's doctor has been prepared to make a confident prophesy that he would be sick for six months or more, but where the doctor gave a less determined prognosis, though the illness itself might continue just as long, the 20s. limit applied. That, as hon. Members with experience of National Insurance administration will know, has caused a great deal of difficulty. That difficulty will be eliminated if the House accepts the view of the Advisory Committee and of the Government that the limit should be 40s. in both instances.<br/>
As I have said, this is not a true earnings limit in the sense in which we discussed the earnings limit last summer when dealing with the Private Member's Bill to which I have referred. This is much more a test of dependency, a test whether the wife is dependent on the recipient of National Insurance benefit and, therefore, whether the increase in respect of a dependant should be paid in respect of her. For that reason, it is, and always has been, framed differently: that is, with no marginal adjustments but so that, once her earnings exceed the limit, even by a shilling or two, she ceases to be treated as a dependant at all.<br/>
This is financially much the most expensive part of the Bill. The cost to the two funds&#x2014;the National Insurance Fund and the Industrial Injuries Fund&#x2014;will be over &#x00A3;1&#x00BD;million a year to the National Insurance Fund and &#x00A3;&#x00BC; million to the Industrial Injuries Fund. That cost, of course, will have to be taken into account in due course when the level of contributions is reconsidered.<br/>
The third major change relates to the payment of unemployment benefit in respect of short-time working. That matter was considered by the Advisory Committee a little time ago and that Committee, being divided on the matter, came to no conclusion on this issue. This proposal is, therefore, put forward in the light of the Advisory Committee's consideration but after consideration by the Government and on the basis of the Government's consideration of the merits of the matter. It has been subject to criticism from both directions. It has been criticised for doing anything at all, and it has also been criticised, noticeably in the Press, for not having gone further. That is probably a good indication that the proposal is about in the right place.<br/>
Perhaps I may describe it. Essentially, it has to take into account the growth of the five-day week, which now covers, roughly, about half the insured workers and, of course, a much larger proportion in manufacturing industry. The present position when such a five-day worker goes on short time is that if he or she loses one day's work of his five days he is entitled, if he fulfils the other conditions with regard to waiting days and so on, to two days' unemployment benefit, whereas a six-day-week worker who loses one day is in general, unless he can link it with another day, entitled to no benefit at all.<br/>
That seems to us to be an anomaly. It seems to be wrong in principle that unemployment benefit should be paid to a man in respect of a day&#x2014;normally, but not necessarily, a Saturday&#x2014;on which he does not normally work and in the ordinary way of things would not be working. That has been thought in many directions to be an anomaly. Therefore, the Bill proposes simply to correct that and to provide, by a Clause which is easy and intelligible to read, that benefit shall

not be payable in respect of unemployment on a day on which the man in question does not normally work.<br/>
That is the proposal. We may have discussion of it later, but I think it will suffice for me at this stage to say that it does not seem fair to place on the other contributors to the Fund responsibility for the payment of unemployment benefit in respect of a day on which the recipient does not normally work.<br/>
I do not think it is necessary for me at this stage to indicate why we have not gone further in this direction, except, perhaps, to say this. It has been suggested that we should have gone further and gone back to the old three-in-six rule, which prevailed up to 1940. One great objection, it seems to me, to the three-in-six rule is that it means that a man who is out, in the case of a six-day worker, for three days gets half a week's benefit, whereas a man who is out for two days gets none at all. Undue importance is attached to the odd day which may have a discouraging effect in certain circumstances on production. We have, therefore, rejected that and confined ourselves to the proposal which I have been attempting to outline.<br/>
I should make it clear that it applies only to those who normally work for five days or less a week and that it does not apply in any respect to the six-day or 5&#x00BD;-day worker. Neither does it apply to the five-day worker when he is unemployed for the whole of the week. It operates only in respect of short time.<br/>
The remaining provisions of the Bill are, perhaps, of less general interest, though each and all of them matter quite substantially to limited numbers of people who will be affected by them. I might, perhaps, mention the new benefit which is created by Clause 5 and is called the child's special allowance.<br/>
That benefit originates from a recommendation of the Royal Commission on Marriage and Divorce and has been approved by the National Insurance Advisory Committee. Indeed, we go a little further than the Royal Commission. The Royal Commission took into account the position which arises where there is a divorced couple and where the children are living with the mother who is receiving payment for their maintenance from the father. Under the existing law, when


the father dies no National Insurance benefits are paid. Although the position of these children is perhaps broadly similar to that of the children of a widowed mother, no National Insurance provision is made for them.<br/>
We therefore propose&#x2014;and we go further than the Royal Commission, which recommended this only in respect of cases where the parent was the innocent party to the divorce proceedings&#x2014;that this should apply in cases where the person in charge of the children was either the innocent or the guilty party. I think that is right, because it is the child's interests that we are concerned with here. We propose that where payments have been made by the divorced husband in respect of the children over a reasonable period before his death, the payment shall be made up to a maximum equivalent to the child element in the widowed mother's allowance, that is 16s. 6d. for the eldest child and 8s. 6d. plus family allowances for the subsequent children, and up to the maximum of the amount that the husband was contributing before his death. That is a new benefit which will affect a very limited number of people but which will, on the other hand, within that limited number, deal with cases of very real hardship.<br/>
There are some provisions in Clause 6 with which I will not weary the House at this stage&#x2014;no doubt we shall discuss them later&#x2014;relating to children. I might, however, mention the variation made in Clause 6 in respect of the payment of guardian's allowance. As hon. Members know, the guardian's allowance is paid in respect of orphans who are taken into the families of other people. A difficulty has arisen in the case where there are step-parents. When the National Insurance Act was passed, step-parents had a liability for the support of their step-children. Therefore, the original Act&#x2014;in my view quite rightly &#x2014;provided that the existence of a stepparent should be a bar to the payment of guardian's allowance.<br/>
Since then, subsequent legislation swept away the legal liability of the step-parent to maintain his step-children. One such case was drawn to my attention by the hon. Member for Stechford (Mr. Roy Jenkins) a little while ago, where the existence of the step-mother, who had

never seen the child, provided a complete bar to the payment of the guardian's allowance to the child's grandparents who were looking after it. That will be dealt with. I have gone into it in detail, because it is a good example of the practical problems that have arisen over recent years in the operation of the scheme and which it is the object of this Bill to solve.<br/>
I think that I have given some idea of the general scope and purpose of the Bill, although I have not, for reasons which I gave in opening, sought to deal with each and every separate point that may arise. The main purpose of the Bill, as I have said, is to adjust and iron out difficulties which have arisen in the operation of the scheme. I do not suggest to the House that it is one of the great Measures of the Session or a Measure of major policy, but I do suggest that it is a useful but modest Measure for making necessary adjustments to deal with various difficulties that have arisen in our very intricate National Insurance scheme.<br/>
I am told that if the House accepts and passes the Bill it will benefit in their very different ways about 250,000 people. It is, therefore, not a wholly insignificant Measure. I think that it is a useful one. I think that it swill make our great National Insurance scheme work more smoothly and more fairly and, for that reason, I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

<p>I am sure that we all agree with the right hon. Gentleman's opening remarks that his predecessor Lord Ingleby was a very careful administrator of the provisions of the National Insurance Acts. We may not always have agreed with him on policy, but we gladly pay tribute to his care as an administrator. We should like also to pay tribute to the National Insurance Advisory Committee, whose various recommendations, although not all of them, unfortunately, will be implemented when this Bill becomes an Act.<br/>

<p>It is not for me to say anything stronger than that. This Bill is undoubtedly difficult in detail to understand. When reading through it, one becomes baffled occasionally and turns back to the Explanatory Memorandum in the hope that what one reads in the Clause really does carry through what is stated in the Explanatory Memorandum. These things we shall have to examine in Committee. I think that the difficulty of understanding the Bill in detail illustrates the complexity of the whole National Insurance scheme.<br/>
We all from time to time in our contacts with our constituents come up against what appear to be anomalies and against situations in which constituents had understood that there was a universal comprehensive National Insurance system which would provide them, in certain eventualities, with certain definite benefits who had then discovered that somehow or another they had not qualified for the benefits and were upset about it.<br/>
In one case, which the right hon. Gentleman will no doubt remember, his officers advised one of my constituents to pay contributions after widowhood in the hope of getting an insurance pension. She regularly paid the contribution, as she had been advised by his own officials, and it was found later that she could never pay sufficient contributions to qualify for the benefit and the right hon. Gentleman had to return the money to her. I am not complaining that anything unjust or illegal was done in that case, but that is the kind of case which comes forward fairly often and it is necessary to have a tidying up by a succession of amending Acts. The Minister said that the time for consolidation has not yet arrived, but there ought to have been brought forward now a more thorough and comprehensive review of the working of the whole system than we have had. We were disappointed at the hurried way in which the promise to have a review at the end of five years was only partially fulfilled by the late Government.</p>

<p>While dealing with that aspect of the matter, may I suggest to my right hon. Friend that it seems to me at least high time that we not only had tidyings-up, such as the one we are being offered today and to which I take no exception, but also an investiga-

tion into the much wider question of the tremendous volume of case law in the form of the Commissioner's decisions, which are becoming completely incomprehensible to those who have to administer the Acts and benefits. That seems to call for very wide review at the earliest possible time.</p>

<p>I dare say my hon. Friend is right. I am not a great expert on the Commissioner's decisions, although I know that there are several volumes of them. I hope that if he succeeds in catching the eye of Mr. Speaker, he may have an opportunity to develop that point.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman's explanation of the Bill has, I think, clarified our understanding of it. It is, nonetheless, a little difficult when immediately following such an explanation to talk off the cuff, as it were, about the details of the Bill. We shall read what he said today quite carefully before we come to the Committee stage, and even when we have reached it I am certain that my hon. Friends and I will have many points of detail which we shall want to explore in Committee.<br/>
Broadly, in so far as the Bill implements the recommendations of the National Insurance Advisory Committee, we are in agreement with it. We need to examine it in detail, but broadly we accept the implementation, in many of the Clauses of the Bill, of the recommendations of that Committee. Clause 1 is based on the recommendations in Cmd. 9752, the Report of the National Insurance Advisory Committee on the Question of Earnings Limits for Benefits. The principal recommendation concerning the size of the earnings limits was agreed to last year, and the Clause is designed to implement the second recommendation in the Report. We recognise that that will be an improvement.<br/>
The form of the Clause, however, seems to give extremely wide powers to the Minister. The person who elects to return to employment, having previously retired, may do so in accordance with "such conditions as may be prescribed." The regulations which have to be made may make
<q>such modifications of the principal Act or this Act &#x2026; as may appear to the Minister to be necessary or expedient &#x2026;</q>


These are very wide regulatory powers when they permit the Minister to make modifications of the very Bill under which they are made. I hope that when we discuss in Committee that subsection of Clause 1 which concerns these regulations, we shall have the opportunity of having a fuller explanation of what is in the Minister's mind about the regulations before they are made.<br/>
I know that the right hon. Gentleman said that regulations of this kind are put before the National Insurance Advisory Committee for its consideration before they are promulgated, but on this occasion, when the Bill is in Committee, we shall ask to consider whether it is proper that the right hon. Gentleman should have such wide powers to make regulations. Although, eventually, the regulations may go before the Advisory Committee, I think we undoubtedly feel that a Committee of the House of Commons should have a better idea, before it approves of the proposal, how wide these regulations will be.<br/>
As the right hon. Gentleman correctly said, two main questions are raised by the Clause. I recognise that the Clause will undoubtedly carry out the recommendations of the Advisory Committee. That Committee suggested that, in the first instance, the right to elect to de-retire should be granted once only, but it went on to say that powers should be taken to provide for more frequent elections to de-retire. I was glad to hear the Minister say today that he had in mind to give a second or possibly even more than a second opportunity so to elect, in the light of experience to come of the working of this first proposal. That coincides exactly with what the Advisory Committee said, and I doubt very much whether anyone will wish to object to it.<br/>
The other principal point arises on the question of de-retirement where the wife is drawing a pension in her own right, given to her as her own pension. It is whether, when the man retires, he should be able to elect to deretire on his own or whether he should have his wife's consent. In the event of dispute, experience suggests that each partner will think the other unreasonable. If a dispute arises between the couple in these circumstances, the wife may think it unreasonable or unwise for her husband to go

back to work. If she refuses her consent, he undoubtedly will think her unreasonable. I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman is glad that the framework which we have arranged for National Insurance means that these matters will be decided by statutory bodies and not by the Minister. In matters pertaining to the Royal Warrant he has to make a decision on his own. I am sure that he is glad that that is not so in this case.<br/>
Accepting the Minister's assurance that it fulfils the Explanatory Memorandum, I have no criticism to make of Clause 2. Equally, in respect of Clauses 3, 5 and 6, which implement the recommendations of the Advisory Committee's Report on the Question of Dependency Provisions in Cmd. 9855. We welcome the acceptance of the recommendations and their implementation. It is interesting to hear that the major cost of the various improvements for beneficiaries under the Bill arises here. It is also interesting to note that the recommendations of the Committee are accepted, as far as we can see, in full except for a few minor ones concerning staying in hospital and the like. I assume that those recommendations are omitted from the Bill not because they are not accepted, but because, as the right hon. Gentleman said, they could he put into force by regulations without necessitating amending legislation.<br/>
The Advisory Committee made several recommendations of that kind. Recommendations 3 and 4 of the Report are not referred to in the Bill. We presume that they are either not accepted or are to be put into operation through the legislative powers which already exist. If the Joint Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance is to reply to my hon. Friends' questions, I hope that she will consider these points. I refer in particular to page 29 of Cmd. 9855 and recommendations 3 and 4. These recommendations do not appear in the Bill. I freely confess that I could not quite understand why, or what had become of them.<br/>
Clause 5 certainly seems a considerable improvement on the existing situation. It is clearly a great improvement in the condition of certain children that on the death of the father of the child the divorced woman may continue to receive for the child what the father paid. This is subject to a maximum amount. In


reading that maximum in the Bill, one is reminded of what I consider to be, and have described on more than one occasion, the inadequacy of present rates of allowances for children all the way through our system of National Insurance and of National Assistance.<br/>
I do not consider these allowances at their present level to be sufficient, despite all the arguments that the members of a family living together can live more cheaply than the same number of individuals living separately. I do not think any of the dependants' allowances for children in any part of our system of National Insurance and National Assistance are satisfactory. One is forcibly reminded of that fact by the maximum of 16s. 6d. laid down in this Clause.</p>

<p>We can argue on another occasion the matter of the adequacy of these figures, but I take it that the right hon. Gentleman will not dispute the line taken in the Bill, that the maximum here should be the same as that for the child element in the general provisions for the widowed mother's allowance?</p>

<p>No, certainly not. I was merely saying that in passing. I am not criticising that provision in particular in this Bill. Evidently this allowance must be at the same rate as the others. There would be little case for claiming any differential treatment here.<br/>
I thought, too, that Clause 6 was very much to be welcomed and that the spirit of acceptance of the Advisory Committee's recommendation was a good one. Clause 7 also seemed to me to constitute a welcome improvement.<br/>
I have gone through all those Clauses rapidly because I do not wish to take up too much time on this Bill, the greater part of which is non-contentious. I have deliberately left to the end what I have to say about Clause 4. The right hon. Gentleman, in speaking of Clause 4, referred to difference of opinion among persons unspecified about what should be done about unemployment benefit received by short-time workers, and said that he felt that his proposal lay midway between differing points of view and were, therefore, about right. I do not know whom it may have been he was thinking of when referring to the difference of

opinion, or what people may hold these opinions&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>I had better refresh my memory of that before we go into Committee on the Bill. It was certainly not the opinion of the National Insurance Advisory Committee. The Advisory Committee made no recommendation on this. The rest of the Bill fulfils recommendations of the Advisory Committee. This Clause does not. It is the Government's own policy, and it is not backed by the Advisory Committee.<br/>
As long ago as 1953, the then Minister presented to us the Report of the Advisory Committee on "The Availability Question". In the paragraph headed "Five-days a week worker", the Committee said:
<q>Under the present regulations a five-days a week worker is not ordinarily entitled to unemployment benefit in respect of his usual idle day, but if he is unemployed for one of the five days on which he normally works, he is entitled to benefit in respect of this day and also in respect of the day on which he is usually idle. We have considered the possibility of an alteration to the regulations, but since two days is the minimum period provided in the Act in respect of which unemployment benefit is payable, all that could be effected by a change would be to deprive a five-days a week worker who worked on only four day, in the week of title to any unemployment benefit in respect of the day lost.</q>
The Advisory Committee in that Report dismissed the suggestion that anything be done about this.<br/>
It presented another Report in November, 1955, on "Benefit for very short spells of unemployment or sickness," and in that it said:
<q>As things now stand, we find ourselves almost equally divided as to whether or not there should be an extension of the full normal extent rule by providing that unemployment benefit should never be paid for a day on which a person does not normally work.</q>
The members of the Advisory Committee were divided. There was some difference of opinion, though I do not know who held which opinion in that Committee. However, although there was a difference of opinion as to whether any change


not a particular change, but any change &#x2014;was required the members of the Committee said:
<q>We are agreed, however, that where an existing right to benefit is at issue, we should not recommend its removal save by a substantial majority of opinion. Accordingly we do not recommend any departure from the present provisions</q>
There is a principle laid down unanimously by the Advisory Committee, that where an existing right to benefit is at issue we should not recommend its removal save by a substantial majority of opinion, and the Minister treads on very dangerous ground, I think, when he departs from that principle, which was agreed by his own Advisory Committee. Why, in the light of that feeling of the Advisory Committee, why, in the light of that very reasonable principle that we should not deprive people of something they have already got unless there is a substantial majority of opinion behind the proposal, does he now introduce this proposal?<br/>
He spent very little time on this Clause. I must warn him that we shall have to spend a great deal more time on it before we dispose of it in Committee. He did not tell us what is the size of the problem. If there is some large new problem arising to very grievous dimensions, and if he feels everybody is not aware of it and that he ought to bring our attention to it, why did he not tell us so, and why did he not tell us the size of it?<br/>
How large will be the saving to the National Insurance Fund by this proposal? He did not say. We know from the Explanatory Memorandum that some unspecified saving may be expected, because we are told that the increased expenditure arising from other, good Clauses of the Bill
<q>will be likely to be in part offset by reduced expenditure on unemployment benefit.</q>
How much is to be saved?<br/>
How many five-day weekers register when they are unemployed for the last two days of the week? If they do not register as unemployed the problem does not arise. They are unavailable for work; they have not registered; they do not qualify for benefit. How many five-day a week workers have been registering during a recent six months or twelve months? Is the number so sub-

stantial as to induce the Minister to feel that some new problem has arisen since the Advisory Committee made its Report in November, 1955? Unless he can say that, he has not a shadow of justification for depriving people of an existing right.</p>

<p>I was saying that the Minister, in the proposals contained in Clause 4, is asking the House to deprive many persons of a right to benefit which they now possess and that he has not given us any estimate of the numbers of persons likely to be affected. We have yet to be convinced that there is any problem at all here, any problem of any dimensions that is to say. Even if there were a problem of dimensions, we should have views about the way the right hon. Gentleman has chosen to tackle it. We certainly want to hear from the Joint Parliamentary Secretary, if she can tell us, what the dimensions of the problem are supposed to be. How many persons are registered among this category of short-time workers, five-day week workers, or however they are described? Men who wish to claim unemployment benefit cannot do so unless they register; but even when they register they must satisfy the condition of being available for work.<br/>
That has been the accepted test for receiving unemployment benefit since


1935. Why has it become insufficient now? The trade unions, I know, have no objection whatever to applying the test of availability for unemployment benefit. They accept that well-established method of determining whether benefits should be paid and see no reason in present circumstances for any change in that situation. They see no abuse of any dimension likely to develop. In any case, they certainly do not agree to be deprived of benefit in this way unless it can be shown that the availability regulations are not a completely satisfactory way of preventing any injustice or collusion taking place.<br/>
The Government are asking power to declare that a man who normally does not work on one working day per week when employment is good shall be deemed to be not available for work on that day when times are bad, even when he is unemployed and has proved unemployment by registering. How are the Government to ascertain whether, to quote the words of the Bill, "in the normal course" a man would not work? How are they to know who these people are who "in the normal course" would not work on a particular day in the week? Who is to tell them? How are they to find out? Can they expect the individuals to tell them? Are they going to make inquiries of all the employers in the country? Are they to make some assumption based on general knowledge of existing agreements between employers and workers? Whichever way it is adopted, it seems to us that it will be administratively rather complex and administratively rather costly.<br/>
Has the Minister made an estimate of the extra administrative cost likely to be involved in applying the new regulation he proposes? Has the Ministry of Labour adequate staff in the offices which pay the benefit to find out in every detail exactly what is the position? Will there not be endless disputes between the individual concerned who is denied the benefit and the Department as to whether or not "in the normal course" he would not work on any particular day? We should like to know whether any estimate is being made, not merely of the size of the problem, but of the difficulties and costs likely to be involved in manpower in administering the proposed regulation.<br/>
Special regulations applicable to only one sort of labour are inevitably difficult to administer. They breed resentment because they discriminate. A discrimination is proposed here between the type of person who normally does not work on a certain day of the week and other types of worker. Other types are dealt with by the availability regulations and do not get the benefit if they are not available, but this type will not get the benefit because normally he does not work on one particular day. Discriminations of that kind breed resentment.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman told us that he was doing this simply to correct an anomaly. I wonder if he realised the full significance of the word he used? I wonder if he realised what memories that word "anomaly" arouses among workpeople, especially among those old enough to remember the twenties and thirties? Trade unions undoubtedly fear that this attempt to correct a so-called anomaly&#x2014;the size of which we do not know and are not told&#x2014;will cause a return to the difficult, bitter and resentful days of the anomalies regulations which existed in the twenties and caused so much discontent and unhappiness. They feel, they tell us&#x2014;and I am sure they have told the right hon. Gentleman &#x2014;that it would be far better to rely on the broad, general and agreed rule of availability.<br/>
We dislike very much this proposed change in the existing rules, this proposed deprivation from benefit of people who at present have the right to receive it. We cannot fully understand why the Minister should feel&#x2014;if he does feel&#x2014;that it is in the general public interest to introduce such a regulation at this time. Is it because he believes there is some measure of collusion between employers and employed in trades where there is some diminution of employment, perhaps for the time being? Is it because in an industry where there is some diminution employers wish to hang on to the labour they have, fearing that otherwise it might disappear and that they fix up arrangements for shorter working weeks designed to give workpeople unemployment benefit and thereby keep them in the neighbourhood available for that industry at the time when its fortunes may improve?<br/>
It does not follow that every time there is a short-time working there is


a surplus of labour which ought to be dispersed and encouraged into other employment. There may be occasions, of course, when a genuine surplus of labour will develop. In such a situation, one would agree that special agreements designed to keep an unnecessary amount of labour attached to an industry would be against the public interest.<br/>
Certainly agreements which have the effect of keeping a certain amount of labour attached to the industry cannot always be of that type. There must be occasions in the short term where a temporary depression in the demand for the products of an industry reasonably justifies, in the national interest, that people should remain in the industry and regard themselves as employed by the industry, working part-time in the industry and waiting until times improve and they can work full-time.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman should distinguish between the short and long terms. If he has evidence of the existence of what appear to be long periods of surplus labour attached to particular industries, and if the Government feel that such a surplus is against the national interest, the proper way to tackle the situation is not by a change in the unemployment regulations, thus depriving people of rights which others have and of rights which they have been enjoying for some time, causing bitterness, resentment, annoyance and a sense of grievance among trade unions and their leaders, but by having the Minister of Labour and not the Minister of National Insurance approach the employers and employed in the industry.<br/>
I am not saying that such a situation exists. If it does, then the Minister of Labour should approach employers and employed in such an industry and say, "The effect of the agreement which you have made between yourselves for a five-day week, or whatever it may be, in existing circumstances is resulting in a larger volume of labour being attached to your industry than can permanently find full-time work in it. In your own interests you ought to revise these agreements, or among yourselves agree on declarations of redundancy which will allow some of the workpeople to be free to find work elsewhere."<br/>
I could not cite an industry where a surplus of labour exists, but if such a

situation arose, or has arisen, then the proper approach is for the Minister of Labour to ask the employers and employees concerned to consider their agreements about short-time working and to modify them in the national interest. He should approach both sides together and put the point of view of the national interest before them. It should not be done by back-door methods by the Minister of National Insurance, so causing annoyance and resentment.<br/>
I know that some of my hon. Friends want to develop this topic and some have great experience of dealing with it as members and officials of trade unions. I shall say no more, except that although in general we like the Bill, we dislike Clause 4 very much indeed, and we shall seek in Committee to get rid of it if we can. If we cannot, we hope to persuade the Minister to modify it. I seriously suggest to the Minister that he should think again about this matter. He should give very careful consideration to the representations made to him by the Trades Union Congress.<br/>
We feel that we cannot divide the House on the Second Reading of the Bill, which, as the right hon. Gentleman said, improves the condition of two million people. It makes substantial improvements for many people and we welcome it on that account, but we very much dislike the wholly unnecessary change in the present unemployment benefit regulations which it is proposed to make in Clause 4.</p>

<p>I should like to begin in the way the right hon. Member for Middlesbrough, East (Mr. Marquand) began and refer to the immense complications of the National Insurance scheme as we have it today. Certainly, the number of regulations and different cases which can arise are such as not only to fill the postbags of Members of Parliament, but also to cause a great deal of worry to people who try to obtain their rights under the scheme. Although I sincerely welcome the Bill, it seems to me that it may have the by-effect of making yet one more complication in a situation which already defeats the understanding of many people.<br/>
Whenever I try to talk in my constituency about National Insurance, the


evening invariably ends with a long discussion about the earnings rule and retirement and what retirement really means. That is not helped, unfortunately, by the fact that so many of us, without thinking, still talk about "old-age pensions" instead of "retirement pensions." I hope that the extra complication which Clause 1 and Clause 2 bring into the Bill will not cause more distress to people who are considering whether or not they should retire.<br/>
I presume that the aim of Clause 1 and Clause 2 is to encourage people to stay at full-time work as long as their health and their desire enable them to do so. I presume that this is upon two grounds: first, that we have an ageing population; and, secondly, that we want children to remain at school for longer than was the case in the past. It is, therefore, essential that we should all work for as long as our health enables us to do so and that we should give every encouragement in the National Insurance scheme towards prolonging our working life.<br/>
Apart from helping us to help ourselves with the pensions increments which can be earned, the Bill gives a chance to "de-retire"&#x2014;I, too, could not think of an alternative to that word; I would that I could. I should like to welcome this proposal to help those who have retired, when in had health, not having fully realised what retirement was, or, in some cases, having retired at the minimum age, because they thought that was the only thing to do&#x2014;and there are still such people in the country&#x2014;to go back to work.<br/>
The Bill is an improvement in the National Insurance scheme and I am very glad that so many improvements which will affect people in the first five years of their potential retirement have come from a Conservative Government, particularly from my right hon. Friend the Minister. Although, in a Private Member's Measure, we increased earnings under the earnings rule from 40s. to 50s., we had the institution of the gradual deductions from the pension, instead of the total deduction, and we are now in a position whereby a man having retired within the first five years of his pensionable age can still earn up to &#x00A3;5 a week without finding that his pension is no good to him. Those who wish to earn more than &#x00A3;5 a week&#x2014;and, after all, &#x00A3;5 a week is not

an enormous wage in these days&#x2014;will find the de-retirement provisions of the Bill very useful.<br/>
While giving the Bill that welcome and bearing in mind its main purposes, it has not gone far enough. I do not think that having an earnings limit of 50s., and the possibility of de-retirement, will be enough to encourage people to stay at work after the minimum retirement age. If a person does stay at work after the minimum retirement age, and if the incentive for each complete year's extra work is to receive, when he finally retires, an extra 3s. a week for a single person and an extra 5s. a week for a married man, then, quite frankly, I do not regard that as being particularly attractive.<br/>
It is not at all attractive for anyone who can do simple arithmetic, and I do not pretend to be able to do the complicated kind of arithmetic which the hon. Member for Sowerby (Mr. Houghton) has undoubtedly done in relation to this Bill. Let us take the case of a single employed male person who works from 65 to 70. During those five years, he will sacrifice 40s. a week retirement pension, a total of &#x00A3;520. He will have paid 6s. 9d. a week extra for five years in National Insurance contributions, which makes a total of &#x00A3;87 15s. The total of these two figures is &#x00A3;607 15s., which he has paid to or permitted to remain in the National Insurance Fund. Then, the man retires on a pension of 55s. a week.<br/>
Until he has lived and drawn this 55s. a week for 221 weeks, which is over four years, he will not have recouped the pension which he voluntarily relinquished and the extra contributions which he paid between the ages of 65 and 70. If we start doing one of these very complicated sums, whereby we consider the &#x00A3;2 a week he would have been drawing throughout the 221 weeks, we find that it is virtually impossible for anybody who does not become an octogenarian to make anything on this scheme by staying at work.<br/>
The position of a married man is as bad. He forgoes five years' pension at 65s. a week, a total of &#x00A3;845, and pays a further &#x00A3;87 15s. in National Insurance contributions, and then retires on a pension of 90s. a week. He has to live for over 207 weeks to recoup himself for the


pension which he voluntarily relinquished and the extra contributions he paid, whereas he would have got &#x00A3;2 a week during these 207 weeks anyway.<br/>
The same is true of the self-employed person, though his extra contributions are, of course, higher. They total, not &#x00A3;87 15s., but &#x00A3;109 18s. 4d. Therefore, if he is single, he has to draw an increased pension for 229 weeks, and if married for 212 weeks, to recoup himself for the pension which he voluntarily relinquished between the ages of 65 and 70 and the extra contributions which he paid during those years.<br/>
I apologise for wearying the House with these figures, but I believe that it is an essential part of this effort which we are all jointly making to encourage people to stay at work after the age of 65 that the increment should be raised from 3s. to 5s. and from 5s. to 7s. 6d. a week if it is to prove attractive financially to people to de-retire and take advantage of this Bill.<br/>
We have also to remember one other thing. The National Insurance retirement pension is not a living wage. It does not give a standard of living upon which anyone can be expected to live, and, thank God, no one is expected to live on it. This means that there is a wide range and a wide gap between the retirement pension level of 40s. a week and the total income of the person who does retire on pension, plus the maximum possible from the National Assistance Board. If the total income of a person from the two sources, of basic retirement pension and earned increment on top of it, comes in this range between the basic retirement pension and what one gets from the basic retirement pension and the National Assistance Board, then one begins to wonder what is the point of doing this work at all.<br/>
Therefore, I believe that if this scheme of de-retirement is to be as successful as my right hon. Friend hopes, we shall have to introduce a Bill to increase the increment which a person receives by working after the minimum retirement age. In so far as the de-retirement provisions stand, I heartily welcome them.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Middlesbrough, East came to the more contentious part of the Bill, namely, Clause 4, and wondered why my right hon. Friend had included this Clause in the Bill, when

the National Insurance Advisory Committee not only did not recommend that it should be included, but by implication, suggested that it was not prepared to suggest that it should. I think that here, if I read the mind of my right hon. Friend aright, one has to consider the Bill as a whole.<br/>
I presume that when my right hon. Friend started to draw up this Bill, he had to bear in mind the very substantial annual deficits into which the National Insurance Fund will in the coming years begin to move. I presume that he therefore decided that it was essential that, in any Bill which he brought forward to ameliorate the conditions of certain people under the National Insurance scheme, the extra expense which he incurred would have to be balanced by the savings of which he could make.</p>

<p>I am sure that the hon. Member will realise the danger of what he is now putting forward. To begin with, when the National Insurance scheme came into existence, we took over from the old unemployment insurance scheme several scores of millions of pounds which had been accumulated during the war, and ever since 1946, taking the unemployment part of the fund, there has been a continuing increase in the surplus of the fund. I am, therefore, asking the hon. Gentleman whether lie is now suggesting, in considering the problem of retirement pensions, that to meet that deficit we should reduce the provisions for unemployment, sickness and other benefits?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-03-21a.592.1" hansard_membership_id="4656" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/15098" speakername="Mr. Freeth" colnum="592" time="">
<p>I do not think that when the right hon. Gentleman reads my speech tomorrow, as I am sure he will, he will come to the conclusion that that was what I was suggesting. What I was suggesting was that, taking National Insurance as a whole, my right hon. Friend came to the conclusion that it would be improvident, unless the contributions were raised, to increase the deficit into which the fund as a whole will be moving over the next five, ten or twenty years.<br/>
I do not know whether this is one of the reasons which led him to look particularly carefully at the amount of unemployment benefit paid at present to a man working a five-day week if he is on short-time and, in fact, works for only four days a week.<br/>
I listened with special interest to the right hon. Member talking about the effects of Clause 4 upon workers who were working short-time, and upon the question whether it would encourage them to move away from the jobs in which they were working short-time to try to obtain full-time employment in other industries, or in the same industry in other places. When an industry goes on short-time, as a rule it is certainly for the good of the worker and also for the country that he begins as soon as possible to work in a full-time job again.<br/>
If there are any signs that the period of short-time is likely to be prolonged every encouragement should be given to workers on short-time to try to find full-time employment. If we are trying to encourage people to move from luxury industries to basic industries, and from industries catering purely for the home market into industries which are primarily manufacturing goods for export, it is prudent to look at the encouragements and discouragements which exist in the way in which a National Insurance Fund deals with persons on short-time.<br/>
There was an anomaly here, because a man who is on a six-day or five-and-a-half-day week has never been able to draw unemployment benefit during a week in which he lost one day's work. I fully appreciate the argument of the right hon. Gentleman that there is always the danger that people will misunderstand one's motives, and feel that in this case a benefit which they have enjoyed for some time is being taken away, and not for the highest motives. I believe, however, that it is occasionally right to run the risk of having one's motives misunderstood, or even misrepresented; indeed, I believe that there has been substantial misunderstanding about Clause 4, and in some cases I think that there has been misrepresentation, whether deliberate or otherwise I do not wish to say.<br/>
I hope that my hon. Friend the Joint Parliamentary Secretary has read a Report which appeared in the <i>Leamington, Warwick, Kenilworth and District Morning News</i> on Monday, 4th March, during the recent by-election. It referred to a meeting of the party opposite at which one Socialist speaker told an

audience, estimated at over 500, that by the Bill workers on short-time would get no unemployment benefit at all.<br/>
The report quoted the speaker as saying:
<q> What has happened is this&#x2014;the Conservatives have just published a Bill amending the National Insurance Acts in which Clause 4 provides that no worker on short-time can draw any benefit at all.</q>
In fact, a person working a five-day week will find that if he is on short-time and only works a four-day week he will receive no benefit, just as, at present a person working a six-day or five-and-a-half-day working week does not receive unemployment benefit if he loses only one day's work a week.<br/>
The speaker was also reported as saying:
<q> Even if you work a single day in any one week you cannot draw benefit under the new Bill.</q>
That is certainly a misrepresentation. I do not know the motives with which it was made&#x2014;it may have been a complete misunderstanding&#x2014;but the effect of such a speech in an area where there is substantial short-time working must be fairly obvious, especially during a by-election campaign.</p>

<p>Certainly, and on this occasion I feel that it is fairly obvious that many of the electorate misunderstood many of the excellent aims of my right hon. Friend.<br/>
I should like my hon. Friend to tell me whether or not I am right in assuming that the Bill does not change the legal effect, as determined by the independent statutory authorities, of guaranteed week agreements upon the unemployment benefit rights of workers on short time, even in respect of five-day week workers with guaranteed week agreements.<br/>
I welcome the Bill because it provides an additional incentive&#x2014;although I do not believe that it is nearly large enough &#x2014;to people who are over the minimum retirement age, and who might be encouraged to work longer. I welcome it for another reason, which I shall not go into in detail, namely, that the wives of men on sickness benefit who wish to earn more than 20s. a week and still qualify


for the dependant's increase will be able to do so. I welcome it, further, for the provision with regard to mothers of children of dissolved marriages, who will receive a special allowance under Clause 5 upon the death of their ex-husbands. All those provisions are excellent, and I believe that most hon. Members will agree with them.<br/>
Despite what the right hon. Member for Middlesbrough, East has said, I would still welcome the Bill as a whole. One of my reasons is that no additional expenditure is to be imposed either upon the Exchequer or upon the National Insurance Fund.</p>

<p>We on this side of the House welcome, of course, what is good in this Bill, the general effect of which is to implement the recommendations of the National Insurance Advisory Committee. Clauses 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 all implement recommendations of that Committee. As the Minister pointed out, some of the recom-

mendations do not require legislation and could be made by regulation. The right hon. Gentleman said that regulations were being prepared for that purpose. But in this Bill there is an "ugly duckling." It is Clause 4, which is alien to the whole tone and spirit of the Bill. I will discuss that Clause a little later.<br/>
The hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Freeth) referred to the inadequate encouragements to people to postpone their retirement and stay at work. There is no doubt that the encouragements are inadequate, but one of the difficulties about improving the inducement to stay at work by adding to the pension on eventual retirement is the unfairness that may be created between those insured persons who can stay at work and those who cannot.<br/>
At all events, it is very dangerous to load or weight the benefits heavily in favour of the man who stays at work to the possible disadvantage of the man who must retire. That is especially true of men in heavy industry who cannot easily extend their working life, or those who are compulsorily retired whether they want to retire or not, and who find it difficult to get any other work.<br/>
These are difficulties which are bound to engage the attention of all concerned with stocktaking after ten years of the operation of the National Insurance Scheme. Nor do I think it would be right to give more favourable inducements to re-enter employment after retirement than those given to insured persons to postpone their retirement. I think it right that the Bill should provide the same conditions in both circumstances. I do not regard Clauses 1 and 2 as any particular inducement to people to reenter employment after having retired. I think it an option made to those who probably are going back to full-time work anyway. To that extent it is welcome. How far it will be taken advantage of remains to be seen.<br/>
About the recommendations of the National Insurance Advisory Committee on adult dependants, I am bound to express a personal disappointment&#x2014;I commit no one else in this&#x2014;that the Committee was not able to look more favourably on the representations made regarding benefits to the unmarried wife. There is nothing inconsistent in the plea


I make now and the support that I should gladly have given to the Private Bill introduced by the hon. Member for Davenport (Miss Vickers) had I not been unwell and unable to attend the House on the day when the Second Reading debate took place.<br/>
We have to be fair as between different claimants in different circumstances. But representations were made by the General Council of the T.U.C. that widows' benefit should be given to a female person living with the insured person as his wife. I am bound to copy that description for the sake of precedent from the regulations made during the war when married allowances were given to women who were in this position. There is a conventional objection to the use of the term "unmarried wife".<br/>
I know the difficulties about rival claims for benefit which would arise in some circumstances, if the dependency benefits were extended to cover this class of person. But some very hard cases can arise regarding both widows' benefit and dependants' allowances for a retired man. There was a particularly grievous case recently in my constituency. It involved a man who had last seen his wife over thirty years ago and had not heard from her since. He entered into a form of marriage with another woman and brought up a family. Long ago he had regarded himself as legally married to the person with whom he was living, and his children looked upon them as mother and father legally married. When this man reached the age of 65 the wife to whom he was legally married, who had at least kept a record of his birthday if nothing else, thought it time to write to the Ministry of National Insurance and state her claim for the wife's dependent benefit when the man drew his retirement pension.<br/>
As a matter of fact, by the time this matter was investigated the man had drawn some benefit and I pay tribute to the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance for not asking for the money back. I think that that was generous in the circumstances, because the man had no legal claim under the Act as it now stands. It would have been a grievously hard case had the Ministry demanded a refund of the money. I am sure that the essentials of that case are reproduced up and down the country.<br/>
It is very likely that the Ministry would not wish to be too heavily involved in these "judgments of Solomon" between rival claimants to benefit or a share of benefit. But it is already taking something on under the provisions of Clause 1, which come very near to adjudicating between man and wife. In any case, the Inland Revenue is confronted every day with these complexities and it does not shrink from them. There are rival claims for child allowance, separations, claims to be regarded as married or single, and so on. I am sure that the Ministry need not worry too much about the administrative complications.<br/>
I am not, of course, complaining about the Ministry. These proposals were decided against by the National Insurance Advisory Committee. I have said my word on that. I leave entirely aside&#x2014;as did the Committee&#x2014;the moral considerations in this matter, and try to deal with life as it is and to see how far they can meet the requirements of the situation. Apparently it was decided that it could not be done, at least not without a more radical review of the scope of dependency benefits than the Committee considered it was its duty to carry out.<br/>
Now I come to Clause 4, the "ugly duckling." I am sure that every Minister must be a little worried when one of his hon. Friends presumes to read his mind, because it is always almost certain that the reading will be wrong. I think that the hon. Member for Basingstoke credited his right hon. Friend with being more of an administrator and less of a politician than he really is. The truth is that Clause 4 was put into this Bill at the point of a gun, the gun being the threat of electoral abstension by Conservative Voters. Those were the people who got upset at what they saw going on last year, the short-time working, particularly in the motor industry, and the existing rule for unemployment benefit.<br/>
The National Insurance Advisory Committee considered this matter twice before, and the last time, before we were faced with serious short-time working in five-day week industries, so that it was reviewing the matter at an early stage, I admit under less pressure, let us say, than would be the case today. The National Insurance Advisory Committee found no satisfactory solution to this matter, at


least not one commanding overwhelming support in the Committee.<br/>
I would digress to say that recently I had my first experience of making representations to the National Insurance Advisory Committee, on matters not within the scope of the Bill and not before the House. I came away with a distinct impression of the care with which the Committee considers these complex matters. I have no doubt that it weighed up very carefully indeed, and spent a long time in looking at, this difficult problem of the complexities of unemployment benefit involved in a change from a five-and-a-half-day week to a five-day week arrangement.<br/>
It is a pity that the right hon. Gentleman did not consult the T.U.C. about it. He may think that he knows the views of the T.U.C. He had already had the benefit of reviewing the differences of opinion in the National Insurance Advisory Committee on two occasions. He may think that this was a matter on which Her Majesty's Government had to make up their minds and announce a decision to the House of Commons.<br/>
Was it quite as clear as that? Could not the right hon. Gentleman have approached the T.U.C. and said, "In present circumstances, more attention must be given to this matter. I want you to consider whether there are alternatives to the present arrangements. Can we see whether any of them is acceptable?" The right hon. Gentleman did not do that. The first that the T.U.C. heard about this was when the Bill was published. I am not saying that the Minister is under any obligation to consult the T.U.C. every time about everything, but here was a matter which was bound to come very close to trade union interests and to the interests of the workers. Since it had been the subject of consideration by the National Insurance Advisory Committee in the past it would have been better had the right hon. Gentleman taken that step. He might not have got any agreeable response, but he would have given the T.U.C. an opportunity of seeing whether something different might be done in the problem between the five-and-a-half day and the five-day working week.<br/>
The unfairness of the proposal in the Bill is that many workers on a five-day

week do just as many hours of work as they did in the five-and-a-half-day week. I have had some connection with this matter; in the case I have in mind, there is not the slightest doubt that we got a five-day week on condition that the hours of work in the five-and-a-half days were spread over five days. That means that each of the five days carries a higher factor in the week's wages than each day did under the five-and-a-half-day week arrangement; yet for unemployment benefit purposes the Bill proposes that if a man on a five-day week is unemployed for the Friday of the week he will get no unemployment benefit, even though he lost more than a day's wages, calculated on a five-and-a-half-day basis. This is an anomaly which is bound to be felt acutely.<br/>
The National Insurance Advisory Committee felt unable to recommend a departure from the present arrangements which fix unemployment benefit by the day. Of course, there is another factor which can be taken. I am not saying that it is free from difficulty. The fair thing would be to give unemployment benefit by reference to the proportion of the working week lost. That is the mathematics and the equity of the matter. It involves a departure from the traditional arrangement of unemployment benefit paid by the day. That I admit.<br/>
I only throw it out as a personal suggestion that the matter could have been looked at more carefully. If the Minister had it in mind to do something he could have asked the T.U.C. to find a satisfactory answer to the problem. He did not give it a chance to do so. When we come to the Committee I hope that the Minister will give further consideration to this matter and see whether he can find a different and fairer way out.<br/>
I know that, just looked at in the news, papers, or by "Pro Bono Publico" writing his letter to the newspapers, it seems wasteful to pay unemployment benefit for a day on which a person does not normally work, but unless unemployment benefit is adjusted to the distribution of hours a week over five days instead of five-and-a-half we cannot solve the problem by the method proposed by the Bill.<br/>
I hope that we shall find other ways of meeting this situation later. Even at its worst, even if the Minister were concerned about the short-time working arrangements


in the motor industry at a particular time, to save redundancy or a four-day week for some workers and complete unemployment for others, and to overcome a temporary situation, is there anything wrong about the existing method? Is it so lamentable? Was it not an attempt to meet special circumstances for a temporary period? After all, what is unemployment benefit for if not to meet unemployment and short-time working? It is to support the worker when his capacity for full earning is impaired by unemployment; that is the principle of it.<br/>
Goodness knows, the Insurance Fund has benefited to the tune of hundreds and hundreds of million of pounds on account of insurance contributions from the unemployment element being put much higher for a long time than actual unemployment warranted. In fact, benefits have been paid to every nationally insured person out of the favourable state of the funds created by the low unemployment ratio as compared with the actuarial computation of the unemployment factor in the total contribution. I do not think that any of these workers is asking for something that he has not paid in for, even in the arrangement, about which the Minister no doubt complains privately although he has not said so today, for short-time working.<br/>
That is the indictment against Clause 4. We shall want to examine the Clause critically in Committee. It would have been much better, in present circumstances, for the Minister to have left well alone. If there is any widespread extension of the kind of arrangement to which I have referred, the whole employment situation will be grave and other measures might have to be taken to deal with the social and economic consequences. There was nothing in this to give the Minister or the Insurance Fund any ground for concern, because it was purely temporary and transitional. If it had become more permanent the Minister might have thought something should be done about it.<br/>
All in all, the right hon. Gentleman would do better to withdraw the Clause altogether and to let things continue as they are. If he must go on with it and if he persists in his refusal to leave things as they are, he must expect that we shall give critical attention to the detail to see whether we can find an alternative.</p>

<p>It has rightly been said that the whole business of National Insurance as it concerns the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance today is very complex. This Bill certainly adds to the complexity. I felt that rather than speak in the debate I should like to put down the Bill, wave goodbye to my right hon. Friend and say, "See you later, legislator."<br/>
I congratulate my right hon. Friend upon inserting the controversial Clause 4 in the Bill. It could be another grasping of a nettle. It is obvious that people have been drawing unemployment pay for days on which they were not unemployed and for days on which they do not normally work. While some of us may not wish to be niggardly and quarrel about it, the problem is not the amount of money involved but the inequality as between individual workers.<br/>
Many of us know workers, normally working six or even seven days a week, who have been unable to draw unemployment pay, whereas a five-day week worker who works only four days is able to draw unemployment pay for the fifth day. The man who works six or seven days a week very often earns less money &#x2014;perhaps in the Post Office; certainly in the dairy trade&#x2014;than five-day week workers in the motor trade. That is very unfair.<br/>
It is extremely unfair when such people see Austin workers going home with &#x00A3;14 or &#x00A3;15 in their pockets after working four days and then being able to draw unemployment pay for the fifth day. "Unemployment pay" obviously means money given to prevent hardship during unemployment. If we are to pay unemployment benefit for days on which such people as I have mentioned do not work, why should we not pay it to a lot of other people who never work anyway?</p>

<p>Surely the logical conclusion to the hon. Gentleman's argument must be that if a man makes sufficient money in two days at work he does not need any unemployment benefit at all in respect of the rest of the week.</p>

<p>I represent not motor car workers but textile workers, who have a very low minimum wage. Would the hon. Gentleman apply the same argument to them? Will he remember that when they receive unemployment benefit in future it will be on the basis of one-sixth of a week and not one-fifth, so that they will lose it both ways?</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman has helped my argument. Surely the textile worker who is paid less than the motor trade worker does not like to think that the motor trade worker can go home with &#x00A3;15 in his pocket and also draw unemployment benefit. I should have thought that the hon. Gentleman would have seen the anomaly. I see it, although I do not know whether I should have seen it so easily had it not been drawn to my attention by constituents of mine who do not like the motor trade workers to take advantage of money which they themselves have paid into the fund through working six days a week all the year round. I should have thought that the Clause was a reasonable one.<br/>
I turn now to the subject of retirement pensions. If we were doing our job properly here, I suppose we should feel very much like increasing the old-age pension. I think that at heart we should all like to do so, although they are at a higher level than they have ever been, even taking into account the higher cost of living. I propose to take the facts as they are, and I accept the official figures.<br/>
The problem for any Government has always been where to obtain the money to pay increased retirement pensions. It is no use saying that the Government will supply the money. It is the people of the country who have to find it by some means or other. That brings us back to the problem of what is the highest level of retirement pension that we can provide.<br/>
We ought to look to the future. Thanks to the tremendous strides made in the medical world and in improved nutrition, people are living longer. I should like the retirement pension to be raised at once. I should like the ages at which the pension is paid raised by six months, making them 60&#x00BD; and 65&#x00BD; years respec-

tively. In another two years those ages could be raised by another six months perhaps. All the money so saved, and perhaps a little more, should be added to the retirement pension. None of it should be taken away; it should be given to those who draw pensions. I make this suggestion because it is obvious to anyone who realises how the average age of the population is increasing that some day it will have to happen, and the sooner it happens the better.<br/>
People are now living longer. In respect of the payment of old-age pensions, can we say that a person is now old at 60 or 65? People in my constituency have come to me in tears because they have had to retire at 65 from a job which they loved. Many say they are fit to continue at work, and one must admit that many of them look fit enough. I admit that there are types of employment which bear heavily upon people and in which they age more quickly than in others.<br/>
Sooner or later a Minister will have to face this problem of increasing the minimum age. Surely that is the obvious solution to the problem, which will be an ever-growing problem. The number of industries and the number of workers in industry, with the amount of money which they pay into the Exchequer, will not be able to pay decent pensions in thirty or forty years' time for the increased number of old people who will be on the books.<br/>
I hope that my right hon. Friend will look at this problem. I congratulate him again on the Bill. Indeed, I think he was rather too modest in his presentation of it, because I think it is more important than he made it out to be.</p>

<p>I certainly cannot follow the hon. Member for Selly Oak (Mr. Gurden) in congratulating the Minister on including the iniquitous Clause 4 in the Bill.<br/>
If I heard correctly the hon. Member's reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Accrington (Mr. H. Hynd), he seemed to be advancing the extraordinary thesis that people with low wages should receive unemployment benefit but that people who earned higher wages should not. That, I should have thought, was the logical conclusion to be drawn from his argument.<br/>
The hon. Member does not represent a motor car constituency. I do, and I can assure him that, however good they may be, employers in a motor car constituency are not philanthropists and that everything the men receive is a result of work done. I do not think that the point the hon. Member made was worth very much, because it does not seem to lead us anywhere.<br/>
The Minister ought to be told, if he does not know it already, that there is grave dissatisfaction, added to the other dissatisfaction which the Government have given, among the unions in Coventry over this Bill. As I understand&#x2014;and perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will correct me if I am wrong&#x2014;before the war benefit was paid only to those who were out of work for three days in six. That meant that the short-time worker on a four-day week was automatically excluded. In 1940, Mr. Ernest Bevin changed this rule to two days out of six.<br/>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Sowerby (Mr. Houghton) said, in 1953 the National Insurance Advisory Committee was asked to consider the provisions governing short spells of unemployment or sickness, particularly where a claimant was already receiving payments from his employer. Even though it was asked to do this, I believe it is correct to say that the Committee was unable to give any advice to clear up a very difficult situation, and that it proposed no change in the existing arrangements. If that background is correct, then I gather that the present position, before this Bill becomes law, is that a worker who wishes to claim unemployment benefit is required to prove that he is unemployed on two days within a period of six days.<br/>
We have a good deal of unemployment and short-time working in Coventry today. As recently as 11th March, as was revealed at Question Time in the House this week, we had 2,826 men and women wholly unemployed, with only 618 vacancies registered at employment Exchanges. My reason for making the point is that there is a widespread suspicion in Coventry, which I certainly share, that all this unemployment and short-time working&#x2014; itself a result of direct Government policy, for they have deliberately brought it about&#x2014; is causing

the Government to consider the whole question of the redeployment of labour.<br/>
The hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Freeth) spoke of workers moving from job to job. We on these benches have repeatedly asked a question which might now be put to the present Minister, because the problem concerns him as well as the Minister of Labour. The question is: are the Government prepared to discuss with the unions and the employers adequate guarantees for the maintenance and rehousing, under redeployment conditions, of redundant workers? I ask that because we believe that Clause 4 is brought forward as some means of achieving that end and as a means to prevent the Government from having to suggest remedies which would be more acceptable to the workers involved.<br/>
The Coventry District Committee of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions is very strongly of the opinion that the Government feel that if unemployment benefit continues to be paid as at present to men on short-time in certain industries, it will make them less mobile because they will be reluctant to change their jobs. The unions in Coventry see Clause 4 as a method of adding persuasion in order to force these men to change their jobs, and they feel very strongly about it.<br/>
As I expect the hon. Lady, the Parliamentary Secretary knows, for a number of years workers in the engineering industry have been disqualified from claiming benefit due to the wording of a guaranteed week agreement which operated in the industry. Mr. Harry Urwin, who is Secretary of the Coventry District Committee of the Confederation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Unions, said on 16th February that the unions had been working for years to devise a form of words which would ensure that short-time workers would qualify for unemployment benefit, within the framework of the present legislation, for odd days of unemployment.<br/>
At present, we have a great deal of industrial unrest in the country and we hear repeated requests from the benches opposite that the unions should be prepared to negotiate on industrial matters. In the case of the present dispute, we should obviously use the words "submit to arbitration" rather than "negotiate",


because the unions are already willing to negotiate.<br/>
This is a point which may not have struck right hon. and hon. Members opposite. As recently as 25th February, the Confederation resolved this very thorny problem of claiming for unemployment benefit with the Employers' Federation and workers in the engineering industry can now claim this benefit. The Government are asking unions to negotiate with employers. The unions have spent a long time doing so, and at last an amicable agreement has been reached. The moment the amicable agreement has been reached, if we can call 25th February "the moment", the Government step in and torpedo what is being done by introducing Clause 4.<br/>
I should be glad if the hon. Lady, in her reply, will state whether the unions are correct about this. They believe that Clause 4 will partly nullify the effects of the agreement which they have negotiated wtih the employers. I am glad that the right hon. Gentleman shakes his head, but I hope that we shall have a very clear statement from his hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary tonight.<br/>
The hon. Lady may not like this, but I must say it: we in Coventry feel that she does not entirely understand the position of the workers who are redundant in the motor car industry. I have brought with me a copy of HANSARD for 20th March, 1956. The debate on that day followed immediately on a speech made in Birmingham by the hon. Lady, in which she took very strong objection to the fact that people in the motor car industry were not prepared to move to other jobs at less pay. She thought they should go&#x2014;just like that.<br/>
Reference to column 1065 of HANSARD of 20th March, 1956, will show this and that I mentioned it again in column 1091. The workers in the motor car industry took strong exception to these remarks, so, if the hon. Lady is to reply to this debate, as I gather she is, I hope that she will bear it in mind when addressing herself to the question of redundant workers.<br/>
At present, a worker on short time can regard Saturday as a day of unemployment and can add it to any other day within a period of six days on which he

may be out of work. We believe that Clause 4 removes that right. Perhaps we could have some comment on that. I believe that the workers have had that right ever since unemployment insurance was introduced in 1911.<br/>
The Coventry District Committee stressed another point and asked me to get an answer from the Minister on it. The Committee says that a man can be employed for only one day in each week yet still be refused benefit for the other days of unemployment, because he is said to be covered by his guaranteed week agreement for four days of the week. This may all sound very complicated in the matter of detail, but the important point is that here is a problem that has been causing difficulty for a good many years.<br/>
As we see it in Coventry, at the very moment when an amicable agreement has been reached between the employers and the unions on a method by which short-time workers may receive unemployment benefit, the Government interferes by this legislation. The Confederation is afraid that by the passing of this Bill we will be cutting the benfit entitlement of the applicant by at least half, and will make it much more difficult for him to establish his claim to benefit. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, in common, I think, with all my colleagues on this side, I wish to protest most strongly against Clause 4, and express the hope that the Minister will have second thoughts about it.</p>

<p>Does not the hon. Lady think that the recent habit of negotiating for short time from a five-day to a four-day week in some parts of this highly-paid industry has become popular because of this very fact that the workers would still be entitled to draw unemployment pay for a day on which they never worked and would do so rather than move to other jobs?</p>

<p>That raises a whole host of issues. I can only say to the hon. Gentleman that I believe that the whole matter of the four-day and the five-day week should be settled by negotiations between the unions and the employers, and not by Government legislation.</p>

<p>If I do not follow the hon. Lady the Member for Coventry, South (Miss Burton) it is because when I am confronted by one with such a clear mastery of her own industry I know that I should be tackling an expert in a subject of which, unfortunately, I know nothing&#x2014;the employer-union arrangements in the motor car industry. I sometimes wish that we had some motor car factories near my own constituency, so that the people there could earn the high wages which, I believe, have been common for many years in Coventry.<br/>
Before I leave the complications of Clause 4 of the Bill, I believe that the views on the other side of the House might well be expressed by the closing remarks of the hon. Member for Sowerby (Mr. Houghton). They can, I think, be reasonably summarised as saying that Clause 4 produces a marked change which he did not like. I shall leave it at that.</p>

<p>I want to welcome Clauses and 2 of the Bill and to put to the Minister what I, fear, he might not accept: an alternative to the word "de-retirement", which we all detest. I would substitute "back to insurance". It is true that that phrase would add to the number of letters, but at least they would be English words, which "de-retirement" is not.<br/>
One reason I welcome this Bill has not often been referred to. It will give an additional chance to those who feel they want to start work again and so keep themselves in better health. We do not need doctors to tell us that retirement is an important cause of people's physical condition gradually deteriorating. A few months after they have retired, thinking that that will enjoy retirement, they do not find it at all to their liking, and they begin to go to pieces physically. Yet, as things have been since 1948, they have not been able to return to work and do what they themselves know would be good for them. I strongly welcome giving this additional chance to those who want to do what is helpful to their health.<br/>
The de-retirement proposal has rather more significance than has been made out generally this afternoon. It seems to me to be another step in the direction of moving away from the strict retirement conditions which Lord Beveridge proposed in his Report, and the Coalition Government accepted in a White Paper, and was incorporated in the 1946 Act. We started shuffling from the retirement pension with the loosening-up of conditions for occasional earnings on a graduated scale, introduced by a Private Member's Bill last year.<br/>
With this Bill we take another shuffle forward. By doing so, we show that after a practical experience of the problems of retirement now for over ten years we feel that the last word was still very far from being said in the 1946 Act. I hope that the Government will note this tendency, and encourage us to think more about these problems by allowing a debate on the Phillips Report.<br/>
One further small point which I wish to raise with my right hon. Friend is that, when he issues the regulations, I hope that he will not start off immediately by saying that there can be only one de-retirement followed by final retirement. I have never been to the Ministry's Newcastle office to see what is involved, administratively, but if it is practical to allow a fair number of retirements and de-retirements that would certainly help those who would like to work, and also be of great value not only in the seaside industries, which is an obvious example, but also in farming, where there is so much extra work required at certain times of the year.</p>

<p>As my right hon. Friend said, this Bill is a very intricate one and forms part of a very intricate subject. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Middlesbrough, East (Mr. Marquand) said that it is difficult to understand, and I sympathise with that view. The Bill is, indeed, technical and complicated.<br/>
All the comments which have been made in the debate this afternoon have been favourable towards the general provisions of the Bill, with reservations


about Clause 4, which the hon. Gentleman the Member for Sowerby (Mr. Houghton) called the "ugly duckling". Since no questions have been asked of me about the other provisions, I do not propose to take up the time of the House by referring to them, although I am well aware that hon. Members have made the reservation that they will want to discuss them further in Committee.<br/>
The Bill seeks to effect improvements and adjustments in the National Insurance and Industrial Injuries schemes. It arises mainly from the recommendations of the National Insurance Advisory Committee in its Reports, and many of those recommendations have already been implemented. With this Bill we shall have legislated for all recommendations which require legislation except death grant, the subject of the latest report which is under consideration.<br/>
As hon. Members will know, many recommendations of the Committee can be implemented by regulations; some are already in operation, and others we shall be submitting in draft to the Committee shortly. I hope that this answers the point raised by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Middlesbrough. East. For the two recommendations he particularly had in mind, Numbers 3 and 4 of the Report on Dependency Provisions, draft regulations are now in preparation.<br/>
As regards de-retirement, there is one point which I must mention. My hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Freeth) said that he hoped this would not add to the difficulties of those who must make up their minds whether they wish to retire or not. I hope that the provisions of the Bill will make it easier for people to understand both the retirement principle and the earnings rule. If they make up their minds and then find that they have made them up in the wrong way, the Bill gives them a second chance.<br/>
Both my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke and the hon. Gentleman the Member for Sowerby referred to the amount of pension the retirement pensioner would lose because of his return to work by pension forgone and by contributions he had to pay. The hon. Gentleman the Member for Sowerby really had his tongue in his cheek. His argument was fallacious, because he

chose, very carefully, to count in the pension. In fact, the man he is thinking of is foregoing pension because he is no longer retired; he has given up retirement for the moment and is earning full wages.<br/>
That, I hope, answers my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke also, who was concerned that a man would have to live for so many years after 70, if in the meantime he had foregone pension and paid contributions, to recoup himself on increments.</p>

<p>I am very grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way. This is really not just an academic exercise. The point has been put to me very strongly by a sub-postmaster in my constituency who tells me that many people come to him and say, "It is just not worth while doing all this work. I may die and I shall not get my money's worth from the National Insurance scheme".</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-03-21a.612.1" hansard_membership_id="12592" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/19587" speakername="Miss Pitt" colnum="612" time="">
<p>That is a risk which we all take with insurance. In particular, the expectation of life of a man of 65 is just about twelve years. The calculation which the hon. Member for Sowerby made was incorrect inasmuch as a man might expect to recoup nearly six times his stake in the years he would normally expect to live above minimum pension age. I hope that I have made that clear.<br/>
There is another point which occurs to me, which is of some importance. The man who forfeits pension, goes on working and earns himself increments, will enjoy these increments for himself, and perhaps for his wife, too, at the time when his age is rising and he will be most in need of any additional income for which he will have been able to insure.<br/>
I come now to Clause 4, which is the matter on which we have had argument. The purpose of the Clause is to remedy an anomaly. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Middlesbrough, East mentioned the word "anomaly," and said that there had been many difficulties in the past; but I wonder whether he would answer me this question. What is wrong with trying to put right something which is anomalous?<br/>
It is, I think, agreed that this particular provision is anomalous; it was not


visualised when the 1946 National Insurance Act was passed, because the five-day week was only just beginning then. The adoption of the five-day week has increased enormously in the years since 1946, until we have arrived at a stage when, as my right hon. Friend said, roughly half the employed population is on a five-day week.</p>

<p>Has any inquiry been made into this mater, which I should like to put to the hon. Lady? I have in mind workers who worked a five-and-a-half-day week, five clays and the half day on Saturday. They decided that they would rather go on to a five-day week. They arranged it by working longer on each of the five days. How many workers are in that position? If such a thing is general, it seems to me that this is not an anomaly which the Minister is trying to clear away. He will be doing a grave injustice to those people who are doing exactly the same hours of work, divided between five days instead of five and a half.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-03-21a.613.1" hansard_membership_id="12592" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/19587" speakername="Miss Pitt" colnum="613" time="">
<p>With respect, I really do not think that that has any bearing on our debate, although I can add, from my own experience, that in 1946, when a five-day week was introduced into the engineering factory in Birmingham where I earned my living, the number of hours for everybody concerned was reduced from 47 to 44. But even if it still continued at 47, it is the working week accomplished in five days.<br/>
The present "two in six" rule was introduced in 1940, as the hon. Lady the Member for Coventry, South (Miss Burton) reminded us, and assumed a working week of six or five-and-a-half days. It is important to bear in mind that, despite all the discussion about the effects of Clause 4, there remains the other half of the population still on a six-day or five-and-a-half-day week; such people are unable to claim for one day of unemployment. At present, when working four days or less, the five-day week worker can claim for Saturday although it is not a normal working day. The result is that he gets two days' benefit&#x2014; tax free, incidentally&#x2014; for the loss of one day's work. This has been much criticised because it is unfair to other contributors, the other workers who are

themselves still on a five-and-a-half or six-day week.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Middlesbrough, East, argued that if a man now working a five-day week is on short time and is available for work, it is very difficult to test. I agree, but the information we have in the Ministry is that very few, if any, of these workers not entitled to benefit, because perhaps of the agreement referred to by the hon. Lady the Member for Coventry, South, bother to register at the employment exchange.<br/>
These figures, also, are important and, I hope, answer one of the right hon. Gentleman's points: when the general engineering agreement which previously prevented benefit was changed in February, about 20,000 workers came to the exchange and declared themselves available for work and claimed benefit because they could now claim for two days. But before, when they knew there was no hope of benefit, they did not bother to register at all.<br/>
The Advisory Committee was asked as long ago as June, 1953, to review the question of short-time working. I emphasise this, because there have been suggestions from hon. Members opposite that my right hon. Friend had some Machiavellian intention in introducing Clause 4 in the last few weeks to counteract the change in the agreement concerning the working week. That is not so. The matter was referred to the Advisory Committee in June, 1953, to review the question of short-time working. The Advisory Committee discussed it fully and, as the right hon. Member for Middlesbrough, East has reminded us, its members were almost equally divided. "Equally" is the operative word. The Advisory Committee's Report was published in November, 1955, but it made no recommendation.<br/>
When the hon. Member for Sowerby stressed that in its Report the Advisory Committee said that it felt that it should not recommend except by a substantial majority of opinion, the point surely is that as a Committee its members felt that they should not make any recommendations unless there was a majority in favour of them. The Government of the day, however, are in a different position and they have come to the conclusion that payment for a day not normally


worked, when men do not intend or expect to work, is an abuse which must be remedied.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke said that he assumed that the Bill would not change the legal effect of agreements now in operation. That ties up with the point raised by the hon. Lady the Member for Coventry, South. The answer is that the Bill does not change the effects of those agreements, nor would we wish to try to do that. The effect will be that the five-day week worker, when on short time, will not be able to claim for Saturday. When he loses one day in a week, however, the question of whether he can claim benefit will depend on the pattern of his short-time working.<br/>
The five-day week worker is not necessarily debarred, although, I may add, the Government have been urged in some quarters to secure this. He is in the same position as the six-day worker, and will have to lose two days in six to qualify for benefit. If he loses two or more days in a week, he will be able to draw benefit. If he is unemployed for the full week, he will get a full week's unemployment benefit.<br/>
The new rule will not apply when the employment is terminated nor will it apply to the six-day week worker. That answers the question raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke, who raised the question of wrong reports and mis-statements which have been made in the Press concerning the possible effect of Clause 4.<br/>
I was asked a question concerning the size of the problem and how much we hope to save. The answer is that we hope to save very little, because we hope there will not be any short-time working. I was asked how many short-time workers were at present registered. As the right hon. Member for Middlesbrough, East will appreciate, that is the concern of the Minister of Labour. I am, however, advised that at the beginning of the year about 155,000 people were on short-time, and that by the middle of March the figure had declined to 100,000, in the manufacturing industries.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman asked what extra administrative cost would be involved. The answer is that there will

be very little extra. Although there may be difficulties and fringe problems to be solved, we do not expect to be involved in very much additional administrative cost, nor do we need any extra staff to deal with the changes. That answers another of the questions he asked.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman made the point that Clause 4 would breed resentment because, he said, it would make for discrimination among workers. There is, however, already discrimination between the six-day and the five-day worker. I should have thought that if there was resentment, it would be on the side of the existing six-day worker, who contributes for the five-day week man who draws benefit when on short time. In fairness to both classes of men, I think that the Clause has much to commend it.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman asked why we should introduce the Clause at this particular time. The short answer is that we had no previous opportunity. There has been no opportunity for legislation, through our Department, to introduce the Clause.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman interjects, "What about last year?" May I refresh his memory?<br/>
At the beginning of last year, my right hon. Friend, in putting the Report on Widow's Benefits before the House, said he was afraid that there was no possibility of legislation. Subsequently, in the Budget, the announcement was made of an increase in family allowances. So we were able to introduce a Bill. Because the matter was urgent and desirable, we introduced into that Bill the provisions to benefit widows. It was the right hon. Gentleman himself who assured us that he would co-operate in giving the Bill a speedy passage through the House, because we all wanted these things to be done; but we could not then introduce any other legislation which might delay it.<br/>
I hope that the right hon. Gentleman now understands the position.</p>

<p>That shows how wrong was the hon. Lady's hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Freeth) when he attempted to read the Minister's mind. He has had this rod in pickle for a long time and has been awaiting an opportunity to use it. He has now brought it


in alongside beneficent gestures to widows, dependants, children and the rest. That is the explanation of Clause 4. I hope that I have now shattered the hon. Member's illusions about his right hon. Friend.</p>

<p>I should hate to speculate on my right hon. Friend's mind.<br/>
I hope, however, that that intervention removes any suspicions and doubts, some of which have been voiced, that in introducing the Clause into the Bill my right hon. Friend had in mind any action directed against the motor car workers. That is not the case. I assure the hon. Lady the Member for Coventry, South, who said that the unions in Coventry saw Clause 4 as a means of causing their members to become mobile, that that is certainly no part of the intention behind the Bill. The question of mobility is one not for our Department, but for the Ministry of Labour.<br/>
The hon. Lady asked about agreements and their effect. Agreements are a matter for industry itself, for the employers and the employees to negotiate. Certainly, we would not wish to do anything that would preclude the introduction or extension of agreements, which are a very good thing in industrial relations. I think that the hon. Lady really answered herself when she said that the Confederation had resolved its thorny problem by altering the wording of its agreement to enable its members to benefit from unemployment pay when they really were unemployed. All that happens under the Bill is that the amount of unemployment pay by which they will benefit will be reduced directly in relation to those days of unemployment when they are not, and would not expect to be, at work.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-03-21a.617.2" hansard_membership_id="1934" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/13061" speakername="Miss Burton" colnum="617" time="">

<p>But it does not frustrate the agreement. Nothing upsets the agree-

ment. If the men are unemployed on days when they would normally work, they will get benefit. That is quite clear.<br/>
Hon. Members will wish to know when we hope to bring the Bill into operation. We shall need to make appointed days for almost every part of it. The dependency benefit for the wife whose earnings do not exceed 40s. can be dealt with, we think, within a week or two of the Bill receiving the Royal Assent. We shall need time to make an order and notify our offices of the operation of the date, but that aspect will come into operation first.<br/>
The other provisions cannot come into operation until the regulations are made. As hon. Members know, they must be submitted to our National Insurance Advisory Committee. Although the Bill mainly implements the Advisory Committee's recommendations, those were in broad terms and it would be an advantage to have the Committee's views on detailed provisions. We intend, however, to submit the regulations to the Advisory Committee soon after the Bill receives the Royal Assent.<br/>
It is expected that we can bring some regulations into operation within six to eight weeks after the Royal Assent is given to the Bill. It may be two or three months before the Advisory Committee is able to report on the remaining regulations, but we hope that we shall have all the provisions of the Bill in operation within six months of its receiving the Royal Assent.<br/>
As my right hon. Friend said, this is a modest Measure. The majority of its recommendations benefit the minorities amongst us. That is its main intention. I am very glad that it is to have a Second Reading today.</p>

<p>The Amendment in the name of the hon. and learned Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Hector Hughes)&#x2014;in page 1, line 23, to leave out "appointed day" and insert "seventh day of November, nineteen hundred and fifty-six"&#x2014;is out of order as it is beyond the scope of the Financial Resolution.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 2, line 3, after "unless", insert:
<q>the vessel conforms to such conditions as shall be prescribed regarding the standard of crew accommodation to be provided in any vessel in respect of which such a grant is made and".</q>
During the Second Reading of the Bill, which was very warmly welcomed by my hon. and right hon. Friends on this side, reference was made by my right hon. Friend the Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn) and many other hon. Members who spoke from both sides of the House to the standard of accommodation of crews. It seemed to us that if the Government had to spend the amount of money which they are proposing to do in giving grants to fishing vessel owners&#x2014;both the skipper-owners and the owners who are not sea-going owners, that is to say, generally speaking, the companies&#x2014;some regard ought to be had in the Bill to the conditions under which the crews work.<br/>
I think it would be agreed by everyone on both sides of the Committee that during the last 30 years, which covers my connection with the fishing industry, the standard of crew accommodation has been very greatly improved. As I said on Second Reading, when I first made contact with the herring drifter fleet in Yarmouth, I was really appalled at the crew accommodation. Today one can see

in my own port of Lowestoft wonderful trawlers being turned out of our shipbuilding yards, and one of the most impressive elements is the regard that is being paid to the accommodation and the amenities for crews.<br/>
This Bill is primarily concerned with conversion, and that obviously means in this connection the conversion of engines from steam to oil. Although that, of course, is the major object of the Bill, designed to eliminate from the trawler fleets and the herring fleets particularly the old steam drifter and the old steam trawler, it is related only to one section of the vessel&#x2014;to the drifting power, motive power and catching power of the vessel.<br/>
I am sure that we on this side of the Committee and, in fact, all hon. Members&#x2014;because this is not a political point &#x2014;will agree that if we are to have a contented fishing fleet, and if the object of the Bill is to be pursued to its best ends, we must have not only the remuneration as provided for in the subsidy, but also a standard of amenities for the crews. Those of us who have known drifters and trawlers in the old days cannot possibly be satisfied that men should be asked to go to sea under those conditions when the industry is being subsidised out of public funds. The Amendment is the very modest one that where the regulations are put before the House, whether by Statutory Instrument or any other means as the Minister shall decide, some regard shall be paid to the amenities of the men who actually catch the fish.<br/>
It is very pleasant to sit in a nice office or to be in the market or in a fish monger's shop, but our concern is for the men who go to sea and catch the fish in all sorts of weather. Many of us know what fishing can be like in the winter months, particularly in stormy weather and in the ice of the northern waters of the North Sea, although this Bill does not concern those above a certain northern latitude. In any case, we all know that the conditions can be pretty rigorous. For that reason, we thought it wise to ask the Government to accept this quite reasonable Amendment to ensure that before the grant is paid they shall be satisfied by certain standards.<br/>
It is not our business to prescribe those standards. The Minister's Department


has had a long experience in the standard of amenities that are available today. When we look at a modern trawler or trawler drifter&#x2014;if I may say so without undue modesty, those made in Lowestoft and those made for the Russian Government&#x2014;we find a very high standard of amenities in the accommodation for the crew.<br/>
We do not want to make this too controversial a matter&#x2014;I am sure that the Bill will achieve a great measure of acceptance on both sides of the House &#x2014;but we should like to ask the Minister that when he considers the regulations which he proposes to lay before us some regard will be paid to the standard of comfort and the amenities for the crews who go to sea.<br/>
I am quite sure that it is the wish of all of us to have a contented and happy fishing fleet. It is not only the financial awards that will make for the success of this Bill. The Bill is to encourage the development of the near water and herring fishing fleets, and the mere changing of engines will not attract men. The idea of this Bill, if I may be permitted to say so, is to retain in the herring industry those men who would drift into the white fish part of the fishing fleets and who, once there, owing to the subsidy, would not come back. We want to secure not only the financial rewards but to ensure that the personal comfort and the amenities of the men shall be safeguarded.</p>

<p>I hope that the Minister will see his way to accept the Amendment, which speaks for itself. Obviously, it is a beneficial one. It would not be right that public money should be advanced in respect of ships which were unfit for their purpose by reason of the lack of adequate accommodation for the crew. One would have thought that in drafting a Clause such as this, which provides that
<q>No grant shall be made in pursuance of a scheme under&#x2026; the principal Act in respect of expenditure incurred in the acquisition of a vessel unless an application for the grant is approved by the Authority or the Board &#x2026; </q>
some standard would have been provided for the Authority or the Board. No standard is provided, and that again is a defect in the Clause.<br/>
The Amendment provides a standard which would guide the Authority and the

Board. We merely ask that there should be a standard of crew accommodation which will be satisfactory to the crew and, <i>ipso facto</i>, satisfactory to the owner of the vessel, who naturally wants to have a vessel which is suitable for the purpose for which it is provided. Therefore, it seems to me that the words, which we seek to have incorporated, complete and round off the Clause. There is a defect in the Clause, the words make good the defect, and I urge the Minister to take that view and accept the Amendment.</p>

<p>I should like to support the Amendment, though I must say I am disappointed that we are not discussing the first Amendment on the Order Paper, which is designed to make the appointed day the 7th November, 1956. I am sorry that that Amendment should have been cut out, but I would not dare to challenge a Ruling by the Chair. I hope, however, that the Minister has not thought that I have forgotten the point. I hope that he also has not forgotten it.<br/>
The present Amendment has my wholehearted approval, but it is only right to say that the owners have certainly paid considerable attention to crew accommodation in the latest trawlers. I know that in my own area, where a considerable amount of new building has been done, even without the assistance of the Government in some cases, large sums of money have been spent in making these improvements. The hon. Member for Fife, East (Sir J. Henderson Stewart) has visited one or two places in the area, and I am sure that he will agree with me. We are not, therefore, criticising what has been done.<br/>
We seek, through the Amendment, to improve the accommodation in the old trawlers. No one can gainsay the fact that a considerable improvement must take place if we are to retain men in the fishing industry. One of the ways in which we can do that is to ensure that when grants are made the owners are asked to pay some attention to the accommodation provided for their crews. In so doing, the owners will be well paid, because there is no more contented man than the one who has his comfort looked after, especially in the arduous conditions in which men work in this industry. The


Amendment, though extremely modest, would make for a much more successful operation of the industry itself.</p>

<p>I support the Amendment, which has been so ably moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Lowestoft (Mr. Edward Evans) and so warmly supported by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Hector Hughes) and my hon. Friend the Member for Leith (Mr. Hoy). In recent years much has been done to improve the welfare of the workers generally. I have no fishermen or trawlermen in my constituency, but I have always been interested in industrial health and welfare. The Bill is designed to help, first of all, with the conversion of these ships so that the industry will be able to do its work better than it has been able to do it up to now.<br/>
There is, however, another important point. We must ensure not only that we keep the men who are already in the industry, but that we do everything possible to attract others to it. This is heavy and arduous work which calls for bravery and courage on the part of the men who are employed in it. Since that is the case, we should try to make the conditions for the men working in the industry as good as they can be made.<br/>
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Leith that we cannot criticise in any way the great steps that have been taken by the trawler owners who, in recent years, have been able to build new vessels for this work. We give them all possible praise, but by means of the Amendment we are trying to ensure that if Government money is to be spent to help the industry there shall be attached to that grant the condition that improvements shall be made in order that these men's work shall be more congenial than it is at present.</p>

<p>This is an important matter, and I am very glad that it has been raised and ventilated in this way. I realise the importance hon. Members opposite attach to it. It is very important that the conditions in which these men work should be adequate, and

I am very glad that tributes have been paid to work done in this direction on new vessels. It is very encouraging to know that that work has been done and that its importance has been recognised.<br/>
I ask the Committee to reject the Amendment, not because the Government disagree with the feelings expressed by hon. Members opposite, but because the Amendment would not do exactly what hon. Members have in mind. The Amendment would be directed towards new vessels, which are the very ones that are being dealt with already. I am advised that the Amendment in these terms would affect new vessels only.<br/>
In any case, this matter is already covered in other ways. A similar Amendment was proposed in Committee on the White Fish and Herring Industries Act, 1953, but it was withdrawn when the assurance was given at that time that conditions of crew accommodation would be provided for in the statutory scheme governing conditions of grant.<br/>
Section 9 (3) of the White Fish Industry (Grants for Fishing Vessels and Engines) Scheme, 1955, accordingly prescribes that vessels should conform with any standards laid down under the Merchant Shipping Acts and should make such provision for the accommodation of officers and crew as the White Fish Authority may require in conformity with the best modern practice, appropriate to the class of vessel concerned, for sleeping, messing and sanitary accommodation, medical or first-aid facilities, store rooms, catering facilities and other accommodation.<br/>
That was what was done in that case, and a similar provision was made in the scheme governing grants to herring vessels. Any amendment of these grant schemes would require the approval of both Houses. I hope, therefore, hon. Members agree that it is unnecessary to make specific legislative provision for something which is being done already.</p>

<p>Would the hon. Member clarify his earlier point about new vessels? Our point is that these conversion grants really make old vessels new vessels from a catching point of view, and surely what is applicable to entirely new hulls is equally applicable to a grant towards making an old vessel into a new vessel. I do not think that is an academic point. It is one which has a great deal of validity. I hope the


Minister will have another look at the matter before he finally commits himself to reject the spirit of the Amendment. I say nothing about the words of the Amendment&#x2014;subject, of course, to the Front Bench discipline to which we on this side of the Committee submit.</p>

<p>I am sorry if I did not make myself clear. We are not rejecting the spirit of the Amendment. All I was saying was that its form of words relates the proposal to new vessels rather than to conversions. I was saying that we are in any case dealing with the matter in another way. I was pointing out that this has already been done under the previous Act, and we are proposing to do the same sort of thing under this Bill when it is an Act.<br/>
It will be done under the Scheme rather than under the Act, because the Scheme gives greater flexibility. There is a very wide variation in the types of vessels, and, in practice, under the Scheme it is possible to make proper provision for each vessel. We think that that is a more appropriate method of procedure and that it is the best way in which this can be done. It is for that reason that I was advising the Committee not to accept the Amendment. I ask the hon. Member to withdraw his Amendment, for we are entirely agreed about what it is desirable to achieve.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 2, line 37, to leave out "three-tenths" and to insert "two-fifths".<br/>
I feel a salty tang in the air and I am among people who have got the use of their sea legs, so I speak with circumspection.

By this Amendment we are not seeking to make a partisan point. We are not questioning the amount of the global sum. Our object is to see whether we can make a better use of the global sum. I say that we do not seek to make any party capital out of this because I remember that when the principal Act was going through Committee the Committee as a whole persuaded the Government to change their views about the provisions which they had proposed.<br/>
The question we are concerned with is whether it would not be better to afford a greater inducement to achieving the purposes that the Bill is meant to further; in other words, whether the benefit should not.be spread rather more thickly, though that would, of course, mean that the grant would be used on fewer occasions. I claim no special virtue for the specific proposal in the Amendment. What we are trying to do is to open for discussion the question whether or not the Government are right in fixing the figure at three-tenths; whether that ought not, in changed circumstances, now to be reconsidered and possibly altered.<br/>
We are concerned about the overall interest burden upon the working owner. We have to pay attention to two factors, the interest rates and the proportion of the grant. I should have thought that in the light of present circumstances there was a case at least for reconsidering the grant, for not merely accepting the position as it is under the principal Act. The major question is what is the interest burden to be?<br/>
I put this tentatively, not dogmatically, but I think that the very fact that we have the Bill means that, at any rate, we are not altogether satisfied with the progress we have made, and that we realise that more has to be done and that more has to be done as quickly as we can accomplish it. I appreciate that we are, of course, governed by the building capacity. We have to satisfy ourselves that the present capacity is being fully utilised. I appreciate that any permissive limit is the maximum limit. If it is to be an inducement it must be, and the Government are bound to make it so.<br/>
In the rather changed circumstances, and because we have this Bill before us, I think that there is a case for a rather greater inducement to be offered than we


have offered hitherto. That is the reason for the Amendment. It is also to elicit the views of the Government.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-03-21a.629.0" hansard_membership_id="4097" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29204" speakername="Mr. Edward Evans" colnum="629" time="">
<p>As I shall try to show on another Amendment, if it is called, as I hope it will be, the fishing industry is now going through a very anxious time indeed. The rising cost of gear and oil, of wages and everything else, calls for the greatest consideration by the Government of the situation of the small owner.<br/>
Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee know that the lot of the small man is a very difficult one today. That is not only because of the cost of conversion and because the grants are not over generous. It is because of the alarming cost of gear, the alarming costs of day-to-day routine work. It is also because of the spasmodic character of catches, particularly of herring. The catches, particularly of the East Coast fishermen, in the last two years have been catastrophic.<br/>
For these reasons, we feel that we should like to press the Government to consider our figure of two-fifths, indeed, to accept it and so give an additional incentive to the men who have been the backbone of the herring industry. It was the small owner-skippers of the East Coast and in Scotland who were the prime catchers of herring. Those men are gradually being ousted by the larger interests. We hope that the Government will have another look at these figures and see whether they cannot raise theirs. I am no mathematician and I am a little baffled for the moment by calculating which is the larger, three-tenths or two-fifths. I hope that the Government will give me the benefit of the doubt and credit me with asking for the larger.</p>

<p>I sympathise with the hon. Member for Lowestoft (Mr. Edward Evans) in his difficulty. I would suggest that he reads the two amounts as 0.3 and 0.4 but that can be confusing, too&#x2014;they have been called the "damned dots".<br/>
Since this Amendment was put on the Notice Paper we have given it the most sympathetic and careful consideration, because this is obviously a very important matter, particularly to the small working owner whom we are anxious to assist in any way we can. But it must

be recognised that while costs have risen &#x2014;I admit that&#x2014;this is a percentage grant. Therefore, the amount of grant varies in any case. It is important to bear that in mind. It seems to me that the present arrangement is fair, and that there is no reason why an owner should be insulated against all increases in costs. Although we help to some extent, we must keep a sense of proportion in this matter.<br/>
The hon. Member for Sunderland, North (Mr. Willey) suggested that the applications were slackening because the cost burden was too heavy. That is not in accord with our information. The present sign is that over the last two months the rate of application for engine grants has been higher than at any time since the scheme began. That is encouraging and it does not lead one to expect that there is any need for any extra action on our part.<br/>
7.30 p.m.<br/>
There is another point in that the Bill removes the upper cash limits imposed on grants by the 1953 Act. Limits are still imposed by the statutory grants scheme&#x2014;for working owners it is &#x00A3;5,000 for new boats and &#x00A3;1,250 for engines&#x2014;but under the Bill they may in future be varied by a statutory scheme if necessary. There is no indication that the present limits are reducing demand for building or new engines by working owners, but we would be fully prepared to consider them on their merits, if it were felt that they were inhibiting the demand.<br/>
In the light of that assurance, I ask that the Amendment should not be pressed, because the position at present is adequate and we have to keep a sense of proportion. We want to give all we can, but we think that the present arrangement is fair and reasonable.</p>

<p>I do not think that the Joint Parliamentary Secretary adequately replied to my hon. Friend the Member for Lowestoft (Mr. Edward Evans). It may be true that at present the grants are sufficient, but the Parliamentary Secretary is bound to be aware of the considerable increase in costs in recent times. The fishing industry is now facing a further substantial increase in its day-to-day work on account of the proposed increase in the price of fuel oil. Considering


those things, can we have an assurance that the Minister has the authority to meet those matters?</p>

<p>I have pointed out that this is a percentage rate, so that as the costs go up the grants go up. This is a capital cost, and while it is true that it impinges on the day-to-day costs I think that capital items should be kept separate from the general working. I have said that we would be fully prepared to consider on its merits any case at a later stage for raising the ceiling which we have taken powers to do. I think that we are covered in that respect and we will look at the matter most sympathetically whenever necessary.</p>

<p>We are much obliged to the Joint Parliamentary Secretary both for what he said about applications and the assurance he has given. We are trying to make the best use of the grants which Parliament is providing.

<p>I beg to move, in page 3, line 40, after "February ", to insert:
<q> nor later than the thirtieth day of June".</q>
The object of the Amendment is to make the appointed day reasonably certain "fore and aft"&#x2014;if one may use that expression. It is made certain fore but not aft, because the Clause provides that the appointed day means:
<q>&#x2026;such day (whether before or after the passing of this Act but not earlier than the twenty-eighth day of February, nineteen hundred and fifty-seven) as the Ministers may by order appoint.</q>
However, the Minister may delay and, in that way, prejudice the fishing industry. It is obvious that contracts will have to be made to carry out the work envisaged by the Bill. The owners of the vessels will have to make contracts, and in the making of contracts they must have some certainty.<br/>
There is no certainty as the Clause stands, but that certainty would be provided if the Government accepted the Amendment, so that the dates would be

28th February at one end and 30th June at the other. I am quite willing to concede that this is a good little Bill as far as it goes. It is not perfect. It will be remembered that another Bill was presented last November and withdrawn on 27th February because of its defects. I submit that the Amendment will help this little Bill towards perfection.<br/>
I ask the Minister not to follow the precedents which he has so far followed in asking us to withdraw every Amendment as it came along. I am sure that he has tried to judge those Amendments on their merits, but he has not had full regard to their merits or he would have accepted them. I ask him judicially to consider this Amendment on its merits and to accept it.</p>

<p>This Amendment will improve the Bill a little. It does not go far enough to meet my point of view, but I do not want to get out of order in dealing with that topic. We have made wonderful progress tonight. I want to remind the Parliamentary Secretary of a case which may be omitted. When we were discussing this matter in November last year, I raised two instances, one of which affected my constituency, in which a grant was lost because of a difference of three days in the date laid down in the Bill.<br/>
In one case an owner had gone ahead at the request of the Minister&#x2014;because earlier in the year the Minister had said that we must make progress and get conversions done and the fleet brought up to date. The man thought that the Minister meant it, and he got on with the job so quickly that he lost the grant. If people show initiative of that kind the Minister ought to do something to meet their needs. What my hon. and learned Friend is saying is that we should cover a similar type of case, that where the work is carried out by a particular date in June it should qualify for grant.<br/>
As the Minister has changed his dates from one Bill to another, I appeal to him to give a little flexibility to the respective authorities in these hardship cases so they can make awards to men who are not putting money into their pockets but taking money from their pockets and investing in the industry, modernising their boats, providing decent accommodation for their men and so improving the industry itself. The Minister


will be repaid tenfold if he will take action of that kind and for that reason I support the Amendment.</p>

<p>This is really a disciplinary Amendment, because in the Second Reading speech the Minister reiterated that it was his desire to state the appointed day as early as possible. We know how anxious the industry has been to get this date fixed. This puts a limit on the dilatoriness of the Minister &#x2014;to use that expression with great respect&#x2014;in putting off the appointed day. We are asking that the appointed day shall be no later than the date suggested by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Hector Hughes). No great concession is asked. If the Minister cannot make up his mind by 30th June, I do not know when we will get the grants paid.</p>

At the present time, our oil supply position is improving, but I think all hon. Gentlemen would agree with me that the Middle East position is still in a very unsettled state, and I do not feel that we are yet in a position to fix a precise date when supplies of oil will be fully adequate to our needs. I hope it will be possible to fix an appointed day which will lie ahead within a matter of weeks and not in a matter of months ahead. I think that it would be unfortunate if we made a legislative provision so specific as to mention a precise date today and then some untoward development were to occur which would make it impossible to keep that date.</p>

<p>Of course, the right hon. Gentleman could agree to a date and thus put the burden on himself to come down to the House&#x2014;I am not suggesting that he could do that under this Amendment, but if he felt like that&#x2014;and ask for the postponement of the date by order. At any rate, he would have to come and face the House in that case, instead, as he might, postpone and postpone his obligation to come to the House and explain it.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman has used the expression "a precise date". That is not what we are asking him to do. There is roughly a period of three months in which the right hon. Gentleman can make up his mind when to fix the appointed day, and as my hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, North (Mr. Willey) has said, if he cannot do it in three months, when will he do it? I would ask the Minister to bear in mind that contracts depend upon it. The trawler owners will have to make hard and fast contracts with certain people and with specific ingredients in them. We are not asking the Minister to be fixed like that. We give him three months in which to make up his mind.</p>

<p>What the hon. and learned Member is suggesting is that a specific and final date should be put in before which the appointed day must be fixed. That is what I mean by a specific date, but, as the hon. Member for Sunderland, North (Mr. Willey) has said, it would be possible, I suppose, to make a legislative provision which could be extended by order. I think that would be making heavy weather of this particular problem. We have said on three occasions previously&#x2014;I said it on Second Reading, and I have repeated it today&#x2014;that it is our intention that this Bill should be effective at the earliest possible date.</p>

<p>This is a question of contracts, and the prices ruling today might not rule for very long. We know that we are in a very grave industrial situation today. The right hon. Gentle-knows very well that, from the date of the signing of the contract, the date of the operative effectiveness of the vessel may be three or four months later, and, surely, he cannot be so pessimistic about the oil situation as all that. I think we have put up a very reasonable Amendment, and that we should get some sort of assurance


from the Minister that he has that point in mind, because the men went to sign the contracts as soon as possible in order to get the best terms they can.</p>

<p>I do realise that very clearly, but I know that the position is so uncertain that it would be most unwise, however hopeful I am&#x2014;and I am hopeful &#x2014;of being able to fix this appointed day in the near future, to fix such a limit. It is conceivable and possible that it might not be possible to keep to it. It is conceivable and possible that it might, in certain eventualities, have to be postponed, and the hon. Member for Lowestoft mentioned three months, which is quite a considerable time. One cannot be sure, and I hope that hon. Gentlemen will on reflection see the possibility of that happening and will accept the assurances we have given that it is our definite intention to fix this date at the earliest possible moment we can, and as soon as we can see our oil supply prospects sufficiently assured to make it a successful and safe thing to do. I hope that with that assurance the hon. and learned Gentleman will feel that it will not be necessary to press this Amendment to the point of dividing.</p>

<p>We have tried to be most accommodating on this side of the Committee on the other Amendments, and we have accepted the assurances that have been given. However, on this Amendment we find it very difficult to accept this assurance. Here, we are asking for a date not later than 30th June, 1957, but that does not mean that on the 1st of July, 1957, there will be a great rush for extra oil for these trawlers. That is the date when the trawler owners can begin to make contracts in order to have the necessary work carried out on their trawlers. I do not know how long that would take, but my hon. Friend the Member for Lowestoft (Mr. Edward Evans) suggested that it might be three or four months. Indeed, it might be longer than that.<br/>
I have tried to link that up with the statements made on the oil situation in the House and the suggestion that has been made by other responsible Ministers in the House about oil, that if we add four months after July everything should be rosy as far as the oil situation in this country is concerned. It seems to me that

we are not asking the Minister in this Amendment for anything that he should not be able to give us today.<br/>
There is the further point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland. North (Mr. Willey), when he suggested that if this date is put in here it will give us some assurance; and we are not unreasonable people. If the Minister discovers that, for some very good and valid reasons, he cannot operate as from that date, he has only to come to the House and give us the reasons. If the reasons are valid and good, I am certain that they will be accepted by Members on this side. For the reasons which I have adduced, I again ask the Minister to accept the Amendment.</p>

<p>I should like to reinforce the appeal which my hon. Friend the Member for Lanarkshire, North (Miss Herbison) has just made, because this is a matter of some importance and there has been a good deal of uncertainty about it.<br/>
May I make this suggestion to the right hon. Gentleman? We can expect that this Bill may receive the Royal Assent before Easter. Could we have a statement by the right hon. Gentleman when we resume immediately after Easter telling us what the position will be? At present, as my hon. Friend the Member for Lanarkshire, North has said, we have had a good deal of buoyancy from the Paymaster-General about the prospects in the oil situation. I think this industry is entitled to know where it stands, so as to be able to proceed at the earliest possible moment with this work; otherwise, there will be a growing loss of confidence. Why could not the right hon. Gentleman at any rate work with us in trying to contrive a formula which will enable him at the earliest possible moment to make it quite clear what the position is and give an assurance to the Committee that that in fact will be done?</p>

<p>I am anxious to do anything I possibly can to meet the views of hon. Gentlemen opposite, because there is nothing between us at all. What I am sure would be unwise would be to make a specific provision, or any limit, in this Bill.<br/>
Short of doing that, I will do everything I possibly can. I am anxious to help people who are thinking of availing themselves of these grants. I shall be


very ready to accept applications for grants straight away; to consider them and try to get everything done which can be done in advance, so that when the matter becomes effective there need be no further delay. It should help, to start with, to say that we will receive applications.<br/>
I will consider whether there is anything I can do in regard to the suggestion of the hon. Member for Sunderland, North (Mr. Willey). He suggested that I might make a statement, about Easter, as to the prospects. I shall certainly consider doing that. By Easter I hope that I may be in a position to fix the appointed day. At present, may I say that if I am not in a position to fix the appointed day by Easter I will seek an opportunity of making some statement in the House explaining what is the position and what the prospects appear to be?<br/>
I want to meet the hon. Member's point, which was a very fair one, that these conversions will take some time in any case. I agree that we do not want any unnecessary delay in the placing of contracts. The hon. Members have made their points very effectively, and we must try to find some way of easing the position if we can and of making it as easy as possible for those who are anxious to take advantage of the grant not to lose or waste a day.</p>

<p>I very much regret that, conscientious and able as the Minister is, he has not addressed his mind to the fundamental argument in support of the Amendment, which is that the owners will have to make contracts, and those contracts will involve agreements between the parties upon specific points. They must be precise and definite. we are merely asking that the Clause should be so tightened up as to make it precise and definite also. The Minister will realise that at the one end it is precise and definite&#x2014;" not earlier than 28th February "&#x2014;but at the other end it is not precise and definite, because no date is given. The appointed day means:
<q> such day&#x2026; as the Minister may by order appoint.</q>
The Minister may by order appoint 31st December, 1957.<br/>
However excellent his intentions may be, he is putting it completely outside

the power of the owners to make contracts. That is the essential and fundamental point, and it is a very important one. It goes to the root of the usefulness of the Bill, and I beg the Minister to address his mind to it. I must tell him that I shall not withdraw the Amendment.</p>

<p>I want to raise a point in connection with the working owner. As far as I could understand my right hon. Friend, he said that the matter was under consideration. Many of us in the past have raised the question of a working owner who, to all intents and purposes, is the working owner of more than one vessel. Subsection (3, <i>b</i>) reads:
<q> in any other case, one-quarter of the said expenditure.</q>
Will that apply to the family of such a working owner, or will he be deemed to be a working owner in more than one case? Perhaps my hon. Friend would be good enough to look into that point. I may say that I do not expect an answer.</p>

<p>I am most grateful to my hon. Friend for his kindness in not expecting an answer to what is a tricky point. If he had only kept talking a little longer it might have been easier for me to give him one. My initial reaction would be to say that only one boat would be allowable in the case of a one working owner. I do not think that it would be reasonable&#x2014;certainly at first glance&#x2014;to say that a working owner could be presumed to be working in more than one boat at once.<br/>
If we were to accept the other contention we should be very much widening the matter. I regret to have to tell my hon. Friend this&#x2014;I realise the point of his intervention. I believe that I have stated the position correctly but if I am wrong, I shall be happy to advise him in due course.</p>

<p>Suppose the man has sons, and has more than one boat, and on one day he goes to sea in one boat and on another day in another boat? Why should he not be a working owner in both cases? He may go to sea on a Monday in one boat, with two of his sons, and on the Tuesday in another boat. He is still going to sea.</p>

<p>I have been considering this matter further since I replied to my hon. Friend, and I should think that he may well be right. He has to some extent convinced me that there is a case for such a working owner. Provided that he goes to sea in each of his two boats it might well be said that he qualifies. I may have been over-hasty in what I said, and I think that in the case which my hon. Friend now quotes he may well be right. But I do not think that we could continue this process <i>ad infinitum</i>. I should have thought that two boats would be as much as one could reasonably expect any working owner to be working in himself&#x2014;and he must go to sea in each boat in order to qualify.</p>

<p>This is a very interesting announcement. Supposing there are four boats. It would appear that the owner would then qualify for twelve-tenths. It reminds me of the man who, under Scottish agricultural legislation, received 110 per cent. of his outlay. Surely the Minister can give us a better answer than that. If what he says applies to two boats, would it not apply to three or four? If not, can the Minister tell us where we can find a definition in respect of this matter? It must be laid down somewhere. If there Minister can say that a working owner will qualify if he has two boats there must be something in the Bill which says so.</p>

<p>Each case is considered on its merits. I have tried to make it clear that I think that two boats would be the limit. It would not be a case of anybody getting 120 per cent.; it would be a case of 30 per cent. in respect of each boat, and there would be double the expense with two boats. I should have thought that two would be a reasonable figure to fix as the limit. I hope that the Committee will accept that explanation and will consider two as the maximum number. I would emphasise that the working owner must go to sea regularly in each boat in order to qualify.</p>

<p>I feel that we must make it known that we are in some doubt about this matter. What about the man with four sons? I do not see the logical reason for making two the limit. If I accept the Parliamentary Secretary's argument, the qualification would appear

also to be related to the number in the family. I hope that during our further consideration of the Bill we shall receive a clearer ruling on this matter.</p>

<p>I think that it is quite clear. I hope that I can carry the hon. Member with me in regard to this rather involved family tree. It must be one business, and if it is it does not matter how many sons the working owner has. He will receive consideration only in respect of one or two boats. If each son owned his boat separately there would be separate businesses, and that would be a different matter. I do not want to fragment families in this way, but I must make it clear that in such a case there would be separate businesses.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 4, line 4, after "matter", to insert: "including the provision of fishing gear".<br/>
I am delighted that the Long Title of the Bill enables me to move this Amendment. The argument is plain to every hon. Member who knows anything of the fishing industry or who is interested in it. The provision of grants for conversion covers only a part of the necessary adjuncts to an effective fishing vessel. We all know that they are onerous enough. In fact, in comparison with pre-war times they are dreadful. One of the most disquieting features of the industry today is the alarming growth in the cost of gear of all kinds. Added to that, we are to have another increase in the price of oil. So, as a capital expenditure in the running of a fishing vessel, the cost of gear is just as important as the cost of conversion from steam to oil.<br/>
I move this Amendment with diffidence because I know that the Minister had not envisaged that gear could come into the Bill. I am encouraged, however, by reading the Long Title, which states that the Bill seeks
<q>&#x2026; to provide a subsidy in respect of &#x2026; and for purposes connected with&#x2026;</q>
an effective fishing industry.<br/>
I hope that the Minister will examine this matter. He has an ingenious mind


and perhaps he can introduce a provision to allow grants for the conversion from steam to oil to cover, also, a grant for the increased cost of gear. The issue is plain. There is no need to elaborate it. We all know that the cost of gear has gone up by 800 per cent. since pre-war days. We are faced now not only with the increase of 40 per cent. in the cost of oil on 30th December last, but also, which is the purpose of the Bill, with a rise of another &#x00A3;1 a ton&#x2014;for what reason I fail to see &#x2014;in the price of oil for the fishing fleet. That is disastrous. We know very well that there will be a considerable lay-up in the fishing fleets when this new charge comes in.<br/>
For those reasons, I hope that the Minister will consider whether he can accommodate us in this matter.</p>

<p>I support the Amendment. I think that these words should be included and that they are necessary for the intelligent administration of the Clause, which makes provision for the payment of grants.
<q> &#x2026; for the purpose of catching such fish and landing them in the United Kingdom or any such other matter&#x2026;</q>
The words, "any such other matter" are so wide as to give no guide to the authority whatsoever. The words which it is sought to insert by this Amendment will give a necessary guide. They indicate that the words "such other matter" are to include the provision of fishing gear.<br/>
As my hon. Friend said, the cost of fishing gear and other things that fishermen use has gone up enormously. We live in a period of inflation. The cost of living keeps rising steadily and so does the cost of oil and fishing gear. It is right that the owners should have that fact taken into account in this Clause.<br/>
On the other hand, it is wrong that there should be put into this Clause words so wide in character as the words, "such other matter." They give no guide to the administering authority and it would find great difficulty in administering the Clause. It might ask, "What are these matters? If we give a grant for this, we may be at fault and if we give a grant for that we may be at fault."<br/>
Now we are proposing to insert these words, which are clear, concise and

expressive, to include the price of fishing gear. They give a necessary guide and they improve both the Clause and the Bill.</p>

<p>The hon. and learned Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Hector Hughes) described the words of the Amendment as clear, concise and expressive. I think that those words may also be applied to the speeches which he makes on this subject.<br/>
There is, however, a danger in inserting words such as these into the Clause. To do so would seem to give undue emphasis to a particular thing and might throw doubt on some other matters which one might wish to draw within the ambit of those words. In any case, it is an academic point, because the Clause as it reads at present would give power for payments in respect of fishing gear. There is no doubt about that and I give that assurance. The point is covered in the words of the Bill. Therefore, were it decided to make a grant for gear, there would be no difficulty in that respect.<br/>
This Clause is dealing not so much with grants but the method of payment of subsidies both for white fish and herring. So far, the subsidy for white fish has been limited to payments in respect of landings of fish or voyages made for the purpose of catching fish. A particular form has not yet been decided for herring, but the suggestions of the Herring Industry Board and the producers associations favour a subsidy payment per day at sea, like the white fish subsidy paid to near and middle water vessels; but no suggestion of a subsidy on fishing gear has been made.<br/>
The total sum to be paid out would not be increased by doing this. It is a matter of finding the most equitable and the fairest way of paying out the subsidy. If this suggestion is put forward, it would be possible to do it in this way, but, so far, consideration has been directed to doing it in the same way as in the case of white fish which appears to be working satisfactorily. I should have thought, therefore, that that is the most likely way for this to happen. I realise the importance of the point which the hon. Member raised, but in view of the assurance I have given may I ask that the Amendment be withdrawn.</p>

<p>The Parliamentary Secretary will realise that my hon. Friend the Member for Lowestoft (Mr. Edward Evans) is not a Parliamentary draftsman, but allowing for that, I should like to congratulate him on his ingenuity in seeking the only opportunity that he had for raising this matter. He has elicited an assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary which is not unwelcome.<br/>
My hon. Friend was seeking to emphasise the importance of the burden of the increased cost of gear by including it in the Bill. It does not look as though the Parliamentary Secretary will assist him in that endeavour, but the hon. Gentleman has made it clear that he appreciates the point which my hon.

<p>May I ask whether my hon. Friend would assist me, because I do not quite understand what he said? This Clause deals with the method of assessing the amount of the subsidy to be paid for the landing of white fish. There is also a similar Clause, dealing with the amount to be paid for the landing of herring. Until now the white fish subsidy, taking into account not only the inshore but the other boats as well, has been based partly on the consideration of the length of the voyage made and partly on the consideration of how much fish was landed. As I understand, the purpose of including in the Bill the words
<q> or any such other matter </q>
was because we thought that the two fishing boards might wish to incorporate a third consideration. If I understood my hon. Friend aright, he did not say that there was a third consideration. It was only to be a matter of the days at sea. I would be grateful if he would explain this matter.</p>

<p>I do not think that there will be any misapprehension. The whole case of my hon. Friend the Member for Lowestoft (Mr. Edward Evans) was that it was essential for the boats to be equipped with gear but that the cost of the gear was prohibitive, and that that might prevent fishing being done in the way we want it to be done. I understood the Joint Parliamentary Secretary to say that this matter was fully provided for in the drafting of the Clause. That is the sole reason why the Joint Parliamentary

Secretary asked us not to press the Amendment.</p>

<p>That is correct. Gear would be covered by the Clause, if it is desired to cover it. There is only a certain amount of money and we have to decide the best and fairest way of portioning it out. White fish is paid for in respect of the time spent at sea and the amount of fish landed. No decision has yet been reached about herring. We are not excluding any other method if it is felt desirable, but we expect that the plan for herring will be much the same as for white fish. There is provision which covers any third, fourth or other method, including payment for gear.</p>

I move this Amendment to show that I still have much good will towards the Minister. I am endeavouring to help him. If he spurns my help, I say at once that I am not prepared to reinforce my help by having a Division.<br/>
No one objects that the Treasury should have a voice in determining the global sum, but we do not think it right and proper&#x2014;and it is about time that someone should say so&#x2014;that the Treasury should have its approval to these schemes written into a Bill. I know what it means in practice: an increase of the bureaucracy the whole time. The Treasury will get a herring man. It has an advantage, of course, when it comes to establishment. If they lose their battle with the Ministry they make sure they get a better herring man than the Ministry has so that they have the final word.<br/>
I am sure that the Committee is content to leave the matter to the right hon. Gentleman with the usual Governmental responsibility that an Order has to be laid. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will at once accept my good offices and this Amendment. I have had previous successes in having Amendments


accepted, but on the last occasion I regret that when I offered this friendly assistance to the right hon. Gentleman he was quite uncharitable and rejected it.</p>

<p>Among the words on the second line of the Clause are:
<q> a continuous and plentiful supply of herring,</q>
not a continuous and plentiful supply of money. If these were the words, I could understand the Treasury being dragged, however unwillingly, into the Clause. It is being brought in, not in connection with a plentiful supply of money but with the preparation of a scheme.<br/>
I fail to see why the Treasury should be brought into it at all. Why cannot the Minister have sufficient independence of character and confidence in his drafting to do the scheme himself without bringing the Treasury into it? Exhorting the Minister to show a little courage and to throw off the shackles of the Treasury, I support the Amendment.</p>

In spite of these efforts, he does not, however, feel that the Amendment is necessary or desirable. The Treasury has the responsibility to see that schemes for the expenditure of public money are prepared with due regard to efficiency and economy. That does not mean that the Treasury dictates policy.

<p>This answer is disappointing. It explains why we have now the

Financial Secretary for the Treasury with us.

<p>After the immensely successive and very speedy excitements of the last few minutes, perhaps we might consider in calm&#x2014;not only in calm, but also almost in solitude&#x2014;the rating for valuation purposes of petrol filling stations. I wish to raise this problem which came to my notice in connection with a particular constituency case. It was the case of my constituent, Mr. H. L. Baird of Andover, whose appeal to the Lands Tribunal is now <i>sub judice</i> and to which I do not now wish to refer. I do not wish to argue against a particular case but against the general principle of the way in which petrol stations are assessed for the purpose of finding their gross rateable value.<br/>
I wish to refer to the case of Mr. Baird because of the method used by the Inland Revenue valuation officer at the appeal by my constituent at a valuation court held in Andover in January, which was fully quoted in the issue of the <i>Andover Advertiser</i> of 11th January this year. With your permission, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, I wish to quote from the report in that newspaper what the valuation officer, Mr. D. W. Wand, said on that occasion. That newspaper stated that Mr. Wand
<q>referred to a method used by valuation officers when they assessed garages, businesses, which he thought were among the most difficult to rate. The officers used to value the buildings, the storage tanks and the forecourt, and 'that was the answer'. 'Now we value the buildings and estimate the throughput of petrol and apply prices to that throughput'. Mr. Wand's 'price list' was: for every 50,000 gallons the rate is &#x00A3;2 each thousand; 50,000 to 100,000 gallons &#x00A3;2 10s. each thousand; from 100,000 to 150,000 gallons &#x00A3;3 each thousand; and for over 150,000 &#x00A3;3 10s. each thousand.</q>
In other words, the Inland Revenue officer stated at that valuation court that Inland Revenue officers formerly valued the site, the amenities and fittings of the petrol station and then, to quote Mr. Wand, "That was the answer". Now, according to Mr. Wand:
<q>We value the buildings and estimate the throughput of petrol and apply prices to that throughput.</q>

I wish to ask my hon. Friend why the method was altered, when the method was altered, and whether the alteration was published or done purely in a hole-in-the-corner method?<br/>
I suggest that to assess the rateable value of petrol retail pumps upon the throughput of petrol is grossly unfair, first because it is almost the only type of business which is rated upon throughput or turnover or total production. If I were to open a store for the selling of toys or clothing, my store would be rated for rateable value upon the building which I occupied, upon the site which I occupied, upon how likely it was to attract trade and therefore how popular it would be, and upon what its rent might be. My store would be assessed upon the fittings, the amenities and so on. But it would not be assessed upon the amount of clothing or toys which I sold.<br/>
Turning to a business about which I have some knowledge, where profit is a very small margin of total turnover, such as a stockbroker's business, we find that a stockbroker's office is rated for valuation purposes upon the type of office that it is, upon its floor space and upon the site which the office occupies. It is not rated upon turnover, which in a business with a very low percentage profit on turnover would obviously be grossly unfair. Yet here, irrespective of the rate of profit which is earned upon the turnover, upon the throughput of petrol, the Inland Revenue has apparently decided&#x2014;a decision applied almost only to this type of business&#x2014;that retail petrol stations shall be rated almost mainly upon the throughput of the petrol which they have sold.<br/>
The second reason I believe this method of assessment to be grossly unfair is that throughput does not depend solely on the station which one takes over. I should have thought that one of the basic ideas of rating was that the rateable value of a building was the same for whatever business purpose that building was used, no matter how great the success or the failure of the owner of that business. Throughput does not depend simply upon the excellent position of the site. It does not just depend upon the number of buildings upon it, or upon the amenities, or even upon the fittings. It depends first of all upon the initiative and the enterprise of the man


running that business, for instance whether he goes out to get business, whether perhaps he stocks other things besides petrol which people will pull in to buy, whether he gets a licence to sell cigarettes, whether he does repairs. Throughput depends, first of all, very largely upon initiative and enterprise.<br/>
It depends, secondly, upon the service which is given. When I have found a garage which has given me good service &#x2014;if people have rushed out to clean my windscreen and have polished it, if they have asked whether the car needed air or water and if they have looked whether I needed oil&#x2014;I have made a mental note to try to call at that garage again if I happen to be passing. But if they did not bother about my windscreen and if, when I asked them to check my tyres, they replied, "There is the machine; you can do it yourself," I have made a mental note not to return there. Throughput therefore depends upon the service given.<br/>
Thirdly, throughput depends largely upon the hours when a business is open. Not very far from my constituency there is a petrol station which as far as I am concerned is permanently shut. It is virtually never open at week-ends. Frankly, when I pass down that road, however much I need petrol&#x2014;and I hope I never need it so badly that I have to stop within the next mile&#x2014;I do not slow down at that petrol station because it seems to me likely that it will remain shut.<br/>
Let us take the extreme example of two petrol stations within half-a-mile of each other on a good stretch of one of our main roads at a time when there is no petrol rationing. The owner or manager of one petrol station may say to himself on a Saturday afternoon, "I am going off to play football", or "I will take my family into the local town to do the shopping and to go to the market ". He may also say, "I do not open on a Sunday because I like to play golf that day". His turnover will not be as great as that of the man who is open all the week-end and stays open as long as possible to pick up the maximum amount of trade. Throughput depends not only upon the site but upon the hours which the garage proprietor or manager is prepared to stay open.<br/>
Finally, throughput can depend very largely on the personal contacts of the

owner or manager of the garage. After all, selling petrol is like doing most other sorts of business, in which we know that personal contacts can mean a great deal. If a garage manager has become friendly with the manager or the owner of a fleet of lorries, so that those lorries make a regular point of filling up at his garage every time they pass, he has, of course, a better business than if he merely sits down and does not attempt to go out to get that sort of trade. Throughput depends on the personal contacts, initiative, enterprise, service and hours of opening of the manager or owner of the garage. And those are things with which, I contend, rating valuation has nothing whatever to do.<br/>
In addition to these points, I submit that an assessment for rating purposes on throughput is unfair, particularly in view of the table of progressive charges given by Mr. Wand and quoted in the <i>Andover Advertiser</i>. Thus, if we take the lowest charge, that up to 50,000 gallons, the rateable value would be &#x00A3;2 per thousand; between 50,000 and 100,000 gallons it would be &#x00A3;2 10s., and between 100,000 and 150,000 gallons it would be &#x00A3;3 per thousand gallons.<br/>
This particular progression completely ignores labour costs. One man may be able to run a petrol station which sells up to 50,000 gallons a year, and cope with that in comfort. If the sales go up to 70,000 gallons he cannot cope with it himself, and has to employ a man to assist him. When a business gets to that awkward stage of expansion, when it is just too much for one man to manage and is not really big enough to pay for two men, it is a difficult time in the history of the expansion of that business.<br/>
Under the scheme drawn up by my hon. Friend's valuation officer, not only does the man have the difficulty in an expanding business of taking on and paying a man but, in addition, he moves up from the &#x00A3;2 to the &#x00A3;2 10s. per thousand gallon category, and his rateable value goes up from &#x00A3;100 to &#x00A3;175 by virtue of that relatively small, 40 per cent. increase in turnover&#x2014;the profit on which is probably completely wiped out by the taking on of another man. Nevertheless, according to Mr. Wand's assessment, his rateable value goes up by 75 per cent. Even my hon. Friend cannot make me believe that that is right.<br/>
I suggest that the Inland Revenue is not even consistent in insisting on this method of turnover, or throughput, as a means of assessing rateable value. The Inland Revenue takes only the throughput on petrol. It does not take the turnover on spare parts sold, or the turnover on repairs done; and it does not, for one moment, take the throughput of the cigarettes and matches sold. Why not&#x2014;if throughput is to be the peculiarity of the rating assessment of garages?<br/>
Basically, what the Inland Revenue is doing is putting an extra tax on success. Turnover has a direct relationship with profits. The bigger the turnover, then, roughly speaking, the bigger the profits. And if the profits are big, they are taxed by Income Tax. They may be taxed through Surtax, and they may be taxed through Profits Tax. We have enough taxes upon success, but Income Tax, Surtax and Profits Tax are decided by legislation in this House. This House not only decides the rates which are to be levied, but decides at which levels the rates of tax are raised or lowered. Here, according to Mr. Wand's assessment, we have a progressive tax on profits; a progressive tax, decided not by Parliament or in public, but by Departmental officials and privately.<br/>
Therefore, I would suggest to my hon. Friend that this method of assessing garages is as wrong in form as it is wrong in essence, and that a tax designed to be related, as the rateable value of a business should be related, to the site, to the buildings, to the amenities and to the fittings, should not be levied on profits as well. Site, buildings, amenities and fittings are, I contend, the only factors which should be taken into account. According to Mr. Wand, they were the only factors which were taken into account. I would ask my hon. Friend to ensure that in future they are the only factors which are taken into account.</p>

<p>It will be convenient, I think, if I begin by defining my own status in this matter, which is, in fact, a very limited and rather indirect one.<br/>
The relevant statues lay down in general terms the basis upon which different types of property are to be assessed

for rating. Under the Local Government Act, 1948, it is the duty of the Inland Revenue to make those assessments in accordance with the law. The question whether, in any particular case, it has done so in accordance with the law is not a question for me. It is a question which, upon a proposal being made, falls to be decided, in the first instance, by a local valuation court, and, on appeal, as my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Freeth) mentioned, by the Lands Tribunal.<br/>
It is, therefore, a question for the courts to decide whether, in any particular instance, the valuation officer has or has not succeeded in correctly interpreting the law of rating in connection with a particular property.<br/>
Of course, the Commissioners of Inland Revenue and I, as answering for them in this House, have a responsibility for seeing that in general the valuation officers do, broadly, succeed in complying with the law as interpreted by the courts. It would be a matter of concern if it were found that in any particular area or in regard to any particular type of property, decisions of the courts showed that the assessments made by the valuation officers of the Inland Revenue were not in accordance with the requirements of the law.</p>

<p>I am not complaining at all that the law is being contravened. All that the Rating and Valuation Act, 1925, asks valuation officers to do, as I understand it, is to arrive at
<q> the hereditament might reasonably be expected to let from year to year"&#x2014;</q>
with various provisos. It is the method of assessing that rent, and nothing else, against which I am complaining.</p>

<p>But I do want to make clear that the question whether the right answer is arrived at or not is not for me; it is a question referable to courts as provided in the Acts and which only the courts in a particular case can decide. The Commissioners of Inland Revenue and I come into the matter only if it appears, on the basis of decisions of courts, that the results arrived at by valuation officers are, in fact, not in accordance with the law. So much by way of defining my own limited status in this matter.<br/>
Like my hon. Friend. I propose not to comment&#x2014;it would be quite wrong


for me to comment&#x2014;on the particular case from which this debate took rise, which is, I understand, <i>sub judice</i>. I hope that he will understand if I prefer also not to comment, at any rate now, at this Box, upon a newspaper report; though, if my hon. Friend will let me have it, I will certainly look at it in detail and communicate with him if there is anything that I can usefully say. All I can do, here and now, is to make some general remarks upon the problems facing a valuation officer who is called upon, in the case of a property of this type, to interpret what would be&#x2014;again, like my hon. Friend, I quote the words of the Statute&#x2014;
<q> the rent at which the hereditament might reasonably be expected to let from year to year "&#x2014;</q>
under certain conditions.<br/>
Petrol stations are not commonly let, nor are a good many other classes of property, such as public houses, hotels, racecourses and cinemas; and so some other approach has to be found rather than the very simple one of ascertaining at what actual rents comparable properties in the vicinity are letting.<br/>
Clearly, in arriving at the rent which a tenant would pay for a petrol station, if tenants did rent petrol stations, the business likely to be done at a particular petrol station is of very direct relevance. Thus, one would pay more rent for a petrol station on the Great North Road than for a petrol station on a by-road. One would pay more rent for a petrol station in a position which happened to catch and attract the traffic, which was well situated for a petrol station, than one would pay for a petrol station less well situated. So that the actual business which is done in a particular petrol station, in so far as it is an indication of the aptitude of that station for attracting business, is relevant to the rent which would be paid and thus to the correct assessment.</p>

<p>Perhaps I will meet the point in my next sentence.<br/>
It would, of course, be quite wrong simply to take turnover at a particular garage under a particular manager in particular circumstances and to attempt to deduce from that in isolation the rent

which a tenant might reasonably pay from year to year. As my hon. Friend said, all sorts of factors enter into it, such as the hours at which the petrol station remains open and the business acumen and activity of the proprietor. All sorts of qualifications must, therefore, be applied and taken into account before turnover in a business of this sort can provide even a rough yardstick for the rent which a hypothetical tenant would pay for it from year to year.<br/>
One could not, however, even after those qualifications had duly been introduced, rely simply upon turnover. The buildings themselves, their value, their attractiveness, their modernity, and so on, must all be factors which would affect the letting value of the premises. I am sure that a correct assessment of one of these properties, which, by their nature, are so difficult to assess, cannot be arrived at unless all these factors are taken into account and given their proper weight.<br/>
Whether the result of taking those factors into account in any particular assessment does or does not hit the mark laid down and intended by Parliament is, I must again repeat, a matter which can only be decided by a court and, on appeal, by the Lands Tribunal. In the case to which my hon. Friend has referred, that course is being taken and it will be very interesting to see what is the result.<br/>
I can, however, give my hon. Friend the assurance that every effort is made by the valuation officers of the Inland Revenue to take into account all the factors reasonably bearing upon the letting value of these premises. In general, if we look at the decisions given on appeal by the courts and the Lands Tribunal, I think we should conclude that by and large their assessments are not too far from what, in the view of the courts, the law requires.<br/>
I do, however, in conclusion, repeat that I am perfectly ready to take the particular report which my hon. Friend quoted to the House and investigate it for him. The position which I have put before the House is the general position as it applies to the rating of these types of property throughout the country.</p>

<p>I was about to ask a question of my hon. Friend before he sat down. Will he not agree that, although he said that petrol stations were not normally rented, in fact tied petrol stations are rented, and that with the agreement of the owner it might well be possible to obtain the rent figure and to make due allowance for particular trading terms with which that rent was bound up?<br/>
Secondly, could my hon. Friend tell me whether or not it is true, as I have had it reported to me, that recently a directive went out from the Treasury that local valuation officers were not to place as much reliance as they had been doing in the past two years on petrol throughput? Thirdly, will he not agree that the essential thing that one has to try to get

is the aptitude of the station and not the aptitude of the garage proprietor?</p>

<p>Clearly, where the actual rent of a comparable station or of that station is available, that is a most important factor and might well be the decisive factor in determining the assessment or the decision of the court upon appeal. As regards the second question, I will certainly ascertain whether there has been any such directive. I do not think that it would be from the Treasury, if it existed at all, but I will certainly find out if I can trace any such directive and let my hon. Friend know. Thirdly, I have already agreed that in ascertaining the letting value for the purposes of assessment for rating, one must disregard the variation in aptitude as between different individual tenants.</p>
