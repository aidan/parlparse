<p>As my right hon. Friend said in reply to a Question by my hon. Friend the Member for Maldon (Mr. Driberg) on 23rd March, it is not possible to forecast how many R.A.S.C. clerks in group 68 and later groups serving in the Middle East, including East Africa Command, may have to be deferred. It is not the case that whole groups are being deferred. Cases are dealt with individually, a minimum working strength being assessed for each unit. It was not possible to avoid the necessity for deferments by training extra clerks because the present difficulties have arisen partly owing to acceleration of the release programme generally, and partly owing to the situation in Palestine.</p>

<p>I think that what my hon.

<p>No, Sir. We are fully satisfied that that undertaking was not given. The nature of the undertaking was that if ever the village were to be inhabited again, the previous inhabitants would have the right to go there.

<p>The answer is that there is no system of allocation. We depend upon the manufacturers themselves to send crockery where they feel it is required.

<p>Yes Sir. I should like if, if I may, to answer these two points separately.<br/>
As the House will have heard, a British European Airways aircraft was approaching Gatow aerodrome in the British sector of Berlin from Hamburg yesterday afternoon when a Soviet fighter aircraft collided with it. As the result of this both aircraft crashed to the ground and all the occupants were killed. I wish to take this opportunity to express the deepest sympathy of His Majesty's Government, and I am sure, of the House, with the relatives and friends of the victims in this appalling occurrence. The British aircraft fell 2&#x00BD; miles North-West of the Gatow airfield in the Russian zone, and the Soviet fighter fell just inside the British sector of Berlin close to Gatow airport.<br/>
I am awaiting a full account of the disaster. The information which I have received so far shows that the British aircraft was proceeding on the ordinary route, and that according to routine instructions, warning should have been given by the Soviet authorities that their fighter was in the air. No such warning was given. After the crash the Soviet authorities took immediate charge of the British aircraft, and later in the day British representatives went to the scene to investigate and to gain access to the bodies and the baggage. A cordon of British troops has been placed round the Soviet aircraft, with one Soviet sentry.<br/>
The Soviet General, with whom the British Commandant in Berlin dealt, expressed a desire to deal with the occurrence with proper calmness. Immediately on hearing of the disaster, the British Commander-in-Chief, General Robertson, communicated with the Soviet Commander-in-Chief, Marshal Sokolovsky. In


this communication, after stating the facts that I have given, General Robertson asked for an immediate assurance that Marshal Sokolovsky condemned as strongly as he did that the Soviet aircraft was being flown without prior notification and in a manner to cause the catastrophe. He also requested a positive assurance that British aircraft using the corridor in accordance with our mutual agreement would be immune from molestation. General Robertson also reserved all the rights of His Majesty's Government.<br/>
General Robertson also had an interview with Marshal Sokolovsky yesterday evening. General Robertson's actions in this matter have our full approval. At the interview, General Robertson made it plain that he had no wish to prejudge the cause of the catastrophe until a proper inquiry had been held. The form and scope of this inquiry is at present under consideration. Marshal Sokolovsky then gave General Robertson orally the assurances for which the latter had asked. A written reply to General Robertson's communication is awaited. In view of the assurances which have been received, the British Commander-in-Chief has countermanded the instructions which he gave that British civil aircraft should receive fighter protection. I understand that the United States Commander-in-Chief took similar action.<br/>
I wish to make it clear, pending the results of tae inquiry, that I have no information to suggest that the conduct of the Soviet aircraft was in any way the result of direct instructions from the Soviet authorities. Routine flights to and from Berlin by British aircraft are continuing in the normal way.<br/>
In view of what I have said, I trust the House will agree that it is undesirable that there should be any further speculation or recrimination about this tragedy. I am pressing for an inquiry to be held as soon as possible, and until the results are known I suggest that judgment should be reserved.</p>

<p>I would now like to make a statement on the general situation in Berlin. The House will have seen from

the Press the general trend of events there. The difficulty began with the departure of the Soviet representatives from the Control Council on 20th March. The House will remember that, owing to the failure to establish economic unity in Germany, we have been compelled to establish, in conjunction with the United States, a bi-zonal authority. Further, owing to the breakdown of the four-Power meeting in November and December, it was decided that there should be consultations with the three Powers in the Western zones, in order to consider what steps could be taken to make these three zones viable.<br/>
The Soviet representative demanded a report of these discussions, which were purely consultative. Our representatives in Berlin were not aware that this demand was going to be made, and declined to present a report. Accordingly, the Soviet representative walked out. As no decisions were reached at this consultative conference, there was no report to make. Therefore, meetings of the Control Council and its subordinate committees and directorates are at present in abeyance.<br/>
Another problem which has arisen is in connection with the Berlin City Kommandatura, where the Soviet authorities refused to attend eight of the committees.<br/>
We are ready to discuss the reorganisation of this body, and, in fact, apart from these eight committees, the body is still functioning. Arising out of all this, the British representatives, in consultation with their United States and French colleagues, are doing their best to negotiate with the Soviet authorities for a resumption of the normal activities of all these bodies in accordance with existing agreements.<br/>
These acts of the Soviet authorities were followed by another unilateral action affecting travel regulations between the British zone and British sector of Berlin. On 31st March the Soviet authorities announced the introduction of new regulations at 24 hours' notice. No opportunity was given for consultation or discussion, notwithstanding the fact that there is a clear four-Power agreement for the occupation of Berlin, of the validity of which there can be no doubt. It should be explained, however, that the regulations for travel to and from Berlin are not so clearly specified. When the arrangements


were made a good deal was taken on trust between the Allies, and until this event travel has been reasonably satisfactory. On the roads, British travellers have shown their documents. On military trains this has not been required, since the trains were supplied by and were under the exclusive control of the British military authorities.<br/>
This new difficulty which has arisen results from the Soviet demand that Soviet military personnel should board the trains and examine the passengers' documents.<br/>
This whole question of travel is now under discussion between the Soviet authorities on the one hand and the British, American and French on the other. We must await the result of these discussions, and I should make it clear that His Majesty's Government would welcome an agreement. In view of the arrangements for the occupation of Berlin, we cannot yield our right to free access to and from these sectors of occupation, which is essential to maintain our Forces and fulfil our obligations as an occupying Power.<br/>
I do not want to exaggerate the issues or to say anything which would aggravate an already difficult situation. I regret what has happened, but if there is good will the difficulties are capable of solution. The British Commander-in-Chief and the British authorities in Germany have the full confidence of His Majesty's Government in handling the position.</p>

<p>As the Committee is aware, it has been arranged this year to discuss the Economic Survey at the same time as the Budget proposals, and the arrangement will, I think, be of convenience both to the Committee and to the country. It means, I am afraid, that in opening these two closely linked subjects I shall have to detain the Committee for rather a long time.<br/>
Government expenditure and revenue ought not to be considered in isolation from their effects upon the general economic prospects of the country, nor can any survey of the economic situation of the country be complete without a knowledge of the Government's Budget proposals. The combination under a single Minister of the co-ordination of our external and internal economy with the control of Government expenditure and revenue was an important change in our planning machinery. The new task of the Chancellor of the Exchequer is not merely to balance the Budget; it is a much wider one&#x2014;to match our resources against our needs so that the main features of our economy may be worked out for the benefit of the community as a whole.<br/>
This means that the Budget must be complementary to, and, indeed, in some sense a part of the National Economic Plan. It will, therefore, be convenient to the Committee, I hope, if I deal with the subject matter of this speech in the following order: First, I will draw attention to some of the more important aspects of the Economic Survey. I will then pass on to the out-turn of the 1947&#x2013;48 Budget, and then to an examination of the prospects for 1948&#x2013;49 on the basis of the present taxation. Finally, I will state the proposals for new taxation or for remission of taxation which form part of the present Budget.</p>

<p>The Economic Survey gives the provisional estimates for the national income and expenditure for the calendar y ear 1948. It sets out the facts as to our immediate problems and the resources which we estimate will be available to meet our needs. Estimates of this kind, as the Committee will understand, are always bound to be somewhat provisional and uncertain, and, in circumstances such as those which confront us today, they are pretty certain to be subject to revision and correction as the year progresses. It is, however, essential that all those responsible for our production effort, whether as administrators, employers, technicians or workers, should have as full knowledge as is available if they are to join&#x2014;as we want them to join&#x2014;with the Government in framing and approving the general strategy of our production.</p>

In some matters, the Government can assist in bringing about the desired results; in others, it must be for the people themselves to conform voluntarily to the needs of the situation. In framing that plan, we have to examine our requirements as a nation and formulate our current needs. We then have to consider how far those needs can be met, in the light of the various limits set by our dependence upon overseas markets, our own capacity of production, the availability of manpower, and all the other factors which have to he taken into account.</p>

I will deal first with our external payments. This problem has already been very fully discussed, and I believe that today the whole country is becoming aware of the urgency of arriving at a balance of overseas payments, particularly with the dollar countries. The whole economic situation of 1948 will be dominated by our difficulty


in paying for the imports without which we can neither live nor produce. The hopes that we had a year ago have not materialised. Though, in 1947, we were able to import only 75 per cent. of the volume of imports in 1938, against the 80 to 85 per cent. for which we had hoped, rising prices of imports made the actual cost &#x00A3;124 million more than the forecast. We got considerably less than we hoped, and we paid much more for it than we calculated.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1948-04-06a.39.0" colnum="39" time="">
<p>On the export side, the rise in volume was not as great as we had planned, largely due to the set-back in production in the early months of last year, though, with the increases in price, the value of our exports was only &#x00A3;75 million less than the estimate. Government expenditure abroad exceeded the expectation by &#x00A3;36 million, due to the continuing political uncertainties throughout the world, which made it impossible for us to reduce expenditure as rapidly as we had planned. Our earnings from invisibles were &#x00A3;90 million below the forecast for a variety of reasons. Our net shipping earnings were only &#x00A3;17 million. As we are importing less than before the war, if we had as large a shipping tonnage as pre-war we could have earned a net income several times the pre-war level of &#x00A3;20 million, but owing to our shipping losses, the amount of tonnage available for the profitable cross-trade routes is less than before the war. In addition, oversea expenses of British ships have gone up, as has the cost of repairs in foreign ports. This cannot be avoided, owing to the pressure on our own yards.</p>

<p>Our net income from investments was only &#x00A3;51 million in 1947, a decline of &#x00A3;24 million on 1946 and of no less than &#x00A3;124 million on 1938. We have had to continue selling some of our foreign assets. On the item of interest we have had to meet charges on our war-time borrowings of over &#x00A3;3,500 million, and in 1947 there were particularly heavy transfers of profits by foreign firms operating in this country. Our miscellaneous invisible items cover a large range of activities, involving both receipts and expenditure abroad. There was a large increase in most of this expenditure, much of which was of a productive character, largely connected with establishing new markets and business connections overseas as part of the export

drive, and, of course, also on the restoration of plant and other physical property damaged or neglected during the war.</p>

<p>All these adverse factors reflected themselves in the drain on our gold and dollar reserves, which stood out as the most obviously serious feature of the whole situation. The drain turned out to be more than 50 per cent. greater than our overall deficit, amounting to 1,023 million during the year. This matter has been fully explored on more than one occasion in the House, and I do not propose to deal with it again now.</p>

<p>I turn, therefore, to the future&#x2014;to the dimensions of our external problems in 1948, and the measures that we must take to keep the drain on our gold and dollar reserves under control. In the Survey are set out our prospective foreign receipts, both for the first six months of 1948 and for the year as a whole. The provisional export targets for 1948, which were given last September, have been exhaustively reviewed and revised in consultation with the industries concerned. In the result, we have slightly reduced the overall target for the end of 1948. We now aim to reach a level of 50 per cent. by volume above 1938 by the end of December next, instead of 60 per cent., which was the target fixed last September. If we build up to 150 per cent. by the end of the year, we estimate that that should give an average throughout the year, of 130 per cent. I do not think that this is an over-optimistic target, in view of the fact that we reached a level of 128 per cent. in January and 121 per cent. in the shorter month of February. But it will certainly require a sustained effort in many industries if we are to reach the overall 150 per cent. level by the end of this year. This is, of course, only an average figure made up of many different percentages, some smaller and some greater for the different industries.</p>

<p>On the side of invisible exports and imports, though we look for some small improvement, we cannot hope for any marked increase of net invisible earnings for some time to come. We estimate that in the first half year we shall receive, mainly from shipping and interest, &#x00A3;161 million against payments of &#x00A3;70 million for Government overseas expenditure and &#x00A3;140 million for other outgoings&#x2014;giving a

<p>Imports for the first half year have been fixed at &#x00A3;792 million sterling. Our import programme has been built up on three principles&#x2014;the first, to buy as little as possible from countries to whom we must pay dollars or gold; the second, to buy the minimum of food to maintain a healthy standard; and the third, to buy the minimum of raw materials to enable us to maintain a high level of industrial activity.</p>

<p>For the first six months of 1948, our import programme, so constructed, will result in an overall deficit on our balance of payments of at least &#x00A3;136 million. But, as some surpluses in sterling area countries cannot be used to offset other deficiencies, we estimate the drain on our reserves at over &#x00A3;220 million. Such a high rate of continuing drain on our reserves must give us all the gravest concern and it cannot be allowed to continue. The preservation of our reserves must be a cardinal principle of our planning. If, without further external aid, this drain were to continue, then our remaining reserves, which we estimate at a maximum of &#x00A3;450 million in June next, would be halved before the end of the year, and would be wholly exhausted in 1949.</p>

<p>During, this last week-end we have all seen that the Congress of the United States of America have passed the legislation for the European Recovery Programme and that the President has put his signature to it. That is an event of the most profound world significance. At this moment of doubt and difficulty in world affairs it comes as a light and hope to the freedom-loving peoples of the world. I could not let this occasion, on which we are dealing with matters so intimately affected by this action of the United States, pass without recording what is I am sure the deep and genuine gratitude of the whole Committee for what is being done and for the speeding and helpful way in which it has been done.</p>

<p>I need not emphasise what would have happened if no aid had been forthcoming from the United States. We should have been forced to cut down drastically our imports of food and raw materials, with

the gravest consequences to our standard of living, our employment, and our productive effort. United States aid cannot, however, add significantly to our reserves; it can help to reduce the drain upon them. We must, therefore, so manage our affairs that the drain on our reserves over the whole period of aid is brought as low as possible and virtually eliminated. We shall need all the reserves we can muster when Marshall Aid comes to an end. This means that we must control our imports, both in total amount and also in composition. We must make sure of our necessities and we shall not be able to indulge in luxuries. It means also that we must send more goods abroad even before satisfying our home market unless we can increase our production to meet both export and home demands.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1948-04-06a.42.1" colnum="42" time="">
<p>As I have said on many occasions, the European Recovery Plan does not solve our problems or those of Western Europe. We are faced with the need to redress, within the next four years, the present gravely unbalanced position between the Western Hemisphere and Western Europe, so that at the end of the period we shall no longer need extraordinary outside help. It gives us time to build up our own economy and to co-operate with the participating countries for the same purpose. We shall have to devote this opportunity not to an early improvement of our standard of living, but to a strengthening of our physical resources, both in the United Kingdom, in Western Europe, and in those overseas countries whose economies are dependent upon, or linked with, the countries receiving Marshall Aid. As the Committee is aware, rapid progress has been made towards effective co-operation between the countries of Western Europe. This co-operation should not in any way prejudice the close working of our own country with the rest of the sterling area, and particularly the sterling area Dominions. It should, in fact, result in an extension of trade and commerce between Western Europe and the sterling area, to the benefit of both.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1948-04-06a.42.2" colnum="42" time="">
<p>The strategy of the Government's plan for bringing about a better balance of payments between ourselves and the Western Hemisphere is set out in paragraphs 67 to 81 of the Economic Survey. The elements of those plans are, the diversion of exports to the dollar areas; the building


up of alternative sources of imports in non-dollar countries; close co-operation with the sterling area, and with the countries of Western Europe and their dependencies; and the restoration of conditions of multilateral trade over as wide an area as possible, with the eventual object of our being able to earn dollars or gold by our multilateral trade.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1948-04-06a.43.0" colnum="43" time="">
<p>As part of these plans the Government are steadily pushing ahead the development of new sources of supply of raw materials and food in our overseas territories and throughout the sterling area. The groundnut scheme is one example. Co-operative developments of poultry farming in Eire, and of grain production and pig farming in Queensland, are examples of another type. Moreover, we have been able to make arrangements with some of the Western European countries, such as Denmark and Holland, by which we can increase our exports to them of products they particularly require and, in return, get larger supplies of food.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1948-04-06a.43.1" colnum="43" time="">
<p>As we turn from our excessive dependence upon the Western Hemisphere to other sources of supply we must, of course, adjust our export plans both as to type and to destination. We must maintain a great degree of flexibility as these plans develop so that we can manufacture for the countries which send us additional supplies the goods they need, at the price and quality they can afford, in return for the imports which we need from them. This is not a matter which is capable of precise regulation by the Government. It must be left to close co-operation between the Government and industry, and producers will have to bear in mind the national interest, as indicated by the Government's plans, rather than their individual interest in seeking quick profits in easy markets.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1948-04-06a.43.2" colnum="43" time="">
<p>In particular, of course, we must pay unremitting attention to the expansion of our exports to the dollar countries. Here again, I must repeat that we cannot choose the exports we will send. We must make what those countries are willing to buy from us. We must also expand our exports to South Africa, because that country is a source of gold for us. The increase of our exports to South Africa is one of the few ways of strengthening our reserves that still remain open to us. These changes in our

export policy and the development of production of non-dollar sources of supply obviously require time to be effective. The great act of the United States in bringing into operation the European Recovery Programme has given us and the Western European countries that time. Time, I would remind the Committee, is the scarcest commodity of all today, and we cannot afford to waste a moment of it.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1948-04-06a.44.1" colnum="44" time="">
<p>I now turn to our internal economic situation and to the problem of securing a balance between our internal resources and the demands that are made upon them. The steps taken during the past year to strengthen our administrative machinery for handling this problem of planning the nation's resources have proved of toe greatest value. It is just about a year, the Committee will remember, since the Central Economic Planning staff came into being and the Economic Planning Board was set up. The latter body comprises representatives of industrial employers and trade unionists, together with the permanent heads of the principal Government Departments concerned with economic affairs. It has come to play a most effective part in helping to shape our economic policy. The achievement of a satisfactory internal balance is, of course, fundamental to a healthy economy. If demand is grossly excessive or, as has been the case too often in the past, grossly deficient, the economic system cannot work smoothly. In the particularly difficult situation in which we find ourselves today, our internal situation is bound to affect our external balance of payments. If inflationary tendencies are not controlled, exports will suffer from the too strong drag of the home market and the too high prices at which they will have to be offered overseas.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1948-04-06a.44.2" colnum="44" time="">
<p>Excessive and uncontrolled demand also makes all planning a matter of extreme difficulty and renders it impossible to carry out the plans that are laid down&#x2014;especially in such a democracy as ours, where we all desire to preserve a large measure of freedom of action for the individual. Today, all industries tend to show an abnormal appearance of prosperity, which exaggerates the real insufficiency of capacity and labour. Competition for scarce resources of all kinds exists, in which the most desirable


products from the national point of view are by no means necessarily successful, and there arises, as a result, a demand for increased controls over resources and investment because of the heavy pressure upon them.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1948-04-06a.45.0" colnum="45" time="">
<p>The balancing of resources and needs is a continuing process and is one of great complexity. As a first stage, we need to achieve an over-all balance, measured in monetary units, but that alone is by no means sufficient. Needs vary in importance, absolutely and from time to time. Some are more essential for the good of the country; others are less so. We must see that the principle "First things first" is carried into effect; and it is not always easy to agree upon what the first things are, though we should, I am sure, all agree that the ultimate welfare and happiness of our own people is the first demand upon our resources.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1948-04-06a.45.2" colnum="45" time="">
<p>When formulating a plan which will give an over-all balance we must ask what it means in terms of manpower, and what changes it may involve in the distribution of manpower between different industries and different parts of the country. Raw materials, too, must be examined to see whether they can be made available and capital equipment for the necessary changes or expansions of production should be considered. Obviously, if any measure of success is to be achieved in carrying out the plan, the tasks set for different industries must be indicated. That has been done in the Survey for certain of our key industries, and targets have also been set for the labour force to show what changes in the distribution of manpower are desirable.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1948-04-06a.45.3" colnum="45" time="">
<p>I would warn the Committee against the danger of developing plans which have no real relation to the actual facts of our present situation. Many such proposals have been put forward by armchair critics which would involve the movement of many hundreds of thousands of workers and their retraining in new skills, the use of raw materials that we cannot obtain and of capacity which does not exist and cannot be created. We are dealing primarily with production by human beings and they cannot, and must not, be dealt with as though they were pieces of machinery. We have to plan within the restrictions imposed by human habit and

custom as well as by raw materials and machine capacity.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1948-04-06a.46.0" colnum="46" time="">
<p>It is because of the overriding importance of this human factor that we must give the producers the fullest information both as to our existing economic situation and as to the targets of production at which we are aiming. Unfortunately, it is not possible to set targets from the centre for all individual production units. A global target can be set for an industry as a whole but it is not possible in most cases to break that down owing to the very great variety of products and to the scarcity of raw materials and components that is bound to persist until we can afford to fill up all the pipelines of production.</p>

<minor-heading id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1948-04-06a.46.1" colnum="46">CLAIMS ON NATIONAL INCOME</minor-heading>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1948-04-06a.46.2" colnum="46" time="">
<p>Turning to the actual working out of the plan for this year, I shall only have time today to deal with our internal position on very broad lines. There are three claims upon our available national resources&#x2014;public consumption expenditure; capital development, both public and private; and private or personal consumption. The first of these includes the expenditure of Government Departments and of municipalities and thus comprises all those national activities which we have decided to undertake in common because we regard them as of importance. In 1938, public current expenditure on goods and services absorbed only about 16 per cent. of the net national income. In 1948, on the basis of the provisional estimates in the Survey, that figure will be 22 per cent. I will revert later to the main items of that expenditure.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1948-04-06a.46.3" colnum="46" time="">
<p>The second claim on national resources is for the maintenance and improvement of our capital equipment. The Survey gives a forecast of &#x00A3;1,800 million gross capital development in this country. That is the figure resulting from the review of investment programmes carried out last autumn. It is by no means an excessive amount when we bear in mind the great arrears of replacement and maintenance during the war period. It is, indeed, quite obvious that if we could afford it and had the necessary materials, we ought to make even greater provision to develop to the full our export and import-saving potentialities, especially in the way of new inventions and processes which will give us competitive advantages in the future. The fact that we


are, I hope temporarily, unable to embark on more extensive schemes should not stop the preparation and planning of such schemes for future execution. Indeed, it may be an opportunity when engineers, architects and other professional persons are less heavily engaged on current work, to get ahead with those plans for the future.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1948-04-06a.47.0" colnum="47" time="">
<p>When the two claims on national income that I have mentioned have been met, the remainder is available for personal consumption, and if inflationary pressure is to be avoided, personal consumption must be limited to this amount. Sufficient purchasing power must be with-held by taxation and by voluntary saving, to offset the purchasing power created by public expenditure and capital investment. The voluntary saving we need is private saving&#x2014;that is, abstention from spending. In our situation today, the amount saved is more important than the particular security or institution in which the savings may be held; but money saved should be invested safely and kept unspent until it is wise to use it. I ask the National Savings Movement to take abstention from spending as its central theme for 1948, and I know that I can rely on their doing their utmost to increase private savings in that way.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1948-04-06a.47.2" colnum="47" time="">
<p>When we come to consider, as we must, the degree of inflationary pressure which today exists in our economy, we enter the most difficult field of economic analysis. It is not possible to give any accurate answer to the question: "How much inflation is there?" Nor is it easy to find remedies to deal with the situation. Indeed, inflationary pressure cannot be removed entirely by Governmental action unless we are to envisage a degree of economic control which is too rigid to be operated in a democracy, and would defeat our aim of getting away from detailed controls as rapidly as possible.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1948-04-06a.47.3" colnum="47" time="">
<p>As to the facts, there can be no doubt that during last year many signs of inflationary pressure were to be observed. The demand for labour and materials was excessive throughout industry; costs, profits, and wages rose all through the year; the pressure of the black market continued in certain spheres, and we experienced great difficulty in devoting

sufficient of our resources to those types of production which were the most urgent for the country but not necessarily the most profitable or attractive to the producer.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1948-04-06a.48.0" colnum="48" time="">
<p>And yet during 1947 we had an overseas deficit of &#x00A3;675 million, which meant that we had that extra volume of goods available to us in excess of our own production. In 1948, we plan to reduce that excess very substantially, depending to some extent upon the outcome of the European Recovery Programme. This means that there will be an increase of inflationary pressure to the extent of the difference between the amounts of the excess imports in the two years respectively. To set against this we have the reduction in capital investment consequent upon the plans of last autumn.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1948-04-06a.48.1" colnum="48" time="">
<p>There will, therefore, almost certainly be a net increase in the inflationary tendencies this year as compared with last year. This problem of removing the inflationary pressure is not by any means the only one affecting the Budget, though it certainly is the most immediately important. There are two ways, as I have already stated, by which the inflationary pressure can be reduced&#x2014;voluntary withholding of spending and Government taxation.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1948-04-06a.48.2" colnum="48" time="">
<p>The mere fact that there is a Budget surplus, according to our traditional form of account, does not mean that we are thereby reducing inflationary pressure by the amount of that surplus. Last year there was, as the Committee knows, and as I will explain in detail in a few moments, a large Budget surplus, and it was in fact rather more than sufficient to secure that the money collected by taxation, with other Government revenue, defrayed all the Government's expenditure of every kind, omitting, of course, the Sinking Fund. I am not advancing any view that this is a test which ought necessarily to be applied year by year in judging the adequacy of the Budget. Much of the Government's capital investment which is of the highest priority should, in normal circumstances, properly be met from savings, that is to say, by borrowing rather than by taxation, but in this present inflationary condition a different and more stringent test is required.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1948-04-06a.48.3" colnum="48" time="">
<p>Indeed, it is clear that despite the large surplus on last year's Budget inflationary pressure has not yet been decreased to


any marked extent. In view, therefore, of the factors I have mentioned, which will tend to increase inflationary pressure this year, we must secure an exceptionally large Budget surplus, big enough to yield a balance after all forms of Government expenditure have been met. We cannot, I think, rely upon any substantial increase in private savings; to do so would be highly speculative and quite unsafe, though we shall certainly hope that their volume will be at least maintained at last year's figures. On the other hand, we are certainly looking for an increase in production, through greater effort, higher efficiency, and continued mechanisation; and we want to do all we can to encourage that increase.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1948-04-06a.49.0" colnum="49" time="">
<p>The Budget must, therefore, to fit in with the economic plan set out in the Survey, have two main objectives&#x2014;first, to obtain, with an equitable distribution of the load of taxation, a real and substantial surplus, which more than provides for all Government expenditure, capital and current, and leaves over a balance, to be used to counter the inflationary pressure; and second, so to adjust taxation as to encourage production, by providing a better incentive to producers. This sets a difficult task, because, as I have said, no one can assess with any certainty the present degree of inflationary pressure or define with accuracy in which part of our economy it is strongest. My proposals, when I come to them, may be criticised as doing too much or too little.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1948-04-06a.49.1" colnum="49" time="">
<p>We must always remember that one of the factors in inflation is the state of mind of the community as a whole, and if this altered we might find ourselves in a very changed situation. I hope that my proposals will prove sufficient, without weighing unduly heavily upon the taxpayers; but we must watch the situation carefully, and be ready to detect the moment when the inflationary pressure vanishes and gives place to deflationary tendencies; if such a thing should happen, we must then make a rapid readjustment of our economic and financial policies.</p>

This imposed further taxation, estimated to bring in an extra &#x00A3;198 million in a full year. On this basis the anticipated surplus for 1947&#x2013;48 would have totalled &#x00A3;318 million. Instead, the realised surplus has amounted to &#x00A3;636 million.

The new duty of pool betting, which came into effect on 4th January, has brought in nearly &#x00A3;3&#x00BE; million as against an estimate of &#x00A3;3 million. Of this, roughly &#x00A3;2 million has come from the totalisators at dog races, and the balance from football pools.</p>

<p>Turning now to Inland Revenue receipts, these have produced a record surplus over estimates of &#x00A3;214 million that is &#x00A3;1,799 million compared to an estimate of &#x00A3;1,585 million, and this excess is derived from almost every head of revenue. Income Tax, at &#x00A3;1,190 million is &#x00A3;104 million up, again a reflection of the increased profits and earnings, evidence of the inflationary tendency in the previous year. The Surtax accounts for &#x00A3;91 million an excess of &#x00A3;11 million over the estimate. Death duties gave


&#x00A3;172 million, a surplus of &#x00A3;17 million, and E.P.T. and Profits Tax together &#x00A3;289 million, a surplus of &#x00A3;83 million. Stamp Duties alone at &#x00A3;56 million have fallen short of the estimate, by &#x00A3;1 million. The large surplus on the Income Tax is not attributable to the interest charge, for the rate of collection has actually fallen this year compared with last year; but in the case of Surtax and E.P.T. there has undoubtedly been an acceleration of collection due to the interest charge.</p>

Surplus stores, at &#x00A3;197 million, are &#x00A3;102 million over the estimate, and net receipts from trading services, mainly realisations of stocks, at &#x00A3;101 million, exceeded the estimate by &#x00A3;46 million. Miscellaneous Receipts, which included the &#x00A3;112 million of unspent Votes of Credit from previous years, realised &#x00A3;278 million as against the estimate of &#x00A3;303 million.

<p>I now turn to the Expenditure of 1947&#x2013;48. Excluding &#x00A3;22 million for Sinking Funds, which, for technical reasons, appears in the Budget expenditure of last year, the total expenditure shows an excess of only &#x00A3;6 million over last April's estimate of &#x00A3;3,181 million, or less than one-fifth of 1 per cent. This is remarkable, since the rise in costs might well have caused an increase comparable to that in revenue, but it has not been so because of the constant effort to keep down expenditure. As a result of last autumn's decision to accelerate the run down in the Forces, there was a saving of &#x00A3;45 million on Defence expenditure at &#x00A3;854 million. On the side of Civil expenditure, however, there was an increase of &#x00A3;73 million over the estimate of &#x00A3;1,726 million, making &#x00A3;1,799 million in total.

We must, however, have regard to the fact that, for the present, Defence expenditure is necessarily running at a high level&#x2014;though it is coming down&#x2014;and that we have already initiated, since the war, extended social services, which have not yet by any means reached the limits of their claims on our resources.

million, as against &#x00A3;334 million in the original Estimate last year, but here it must be borne in mind that the special item of &#x00A3;100 million for the Argentine came fortuitously into last year's accounts.</p>

<p>Food subsidies are estimated, in round figures, to amount to &#x00A3;400 million for the year. We have decided to continue these subsidies at this level, because we are convinced that though, in theory, they may be inflationary, in practice, they have, in the particular circumstances of today, precisely the opposite effect, since they restrain the demands, which would otherwise inevitably arise, for increased personal incomes to meet the increased cost of living. It must be remembered, in any consideration of cost of living figures, especially in comparison with other countries, that we are providing this sum annually out of taxation, which is equivalent to something like 12s. to 14s. a week for every family in the country, in addition to at least a like sum by way of social services.</p>

The comparable figure for the 1947&#x2013;8 estimate was &#x00A3;661 million, so that there is a net saving on these items of &#x00A3;142 million or 21&#x00BD; per cent. over this group. An analysis of this total of &#x00A3;519 million will be found in Tables VIII (<i>c</i>) and (<i>d</i>) of the Financial Statement. It is too long to go into in detail at present. It covers a very wide range of services, some of them still affected by war circumstances, and in these we can look for further reductions.

<p>I now come to the estimate of revenue for 1948&#x2013;49, on the existing basis of taxation. During 1948&#x2013;49, Customs and Excise receipts will show the full effect of the changes in taxation introduced since last April, including the tobacco concession to

Beer, and the rest of the alcoholic drinks, are expected to bring in &#x00A3;400 million, tobacco &#x00A3;560 million, and Purchase Tax &#x00A3;300 million.

<p>So far as the Inland Revenue is concerned, we can look for a further expansion this year. There has been a considerable expansion of profits in 1947, and it is those profits which will come under charge to Income Tax this year. There was also a considerable rise in wages and salaries last autumn, with the result that total earnings will be running at a higher level this year than they were last year. Even allowing for the increased reliefs which were given by last year's Budget, which will operate fully this year, I anticipate a yield of &#x00A3;1,395 million from Income Tax this year, compared with &#x00A3;1,190 million last year. Last year's high Surtax yield will, I hope, be maintained and I estimate for &#x00A3;90 million. I expect 160 million from Death Duties, and &#x00A3;55 million from stamps. E.P.T. will show a further substantial fall&#x2014;it now being over a year since the tax was taken off&#x2014;but we can reckon on a full year's yield of the increased Profits Tax, so that the two together are estimated to yield &#x00A3;250 million this year. Adding &#x00A3;1 million for miscellaneous duties gives a total from Inland Revenue of &#x00A3;1,951 million, or an increase on last year's out-turn of &#x00A3;152 million. Since the present Government took office, we have reduced Income Tax by 1s. in the &#x00A3;, substantially increased personal allowances and reliefs, and abolished E.P.T.; and yet the total yield of Inland Revenue duties is now not far short of the all time peak of &#x00A3;2,043 million, reached in 1945&#x2013;46.</p>

Trading services should realise &#x00A3;57 million, against last year's estimate of &#x00A3;55 million; &#x00A3;12 million should come from broadcasting licences and Crown Lands, &#x00A3;14 million from sundry loans, and &#x00A3;68 million from miscellaneous receipts&#x2014;against the exceptional figure of &#x00A3;270 million estimated, and &#x00A3;243 million re-

ceived last year. The total of these items is &#x00A3;303 million. To sum up, therefore, the total revenue on the existing basis of taxation is estimated at &#x00A3;3,754 million as against an expenditure of &#x00A3;2,976 million, or a prospective surplus, on the traditional basis, of &#x00A3;778 million.</p>

<p>The figures I have given for the realised surplus in 1947&#x2013;48, and for the expected surplus on the existing basis of taxation in 1948&#x2013;49, are on the conventional basis, that is they relate to the


position on that part of the Exchequer balance sheet which is commonly spoken of as "above the line." This basis has been criticised in the past, on the ground that "the line" does not divide capital items on the one side from revenue items on the other. Originally, the criticism was that capital payments were being charged to the revenue account, so that the real surplus available for tax reductions was larger than appeared in the Budget. Latterly, it has been criticised on the opposite ground, that payments which should be charged to the revenue account were being met by borrowing, and that capital receipts were being credited to the revenue account, with the result that the surplus shown in the budget was greater than the true surplus of the year. It was also argued that there was a number of non-recurrent items in the Budget, arising mainly out of the aftermath of the war, more of them occurring on the receipts side than on the payments side, and that therefore the surplus was itself non-recurrent and would not be maintainable.</p>

<p>These opposing lines of criticism open up a subject of great interest, and, especially at the present time, of considerable importance; and I would, therefore, like to express a layman's view on the issues presented. It is not profitable, now that war terminal items on both sides have diminished considerably, to pursue arguments based simply on recurrence or non-recurrence of such items. Items must be shown in full in the accounts, whether or not they will recur in a subsequent year. They are no less real because they are non-recurrent. Moreover, there is no clear frontier between entirely non-recurrent items and those which may take some years to decline to nothing. Indeed, the Committee may hope that some of the present rates of taxation may have some element of non-recurrence in them; but none of us can say which items may diminish or by how much.</p>

The proceeds of taxation are all in the revenue account. There are also some miscellaneous receipts (broadcasting Licences, Crown Lands, etc.) which are clearly revenue. On the other hand, receipts from the sale of surplus stores&#x2014;&#x00A3;197 million, capital repayments from trading services&#x2014;&#x00A3;101 million, and repayments of loans, etc.&#x2014;&#x00A3;85 million, are put to capital, and the surrender to the Exchequer of balances on war time accounts&#x2014;&#x00A3;112 million, is omitted from revenue account, as an internal transaction of the Government.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1948-04-06a.58.1" colnum="58" time="">
<p>On the expenditure side, sinking fund, loans to allies, etc., are excluded from the revenue account, together with the advance payment to the Argentine, and certain payments which are the cost of creating physical assets&#x2014;including the net value of changes in food stocks but not including such items as ships of war and aeroplanes. The total so transferred to capital account is about &#x00A3;211 million. But Post-War Credits&#x2014;&#x00A3;56 million&#x2014;are included in the revenue account. War damage and Excess Profits Tax refunds are left in the capital account. On this basis, a real surplus of receipts over payments on revenue account for 1947&#x2013;48 is shown, at about &#x00A3;338 million.</p>

<p>Hon. Members may have noticed that, on page 29 of the National Income White Paper, a deficit of &#x00A3;537 million on the current account of the Central Government appears, and they may wonder how this can be reconciled with the surplus of &#x00A3;338 million which I have just mentioned. The difference is almost wholly due to two large factors. First, I have taken war damage payments and E.P.T. refunds into the capital account, whereas the White Paper treats them in the revenue account of the Central Government. This accounts for &#x00A3;306 million of the difference. Second, the White Paper covers the calendar year 1947, whereas the Budget figures cover the financial year 1947&#x2013;48. The big increases of taxation and the big reductions of expenditure, made between


the first quarter of 1947 and the first quarter of 1948, account for over &#x00A3;500 million in round figures. The anticipated real surplus in 1948&#x2013;49 on the existing basis of taxation would, on the basis which I described a moment or two ago, amount to about &#x00A3;598 million.</p>

<p>When we examine these figures from the point of view of their effect on the inflationary tendencies, we have to look at them in relation to the economic situation as a whole. The expenditure of the Government on capital account puts money into circulation and creates purchasing power just as much as does the expenditure on revenue account, and has to be offset by private saving, or by the revenue surplus. When we make this examination, we see that, in 1947&#x2013;48, the Government put back into circulation, in one way or another, all the money they withdrew by taxation. They paid for their own capital expenditure, but there was no surplus over to help to stem the inflationary tendencies in the rest of the economic system. It is at such an overall and absolute surplus that we must aim this year, and it must be substantial enough to make an impact on the situation. Especially in view of the reduction in our external deficit, I believe that we should aim at such a true overall surplus of about &#x00A3;300 million.</p>

We have stated no objection to adjustments as set out in the White Paper; indeed, we have envisaged the need for such adjustments in special cases. We are much encouraged in this policy by the support that the Trades Union Congress has given to our appeal.</p>

<p>When it comes to profits, we have taken steps by taxation to limit the amount of profits that can be distributed to shareholders. Roughly speaking, 60 per cent. of distributed profits now has to be paid in taxation through Income Tax and Profits Tax, and it is only the remaining 40 per cent. that can be distributed as personal incomes. At the same time, we


have appealed to the directors of companies not to increase the distribution of profits this year, and to that appeal there has already been a wide response. I propose to leave the matter there until next year, by which time we shall see whether the promises not to increase the distribution of profits have been fully carried out.</p>

<p>So far as prices are concerned, we recognise that increases which have already occurred and may yet occur, in the prices of primary commodities will make it impossible to prevent a rise in some prices even when full advantage is taken of the economies which can be made by greater efficiency and of the maximum reduction of profits and of margins for distribution. It is important that, when the people are being asked to forego increases in their personal incomes there should be, so far as possible, stabilisation of prices over the whole field, whether covered by price control or not. We have, therefore, appealed to the trading community to co-operate in effecting a price standstill and in making reductions in price wherever possible, to offset the inevitable price increases to which I have referred.</p>

<p>Perhaps it would be convenient, before I come to the main items of tax changes in the Budget, to deal first with certain minor matters. There will be a few alterations on the Customs side, arising out of the trade agreements which we entered into at Geneva last autumn. Most of the changes we then undertook to make were, in fact, brought into operation by Treasury Order as from 1st January last. A few cases must, however, be dealt with in the Finance Bill. These relate to a very mixed bag&#x2014;motor cycles, agricultural tractors, prunes, rice, patent leather, and certain silk and artificial silk manufactures. On most of these matters Budget Resolutions will also be required. These will implement undertakings already published in respect of these goods.

This, which is mainly a tax on soda water, which I do not drink, now yields only about &#x00A3;150,000 a year, and is not worth the trouble and manpower necessary for its collection. It will be repealed as from 1st May, and the loss this year will be about &#x00A3;100,000. At any rate, we think that very little soda water is drunk neat in this country today.

Where the taxpayer's coding is correct and tax has been correctly deducted in accordance with that coding, the liability will be regarded as finally discharged, and no assessment will


be made in respect of any slight underpayment that may result. There will also be a change in the measure of relief in respect of life insurance premiums, designed to permit the relief to be accurately allowed for in the coding.</p>

With the present system of guaranteed prices, there is no reason why farmers should not&#x2014;in common with everyone else&#x2014;pay tax on their true income. Indeed it is a matter of importance both for the nation and for the farmers that accurate and proper accounts of their activities should be available in connection with the review of costs undertaken by the independent economists for the fixation of prices under Part I of the Agriculture Act, 1947, and we believe that this alteration in the method of taxation will help to produce such accounts.</p>

<p>There will be a corresponding increase of &#x00A3;1 per proof gallon in the duties on whisky, rum, and other spirits. This increase will be the equivalent of 2s. 4d. a bottle on whisky of the usual strength of 30 degrees under proof. The increase will not, however, apply to perfumed spirits, a very different thing from potable spirits.

<p>In regard to wine, the changes which I propose will have two objectives. In the first place, there will be a general increase of the rates of duty, corresponding to the rates of increase for beer and spirits. For heavy wines of foreign origin, the increase will be the equivalent of 1s. a bottle, and for light wines, 6d. The Empire wine countries have, however, made out what seems to me a good case that, although the margin of preference on their heavy wines has been continued at the amount of 4s. a gallon&#x2014;at which it stood before the war&#x2014;this difference has become proportionately of much less value in relation to the present rates of duty. We therefore agreed, at Geneva, that this margin should be raised to 10s. a gallon. The practical effect of this is that the rates on heavy wines from South Africa, Australia and other Empire countries will remain unchanged at the present level.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1948-04-06a.64.2" colnum="64" time="">
<p>In addition, we have undertaken with France to make certain reductions in the rates of surcharge on sparkling wines and on still wines imported in bottle. These concessions, details of which have already been published, will be brought into effect in the new scale of rates that I now propose. There will be corresponding changes in the rates on British wines, equivalent to an extra 6d. a bottle on light wines, and 1s. a bottle on the heavier types. In the Debate on the November Finance Bill, my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary undertook to give sympathetic consideration to a proposal to allow the British wine industry to raise the strength


of their product in bond with duty-free spirits, in the same way that importers of foreign and Empire wines have been able to do for many years. I have decided that it would be reasonable to meet this request of the industry, and a provision to that effect will be included in the Finance Bill. Further details of these proposals will be found in the usual White Paper. The new rates of duty will come into operation from tomorrow, and are estimated to yield additional revenue of &#x00A3;45 million in a full year and &#x00A3;41 million in 1948&#x2013;49.</p>

<p>As the Committee is aware, the increases in Tobacco Duty last year were made with a view to producing a substantial fall in consumption, put by my predecessor as at least 25 per cent. This reduction in consumption has not been fully realised, and it is as necessary as ever that we should keep down the consumption of this imported article. It would not be advisable, I feel, to make another very large increase in the duty; but it is necessary to bring to smokers' attention once again the need for economising in tobacco, and I therefore propose to raise the Duties on leaf tobacco by 3s. 4d. a lb. and to make corresponding adjustments in the rates chargeable on imports of cigars, cigarettes, and other manufactured tobacco.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1948-04-06a.65.2" colnum="65" time="">

It is estimated that this increase in duty will yield &#x00A3;20 million in a full year and &#x00A3;19&#x00BD; million this year. The new rates of duty will come into effect as from tomorrow. In the absence of special action, this increase in the duty would give the tobacco manufacturers a substantial and fortuitous profit. It would not be right that, in present circumstances, they should retain this, and I therefore propose to place a corresponding Excise Duty on stock held by manufacturers on Budget day.

<p>I now come to the question of Betting Duty. The collection of this duty has

proved easy and profitable, and I have come to the conclusion that, in present circumstances, football and similar pools can bear a higher rate of duty. I propose, therefore, to increase the present rate of 10 per cent. to 20 per cent. The new rate will apply to all such pools in respect of events taking place after today. There is one small loophole in this duly which I propose to close. Some operators in this field have discovered that the existing definition of pool betting, by which winnings are related to the total amount staked, does not cover the case in which a fixed amount is offered as the prize money, to be divided amongst the winners without reference to the total amount staked. The definition of pool betting will be extended to cover these cases. The tax on bets with the totalisators at dog tracks bears more heavily than that on the pools, because of the mote rapid turnover of money from race to race. I do not, therefore, propose to increase the tax on totalisator bets.</p>

<p>The next item is the difficult and complex one of the Purchase Tax. Almost my first experience of my present office was the widespread demand for a comprehensive review of the Purchase Tax. The criticisms of the present tax fall under three main heads. First, it is said that the tax classification is unduly complicated, and gives rise to many anomalies; second, that the tax falls unduly hardly on necessities, and therefore has an inflationary effect; and, third, that the legal provisions governing the rate of tax are difficult to follow, being scattered among a number of schedules to different Finance Acts. There is a good deal, I think, in all these criticisms, and, anyway, I am sure that it is necessary to re-arrange the whole incidence of the tax and to make it more easily intelligible.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1948-04-06a.67.2" colnum="67" time="">
<p>I must, however, continue to look to the tax for a very substantial revenue, especially in existing circumstances. Yet I am, at the same time, most anxious to make some contribution to a lowering of prices, and, what is more important still, to provide some relief for the hard-pressed housewife, who feels the incidence of this tax very keenly. We must certainly continue the exemption of those broad classes of goods which must be regarded as absolute essentials for the individual and for the maintenance of the home.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1948-04-06a.67.3" colnum="67" time="">
<p>I accordingly propose to continue the exemption of all food and fuel, and of utility clothing, with one exception to which I will refer in a moment. Similarly, utility furniture, sheets, towels, pillow cases and so on, cups and saucers, saucepans, buckets and so forth, and the various kinds of household brooms, brushes, soap, and similar cleaning material, will all continue to be exempt. One of the great complexities of the present tax is the diversity of rates in force&#x2014;33&#x2153; per cent., 50 per cent., 66&#x2154; per cent., 75 per cent. and 125 per cent. I propose, therefore, to reclassify the

whole field into four categories&#x2014;exempt, 33&#x2153; per cent., 66&#x2154; per cent., and 100 per cent., all percentages being on the wholesale value.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1948-04-06a.68.0" colnum="68" time="">
<p>Experience has shown that above 100 per cent. evasion is widespread, and goods are driven on to a black market. The goods to fall within the new 100 per cent. category will be substantially those hitherto in the 125 per cent. and 75 per cent. lists. The rest of the field of chargeable goods will be divided between the 33&#x2153; per cent. and 66&#x2154; per cent. rates. Practically all the articles at present charged at 33&#x2153; per cent. will remain in that category, and I shall add to that list one or two articles, at present exempt, which for special reasons can be moved up. Children's non-utility clothing was made tax free before utility clothing was being produced for children, and it is right that, as with other garments, the exemption should be limited to the utility types. I, therefore, propose to put up children's non-utility clothing into the 33&#x2153; per cent. class, and also utility fully-fashioned stockings, which can bear the lowest rate of tax; this may, indeed, make it a little easier to meet the demand. Refrigerators will also be moved up to the 33&#x2153; per cent. class.</p>

<p>The main reductions will come about by moving down a large range of articles from the present 50 per cent. class to the 33&#x2153; per cent. rate. The principal classes of goods that will thus benefit by a reduction of tax are: Headgear, gloves and haberdashery; carpets, rugs and matting; lighting fittings and hand lamps; vacuum cleaners, carpet sweepers, washing machines, sewing machines and ironing boards; knives, forks and spoons; stationery; toilet and shaving soaps; razors and razor blades; tooth brushes and tooth paste; and toys and sports goods. The rest of the group at present chargeable at 50 per cent. will go up to 66&#x2154; per cent. This list will include cloth, excluding utility kinds; non-utility furniture and soft-furnishings; clocks, watches and radio sets; trunks, etc., except the leather ones chargeable at the top rate; cameras and photographic films; smokers' requisites; and musical instruments. Organs, however, I propose to add to the list of exemptions, in view of the fact that the tax falls chiefly upon church finances.</p>

<p>On balance, therefore, this rearrangement of the Purchase Tax will make a contribution at the rate of &#x00A3;24 million a year to price reduction. The actual reductions, in the range of necessary goods like carpets, cutlery, haberdashery and so on, will amount to about &#x00A3;50 million, but will be offset by some increases in tax on less necessary articles. This will, I hope, be some encouragement to the housewife, who is such an essential factor in creating the necessary morale for high industrial production. I hope, too, that the reduction on stationery of all kinds will be of help to the educational world. The &#x00A3;50 million reductions of tax should mean a price reduction of approaching 10 per cent. spread over rather more than &#x00A3;500 million worth of goods this year.</p>

<p>The first matter with which I want to deal on the Inland Revenue side is one

which has been much complained of, and quite rightly too; that is the extravagant way in which, in recent years, companies have made expenses allowances to their directors and senior officials. It is perfectly legitimate, of course, to deduct, by way of expenses, a reasonable expenditure upon necessary entertainment; but this right has been noticeably abused by extension to cover the ordinary living expenses of many persons, who are either directors or employees of the companies. This must be brought to an end. Under the existing law, it falls upon the Inland Revenue authorities to prove that the payments are not necessary business expenses, and because of the difficulty of substantiating the case it often happens that these payments go untaxed. The majority opinion in industry condemns this practice, but there can be no doubt that many individuals are circumventing the law, and are succeeding in maintaining a lavish standard of living at the cost of the taxpayer.</p>

There is no intention to interfere with legitimate expenditure so incurred, but I hope that these new provisions will put a stop to the present bad practices. Since the proposal is designed to check an abuse, I do not anticipate any substantial new revenue from it. I put it at &#x00A3;250,000 for a complete year, and 150,000 for this year.</p>

Such devices, by which a man aims to evade paying his fair share of Income Tax, are intolerable in our present state of affairs and I must give warning that the position

<p>So far, I have indicated a net increase in revenue for this year of some &#x00A3;51 million, but I have to bear in mind that some moderate incentives are required to encourage production, and that we must have a sufficient absolute excess of revenue over all payments out to enable us to diminish the inflationary pressure. It is, therefore, necessary, as a special measure, to increase the revenue on the Inland Revenue side. Various attractive suggestions have been forward for a capital levy, but from the administrative point of view, a capital levy&#x2014;in the ordinary sense of those words&#x2014;is impracticable at the present time. It would be impossible to effect the valuation of all the capital assets in the country without a very large increase in the staff of valuers; and that staff is already very short for the jobs that it has got to do.

A contribution arrived at in this way avoids all the difficulties of valuation which beset a capital levy. It will cover all forms of income-producing capital, but not other forms. This is essential, if it is to avoid the delay and difficulties of a capital valuation.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1948-04-06a.72.0" colnum="72" time="">
<p>The contribution will apply only where the taxpayer's total income from all sources exceeds &#x00A3;2,000, and, in addition, his investment income exceeds &#x00A3;250. Thus, no persons of moderate means will be liable, and no purely earned income will be liable, however large it may be. The scale of duty will appear in full in the Financial Statement, but it will begin at 2S. in the pound on the slice of investment income between &#x00A3;250 and &#x00A3;500, rising to a maximum of 10s. in the pound on investment income exceeding &#x00A3;5,000. Provided that the total income exceeds &#x00A3;2,000, as I have said, a person with an investment income of &#x00A3;500 will pay only &#x00A3;25; with an investment income of &#x00A3;2,000 the charge will be &#x00A3;425; and a person with an investment income of &#x00A3;5,000 will pay &#x00A3;1,625. There will be a marginal relief to ensure that the contribution payable does not exceed the excess of the total income over &#x00A3;2,000.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1948-04-06a.72.1" colnum="72" time="">
<p>As this contribution is something we are specially asking for to meet an internal emergency, it will not fall on capital held in this country by people who are neither resident nor domiciled here. Persons domiciled abroad, but resident in this country for the year 1947&#x2013;48, will be liable to the special contribution if they have been ordinarily resident in this country for the last 10 years. I would emphasise that this is not an annual tax, but a special contribution for a special purpose. I recognise fully that regular taxation of this character would have a marked dis-incentive effect on saving, which is certainly not what we want.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1948-04-06a.72.2" colnum="72" time="">
<p>Necessarily, the administration of this contribution will be spread over some period of time&#x2014;but it is of great importance that it should be paid promptly, so that its full effect can be felt as soon as possible. The due date for payment will be 1st January next, when the Surtax for 1947&#x2013;48 becomes due; but I would appeal to everyone liable to this contribution to make a payment on account to the Inland Revenue, in advance of assessment. I propose, in order to encourage this prepayment, that advance payments should carry a discount of 2 per cent. net per annum up to the 1st January, 1949. Interest will be charged on payments in arrear.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1948-04-06a.72.3" colnum="72" time="">
<p>The contribution is considered to be a charge on capital, and in many cases there will, in fact, be no other way of


paying it. Provision will, therefore, be made to enable the contribution charged to be recovered from capital, where the income and capital are in different hands. For example, in the case of trust income, there will be a provision enabling the contribution to be paid out of the capital of the trust. The full yield of the contribution will be &#x00A3;105 million, of which I have written &#x00A3;50 million into the Estimates for this year&#x2014;though I much hope that, with the co-operation of those liable and the advantages of the discount, we shall be able to collect considerably more than that before the end of the year.</p>

<p>I now come to the question of incentives, and how much of the increased surplus we can spare for this purpose. Before coming to the Inland Revenue reliefs, I will deal shortly with one or two other matters.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1948-04-06a.73.2" colnum="73" time="">
<p>I propose to make certain changes in the incidence of the Entertainments Duty. Since 1935, a distinction has been drawn between the living theatre and other kinds of entertainment; and in 1946, sports&#x2014;other than racing&#x2014;were added to the list of entertainments which were eligible for the reduced scale of tax. I believe that we should encourage these forms of living entertainment, particularly the theatre; arid I propose, therefore, to increase the measure of relief from duty which they already enjoy. For theatres, concerts, circuses, sports, and other entertainments which at present qualify for the reduced rates, payments for admission up to 1s. will be exempt from duty, and the duty on payments above that amount will be approximately one-half the present rates.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1948-04-06a.73.3" colnum="73" time="">
<p>I am also anxious, for the sake of our agricultural communities, to encourage all types of entertainment in the rural areas, including such things as cinema shows. I propose, therefore, to grant complete exemption from duty in the case of all entertainments in buildings situated in places in the rural areas, where the population does not exceed 2,000 and the seating capacity of the building does not exceed 200. I hope that this will enable more entertainment to be taken to the rural areas, and that we may thus help to counter the tendency towards their de-population in favour of the urban areas.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1948-04-06a.74.1" colnum="74" time="">
<p>I now turn to the question of direct taxation reliefs. It is very generally agreed that the incidence of Income Tax upon the medium paid wage-earner and the lower salaried members of the managerial and technical staffs is such as to act as a disincentive to greater efforts in production. It has, therefore, been suggested that income tax should not be payable upon overtime earnings or bonus payments of any kind. I have examined this proposition very carefully, but have come to the conclusion that it is wholly impracticable, even if desirable. Administratively, I do not see how it could he worked out, unless a nominal basic wage were assessed for every industry and every process in the country; and that is quite an impossible task, and, anyway, would take years to perform. Nor would it be at all fair as between persons on fixed wages and salaries which include overtime, and those who get paid extra for more time worked or more production achieved in a given time.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1948-04-06a.74.2" colnum="74" time="">
<p>I have, therefore, come to the conclusion that the only practicable way of removing the disincentive lies in increasing the Earned Income Relief, and, at the same time, giving reliefs on the scale of graduation, so that the great majority of all workers will be relieved from any liability at the standard rate.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1948-04-06a.74.3" colnum="74" time="">
<p>I propose, in the first instance, to increase the Earned Income Relief from is present level of one-sixth, subject to a maximum allowance of &#x00A3;250, to one-fifth, subject to a new maximum of &#x00A3;400. This restores the full pre-war measure of the allowance so far as the rate is concerned, and is an improvement upon the prewar limit of &#x00A3;300.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1948-04-06a.74.4" colnum="74" time="">
<p>This increase will not only raise the point at which liability to tax begins, and thereby relieve half a million persons from paying any income tax at all, but will, in effect, reduce the rate of tax chargeable on additional earnings. The maximum rate of tax any worker will have to pay will be 7s. 2d. in the pound, as against the present 7s. 6d. The increase in the maximum of the allowance will raise the total earned income qualifying for relief from &#x00A3;1,500 to &#x00A3;2,000, and


is designed to give relief to administrative, professional, and scientific workers.</p>

<p>I have been most anxious to do something to assist pensioners and other old persons living on small incomes, for whom we all, I am sure, have the greatest sympathy. As pensions are dealt with as earned income for Income Tax purposes, and as the age relief for elderly persons over 65 years of age on small investment incomes up to &#x00A3;500 a year likewise enables them to be treated as if they were in receipt of earned incomes, both these classes will benefit from the increase in the earned income relief, as, indeed, from the further proposals which I shall make in a moment or two. I propose, in addition, to raise the exemption limit from &#x00A3;120 to &#x00A3;135, to help the smallest of these incomes.</p>

<p>I next propose to do something for married women in industry, as we are most anxious to encourage as many married women as possible to enter industry at the present time. Today, when the wife goes out to work, a special allowance of &#x00A3;110 is given, in addition to the married allowance of &#x00A3;180. This is already very favourable treatment, as it means that the married couple, who both work, receive an allowance of &#x00A3;290, as against &#x00A3;220 for two single persons. However, only one set of reduced rate reliefs is given to the working couple, so that, if the husband is already paying tax at the standard rate, anything the wife earns above &#x00A3;110, plus the earned income relief, is liable to tax at the standard rate; whereas, in the case of a single person working alongside of her, the first &#x00A3;50 is chargeable at 3s. and the next &#x00A3;75 at 6s.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1948-04-06a.75.4" colnum="75" time="">
<p>I propose to give the wife in employment the benefit of reduced rate reliefs as well as the husband. The wife in employment will, therefore, enjoy precisely the same allowances from her earnings as the single woman with whom she works. The proposal also has administrative advantages, as it will avoid troublesome adjustments in P.A.Y.E. which have at present to be made in the case of the husband and wife, both working. This relief will cost &#x00A3;4&#x00BD; million in a full year and &#x00A3;2 million this year.</p>

<p>At present, the first &#x00A3;50 of taxable income is chargeable at 3s. and the next &#x00A3;75 at 6s. I propose increasing this, by enlarging the 6s. step to &#x00A3;200, so that, in future, the first &#x00A3;50 will be chargeable at 3s. and the next &#x00A3;200 at 6s. After allowing for the increased Earned Income Relief, these rates become, effectively, 2s. 5d. and 4s. 10d. in the &#x00A3;. At present, the single man becomes liable to the top rate of 7s. 6d. in the &#x00A3;&#x2014;making allowance for the Earned Income Relief&#x2014;if he earns regularly more than &#x00A3;5 12s. a week; in future, he will not be so liable until he earns &#x00A3;8 17s. a week, and then only at 7s. 2d. instead of at 7s. 6d. For a married man with no children, the present figure is &#x00A3;7 4s.; in future, it will be &#x00A3;10 10S. A married man with two children will be liable to the top rate only if he earns more than &#x00A3;13 8s. a week, compared to the present figure of &#x00A3;10. The married woman in employment will, of course, benefit equally by this proposal in future. Last year, of the 18,500,000 people in the Income Tax field, 4,500,000 paid some tax at the standard rate. In future, less than 2,000,000 will have to pay any tax at the standard rate. This relief will cost &#x00A3;50 million in a full year and &#x00A3;44 million this year.</p>

<p>It is, of course, quite impossible to contemplate freeing all workers from any direct taxation; nor, I am certain, would they ask, in existing circumstances, for any such exemption. What I have been anxious to do is to remove, as far as possible, the disincentive which arises from a high rate of taxation on marginal earnings.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1948-04-06a.76.5" colnum="76" time="">
<p>Let us remember that, despite the drawbacks of high taxation and high prices, the workers of this country have been doing a good job, as is shown by our present level of production. If, by these reliefs, we can help them to do even better, then certainly the reliefs will be fully justified.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1948-04-06a.76.6" colnum="76" time="">
<p>Under the proposed arrangements, the position in that respect will be as follows.


For the single person earning &#x00A3;6 a week, a tax of 12s. 3d. will be payable in all, compared with 14s. 5d. at present. If an additional &#x00A3;1 is earned for overtime, he would, at present, have to pay 7s. 6d. on that &#x00A3;1; in future, he will pay only 4s. 10d. The married man with two children, earning &#x00A3;10 a week, will, in future, pay only 9s. 6d. in Income Tax, as against 11s. 6d. at present. If he earns &#x00A3;1 on overtime, instead of paying 7s. 6d., as at present, he will pay only 4s. 10d. Below those figures, the payments will, of course, be lower.</p>

<p>I believe that these concessions, amounting to over &#x00A3;100 million a year, will be of great importance to our production drive, and I cannot think that anyone will now have a just cause to complain that he is held back from increased effort on the score of the Income Tax burden.</p>

<p>The increased reliefs I have put forward will necessitate new P.A.Y.E. tables, and these will be in the hands of employers in time for the new scale to come into operation in the week beginning 6th July. The relief then given will be cumulative relief, as from the beginning of the tax year.</p>

<p>Whatever we may think about the Budget proposals and the general financial situation&#x2014;and on that point no doubt diverse opinions will be entertained in the different quarters of the Committee&#x2014;I expect there will be general agreement that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has delivered a comprehensive, lucid statement. Very few words were wasted and the whole vast, complicated panorama of facts and figures appeared to be approached in a spirit of careful analysis and embracing design. It was refreshing to hear a statement of this kind, apart, that is to say, altogether from its substance. We must always remember, in judging the right hon. and learned Gentleman, that the inheritance to which he succeeded so unexpectedly, although it was not subject to new and penal rates of taxation, was at any rate one which did not contain only agreeable features. He is the heir of policies which have been much criticised and are accused of having notably emphasised the danger of inflation and have been accompanied undoubtedly by an ever-declining strength in the purchasing power of money.<br/>
The right hon. and learned Gentleman, therefore, is entitled to every assurance that his proposals will receive careful, precise, thorough and searching attention. We have the advantage also of dealing not only with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, but with the overlord of our

economic life. I do not know that the burden of the two offices combined is necessarily much greater than if they were divided; probably more can be done in solving problems when they are all under one's own hat than when time has to be taken up in adjusting difference and difficulties with opposite numbers. The right hon. and learned Gentleman has at any rate the advantage that the whole field is at his disposal.<br/>
I have thought it right to thank him for the full account he has given in a speech quite worthy of Budget occasions, in which the Committee always takes special interest. I feel sure that his precise mind and careful legal training will enable him to carry through the detailed discussion and Debates upon this Bill in the same competent manner which has marked his first unfolding of his proposals to the community. It is not my intention now to enter upon any discussion of merits. We wish to have the opportunity of thinking very carefully over what has been said and endeavouring to apply our minds to the problem as a whole, as well as to its special circumstances. There are, of course, great questions to be borne in mind, and the gravity of the situation admits of no difference of opinion in any part of the House. It is indeed, a situation of extreme gravity when a country so strong and proud as ours cannot pay its way and has to lean upon the good offices of a free and generous nation for a large proportion of its actual upkeep. We cannot and are not paying for our keep and our livelihood at present.<br/>
There are also all those grave financial issues which have been touched upon, and the question is whether the policy which the right hon. and learned Gentleman has put before us constitutes the best method of remedying these evils. This problem of "Too much money chasing too few goods," or the question of killing money wherever possible and destroying spending power, sounds all very strange to those who remember the days when we heard so much about increasing the consuming power and allowing money to fructify in the pockets of the people. All that has apparently passed away and there is a school of economists who believe that restriction, frustration, regulation and taxation of every kind e re the prime reagents by which the wealth of nations may be created. These are


matters which we shall have to consider not only in their financial, but in their economic aspect in the Debates which will take place, and which will be long, upon the general principles of the Budget.<br/>
There are the questions also of the great surplus of over &#x00A3;300 million which the right hon. and learned Gentleman has presented; of whether greater advantage would not be gained by giving further relief to the taxpayers; and whether the present rates of taxation are not onerous in the very last degree. When Chancellors get up nowadays they give away a few minor items this way and that, and parade and preen themselves as great benefactors of the public. It must not be forgotten that the whole of the vast mass of pain&#x00A7; and penalties under which we totter today was accummulated through the national struggle of the war. It was never contemplated that the expenditure of over &#x00A3;3,000 million should roll forward in time of peace. Such ideas must be carefully probed and examined.<br/>
The only other remark which I would venture to make is one which is not of a general character. The right hon. and learned Gentleman unfolded his plan for a capital levy. He avoided the name but he unfolded his plan for a once-for-all levy on capital. How can he say it will be a once-for-all? It does not rest with him.</p>

<p>I do not know that the hon. and gallant Member can speak for the Government. He must allow them to speak for themselves and adjust their policies to the ever-changing, varying problems and circumstances of every day. This seems to me a very serious proposition and it may well defeat the objects which it has in view. Generally speaking, I doubt very much whether the right hon. and learned Gentleman's Budget will be found to meet the real difficulties or to apply the right remedies. On the other hand, I feel that it is only right to compliment him on the manner in which he has presented it.</p>

<p>I think that the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Woodford (Mr. Churchill) must have felt a certain amount of envy

when he referred to my right hon. and learned Friend as being not only the Chancellor of the Exchequer, but also the overlord of our economic life. When the right hon. Gentleman introduced his Budgets, he was not the overlord of our economic life. He had to reckon with an overlord who was domiciled in the City of London and who was, in fact, Governor of the Bank of England. We are no longer working under the conditions of the Budgets of as long ago as 1925. My right hon. and learned Friend is, in fact, overlord, and he has no excuse for the harm he is doing in this Budget. There are some very grave and serious blots on this Budget. I resent in particular the increase in taxation on beer and tobacco. There is no need for this increase of taxation. Why should the innocent amusements of the people, which are already taxed far more than they need be, have to be subject to these added impositions?<br/>
My right hon. and learned Friend is going to an appalling amount of trouble to achieve' a comparatively small result, which will be obtained in any case. The amortisation of some &#x00A3;300 million is to be achieved 1537 all this juggling of figures, but, surely, Marshall Aid is now a certainty in the ensuing year, as a result of which we shall get some &#x00A3;300 million. If my right hon. and learned Friend does what he ought to do, there will be a <i>pro tanto</i> amortisation in any case of rather more than &#x00A3;300 million. My right hon. and learned Friend did not say what he contemplated doing with the Marshall Aid, which will automatically achieve the results which he proposes to achieve by all this tremendous interference with the pleasures of the people. There is a major fallacy underlying the arguments of my right hon. and learned Friend. He talked about inflation, but he did not prove anything. I would argue that either there is no inflation, or, if there is inflation, it is not due to the incomes of the working classes. The incomes of the working classes are not inflationary.<br/>
If there is inflation, it is obviously the result of our immense National Debt of &#x00A3;25,000 million, to which no reference was made in the long speech we have just heard. When I was a boy, the National Debt was &#x00A3;600 million. At the end of World War 1, it was &#x00A3;8,000 million, but now it is &#x00A3;25,000 million and nothing has been said about it in this


wide and comprehensive review of our national finances. Certainly there were no proposals for getting rid of the National Debt, or at least for getting rid of part of it, mitigating the appalling burden and the inflationary influence it represents. I suggest that my right hon. and learned Friend should have an inquiry into the National Debt for the precise purpose of finding out exactly how many units of that Debt represent money really lent, and how many units represent mere creations of credit out of nothing. I believe it is true that something like a quarter of the Debt&#x2014;I am including floating as well as funded debt&#x2014;never had any more substance than the ink in the fountain pens of the bankers. Most of this Debt was created during the war, and we still have its effects with us. What are the objections to having an inquiry into the composition of the National Debt? Why not ask the alleged lenders to prove their bona fides? If anyone really has parted with money, and lent it to the Government, the Government will obviously honour their obligations; but if the lender did not part with any money, there is no reason under heaven why the obligation should be honoured.<br/>
It is a complete fallacy to propose that to the extent that the Government undertake capital works, the cost of these works must he taken out of the people's current incomes. If that were true, it would be equally right to argue that private investment in private enterprise should come out of the investors' current incomes. The fact is that, to the extent that private enterprise extends its business, it is paid for very largely from funds which have been accumulated in the past, or by bank loans, which are merely a form of created credit with no more substance than the ink in the fountain pens of the bankers. Why does my right hon. and learned Friend insist that, for every pound spent on Government capital expenditure, there must be a pound taken out of the current income of the people, especially when he does not propose the same thing in the case of private enterprise, where, of course, it could not be done? There is no logic in his argument.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Woodford referred to the Chancellor of the Exchequer as being the overlord of our economic life. He is indeed the overlord of our economic life, and in devising this fantastic Budget he has fallen into the same trap as the Leader of the Opposition fell into in 1925, when he took the advice of the experts and then six years later admitted that he had been wrong. I believe that my right hon. and learned Friend will also admit at some time in the future that he has been wrong in taking this course. There are good features in the Budget, but I do not propose to discuss them. I protest against the increase of taxation on beer and tobacco, which is absolutely unjustifiable. I resent the failure of my right hon. and learned Friend to mention anything about the savings campaign, which, as we all know, was a flop last year because people simply will not risk their savings unless they are sure the pounds they eventually draw out will be worth at least as much as the pounds they put in.<br/>
I suggest that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should abandon the orthodox pretence that money can perform two functions, namely, that of a store of value and that of an instrument of exchange. We have had a succession of orthodox Chancellors of the Exchequer ever since I was interested in politics. The result has been that the country has got into debt to a greater extent than ever before. Every baby born in the country today finds itself automatically in debt to the extent of &#x00A3;500. I hope that the Chancellor will tell the Committee what he proposes to do with the proceeds of Marshall Aid, which will provide this &#x00A3;300 million without all the fuss of getting it in any other way. Does he propose to do nothing about the National Debt, in which case things will continue to go from bad to worse?</p>

<p>We have listened so long to the Budget that it is a little bit of a strain to switch over to a completely different subject. The Adjournment Debate comes under the heading of "The Princes Hotel, Hove," but that is only part of the subject with which I wish to deal. I am more concerned with the future than the past. I am fully aware that this hotel has been lost for ten years. It has now been taken over by the Electricity Board. Had I known more about this earlier in the year and had the sale been less secretly arranged, it is quite likely that we would have been able to stop it.<br/>
It was suddenly announced in the Press that the local council were about to discuss this matter, but it had been frequently discussed in private with members of the council, about which we knew nothing. Finally, when I brought this matter to the attention of the House, the different Ministers, to whom I hoped this matter might be one of great concern, announced that it had really nothing to do with them at all, because it was a question for the Electricity Board. We have already discussed in this House the question of the advisability of handing over to these boards responsibility for what Ministers call "details." I do not think we have yet heard what "details" involve. I do not think this is a party issue; I am inclined to think that it may affect all parties as the years come and go, no matter who comes into power. Everyone will want to know what exactly a board can or cannot do.<br/>
The particular question I am trying to put before the House tonight is how these boards are slowly but surely taking over property which could very well be used for other purposes, particularly for housing, and whether it can be stopped. The housing problem affects not only my constituency, but almost every other in the country. My constituency in particular, Brighton and Hove, lives almost entirely by catering for the holiday visitor, for the tourist, and generally on entertainment. It may well be that other con-

stituencies will be affected by the taking over of their main industry for use by one of these nationalised boards. What is the Government's policy in this matter? Shall we find ourselves in a position where, after some Ministers have washed their hands of what the boards do, those boards will take over property which is vital to an industry which another Minister is working hard to develop?<br/>
I speak with particular reference to the holiday industry in Brighton and Hove. We are all agreed that we want to obtain dollars from the tourist at present; that we want people-to come to this country from the United States and other hard currency areas and, to a certain extent, from other parts of the world as well. Brighton and Hove are centres that are very well known, not only throughout this country but throughout Europe and the United States. They are known for their Regency architecture, and their historical background. There was a time when America herself was developing this particular type of architecture. After the war, we tried to get our hotels freed and sufficient furniture for them so that they could welcome people from abroad. To a certain extent we have succeeded. I do not think it would be unfair, or an exaggeration, to say that of all the hotels in Hove the best known one is, and always has been, the Princes Hotel. It is famous not only in this country, but abroad. It may be within the recollection of some Members that during the last few months several of us visited Japan. While there the Emperor's brother, at a luncheon party, asked what had happened, during the war, to the Princes Hotel at Hove. He had come over for the Coronation, and, whether it was the Royal Family or the Foreign Office I do not know, but somebody had told him that the best hotel he could stay at for a short visit was the Princes Hotel at Hove. It is not only in Japan but also in America that this hotel is well known.<br/>
Over a long time valuable goodwill was built up, and that is why I am particularly worried about this matter. The board are coming into the place and moving into an industry which is vital to our dollar position. The board are taking over properties without adequate attention being paid to what they are doing by the different Ministries. I feel that there must have been a lack of planning and co-ordination


in this matter. When trying to encourage the tourist traffic the best hotels should be developed. If these boards are to be allowed to run their own show in detail it is possible that they may take over property in different parts of the country that could be better used for some other purpose&#x2014;such as earning dollars.<br/>
The Minister of Fuel and Power answered a Question of mine before the Recess, when he said that he had given no instructions whatever to any board about taking over property that could be used for housing purposes. I did not pursue the point with him, as I felt it was a little unfair because the Table had refused to allow me to point out why I was asking the Question. I was asking it as a supplementary to one which I had put earlier to the Prime Minister. The Question I put to the Prime Minister was:
<q>&#x2026; what is the policy of His Majesty's Government with regard to the purchase by Departments of properties which can be shown to be capable of being used for housing purposes; and if he will direct the Ministers concerned to impose that policy on the Nationalised Boards for which they were responsible.</q>
The Prime Minister replied:
<q>In view of housing needs the Government are anxious that accommodation capable of being used for housing purposes should not be purchased by Government departments and other bodies and used for other than housing purposes where this can be avoided.</q>
I would like the House to remember the word "avoided." The right hon. Gentleman went on:
<q>Defence Regulation 68C.A. covers this"&#x2014;</q>
that regulation says that the prior consent of the local authority must be obtained&#x2014;
<q>by providing that consent must be obtained to the diversion to other purposes of any housing accommodation which has been so used any time since 31st December, 1938, and this extends to hotels and similar accommodation. The Regulation applies equally to nationalised industries and to private individuals, and the present arrangements should ensure that such accommodation is used for living purposes where this is practicable."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 8th March, 1948; Vol 448, c. 786.]</q>
Later, I asked the Minister of Fuel and Power whether he had given any instructions to his Department on those lines, and he replied: "No." I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if he would explain why that is so? If the Prime Minister definitely says that it is the

policy of the Government that housing should come first, why are these nationalised boards at least not advised, if not indeed ordered, that they must leave housing property alone as far as possible? I know the answer will be, as the Prime Minister said, that in the case of the Princes Hotel "the local council accepted this proposition." But, on the main issue, I would like to know exactly what the Ministry can and will do in future, because it is to the future that I am looking. What are the Government going to do with regard to the housing problem as a whole?<br/>
I think that the country ought to know something about the way in which the Princes Hotel has been taken over. We are told that the council agreed to this. That is not entirely true. The council did in public agree to the whole question by a considerable majority, and when it was brought up again, after it had been aired by me, they again agreed to the proposal by a majority, one of the aldermen saying that they would be made a laughing stock if they altered it now. Certain members of the council pointed out that had they known the details, they would not have consented in the first instance. They said that they were not properly informed about it, and that they did not know hat the property could not be requisitioned. I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to explain more clearly to the country as a whole that property cannot be requisitioned for these purposes without the councils agreeing according to Defence Regulation 68CA. I cannot find in any of the documents which I have here, any statement that the council was warned on this point.<br/>
Let us see how it all began. I know that the hon. Gentleman's Department have been in touch with the Hove town clerk, so that the Parliamentary Secretary might reply to me as to what happened. I know that the Electricity Board made a statement in the Press, to which I replied in "The Times." I think that the answer which they have been given is that according to the Local Government Act the council acted absolutely correctly, that the whole thing was done in public and was done properly. That is not, if I may say so, absolutely true. A lot happened before the council met in public. For instance, there is the town clerk's report dated January, 1948, which


refers particularly to a meeting on Friday, 2nd January, when a Mr. Burnell, the clerk of the London and Home Counties Joint Electricity Authority, visited the Mayor and Town Clerk. He pointed out that he had come on behalf of the Chairman of the South Eastern Electricity Board, which had been considering the purchase of offices for its headquarters' staff. He told them that there were a number of places in which they were interested, including the Princes Hotel, and he went on to say&#x2014;and this is in the Town Clerk's report&#x2014;that the Board would not come to a decision except with the full agreement of the local authority concerned, and that the chairman had asked him to find out the reactions of the whole council to the suggestion that the Board should set up headquarters in the Princes Hotel. Then comes the remark:
<q>It might be that the Board could requisition the premises and avoid the question of the consent of the local authority.</q>
Mr. Burnell stresses that whatever might be the legal position they did not intend to do anything of this nature. That would seem to be in the nature of a threat of requisitioning. I have here a letter from one of the people who sold the property. The last paragraph says:
<q>So far as the owners of the hotel are concerned, it is indeed difficult to 'negotiate' with a prospective purchaser who is armed with powers of compulsory acquisition</q>
That letter is dated only 1st April. The council it seems pointed out that for some time past they have been interested in developing Hove, and that they had been pressing for the Princes Hotel to be reopened; that only within that last week an approach was made to the hotel on the matter, and they had been informed that it was unlikely that the hotel would be re-opened before Christmas, 1948. Remember that date; it could be opened by Christmas, 1948. It has been empty for the last two years. Tenders had, I believe, been invited for the necessary work which would take at least nine months to carry out after the tender had been accepted. Mr. Burnell said that the Board had made inquiries, and they "thought it exceedingly unlikely that the premises would ever again be opened as an hotel." That raises another point. No one knows who "they" are; and who says that the premises will never be opened as an hotel? They say that they

have had expert opinion and that the Brighton and Hove area was more than sufficiently provided with hotel accommodation. Yet, when we come to the summer season, people are being turned away because it is impossible to get into the hotels, especially at the weekends. So that statement is entirely untrue.<br/>
These experts also state that the premises are not suitable for use as a modern hotel without considerable structural alteration, and that apart from proposals put forward by the Board the premises would remain empty for many years. I feel that there is no reason why that should be so. While the premises were empty the local authority was losing a considerable amount in rates. So it was pointed out to the council that under the Local Government Bill now before the House of Commons it was provided that the hereditaments occupied by the Electricity Boards, except premises used as a dwellinghouse, would not be rated or included in the valuation list, bill the British Electricity Authority would make a payment year by year for the benefit of local authorities.<br/>
With this background the council were invited to do what they could and make up their minds. Then, as the hon. Gentleman will remember, we had the statement in the Press from Mr. Norman Elliott. We all know what good work he did during the war. But what did Mr. Elliott do over this matter? He came down to see the council and met them after a General Purposes meeting. They had already finished the meeting, and there was nothing on the agenda about this. The Press were asked to leave, and this matter of great importance was discussed privately and out of the blue. It was in December when Mr. Norman Elliott walked in, and I understand from the council that he informed them that he did not know what he was expected to say. He told them all about where he had been to school, what a good rugger player he was, and got all the members of the council interested, so that in the end they finally adopted this really ridiculous proposition for Hove.<br/>
At the next meeting, the mayor said that, having gone so far, they could not go back. Finally, it was agreed that they would let the Electricity Board take the property. They were rushed into it. Then the resolution was put for the first


time in public. At the request of the Electricity Board it was proposed to add strengthening words to it to say that the council welcomed the proposal. On 9th January Mr. Elliott in a letter said that, briefly, the proposal was that the South-Eastern Electricity Board, which would be responsible for the electricity supply in Kent, Surrey and Sussex, should purchase Princes Hotel and make it the headquarters of the Board. The headquarters would house the Board's secretariat and senior officials and would also probably be the headquarters of the consumers' council for the area. The fifth and sixth floors, and possibly the fourth floor would be made into residential premises for the headquarters staff. He went on to say that if there were any surplus office accommodation he would be most happy to enter into negotiations with them. He also said:
<q>I am fully conscious that your council would wish to preserve the pleasant amenities of the Hove sea front and I can assure you that Princes would be kept in first class condition and that all the reasonable requirements of your council in this respect would be a first consideration of the Board. Should the Board's headquarters come to Hove, this would also bring to Hove many most desirable ratepayers and I am sure that the most happy relations would exist between the Board and your council. From the information I have it seems probable that if my Board does not take the Princes Hotel the building may go derelict and this, of course, would be most undesirable for Hove.</q>
All this is just part of a series of threats and bullying. The actual position is that we have a town which has 2,000 people without homes and of the 2,000 on the housing list 1,000 are really extreme cases of urgency. Why was it not possible to put some of these families into the Princes Hotel if it is not possible to turn it into an ordinary hotel? I, personally, cannot see why that could not be done.<br/>
There are two avenues of approach from the hotel into the centre of the town. The Electricity Board have taken two large houses attached to the hotel to house people who perhaps are considered to be desirable ratepayers, yet some six or seven houses in those particular avenues have already been taken over by the local council to house local people. Why could not they have also had these two houses? I am informed that over 200 people are going to move into homes in Hove in order to take part in the workings of the Electricity Board. We have had quite good enough service as it was before, and

where the boards are at present situated they have found plenty of room to work. Why is it now considered necessary so greatly to increase the premises? The answer is that they are taking over the areas of Kent, Surrey, Sussex, and it is the tendency of bureaucracy vastly to increase the number of people at the head of affairs. Several of the undertakings which are being taken over have had their headquarters in London. These headquarters are now being sold and the people working in them are to move into Hove. How is that going to help the people in Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells who were so well served before? If a central office is wanted, why not have it in London?<br/>
I maintain that the only reason is because someone likes to be going to Hove. It is rather pleasant to be at the seaside and Hove is rather a pleasant seaside to be at. I can hear someone saying, "To hell with the 2,000 people there who want homes&#x0021; Why should we be bothered about that?" That is the new bureaucracy which is coming in. I do not understand how a Socialist Government or indeed any Government could defend this present action. We have heard the Minister of Health saying that there are not nearly sufficient houses at present to house all those in need of homes. Yet here is an hotel, which could be used for the purposes of conversion into a block of flats, being used to accommodate the staffs of this new Electricity Board. In Hove, too, there are old people who are in large houses and would be much better off in flats where they would not have to use stairs to the same extent. They would gladly get out of their houses if they could get flats, and those houses could be used to accommodate some of the local families who are in such need of accommodation. Why cannot something like that be done?<br/>
If the answer is that this is a question for the local authority I do not agree, because on more than one occasion, when the local council wanted to requisition local property, the Ministry of Health prevented them taking over houses. The Ministry, when I asked a Question, said that other people from outside were going to move into the property. Therefore, the Ministry of Health, if they wanted, could take an active part in this matter and do something about it. We are left


at the present moment with the position that an hotel, which could have been taken over to house something like 6o families, is being requisitioned to provide accommodation for the new staff of this Board. It is said that 200 families are going to move into the town of Hove, which has its housing difficulties without this new addition to the local inhabitants. They may be desirable, wealthy, better class people, but they are coming in ahead of all others.<br/>
The local council to my mind has been pushed into this thing. It was done secretly at the start, but why I cannot make out. There has been a certain confusion. We have been told by the papers that there was nowhere else for this headquarters to go to, but others have informed us that there were other places where it could be accommodated with much less inconvenience, and with a great saving of money to the nation as a whole, whereas in this instance the amount of money that has got to be spent on this place to put it right for these civil servants will be very considerable and when we take into account the money that the Admiralty spent previously, there will be really no worthwhile saving at all. We have also to remember that the taking of this hotel is damaging the main industry of the town of Hove.<br/>
There seems no reason why the Board should not remain where the branches always were before or why it should not have gone to London as a centre. The whole thing is now signed and sealed, and it may seem rather late for me to raise it. However, it is not my fault that I was unable to raise this matter on the Adjournment earlier. I have to ballot for it. I have already pointed out that this is not a political issue. It is going to affect any Government which comes into power no matter what Government it is. Whatever Government is in power must see that these Boards do not proceed contrary to the policy laid down by the Prime Minister. In this particular case it is the policy in relation to housing. Another time it might be something else. We have to remember that this hotel could have been used as an hotel, or it could have been converted into flats to accommodate some of the local homeless. Already there had been several demands as to why nothing had been done to convert the building and I have raised the

matter myself by Questions to the Minister of Health. I still believe that something could have been done if energetic action had been taken by the Ministry of Health.<br/>
Although this matter may now have been signed and sealed, I am raising it because it may occur all over the country in different ways. That is why I want the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Fuel and Power to say something in regard to situations such as this. I hope he will be able to tell us that this kind of thing will not happen again, and that he will not fall back on the statement that this is a matter for the local council and that we ought not to be talking about it here. To my mind the local council were only pushed into it at the last minute and they did not know the proper facts because they were not told them by the officials of the Board.</p>

<p>I usually listen with great interest and attention to the Senior Member for Brighton (Mr. Teeling), but I must confess that on this occasion I have listened to what is really a private feud between him and his local council. The Debate has ranged not only over my own Ministry but over the Ministries of my hon. Friends who are here on the Government Front Bench with me&#x2014;the Ministry of Works and the Ministry of Health&#x2014;and I am indebted to my hon. Friends for a good deal of the material that I shall use in replying to the points that have been raised.<br/>
When the Senior Member for Brighton looks at his speech in HANSARD tomorrow, or perhaps when it is suitably sub-edited in his local Press, I am afraid he will see that what he is saying is a very severe reflection upon the council as a whole, and an even worse reflection upon the abilities of the town clerk who is responsible for advising the council of the powers which it possesses. I am utterly amazed to hear for the first time this afternoon about all these apparently in-the-dark negotiations. I was a member of a fairly large municipal authority for some years, and I am certain that I would not have been a party to negotiations of the kind that have been described without saying something about it. That, again, is a matter for the council, and not for my


Ministry. The Government have given all the powers to local authorities which are necessary to enable them to do what the hon. Member has suggested. He has referred to Defence Regulation 68C (<i>a</i>) which was made in October, 1945. That regulation provides that no premises used for housing accommodation at any time since the end of the year 1938 may be used for other than residential purposes without the consent of the local authority or, in the case of application by a Government Department, the consent of the Ministry of Health. This was not a case of application by a Government Department.<br/>
I might interpose at this stage and say that throughout these negotiations the Ministry of Works have in no way interested themselves on behalf of the British Electricity Authority and that any statement that they have done so is quite wrong. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will appreciate&#x2014;because he sits on the other side of the House and shares the view that there should be freedom for the people of this country to please themselves fairly well&#x2014;that we cannot force anybody to buy a hotel or, even if they own a hotel and keep it empty, force them to open it and take in tourists. This hotel was one of the earliest to be de-requisitioned. In point of fact it has been closed, I understand, for two years.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, we must remember that it was in November, 1946, that the Ministry of Works granted a licence up to &#x00A3;25,000 for the first phase of rehabilitation after derequisition, and that no work was put in hand. The licence lapsed. If there was no desire on the part of the owner to get busy with the tourist trade and to make the hotel habitable, once again&#x2014;</p>

<p>It is the same piece of property. We cannot help it if it continually changes ownership. Let us not overlook the fact that the hotel, and adjoining property presumably, have been empty, and that the council have powers to requisition the property for purposes of housing. I understand that the council were most anxious that the property should be brought back into use as a hotel. I understand that the council

gave every encouragement to the owners in their expressed intention to carry out repairs that were necessary in order that the property could be reopened as a hotel.<br/>
When the council came to consider the conversion of that particular piece of property for residential purposes for the housing of some of the 2,000 people who are, I understand, without accommodation, they did not regard its requisition and conversion into housing accommodation as altogether an economic proposition. Therefore, they did not take the action which they had full power to take in order to meet the situation which the hon. Member is asking us to deal with this afternoon. The council has all the powers; the hotel has been empty for two years. The council could have done precisely what the hon. Gentleman is asking should be done.<br/>
I will turn to the question whether the council were under the impression that if they did not give consent to the British Electricity Authority to obtain the hotel, the property would have been requisitioned. I can find no evidence for that. Again, it really is a gross reflection upon the town clerk, who must have some responsibility in this matter. He should know the law in respect of requisitioning. He would know quite well that the British Electricity Authority is a public corporation and stands in the same relation to this as any other enterprise of that character stands, and has no special powers to requisition.<br/>
I cannot say anything about the argument that may have taken place in the very interesting interview behind locked doors, and I have not troubled to find out anything about it. It is not our business to interfere in the day-to-day administration of the British Electricity Authority. If it had been a private company wanting these premises for a similar purpose it would not have been possible to secure private information of negotiations. My right hon. Friend the Minister of Fuel and Power feels that the purchase of this hotel is not a matter that comes within the power which he has under the Act in relation to direction.<br/>
Therefore, while it has been most interesting to learn this afternoon of all the negotiations which took place, those negotiations were between a public corporation and the local authority. The local authority had all the power they wanted to


please themselves whether they granted permission for the new use of that property. They decided, as a council, that they would agree, as the planning authority, to the new use to which the British Electricity Authority wanted to put it. I cannot understand why this Adjournment Debate has taken place at all. It is not on a matter with which Parliament is concerned at all at this stage. Parliament has already delegated powers to the local authorities to deal with the matter to which the hon. Gentleman has referred.</p>

<p>Of course, the Ministry of Health has powers, but they are negative. They are not positive in the sense that the Ministry can go to the council and say, "You must requisition this property and turn it into houses." The Prime Minister made a statement, to which the hon. Gentleman has referred. The statement applied not only to public corporations but to all people in business of this or a similar character who wish to acquire premises. The British Electricity Authority, along with all other firms, would take note of what has been said. While the hon. Gentleman has given us a lot of information this afternoon, there is nothing he has said that he ought not to have said to the council. He should really have been making his speech to the council and telling them that they had not done their job, if that is what he feels about it.<br/>
Regarding the acquisition of this property by the British Electricity Authority, I repeat that it is a matter of day-to-day administration. We have no intention of using our powers under the Act to give directions on a matter of this character. The area boards of this undertaking must be left as free on these matters as is any other business, private or public. It is clear that the council, having all the authority to deal with this type of business transaction, exercised their powers. They are guardians of the powers that they possess in the interests of the ratepayers and of their citizens. Whatever they may have done is a matter between them and the citizens of Hove. The speech made by the hon Gentleman ought to have been made to the council and not to this House.</p>

<p>Thank you for your Ruling, Mr. Speaker. I sincerely hope that when the time comes the House will give the necessary permission. We are entering upon a period of great seriousness in regard to oil supplies for Britain. For the first time in her history America is becoming a net importer of oil. She can use her immense dollar resources to attract such supplies as she requires from the oilfields of the world. In the face of this very serious situation, we have to secure our own supplies when we are short of dollars in what is not only a serious situation, but also one which is steadily deteriorating. The Economic Survey recently issued by the Government refers to this matter and says that there will he a period for us of very considerable shortage and difficulty. Those are strong words even for the Economic Survey.<br/>
Unfortunately, during his period of office the Minister of Fuel and Power has not given us any very striking evidence of his competence to deal with the matter of oil supplies. We know, of course, that he has been busy on nationalisation Bills and that oil supplies, except when it comes to rationing the ever-diminishing quantities, have had to take second place. I will give two specific examples of what is taking place. First of all, there was the coal-oil conversion scheme. That was started when the Minister's predecessor was in office, but he has continued it. Firms were urged to make rapid conversions of their plant from coal-burning to oil-burning. Many of those conversions were carried out speedily at the special request of the Minister. Now, barely 18 months later, many firms are being asked to convert back again to coal in view of the


shortage of oil and, incidentally, they are having to bear the cost of a double conversion.<br/>
An even more serious situation has arisen in regard to oil for ships' bunkers. There is no excuse here, because the Minister could have been warned by the deteriorating fuel oil situation for Britain of the difficulties which would very shortly arise in regard to oil for ships' bunkers. Nevertheless, it seemed to catch him unawares. It was well said at the annual meeting of the Chamber of Shipping two or three months ago, that it was not only the rising prices of oil for ships' bunkers but the uncertainty of securing supplies that was their great difficulty. One gentleman said that the outlook was sombre indeed. Some very striking figures were given regarding the cost of bunkering a Liberty ship on the round voyage from Australia via the Cape. The cost has increased since last October by no less than &#x00A3;5,500 to the immense figure of &#x00A3;18,000. That is the cost of the oil alone for the round trip. That is the way costs are going, and even with the increase in the prices, it is still very hard to know whether one can get the oil when one arrives in port. There has been very serious deterioration here and it seems that the time cannot be far distant when there will have to be some restriction on oil bunkering for ships.<br/>
Some of the difficulties facing increased oil supplies for Britain and for British ships are outlined in the Economic Survey, but an explanation of difficulties is not the same as finding a solution. I want to know what the Minister is doing to overcome the difficulties. I will outline some of the problems under three separate headings. First of all, there are the Middle East oilfields. I want to know whether we are really doing enough to get them into full-scale production. Would it not be a sound investment to spend dollars even on making special oilfield equipment available? Would it not even be worth spending dollars to obtain the machinery and other equipment? Every pound we spend in the Middle East oilfields will save dollars when the oilfields are in full production or, better still, will earn dollars or other hard currencies. It is worth while giving an over-riding priority to the factories of Britain to secure delivery of oilfield machinery and equipment to the Middle East oilfields.<br/>
The Iraq Petroleum Company have been doing valiant work over the last two years trying to double the pipeline from the fields at Kirkuk to the Mediterranean. They have been harassed by climatic and other difficulties but their greatest obstacle has been the slow delivery of supplies from Britain. Exports to these fields should have top priority even over the now popular textile drive, and that should be engaging the attention of the Government today. In another part of the Middle East there has been the lamentable spectacle of oil being pumped back into the field. The Minister recently referred to the fact that no less than one million tons of oil had been pumped back into the Anglo-Iranian fields in Persia owing to unbalance in the development of the field due to shortages of essential equipment.<br/>
The second great problem is that of tankers. Everybody knows that there is a shortage of tankers. It is referred to in the Economic Survey. Is enough priority being given to British tanker construction? Is the Parliamentary Secretary, who recently came from the Ministry of Transport, really making sure that his late Ministry is getting the tankers out of the British yards? Additional British tankers could carry dollar oil and thus earn dollar freights in addition to saving the dollars which we at present have to spend on hiring American tankers. I hope the Minister will not criticise the Americans in regard to their oil tanker policy. Many of their tankers were laid up after the war and it was not possible to release them for our routes because they were designed for the Pacific run and were not suitable for the Atlantic and other routes. I believe that in any case in their desire to help to relieve the situation, the Americans have released more tankers from carrying winter oil up the East coast of America and have made them available for foreign use.<br/>
The real bottleneck remains the question of oil refineries. The Economic Survey says that plans for new refineries will take years to mature and will be delayed. Surely that is one thing that ought not to be delayed. The provision of additional refining equipment ought to go ahead without any delay in view of the importance of oil both for us in Britain and for maintaining our balance of payments. The "Petroleum Times" in its issue of


13th March is rather more outspoken. In its leading article it says:
<q>Already &#x2026; British refinery plans, announced long ago, are so behind schedule that no company will release a "progress report.</q>
That is a deplorable state of affairs, particularly as the sterling oil industry is making a contribution of about &#x00A3;100 million per annum towards the balance of payments by the oil it produces going to countries outside the sterling area. Surely in the field of refineries there ought to be no delay, particularly as much of the equipment is not of a specialised nature but could be manufactured in British factories and shipped over quickly. If only the priority were given and if only the urgency were appreciated by all those who can make the equipment for these refineries, things would go ahead much faster than they are going today.<br/>
For a nation to be short of oil can rightly be interpreted as a grave strategic weakness by any hostile Power. The shortage is quite obvious. What is not so obvious is the steps we are taking to remedy the shortage in this important field. There are great difficulties, but the public is entitled to know what is being done to overcome them. The Minister has been busy with nationalisation, and particularly with the nationalisation of the gas industry, but I hope he can now reveal a far-reaching and comprehensive programme which will satisfy Britain's future requirements.</p>

<p>May I, by leave of the House, reply to the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale (Mr. Erroll) and say that he has put forward his case with his usual charm and accuracy. He slipped up only when he talked about the incompetency of my right hon. Friend which, of course, I cannot accept in any circumstances, and when I have dealt with many of the points raised by the hon. Member, I hope he will see that a great deal has been done&#x2014;indeed almost the impossible has been done&#x2014;to deal with what is undoubtedly an extremely difficult situation. The hon. Member paid me the courtesy of advising me of a number of the points he intended to raise, and therefore I am able to give him a fairly full reply and one which I hope will satisfy him.<br/>
The hon. Member referred to coal oil conversion. I am certain that it is not his desire this evening to score political points on this important issue, and therefore I do not want to do so either. However, in 1946 when the question of coal oil conversion was first considered, he will recollect that there was a surplus of sterling fuel oil and an acute shortage of coal. Today we have a world shortage of fuel oil due to the enormously increased consumption throughout the world and, of course, we cannot accept responsibility for increased consumption in countries other than our own. The biggest quantitative increase, as the hon. Member indicated, has been in the United States of America, though from the point of view of percentage increase, the increase in this country and in other European countries has been higher. However, in fuel oil as in everything else to do with oil, the world tends to be knocked sideways by what happens in the United States of America, because that country not only produces but consumes two-thirds of the present world total oil consumption. Not only that, but the United States of America is actually consuming today more than the entire world consumption in 1938. Therefore, a small percentage variation in American consumption has a marked effect on the rest of the world.<br/>
What would the hon. Member have done if he had been in the position of my right hon. Friend; if he had been faced with those factors in 1946 of a shortage of coal and a surplus of sterling fuel oil? I think he would have done the commonsense thing and have said, "There must be conversion. The coal industry has to be given an opportunity of getting up its production capacity and, whilst we have fuel oil in surplus, we ought to use that fuel oil to save the coal because we want it for export in the quickest possible time." What did we do? We did not force coal oil conversion on to industry. The fact was that there was this great shortage of coal in industry as everywhere else and industries themselves, because they needed to keep their factories going, had an opportunity to get fuel oil to replace the coal they could not have. All that the Ministry did was to make an orderly conversion to fuel oil instead of a disorderly and chaotic approach. I am certain that if the Government had not


done something about coal oil conversion in an orderly way, private enterprise would have gone ahead itself, and it could not have been in the orderly way made possible by the arrangements of my right hon. Friend.<br/>
In the United States of America there is not the same relation between Government Departments and industry, but there they have gone in extensively for fuel oil conversion and they are in exactly the same position today as ourselves, that they are short of oil and have to hold up their fuel oil conversion. After all, it is a changing situation and one has to be flexible about these things. Indeed, one would not be an administrator if one were merely to set a hard and fast line and never deviate from it. The circumstances of the case must be taken into consideration at the time and then, with the best advice, what resources there are must be utilised. So it was a little unfair, and not in accordance with the usual line of the hon. Member, to reflect upon the competency of my right hon. Friend, and I think it was just a prelude to a little wordy battle and that he did not really mean it. I am certain that the action of my right hon. Friend was right at the time, and has proved to be right. The changing situation of the world has made a marked difference and, as the hon. Member knows, my right hon. Friend will be making a statement shortly on the problem of fuel oil conversion.<br/>
It is perfectly true that the costs of fuel oil have increased and my right hon. Friend replied to a Question on this matter put by the hon. Member for Bury (Mr. W. Fletcher), pointing out that the increase in price was due to the rise in the world price of oil which this Government do not control and that it must be accepted as a normal commercial risk. The hon. Member also referred to Middle East oil and to oil being pumped back. It is the fact that oil has been pumped back at one of the Middle East oilfields, but it was not because of the bad layout of the field or due entirely to the incompleteness of the plant and machinery at the field. It was due, in the main, to the shortage of tankers to lift that oil, and this re-cycling process will be stopped as soon as the tankers are available to lift the extra oil and bring it to the refineries or wherever we want it taken. In any case a certain amount of re-cycling must

inevitably take place. Ships at sea cannot run like railways because of the hazards of weather and problems of loading and unloading. So there are times when tankers tend to get bunched, and if that happens and tankers are not available to take the oil, there must be some recycling. However, I can assure the hon. Member that as soon as tankers are available to lift the oil, it will be dealt with. I give no guarantees, but I do not think the time is far off when from all normal points of view re-cycling should stop, though there always will be re-cycling when there is bunching of tankers.<br/>
With regard to the development of the Middle Eastern pipelines, obviously the world shortage of steer has a great effect upon them, for refineries and pipelines are large users of steel and pipeline transportation of oil to the Mediterranean is far more economical than tanker transportation. I cannot express an opinion as to what will happen finally in the Middle East, but it will be readily recognised that there is an economic aspect of this problem. The problem of tankers is one of building, and the hon. Member is entitled to ask what is being done about increasing the tanker fleet. This country lost two million deadweight tons of tanker shipping during the war. Yet by the middle of 1947 these severe losses had been made good and, by the beginning of 1948, our tanker fleet had reached the figure of 5.1 million tons or 600,000 deadweight tons more than in mid-1939. Dry cargo shipping, on the other hand, will not reach its pre-war level before 1951.<br/>
Those figures are clear evidence of the very great effort which has been made by the oil and tanker companies to provide sufficient tonnage for their growing requirements. Indeed, it is an accomplishment. Recently oil companies have placed large orders for delivery over the next two or three years. At the end of January, 650,000 dead weight tons of tankers were under construction in yards in the United Kingdom, and of these 260,000 dead weight tons are expected to be completed in 1948. The proportion of tankers in the United Kingdom building programme is steadily increasing, and in January the tankers represented 22 per cent. of the total tonnage under construction compared with 14 per cent. a year ago. This proportion is likely to increase still further.


The planning of the tanker building programme rests initially, not with the Government, but with the oil and tanker companies, which are private enterprise. The Government would be glad to see an increasing flow of orders to meet the demands of the growing trade, although it must be admitted that the scope for more tanker building in the immediate future is limited because the yards are fully booked up, not only for tanker orders, but for other types of merchant ships.<br/>
In regard to bunkers, owing to the very great increase in the general demand for oil in 1947, and further prospective increases, the oil companies found they had not enough oil to meet the needs of everyone, and reached the conclusion at the end of 1947 that they could not lay contracts for 1948 with all the customers they had served in the previous year. They have, however, collaborated with His Majesty's Government in ensuring a sufficient supply of bunkers to keep the Merchant Navy in full operation, and, in-so far as the bunker shortage had been due to lack of tankers, the situation has been relieved by a scheme worked out by the shipping industry and the coal industry for taking bunker supplies at places nearest the sources of production.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman also dealt with refiner capacity and referred to the Economic Survey which clearly shows the general overall position. That Report says very specifically:
<q>They will however, take some years to mature, and may be delayed in view of the current shortage of steel.</q>

I can assure the hon. Member, and the House, that no one is more anxious than we at the Ministry of Fuel and Power to do everything that can be done to assist the companies with their expansionist schemes, but, in the present difficult circumstances, the allocation of steel to industries which can produce a quick return in foreign exchange cannot be overlooked, in spite of the fact that the allocation of steel for the expansion of British oil companies' projects is probably one of the most productive uses to which steel can be put for the longer term export assets. In any case, the details of companies' schemes are submitted to my right hon. Friend in confidence. I cannot at this Box disclose those details without consultation with the companies concerned. I can assure the hon. Gentleman, and the House, that the schemes of the companies are very imposing, and that my right hon. Friend will do his utmost to forward them.<br/>
I hope I have dealt fully with all the points raised by the hon. Gentleman and I hope that, having heard this reply, he will at least be satisfied that my right hon. Friend is doing everything possible to deal with this very difficult problem of oil and that it is not being neglected because of the other work and responsibilities in which my right hon. Friend has also a special interest.</p>
