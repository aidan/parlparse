<p>asked the Secretary of State for Scotland whether he will make a further statement about the progress which has been made on the conversion of the Royal High School in Edinburgh for the proposed Scottish Assembly; what is the total expenditure incurred so far; and what further expenditure will be incurred before the work is completed.</p>

<p>Work is proceeding to bring the buildings to the state described in my reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy (Mr. Gourlay) on 7th April. The expenditure incurred to mid-October, including cost of purchase, was &#x00A3;17;31 million. The outstanding expenditure on these works is &#x00A3;690,000.</p>

<p>Do not these figures show a substantial escalation in the cost of this building? What plans do the Government have for dealing with this ghastly exercise in nonsense if we do not have a Scottish Assembly?</p>

<p>The figures do not show a substantial escalation in the cost. If, in the event, the Royal High School is not required for the Assembly, this will be a matter for the Property Services Agency to consider at that time. The Government are committed to devolution, and we are confident of getting the necessary Bills on to the statute book.</p>

<p>Is it not true that the fact that the Bill might just squeak through the House does not necessarily mean that the Assembly will be set up? Would it

not suit the Government if the Bill were stymied in another place or by a General Election? Or is it the intention of the Government to keep going until the Assembly is duly established?</p>

<p>The hon. Member is looking for ghosts which clearly do not exist. We are confident that the House will approve the Bill. The people of Scotland &#x2014;because we are committed to a referendum&#x2014;will themselves decide whether there will be a Scottish Assembly.</p>

<p>The expenditure was approved by the House by the passing of the Appropriation Act following an announcement by the Lord President on 14th April 1976. The approval of the House of Commons is as good a precedent as any for a constitutional and democratic country.</p>

<p>If the Secretary of State changes his plans, might it not be an idea for him to take along the Tory spokesman on devolution? In view of the remarks made by that hon. Gentleman about the Scottish scene during the summer, he could do with visiting any school in Scotland. Might that not also help the Conservatives to make up their minds about their policy on devolution?</p>

<p>I do not know to which Conservative spokesman the hon. Gentleman was referring. If he meant the hon.

<p>Will my right hon. Friend assure the STUC and the workers at the Scottish Timber Products factory at Cowie that the Government are still prepared to do everything possible to save the factory? Could we have a decision as soon as possible on this matter in view of the anxiety felt by workers and their families?</p>

<p>I can give my hon. Friend that assurance in the terms for which he asks. A number of firms have shown an active interest in taking over that establishment, and we hope for a solution to the problem reasonably soon. Of course one can never be absolutely certain, but a lot of interest has been shown and we are working hard to find a solution.</p>

<p>Will the Secretary of State report on the endeavours of the STUC to seek a solution to the problem at Chrysler's? In view of the severe damage that has been done to the cause of attracting industry to the West of Scotland, will he strive to solve this dispute over what appears to be a trivial matter? Will he give an indication that the full resources of the Government are being made available to find a solution to this damaging dispute?</p>

<p>I am taking a close interest in what is happening there. Certain discussions were held yesterday and today, and it would not help the House or the situation for me to go into the matter in any detail. I very much hope that some solution will be found to enable work to be continued at Linwood.</p>

<p>When the Secretary of State last met the STUC, did he discuss the future of the Scottish steel industry and especially the danger of the BSC's policy to the steelworks at Glengarnock in my constituency? Will he tell me what action he has taken on the future of the Glengarnock steelworks following representations from the STUC?</p>

<p>The Minister of State has met the STUC in the last fortnight, and he discussed the steel industry generally in Scotland. It is known that there are very

serious problems affecting the steel industry, not just in Scotland but in the United Kingdom generally, and the Government are actively discussing a number of these matters with the Corporation.</p>

<p>Is the Minister aware that the House welcomes his interest in the difficult problems facing Chrysler, if only because he has special responsibilities since Chrysler is the only company which has concluded a planning agreement with the Government? Does that factor change the Government's status in regard to this company as opposed to the situation in other industrial disputes?</p>
</speech>

<p>In all industrial disputes, Ministers take the view that the best solution is one arrived at between the trade unions and the industry concerned without ministerial intervention. At the same time, in a case such as this Ministers are interested in doing anything that can be done to help. The Government will do whatever they think is possible. One should not, even in this difficult situation, be tempted to make hasty interventions, because at the end of the day what happens at Linwood will have to be determined by management and men there. When the dispute is settled, they will have to settle down to work amicably together. That is what I hope will happen.</p>

<p>Does my right hon. Friend accept that those of us who are involved in the Chrysler situation are pleased at the close attention he is giving to the matter, but will he study carefully the proposals put forward in the discussions by the STUC which seemed to some of us to create the groundwork for a successful return to work?</p>

<p>Is the Minister aware that 84 qualified applicants had to be turned away by Dunfermline College of Physical Education because it was over-subscribed for the year?

<p>The hon. Gentleman, who has gone over this ground, as others have done, on previous occasions in the last few months, is well aware that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland has said that he will be making a statement on this matter in the next few months.</p>

<p>Does the Minister appreciate that his present policies are scaring young people away from a career in education? What figures can he give showing the number of teachers now in training? What effect is to be expected in Scottish education in three or four years' time? Has not the Minister achieved the worst of both worlds from the point of view of young unemployed teachers, and is he not creating an acute teacher training shortage for two or three years hence?</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman must have heard, as I did, the arguments

on this subject in the Scottish Grand Committee and the projections that were made based on population figures. It is not true to say that young people are being scared away from the prospect of becoming teachers. Indeed, there are a number of young people who have a strong vocation in this respect.</p>

<p>Is my right hon.

<p>My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland and my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State have received deputations from staff and students in the past few months.

<p>Why is the Secretary of State for Scotland dragging his feet on the request made in July by my hon.

<p>I would refer the hon. Member to the reply given to


the hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. White) on 21st July. The reports of the Munn, Dunning and Pack Committees have now been published and my right hon.

<p>Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that those rather academic reports are no substitute for Government views and policy?

<p>I do not think that the reports are of only academic interest. The people who prepared them are closely involved with Scottish education. The chairman of one of the committees was the headmaster of my children's school, and I know, therefore, that he is closely involved in day-to-day education.<br/>
As for parental choice, this subject was at the top of the hon. Gentleman's list when he issued a Press statement on the matter. He gave it much higher priority then than he did in relation to the poorer areas of the country. That indicated to me the attitude of the Conservative Party on this issue.</p>

<p>Is my right hon. Friend aware that the consultation processes are overloaded with the Pack Committee on truancy, the Munn Committee on the curriculum and the Dunning Committee on assessment? These are hardly minor academic subjects.

<p>As my hon. Friend may recall, my hon.

<p>Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that the supplementary question asked by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North (Mr. Fletcher) indicates why the newspaper reports have called the Conservative education committee in Scotland "nuts and bolts"? On a more fundamental matter, will the Minister indicate that he will reconsider yet again the previous decision not to renegotiate the number of pupils per class? This is a matter of vital importance to our schools, particularly in these days of composite classes.</p>

<p>On the first point, I would point out to the hon. Gentleman that the industry is well aware of our view that


the present Commission proposals are highly unsatisfactory. We have not only made that clear to the industry but we have also made it clear to the Council of Ministers and the Commission. In regard to unilateral national conservation measures, I believe that we have taken such measures where needs have demanded them, and the Commission understands that we shall continue to take national conservation measures wherever we consider them to be necessary in the absence of effective action in the Community.</p>

<p>Is the Minister aware of what has been taking place on the West Coast throughout the summer?

<p>On the first point, the industry has told me quite firmly that we should not be tempted, because of frustration at the delays caused, into agreeing an internal r&#x00E9;gime that is not satisfactory to United Kingdom interests. That is my view too. I want to reach a settlement on this matter as soon as we can do so because I want to end the uncertainty in the United Kingdom industry. But I am not willing to agree to a settlement simply for the sake of speed unless that settlement meets our essential interests. We have made this clear to the Community, and the industry supports us.<br/>

<p>Certain aspects of the matters we discussed yesterday will come up in a fortnight's time at the meeting of Agriculture Ministers. The next full meeting to discuss fishery matters will be on 5th and 6th December. Industrial fishing is not a matter that can be dealt with in isolation. There are other problems relating to conservation. We have made absolutely clear, however, that where there is a conflict, as there very often is, between industrial fishing and fishing for human consumption, fishing for human consumption must have


priority. I think that that is well understood within the Community and is becoming increasingly accepted.</p>

<p>There has been a falling off in the number of housing applications coming from local authorities, partly because in a number of areas local authorities feel that the general demand for houses is a good deal less than it was two or three years ago. This is another area in which reductions in population and in the birth rate eventually work their way through into demand for housing. There has been a good deal of increase also in matters such as local authority

rehabilitation. I agree that there are particularly serious problems facing the construction industry, and I am meeting representatives from the industry, employers and trade unions, at a joint meeting on Friday this week.</p>

<p>So far, 22 organisations and two individuals have submitted comments on the Green Paper on Scottish housing (Cmnd. 6852), and several other organisations which were unable to meet the target date of 1st October are expected to comment within the next few weeks. In addition, I have had discussions with representatives of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and of the Scottish Trades Union Congress; and I shall shortly be taking part in a number of housing conferences at which the Green Paper will be discussed.<br/>
Some time will be needed to take stock of the comments, and I cannot yet make a comprehensive statement. My right hon. Friend will inform Parliament of the outcome of the consultations in due course.</p>

<p>Yes. This is one of the fundamental aspects of the Green Paper, and it is certainly one to which we attach importance in Dennistoun. Dennistoun is

in two parts, although I had better not describe them in more detail. However, there are four housing action areas in the southern part. The streets that my hon.

<p>Do the Government still have a target date for all houses in Scotland reaching a tolerable standard?

<p>I entirely agree. It is a matter for concern that there are still too many sub-tolerable houses in Scotland. The main problems are in the two major cities, but the authorities in Edinburgh and Glasgow are making substantial and considerable efforts. Sad to say, it is the country authorities that are lagging behind because of peculiar difficulties. I have had discussions with them, and we may be able to improve matters in any legislation that might be forthcoming from the Green Paper.</p>

<p>The programme of major hospital building projects announced by my right hon. Friend on 2nd May 1977 will provide for approximately 450 additional geriatric beds in Scotland.

<p>Is the Minister aware that the Government must have been playing blind man's bluff with the Scottish economy? Does he realise that the figures have been isolated by the Scottish CBI, which estimates a loss of 10,000 jobs, and that the Cambridge Institute of Applied Economics estimates a loss of about 14,000 jobs?

Scottish industrialists do not understand a word of the Opposition's proposals for devolution as reported in the Press, even after having met the official Opposition spokesman.

<p>I should require notice of the hon. Gentleman's first question, though I do not think that it would be proper for him to put it to me. In regard to the general question of accommodation, I agree that this is a most important matter. As regards delays in the administration of justice in the Glasgow Sheriff Court and the district courts, although these are not subject to the same delays, the problem is caused by the shortage of courtroom accommodation. This is a matter for my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland, and he is planning early additions to the accommodation.</p>

<p>With permission, Mr. Speaker, I wish to make a statement.<br/>
Since the House debated the economic situation in July, the improvement in our financial position has been greatly strengthened. Confidence in Britain's future has been powerfully reinforced both at home and abroad. As a result we are now in a position to take further measures to improve the outlook for employment and to bring the growth of output on to its intended path.<br/>
It is now clear that both in the United Kingdom and in the world as a whole the recovery in demand and activity is weaker than was expected in the summer. The latest meetings of the International Monetary Fund and of the Finance Council of the European Community have agreed that the industrialised world should take steps to stimulate demand and that Britain is in a position to join in this collective effort.<br/>
The Government have made it clear that they aim at a steady and sustained expansion and are determined to avoid the risk of over-heating the economy with the damaging consequences for growth, inflation and the balance of payments which we saw four years ago. For this reason the decisions I shall now announce are part of a programme for economic expansion spreading over 18 months. Our main objective must be a continuing fall in the level of unemployment. In framing measures to this end the Government have been guided by four main considerations. The measures should be quick-acting, they should reinforce the attack on inflation and assist the industrial strategy, they should be fully consistent with our financial commitments for the current year and they should run no risk of over-extending our finances in 1978&#x2013;79 or of unnecessarily prejudicing the possibility of further measures in the next spring Budget.<br/>
Our basic economic strategy remains as I described it in my March Budget. I now see scope for measures within the framework of that strategy costing a little over &#x00A3;1 billion in the current year and &#x00A3;2 billion in the next financial year.</p>

<p>First, measures affecting the next financial year 1978&#x2013;79. The House decided this summer to commit the Government to increasing personal tax allowances each spring in line with the rate of price increase over the previous calendar year unless they sought explicit permission to do otherwise.<br/>
I believe it is right that we should not seek to waive this requirement in the coming year. The Government therefore plan to raise tax thresholds for the next financial year as laid down in the Finance Act 1977. This is likely to require a 12 per cent. increase in personal allowances above the level set by the 1977 Finance Act, at a cost of around &#x00A3;1,200 million in a full year.</p>
</speech>
<major-heading id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1977-10-26a.1438.2" colnum="1438">Public Expenditure</major-heading>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1977-10-26a.1438.3" colnum="1438" time="">
<p>In the summer the Government announced very substantial increases in child benefits for the coming year, measures to implement the Holland Committee's proposals on manpower and training, and a major increase in the number of children eligible for free school meals; together these increases in public expenditure will cost some &#x00A3;475 million at 1977 Survey prices.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1977-10-26a.1438.4" colnum="1438" time="">
<p>The Government recognise that exceptional difficulties are now faced by the construction industry. They have therefore decided to increase expenditure next year on construction by the central Government and local authorities by &#x00A3;400 million at Survey prices over and above the existing plans. The allocation of this additional amount between different programmes will be announced as soon as possible. The full effect of this decision will be to increase employment by some 30,000.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1977-10-26a.1438.5" colnum="1438" time="">
<p>The Government have also decided on certain smaller increases in public expenditure programmes for next year. They are increasing the overseas aid programme by &#x00A3;20 million. They are increasing the law and order programme by &#x00A3;9 million to provide additional resources for police cadets, civilian support, police vehicles and equipment, and also for the prisons and the community service schemes. There will be additional provision in the social field to help the disabled by a further increase in mobility allowance next year


and to ease the strain on hard-pressed health authorities. There will be provision to enable schools to take on some more teachers to meet the needs of children in deprived areas and for small additions to the budgets for science and the arts. Allowing for these decisions and the measures announced in the summer, public expenditure next year is being increased by &#x00A3;1 billion at 1977 Survey prices.</p>

<p>Beyond these decisions on income tax and public expenditure in 1978&#x2013;79 I have left myself freedom to make further changes in the 1978 Budget according to developments in the economy, and particularly the prospect for inflation. If economic and financial circumstances permit, I intend to make some further reduction in the burden of personal taxation. For example, as I explained in my Budget Statement last March, there is a strong case for reducing the poverty flap by progressively raising the personal tax thresholds until they stand clear above the levels of the main social security benefits. There is also a strong case for introducing a reduced rate band of tax.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1977-10-26a.1439.3" colnum="1439" time="">
<p>However, there can at this stage be no assurance that the economic situation will in fact permit a further net reduction in taxation, over and above the major reliefs which I am announcing this afternoon. The scope for any further move in this direction&#x2014;and a reduced rate band of tax, in particular, could be very expensive&#x2014;will depend crucially on the development of the economy between now and next April, and above all on the trend of pay settlements, measured against the Government's guidelines.</p>

<p>I now turn to certain aspects of our overseas financial position. In our present circumstances it would clearly be wrong for us to take up any further drawings

on our standby with the IMF. We shall therefore not take up at the end of November the 310 million special drawing rights which then become available. The Managing Director of the IMF has been informed of this decision. Our full drawing rights under the standby will, of course, remain intact. We intend to keep the standby in place until its expiry at the end of next year, and mid-term discussions with the IMF on our economic strategy will shortly be taking place as envisaged in our Letter of Intent.</p>

<p>The change in our financial situation also makes possible some adjustments in exchange control.

<p>It is argued that the taxation of business transfers is an inhibition on the growth of small firms.

There will also be a relief of 20 per cent. for minority holdings in unquoted companies. These additional reliefs will be limited to transfers of up to &#x00A3;500,000. I have also decided to increase the threshold for liability to capital transfer tax from &#x00A3;15,000 to &#x00A3;25,000. These changes will apply to transfers after today.

When we add in the effect of the tax reliefs in my spring Budget, this figure rises to the gross equivalent of some &#x00A3;5 per week, or nearly 61 per cent.

On the conventional arithmetic, this could produce an increase in employment in these quarters of 30,000 and 170,000 respectively and lead to a reduction in unemployment, compared with what it would otherwise have been, of some 20,000 and 110,000 respectively.</p>

<p>But I have to say again that the prospects for the economy as a whole depend crucially on what happens to inflation. I am publishing today a further half-yearly economic forecast as provided under the Industry Act 1975. This forecast assumes an average earnings growth of 10 per cent. in the current pay round, consistent with the Government's guidelines. On this critical assumption, the growth of domestic output could strengthen significantly over the next 12 months to a figure in the region of 3&#x00BD; per cent.

<p>I believe that the measures which I have announced this afternoon will help the British people to choose instead a better course&#x2014;to build on the gains that they have already won and to achieve a sustained reduction in inflation together with a steady growth in jobs, in output and in living standards.</p>

<p>The whole House will welcome the improvements in the basic financial indicators of which the Chancellor of the Exchequer spoke. The House will be prepared to give much credit for them to the stabilisation programme on which the Government embarked in the last year under the tutelage and guidance of the International Monetary Fund.<br/>
We have heard the Chancellor of the Exchequer deliver his twelfth Budget in a short time, speak yet again about the economy being at a turning point, and make optimistic predictions for inflation and unemployment next year. We certainly hope that he is right, but we shall be prepared to judge him by results rather than by his forecasts.<br/>
We welcome the extent to which the Chancellor feels able to move towards substantial cuts in direct taxation. That is because we, unlike members of the Labour Party, like cuts in direct personal taxes. We shall be watching with care to ensure that the Government's forecast borrowing requirements are in line with the requirements of the International Monetary Fund, because the conquest of

inflation, which would be jeopardised by any wrong movement in that direction, remains far and away the most important contribution that the British economy can make towards restoring the health of the world economy. We shall have an opportunity to discuss these matters further in the days ahead.<br/>
We welcome the impact on the Chancellor of the Exchequer of the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, because it must have been his advice that led the Chancellor of the Exchequer now, so late in the day, to begin reversing the disastrous effect of capital transfer tax and other measures on small businesses.<br/>
We also welcome the Chancellor's decision to bring additional help to the construction industry. However, 30,000 new jobs represents one-tenth of the present rate of unemployment in that industry. The Chancellor has a long way to go to correct the mistakes which he made in choosing to prefer the bureaucracy to the building industry when making the cuts last year.<br/>
I turn to the distribution of the increases in expenditure. We are concerned that the increase in expenditure on overseas aid is more than twice the increase in expenditure on the police and law and order.<br/>
We welcome the extent to which the Chancellor of the Exchequer has been able to go in restoring the real value of tax thresholds, but he has still a substantial way to go towards restoring them to the levels of 1973. Many thousands of millions of pounds are needed to reduce the real rate of taxation to that level.<br/>
I hope that the Chancellor will take account of the need to begin lightening the burden of tax represented by the standard rate. It is still oppressively high on the skilled workers and managers upon whom the country's wealth and prosperity depends.<br/>
This is a Budget of repentance&#x2014;repentance on a massive scale. It will do more to convince the House that the Government are preparing reluctantly to face their judgment at the hands of the people than that the high-tax Socialist Party has, in reality, changed its spots.</p>

<p>First, I thank the right hon. and learned Member for Surrey, East (Sir G. Howe) for welcoming the


decisions I have announced, although I think that his welcome would have carried more conviction had he not looked so glum and miserable. The right hon. and learned Gentleman attributed the success of the Government in restoring our financial position to the stabilisation programme that we adopted last December. However, the right hon. and learned Gentleman attacked that programme violently at the time as being totally inadequate. The Leader of the Opposition went on attacking it and, in the United States this summer, she attacked the IMF for being far too lenient with us.<br/>
I know that the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster will be grateful for the tribute that the right hon. and learned Gentleman paid to him. Without revealing Cabinet secrets, I can say that the credit for these measures should be shared equally between the Chancellor of the Duchy and my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury.<br/>
I am a little confused, but I believe that I understand the general trend of the final paragraph of the right hon. and learned Gentleman's obituary. He seemed to be asking for bigger cuts in public expenditure and then complaining about the cuts. He seemed to be asking for bigger cuts in taxation and then worrying about whether the money supply could be kept under proper control.<br/>
The right hon. and learned Gentleman said that it was a Budget of repentance, but it is a Budget of reward for the sacrifices made by the people over the past few years. It seals the victory for this Government in liquidating the legacy that they found when taking office.</p>

<p>Does the Chancellor of the Exchequer recognise that his statement brings the Government halfway to sanity? Does he realise that this will be a matter of regret to the Conservative Opposition?<br/>
I give an unreserved welcome to his announcements, particularly that relating to small businesses. One cannot but marvel at the astonishing transformation in the attitude of Whitehall in the last six months to the problems of small businesses. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster has fully justified the trust we placed in him.<br/>
May I ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer to say something about the external position of the British economy&#x2014;particularly in relation to our exports&#x2014;and about the Government's policy relating to the future exchange rate of the pound?</p>

<p>If anything were needed to complete my satisfaction over the improvement in the nation's economy it is the knowledge, on which I can now securely rest, that I have justified the trust of the hon. Member for Cornwall, North (Mr. Pardoe). As for the exchange rate, it is, as we have stated on many occasions, the Government's policy to maintain the stability of the pound approximately at its present level.</p>

<p>Is the Chancellor telling us that, despite the measures of reflation which we welcome, he is still prepared only to increase child benefit next April by &#x00A3;300 million? If that is so, can be justify this neglect of the nation's children at a time when, in this year alone, he is spending over &#x00A3;2 billion on increasing the personal allowances for the single man and the childless couple?</p>

<p>I appreciate my right hon. Friend's strong feelings on the matter of child benefits, but she will be aware that last July we did a great deal to help children in poor families by the prolongation of the milk subsidy and by the large increase in the number of children eligible for free school meals. While there is a strong case for increasing child benefits when we can afford to do so, my right hon. Friend must accept&#x2014;I know that she understands this&#x2014;that only 15 per cent. of the total amount of money disbursed in child benefits goes to the poorest 20 per cent. of families. This is essentially a measure of help for people with children at every level of income. It is not a very effective measure for helping poor families.</p>

<p>One of my disappointments, and I hope that it is a disappointment for the whole House, is that there


is at the moment an enormous amount of cash in businesses and, in the banking system, available to businesses. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman deplores as much as I do the failure of business so far to use this money in stimulating investment, and the failure of business to fulfil its declared intentions to increase investment, intentions published both by the CBI and in Government surveys earlier in the year. I can assure the right hon. Gentleman that there will be plenty of monetary room left in the economy for substantial and badly needed increases in investment after these measures.</p>

<p>Is my right hon. Friend aware that his statement will be generally welcomed by all Labour Members? Is he further aware, however, that some of us will be marginally disappointed about the aid to the construction industry, which is not to come forward until April next year? Does my right hon. Friend appreciate that some of us had hoped that there would be a massive injection of aid for the construction industry? I ask him, even at this late stage, to think again on this point. We need assistance now, not next year.</p>

<p>I am grateful for my hon. Friend's earlier remarks. The measures I have announced will be welcomed in all sections of the movement which he and I have the honour to represent. I know that there will be disappointment in various parts of the country and the Labour movement that we have not been able to do more in certain areas. We allocated an extra &#x00A3;100 million for construction in the July measures, to be spent during the current financial year. It takes quite a long time for this type of authorisation to be reflected in actual disbursements of money for doing construction work. Some of that money has still to be fully allocated. One of the reasons why I have given this big increase in money for construction next year is to provide local authorities and Government Departments concerned with plenty of time to prepare plans so that it will be possible to start spending the money as soon as the next financial year begins.</p>

<p>How does the Chancellor justify the payment of &#x00A3;20 million on overseas aid at a time when

our National Health Service is being kept short of funds and when, in those counties which were given insufficient help under the rate support grant, serious slashes in educational services are having to be made? Will the right hon. Gentleman bear in mind the needs of education and the health service in his future programme?</p>

<p>The education services will be receiving about &#x00A3;10 million under these measures, to spend next year. The Department of Health and Social Security will be getting &#x00A3;20 million to &#x00A3;25 million, much of which will be spent in the health service. I deplore the right hon. and learned Gentleman's remarks about the increase in overseas aid. We on the Labour Benches felt that it was one of the most unfortunate consequences of the situation in which we found ourselves last year that we had to make a substantial cut in the aid budget. I regret that the increase we are now announcing is not sufficient to make good that cut, but I believe that the great majority of British people will recognise that assistance from Britain to countries whose peoples are far worse off than we are is not only morally justified but has great political and economic value.</p>

<p>Does my right hon Friend agree, after hearing the lugubrious and rather envious comments of the right hon. and learned Member for Surrey, East (Sir G. Howe), that to make a Budget Statement without hearing those comments is rather like playing Hamlet without the first grave digger? While congratulating my right hon. Friend on his excellent measures, may I ask him to consider what action can be taken to increase investment by large firms, bearing in mind that small firms represent a small part of the total amount of industry?</p>

<p>I must confess that listening to the right hon. and learned Member for Surrey, East (Sir G. Howe), and hearing him trumpet the call to arms for a General Election, I could not help feeling that his trumpet had an uncertain, wavering sound. As for the question of investment by large firms, some large firms have already announced, and begun to carry out, substantial investment programmes. Imperial Chemical Industries is a good example. The general level


of investment is far too low. I referred to that in my Mansion House speech last week. I believe that as confidence, which is already at an all-time high in other parts of the world, seeps through into all areas of our own economy we shall find business men reflecting that confidence in increased investment, particularly since I think they are coming to recognise that the continuing flow of North Sea oil will enable this country to maintain a sustained pressure of demand for many years to come without being subject, as was often the case in the past, to a stop-go policy.</p>

<p>While I suppose that we must be grateful for small mercies, may I ask whether the Chancellor is aware that his Budget does not contain nearly enough for Scotland? Is he further aware that yesterday's Scottish unemployment figures and the continuing social deprivation in Scotland show that Scotland has become the only country to have discovered oil in her waters and become poorer for it? Does the right hon. Gentleman realise that the use of Scottish oil to fuel this mini-Budget represents one of the biggest rip-offs of Scottish assets since the Darien scheme?</p>

<p>We are familiar with the hon. Member's views. All I can tell him is that the progressive improvement we can foresee in the economy will bring great benefits to the Scottish people, even though the consequences of that for the party he represents may be less exciting.</p>

<p>May I ask my right hon. Friend to what extent he has taken into account the further upsurge in the personal savings ratio? Apart from a lack of will on the part of capitalists to invest, there is this fatal reluctance of people to spend. Will the reflation of the economy be as great as he expects, or shall we have the experience of the Americans and the Germans following tax cuts, when people save money rather than spend it?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1977-10-26a.1451.3" hansard_membership_id="5624" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/23743" speakername="Mr. Healey" colnum="1451" time="">
<p>If I could predict the movement of the savings ratio, I would find my job easier than I do. Nobody fully understands why, throughout the world in the last few years, in spite of very high rates of inflation, people have chosen to save money rather than to

spend it. It might well be because of high rates of inflation.<br/>
I think that the right hon. Member for Spelthorne (Mr. Atkins) is right in saying that the main reason for the present situation is the great uncertainty that exists. However, I believe that in this country, thanks to the prudent policies followed by the Government and the special advantages that we are likely to get from North Sea oil, the uncertainty will be a great deal less than it is in many other countries. We can probably expect the savings ratio to begin falling in the coming year, but my hon. Friend knows as well as I do that this is the most difficult and dangerous thing to predict.</p>

<p>Will the right hon. Gentleman expand a little on what he said about exchange control? I was glad to hear what he said on this subject, but will he go a little further, because I would relate that to what he said about overseas aid? If he can ease exchange control, that can be just as effective as, if not more effective than, the help that he is giving through overseas aid. I do not wish to denigrate the latter, but a more positive easement of exchange control can help businesses to invest overseas.</p>

<p>We on this side of the House believe that we should take every step to ensure that the benefits of North Sea oil lead to a big increase in investment in British industry and a strengthening of our own manufacturing base at home, rather than to the acquisition of assets abroad. Indeed, it could be argued that one reason for the relatively poor economic performance of this country throughout the twentieth century was the over-reliance on income from investment abroad in the nineteenth century. I do not think that this is the time for loosening controls on direct or portfolio investment overseas.</p>

<p>Enthusiastically though the proposals enunciated by my right hon. Friend undoubtedly are being, and will be, received in the country, it is clearly impossible for him to satisfy the demands of all sections of the community in the allocation of resources, even in a mini-Budget. I welcome wholeheartedly what my right hon. Friend said about the construction industry, but I support


the representation that has been made that &#x00A3;400 million is by no means adequate to take up the slack in unemployment in that industry.<br/>
Secondly, may I ask my right hon. Friend how he managed to resist what must have been a considerable temptation to allocate at least &#x00A3;100 million for industrial development in the Northern Region, if only to compensate for the withdrawal of the regional employment premium? How did he resist the further temptation to allocate &#x00A3;300 million to &#x00A3;400 million to establish a Northern Region Industrial Development Agency?</p>

<p>I share the desire of my hon. Friend to reduce unemployment in the construction industry, and I agree that it will remain far too high even when the &#x00A3;400 million that I have allocated for next year is spent, but, as he admitted, we have to try to judge between competing priorities. I think that the large amount of additional public expenditure that has been allocated to the construction industry is itself an indication of how seriously we take its problems.<br/>
I appreciate my hon. Friend's concern about the North-East Region. All I can say is that it will remain a constant preoccupation to improve the treatment of industry there. As I said on another occasion, with the Prime Minister's permission I hope to occupy this post for another two and a half years before my six-year stint is over, and during that period I might be able to do something about the problem.</p>

<p>Does the right hon. Gentleman realise that we are all delighted about the strength of sterling, as we should be, but will he realise that he must not go on braying against industry not investing as much as he wants bearing in mind that in many areas industry is under-utilising its existing equipment by 15 per cent. or 20 per cent. and will never invest while that is the case?<br/>
Secondly, will the right hon. Gentleman assure the House, and particularly his hon. Friends in the Tribune Group, that his success has been based on traditional Conservative economic policy and not on Socialist economic theory?</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman must accept that in declaring their inten-

tions both to the CBI and to the Department of Industry British firms predicted and promised very much higher investment in the current year than they have carried through. This is a shortfall against their own tests, and not against the tests of the Government.<br/>
One of the great weaknesses of business in this country is that far too many firms do not invest until they are working at capacity, with the result that their investment does not come on stream until their competitors have taken their markets. If they would only show the wisdom shown by, for example, the firm from Sweden that was described in the <i>Financial Times</i> yesterday, the economic history of this country would be very much happier.</p>

<p>Does my right hon. Friend agree that, generally, private investment is labour saving, whilst public investment is labour creative?

<p>I cannot agree with my hon. Friend that all private investment is labour saving and that all public investment is labour creative. If he were to talk to the steel workers in South Wales he would find that they have a very different view on that matter. Indeed, if he were to talk to some of his hon.

<p>I appreciate my hon. Friend's views on the question of child benefit, but he must accept that the very large increase in the married person allowance will be of immense benefit to all families with children. I have already explained that I believe that the increase in child benefits planned for next April&#x2014;and it had to be announced last July so that it could be paid next April&#x2014;is appropriate in all the circumstances.</p>

<p>Will the right hon. Gentleman now answer the question of my hon. Friend the Member for Oswestry (Mr. Biffen)? If it is the policy to keep the exchange rate at about its present level, is it also the policy to allow the reserves to continue accumulating at their present enormous rate?</p>

<p>I read the literature as assiduously as no doubt the hon. Gentleman does&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "Answer."] I am answering, and if hon. Members opposite contain their impatience they may learn something to their advantage. There have been very large inflows of foreign currency into the reserves in the current year. Hon. Members will know


from perusal of the monetary figures&#x2014;the figures for the growth of money supply &#x2014;that in nearly all months until last month it was possible to sterilise the effects of the inflows on the money supply by very large domestic sales of gilts. A potential conflict could arise between the exchange rate policy, interest rate policy and monetary policy. Of course I know that. If it arises, I shall take appropriate action. But I should be foolish in the extreme if I were to give any indication of what I regarded as appropriate policy in those circumstances and the hon. Member must know that.</p>

<p>Physical controls might have a role to play if this contradiction became an important and urgent one to deal with. But my hon. Friend must understand that physical controls have not proved very effective when used by other countries, such as Switzerland and Germany, in dealing with this problem.

<p>I welcome much of the content and balance of the right hon. Gentleman's statement, but will he accept that many of us are deeply worried about the continuing level of the public sector borrowing requirement at &#x00A3;7 billion or &#x00A3;7&#x00BD; billion next year?

<p>I do not accept that view at all when the economy is working well below capacity. When the economy is working well below capacity, to seek to eliminate the public sector borrowing requirement would be to inflict needless social and economic damage on the people. The hon. Gentleman must know that the level of our public sector borrow-

ing requirement this year is well below the level which I forecast a year ago and, as a percentage of GDP, very much further below the level of the public sector deficit&#x2014;the general Government deficit&#x2014;in Germany, a country to which no doubt the hon.

<p>While welcoming that the relaxation in exchange control was much less radical than forecast&#x2014;one recognises the danger of too much hot money coming into the country &#x2014;may I ask whether it is possible by the extra allocation of gilts to use that money, by direct investment through the National Enterprise Board, for a much more purposive intention than anything that the hot speculators would use it for?</p>

<p>I wish that it were as simple as that, but I fear that it is not. There is a latent and potential contradiction between the three variables to which I have referred. I do not think that it has become acute, but it might, and then the Government would have to deal with the situation as they thought best. Public investment will not help the economy unless it produces a real return in terms of goods which are saleable at the price that they cost to produce. This is a central problem as much for public industry as for private industry. I believe that the appointment of Mr. Edwardes as the new Chairman of British Leyland may help to ensure that that problem, which is very acute in that company, which is under the control of the NEB, is finally resolved.</p>

<p>Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that his remarks about physical controls could be open to serious misinterpretation? Will he spell out the point a little more clearly? He referred in his statement to an increase in living standards. Is not that a very misleading way to put the position? Is it not the case that, even after the tax reliefs he has announced, living standards will not be restored to their earlier level?</p>

<p>I have made it clear on many occasions that there is no way in which the British or any other people who use large quantities of oil can recover the fall in their living standards which was the consequence of the increase in the price of oil. This is as true of Britain as it is of the United States, Germany


or any other country. But I expect a real improvement in the living standards in this country over the coming year, and I think that that improvement will help to ensure that the rate of inflation is kept down by reasonable pay settlements.<br/>
I made it clear that I do not believe that physical controls are a very effective answer to the problem to which I referred a moment ago. I referred to the experience of Germany and Switzerland in trying to operate such controls and finding mat their imperfections became more apparent as time passed.</p>

<p>I welcome the main features of the statement, but will the Chancellor tell us what is the Government's definition of full employment in percentage terms, and when he believes that that level of employment will be reached, bearing in mind the view of certain economists that we need 5 per cent. expansion between now and 1985 if unemployment is to fall below 1 million?</p>

<p>I wish that I could answer my hon. Friend's question but I honestly cannot. I do not think, for example, that any economist in this country had forecast that the employment figures for the last month, which were published yesterday, would show a seasonally corrected fall in the level of employment, a substantial increase in the number of job vacancies and a reduction in the amount of short-term working. I think that predicting employment in its relationship to movement of output all over the world has become extremely difficult. I believe that the measures which I have announced this afternoon, if they are accompanied by continuing moderation in wage settlements, will enable us to get unemployment moving regularly down in the coming year. As to what level and by what time, I do not believe that anyone can predict that.</p>

whether the police should be treated as a special case, a quarter of those asked said "No". [<i>Interruption</i>.] Three-quarters said "Yes", of course, but when people are asked a question of that nature it is not difficult to get a very large majority to say "Yes". But I put this question seriously to the Conservative Front Bench, and particularly to the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Whitelaw), who spoke on this matter recently at the Conservative Party Conference. Does he think that the words he used and the terms in which he spoke were calculated to help this country to get inflation down in the coming year?</p>

<p>Does my right hon. Friend not agree that it is rather nice to be mixed up in a squabble about how to distribute about &#x00A3;1 billion this year and &#x00A3;2 billion next year? Will he not agree that to a great extent the reason that he has this kitty to distribute is the restraint shown by the trade union movement over the last two years? Will he not agree that in some ways the &#x00A3;100 million to be given in the form of Christmas boxes to old-age pensioners is something that the trade unions have been able to provide? Will he not further agree that in some ways there is a moral to be learned by our trade union colleagues, in that because of their restraint over the last two years we hope it will be possible to continue to make progress in the next two years?<br/>

<p>I agree very strongly with my hon. Friend's remarks&#x2014;as would all my friends who are Finance Ministers in other countries with whom I have discussed the matter, and also my friends in international institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development&#x2014;concerning the cooperation between the British Government and the trade union movement, and the restraint shown by ordinary working people in pay negotiations. This applies not only to the last two years but also


to the present time. It has made an essential contribution to getting inflation under control in this country and creating a basis for measures of the sort that I have announced this afternoon.<br/>
The House will be aware that this co-operation with the trade union movement has been steadfastly attacked and derided by the Conservative Party. When there is talk of the Government owing their success to Conservative policies, I am bound to remind the House that the two major elements in our success have been a relationship with the trade union movement&#x2014;which the Conservative Party has never sought and can never achieve in its present posture&#x2014;and control of the money supply, which was allowed to explode under the previous Government.</p>

<p>My right hon. Friend is no doubt aware that economists are predicting a level of unemployment of 2 million. In the light of that, many of us will be very disappointed with the employment creation effects of this afternoon's statement. In arriving at his figures, did my right hon. Friend take into account the dangerous penetration of finished and semi-finished manufactured imports into this country? Could I urge him, even at this late stage, to restore the cuts in public expenditure which have enabled Tory councils up and down the country, such as the Avon County Council, to slash education, health and social services?</p>

<p>Economists predict all sorts of things, as the House knows very well. I recall the research department

of the Association of Supervisory, Technical and Managerial Staffs predicting that there would be 2 million unemployed last autumn. That prediction was absolutely wrong. I have not the slightest doubt that we shall not reach 2 million unemployed in the coming year, as the economists to whom my hon. Friend refers seem to believe. I believe that we can get unemployment firmly on to a downward path in the coming years.<br/>
We published some very interesting figures on imports during the recess. They show that British penetration of foreign markets has matched foreign penetration of British markets in the last few years. This is a two-way business. There is a very great increase in the volume of trade all over the world from which Britain is now deriving more benefit than other countries. This is the first year for many years in which we have actually increased our share of world trade. When we lose domestic markets to foreign imports, the reason is inadequacy of design, inadequacy of delivery or excessive cost, and all these are matters which the Government are deeply concerned to correct.</p>

<p>I know that that is a view widely held by the hon. Gentleman's friends in the City, but it is not held by those who are engaged in trade and production in this country.

<p>Will my right hon. Friend take a look at the ever-increasing cost to the worker by way of National Insurance contributions, taken from his wage

<p>I will consider any suggestion put to me. But as I said earlier, the level of social benefits paid for by National Insurance contributions in this country is still, regrettably, substantially lower than in other countries and the size of the contributions towards them is also considerably lower. I think it right that superannuation in particular should be properly funded. The scheme we are bringing in next year will be one of the most comprehensive that the world has seen and will be something for which this party and movement has fought for a long time.

<p>I am deeply concerned by the question raised by the hon. Gentleman. I devoted to it a good deal of my speech at the Mansion House last week. I have also attended meetings of the IMF in Washington and of the Council of Finance Ministers of the EEC in Luxembourg in recent weeks, when the matter also formed a major element, as it did in the discussions which I had with my West German colleague when the Prime Minister and I visited Bonn last week. We are all agreed that it is necessary to stimulate demand, and that we have shaded risks in recent years too much against growth&#x2014;a point made by Dr. Witteveen in his speech to the IMF. I may add that that speech disagreed strongly with the views of the hon. Member for Oswestry (Mr. Biffen), as the

hon. Gentleman knows. We have agreed in the European Council to try to increase demand by 1 per cent. of Europe's GDP over the coming year, and the measures I have announced today represent the British contribution to that collective end.</p>

<p>Is my right hon. Friend aware that much of what he has announced today should provide considerable encouragement to those trade union negotiators negotiating wage increases in the months ahead? But is he not also prepared to consider that much of what he has announced can be vitiated if there is any form of a race to increase prices?

<p>I strongly support the last point made by my hon. Friend. It is important that both the House and the country should recognise that, as a result of the measures I announced in July and those I have announced today, a married man with two children on only two-thirds average earnings will be actually better off at the end of this year, even without a wage increase, than he was at the beginning of the round. A married man with two children on average earnings&#x2014;about &#x00A3;80 a week&#x2014;would need only just over 2 per cent. wage increase in order to maintain his living standard. So there is a strong incentive for pay negotiators to keep the increase in earnings to the limits set in the Government guidelines. If they do, I shall be able to give further tax reductions in the next Budget, and I think that the House and the country are aware that an increase in living standards generated by tax reductions is infinitely better for the economy, for employment and for trade than an increase in living standards generated by excessive wage increases.</p>

<p>The rate of return has been falling all over the world in recent years per unit of capital, and our experience is not very different from that of other countries. The movement of investment seems to be worse in some other countries, such as West Germany, than it is here. There is all over the world an unexpected lag, in investment. It was not expected by the Governments of France, Germany, the Low Countries, the United States and Canada, and it is to some extent a baffling problem. I believe that it is to do with the uncertainty referred to by the hon. Gentleman, but I believe also that in this country we are beginning to remove some of those areas of uncertainty. As I said at the Mansion House, we are one of the few countries expected by international organisations to have a higher rate of growth next year than this, It looks as if our economy is going to improve significantly faster, while the performance of other economies which have previously been ahead of us is deteriorating.

<p>Will the right hon Gentleman give his views on the level of wage demands to come, particularly as they might be affected by his statement today?

<p>I do not know, but 1 believe that the improvement in real take-home pay generated by my measures in July and by my statement today is also having its effect on wage settlements&#x2014;not always on wage demands, which are a different thing. The hon. Gentleman will have been impressed, as outside observers have been impressed, by the high proportion of settlements made so far within our guidelines&#x2014;about 97 per cent. of those collected by the CBI data bank. I am certain that this is due to the growing realisation that the period of falling living standards is coming to an end and that an increase in living standards can now be rationally expected. I dare say that the House&#x2014;although perhaps not so much the Front Bench opposite&#x2014;was pleased to see that the last monthly index of consumer satisfaction and expectation, published in the <i>Financial Times</i>, was the best since 1970.</p>

<p>Is the Chancellor aware that during the course of his speech the Leader of the Opposition looked decidedly chilly? Is that because he has been stealing her clothes? Does the Chancellor agree that this mini-Budget is, perhaps, too much influenced by the presence of the Liberals and that it should have been more adventurous?<br/>
Will my right hon. Friend give a specific answer to the point made earlier in relation to the growth rates for this year and the next financial year when taking account of the proposition, which he put earlier, about the need for a 5 per cent. growth rate to keep unemployment below the 1 million mark over a long period of time?<br/>
Will the Chancellor tell the Treasury that if it wants to increase consumer purchasing power it should keep its nose out of every argument in the so-called free collective bargaining arena? If it must use sanctions, it should use them instead against firms which constantly put up prices to increase profits at a time when there has been massive wage restraint over a two-year period.</p>

<p>I assure my hon. Friend that I am not, never have been and never will be a transvestite. In relation to his last point, I must tell him that the Government are determined to use their influence in the public sector as an employer, and in many cases as paymaster; and in the private sector, where they are free to grant or withhold discretionary assistance to firms, to ensure as far as possible that our guidelines are adhered to. My hon. Friend the Member for Bolsover (Mr. Skinner) will be as happy as everyone else if we are successful in doing this, because if inflation takes off again next year the consequences for all the objectives and principles that he and I hold so dear will be disastrous.</p>

<p>Does the Chancellor realise that in his forthcoming and very welcome visit to North Wales he will be pressed very hard to explain how quickly his measures will have an effect on unemployment, particularly in Clwyd? This county now has the highest level of unemployment in Wales and the third highest in the United Kingdom, but previously its unemployment rate was very low.</p>

<p>Is my right hon. Friend aware that the House understands why he is not making further drawings on the IMF? Will he use his influence as Chairman of the Interim Committee of the IMF to explore whether the resources that are released can be used for the developing countries, which many of us on this

side of the House feel should have high priority? Will he remind Conservatives that, if they are worried about excessive accumulations of reserves, it would be possible to make some repayments to the IMF at an earlier date than planned?</p>

<p>The latter possibility is always in my mind, but I have come to the conclusion that the time for doing so has not yet arrived.<br/>
On the question of the IMF, in certain areas of potential lending the IMF will very much welcome the fact that we are not drawing the November standby and do not plan to withdraw any further tranches. The IMF has been lending very heavily and successfully to developing countries. However, the difficulty is that the higher credit tranches have not so far been used by the developing countries, which find the conditions and requirements of the IMF which are imposed on their use unacceptable. I have persuaded the IMF that to prolong periods of adjustment beyond a single year has enabled the Jamaican Government, for example, to make a successful drawing recently. If the IMF shows more understanding of the circumstances of some of the developing countries, much more use can be made of the facilities which are available.</p>

<p>If public expenditure is to be increased, no doubt the Chancellor will be assailed from many sides in support of special interests.

<p>I do not propose to enter into this matter, which is not my departmental responsibility. However, like all the members of the Cabinet, I am deeply concerned about it and I hope that we can find a solution that is satisfactory to both sides. I must point out that there is enormous regional variation in police recruitment, in wastage and in the nature of the tasks necessary for maintaining law and order. The problems in Manchester, London and Strathclyde, for example, are different in scale and definition from those in country areas. All these matters must be considered.</p>

<p>Is the Chancellor aware that the restoration of 20 per cent. of


the &#x00A3;100 million cut from overseas aid will be welcome as far as it goes? However, many of us feel that it is far too modest.

<p>I agree with my hon. Friend that it is not enough, and I hope that maybe we shall be able to do more on a later occasion. We should all recognise that our very dramatic&#x2014;indeed astonishing, as it was described by Dr. Witteveen&#x2014;improvement has not been accompanied by an improvement in our real economy. The measures that I have announced today will help the improvement in our real economy to get under way. We have a long way to go before we can feel satisfied. That is why we have no intention of giving way to the rather unconvincing demands from the Conservatives for an early General Election.</p>

<p>Will the Chancellor confirm that his mini-Budget represents a transfer of resources away from people with children?

<p>The hon. Member is talking bunkum. The increase in the marriage allowance goes to all families&#x2014;with or without children. It is not in any sense a discrimination against families with children. The hon. Member should know better than to talk that kind of claptrap.</p>

<p>Will the Chancellor tell the House whether, when drawing up his modest reflationary proposals, he took account of the deflationary effect of the fact that throughout the country Conservative-controlled local authorities are under-spending significantly on budgets which themselves were significantly lower than those of last year? This situation has led, for example, to the ludicrous and scandalous situation in Birmingham that half a dozen new nursery schools, which are fully equipped, are not being used because the Tory authority refuses to

finance the staffing of them. Then there is the even more scandalous situation of the new wing of the Selly Oak Hospital, which is fully equipped but is not being used because the local authority will not fund the staffing of the hospital.</p>

<p>The reason why I am not doing so is contained in the admirable words that the first need is to reduce the burden of taxation on modest earnings and to restore a reasonable differential. That is from "The Right Approach" and will be recognised by the Conservatives. I believe that it is right to concentrate on increasing tax thresholds rather than reducing the basic rate.</p>

<p>I recognise that the increases in public expenditure will be welcomed, but does my right hon. Friend agree that they do not go far enough to restore the cuts which have been made or to maintain the standards of health, welfare, education and public transport, which, deplorably, are lower than they should be? In these circumstances will he recognise in future that priority should be given to the provision of more funds in the public sector, which must take precedence over any cuts in the standard rate of income tax?</p>

<p>My hon. Friend will know that public spending has risen very substantially in the last three and a half years, even after all the cuts which the Government have had to impose. Private spending has fallen substantially, largely as a result of the increase in oil prices and its effect on national wealth. I believe that we are right to restore the balance somewhat towards private spending, and that a balance of two for tax cuts and one for public expenditure is right on this occasion.</p>
