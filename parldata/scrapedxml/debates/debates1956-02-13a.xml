<p>The answer to the first part of the Question is "None, Sir." As to the second, I am not aware of any lung hazards due to welding not already covered by the Act which would satisfy the statutory conditions for pre-cription.</p>

<p>As I think the hon. Member appreciates, if fibrosis of the lungs results from the process of welding, a claim can already be put in under the existing law in respect of pneumoconiosis. That is why in my answer I referred, perhaps obliquely, to the fact that risks which welders run are already covered in a number of directions.</p>

<p>Will the right hon.

<p>From the hon. Member's supplementary question, I think he appreciates that certain aspects of cadmium poisoning have been prescribed in accordance with the Answer I gave a few days ago. On the main issue, the matter is being very fully investigated by my right hon. Friend the Minister of Labour and National Service. The hon. Member will appreciate that it is difficult to draw a hard-and-fast line between research for the purposes of prevention and research for the purposes of prescription.</p>

<p>In reply to an earlier Question about increases in the earnings limit from &#x00A3;2 to &#x00A3;2 10s. a week, the right hon.

<p>I think that the hon. Gentleman misunderstood my Answer. I said, with regard to the other Report, that I was considering it. I gave no indication of my views upon it. Therefore, the hon. Gentleman's supplementary question on this Question is, I think, founded on a false hypothesis.</p>

<p>Since the National Insurance Advisory Committee's remit expressly excluded the Committee from considering the level of benefit of the 10s. pension, will the right hon.

<p>As the hon. Gentleman rightly says, the National Insurance Advisory Committee takes the view that the actual level of benefit is outside its terms of reference, but I am sure he knows that paragraphs 55 to 68 of the Report deal with very important aspects of the position of those ladies, which clearly must affect any decision on the rate.</p>

<p>The 10s. widow's pension is paid in respect of insurance under the former Contributory Pensions Acts, and title to it can only arise in respect of widowhood following on a marriage contracted before the repeal of those Acts in July, 1948. Women widowed since that date are eligible for the appropriate widowhood benefits of the new scheme under the conditions of that scheme. The fact that the second


marriage had not lasted ten years would not prevent the payment of widow's allowance or widowed mother's allowance and would prevent the payment of widow's pension only in some cases.</p>

<p>Is the Minister aware that in these cases to which he refers&#x2014;and they amount to quite a number of cases &#x2014;the widows who are twice bereaved are usually elderly, which means that though they have qualified once for pension they are disqualified merely because additional contributions have not been paid and that they are, therefore, being treated abominably?

<p>The hon. Gentleman seems to be under a misapprehension. The pension right in respect of the original marriage is forfeited not by default of contribution but as a result of remarriage, and, therefore, such a widow is in precisely the same position as any other widow under the new scheme.</p>

<p>Can the Minister answer this question? A woman in receipt of pension marries, and then her marriage is annulled. She is not divorced: her marriage is annulled.

<p>In the case of a widow in receipt of a 10s. pension who remarries, the 10s. pension ceases. If her second husband dies before the marriage has lasted ten years there is no pension at all, not even the 10s. pension. Will the Minister put that right?</p>

<p>Under the National Insurance Act, 1946, these pensions will not be issued to anyone who reaches 70 after 30th September, 1961.

<p>Is my right hon. Friend aware that the Prime Minister did not make any reference to these pensions being only of a temporary character?

<p>I know my hon. Friend's views.

<p>On the assumptions of rapid and continuous economic growth and continued progress in fuel efficiency, inland fuel requirements in 1965 might exceed 300 million tons of coal equivalent a year, of which half might be needed by industry and a quarter by households.<br/>
I am in no position to estimate with any accuracy coal output in 1965, but I would hope that at least 75 per cent. of these requirements would come from home-produced coal and 3 per cent. from nuclear power and hydro-electricity.

<p>With permission, I will circulate a table in the OFFICIAL REPORT. But I would ask my hon. Friend when she studies the table to bear in mind that no valid conclusions can be drawn from a simple comparison of capital expenditure and output per man in any particular year, for much of the expenditure is on projects that take time to complete and can show results only after some years.</p>

Is he aware that this is a very serious matter, and that the trouble has been caused as a direct result of the strain to which these mental nurses have been exposed for many years? When the Minister goes to the North, will he not only go to mental deficiency hospitals, but realise that although mental deficiency hospitals have difficulties, they are not commensurate with those experienced in the mental hospitals? Will he assure the House that he will go to mental hospitals as well?</p>

<p>There is no question of treating this matter lightly. I said last week that I regarded it as of deep concern. I have said today that I have studied the matter with care. As the right hon.

We do not know how much was actually paid for these articles when they were purchased early in the war, but it was almost certainly less than the present replacement prices of 1s. 8d. and 1s. 2d., respectively.

<p>Yes, Sir. I have certain comments to make on the appearance of these two men and their Press conference. First, it brings out into clear relief the consistent lack of candour of the Soviet authorities in their statements about these men. In addition to what had appeared in the Soviet Press, suggesting that the whole story was Western anti-Soviet propaganda, in October of last year before the debate in the House about the two men, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer asked Mr. Molotov in Geneva for information about them. Mr. Molotov said that he was quite unable to provide any.<br/>
As recently as 12th January, when the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Huyton (Mr. H. Wilson) saw Mr. Khrushchev, he put the same question. Mr. Khrushchev was reported to have replied, "Are they in our country, then? I have not heard anything of them from any Soviet officials, nor have I ever met them, so it stands to reason I cannot know what they are doing."<br/>
The House must form its own opinion about the veracity of those statements in view of this latest development. This kind of conduct shows how difficult it is to establish the relations of mutual trust which the Soviet Union profess so much to desire.<br/>
The second comment I have to make is with regard to the contents of the statement itself. The House will have noted that it is designed to be used for propaganda purposes and that the two men were not permitted to answer any questions. In fact, no credence can be placed in their word. There is nothing in the statement which causes me to modify that view.<br/>
My third comment is that there has been a certain amount of speculation as to the reasons which have led the Soviet Government to change their ground and to announce, through this interview, the presence of these men in Moscow. One view is that it was to forestall awkward questions during the visit of the Soviet leaders to this country and to clear the air. That may be so.<br/>
Another view is that after the visit of my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister and myself to Washington, and the close accord we reached with the United States Government on so many matters, the Soviet authorities wished to create distrust and to drive a wedge. If this is the explanation, they will not succeed.</p>

<p>May I ask the right hon. and learned Gentleman whether there was anything to prevent the resignation from the Foreign Service of these two persons and their conducting propaganda on the lines of their opinions in our own country? May I also ask him whether it is not a fact that during the war, and since, all British Governments have sought the most friendly relations with the Soviet Union in the cause of peace? Finally, may I ask whether there is now any evidence that these two men were agents acting on behalf of a foreign Power or the Communist Party?</p>

<p>It is a fact that there is nothing to prevent anyone in the Foreign Service from resigning and conducting such propaganda in this country. In reply to the right hon. Gentleman s second question, the answer is definitely that, in my view, all Governments since the war have sought most genuinely to seek improved relations with the Soviet Union.<br/>
As to whether there is any evidence that these men were Soviet agents, suspicion of the person responsible for a known leakage of information to the Soviet authorities was, as was stated in the White Paper, narrowed down to Maclean before he departed. This was confirmed by his departure and, subsequently, by what Petrov has said. No suspicion attached to Burgess before his departure, but strong suspicion fell on him when he departed, and that, also, has been confirmed by what Petrov has said.</p>

<p>Would my right hon. and learned Friend agree that, if their


statements are correct, it is disquieting that two men, who confessed that while they were at Cambridge they were members of the Communist Party, should both subsequently be employed in the Foreign Service and that one of them should be employed in the B.B.C. and the Secret Service?

<p>I do not accept what my hon. Friend said about the employment of these men. The employment of Burgess is described in the White Paper.

<p>With your permission, Mr. Speaker, and that of the House, I should like to report on the discussions which I and my right hon. and learned Friend the Foreign Secretary have held recently in Washington and in Ottawa.<br/>
The House will recall the situation at the time when these visits were arranged last autumn. The Geneva Conference of Foreign Ministers had disappointed hopes that some at least of the problems facing us might have been solved in the spirit of the July meetings. However, the Soviet Government had made it clear at the October meeting that it had no intention of allowing the German people as a whole to decide their future by free elections.<br/>
More surprising was the fact that the Soviets refused to lower the artificial barriers which still prevent the free flow of visitors and ideas between the countries of the Western world and the Soviet <i>bloc.</i> In the Middle East, we were faced with intervention by the Soviet Government in the shape of the Czechoslovak-Egyptian arms deal.<br/>
In these circumstances, it seemed timely to the President of the United States and myself that we should meet to discuss the world situation together. I was, therefore, very glad that the President's recovery enabled him to invite my right hon. and learned Friend the Foreign Secretary and myself to be his guests in Washington. I will now make some detailed points on the discussions.<br/>
As regards Europe, we are in complete agreement that Germany, whose division is the main cause of the present tension, should be given the opportunity to reunite in freedom. We reaffirmed our obligations towards Berlin. We were in agreement on the principle of support costs and the equal sharing of the burden of defence between Allies. Discussions are proceeding on this subject with the


Federal German Government. We discussed various projects for closer association in Western Europe, and I indicated our desire to press ahead, in particular, with the arms control programme within the Western European Union.<br/>
The Middle East was our chief cause of concern. Within that area the dispute between Israel and her Arab neighbours comes first in difficulty and urgency. Obviously, efforts towards reaching a settlement between the parties must be pursued in secrecy. But the House can be sure that they will also be prosecuted in unison by the United States Government and ourselves.<br/>
Of course, any settlement must involve some compromise, but there is nothing dishonourable about a compromise. We and the United States Government, as we have repeatedly stated, are also ready to help financially and to guarantee agreed frontiers.<br/>
Meanwhile, we must continue to try to reduce tension in the area. Doubt about action by the Powers concerned under the Tripartite Declaration can itself be a cause of tension. We discussed this and found ourselves in complete agreement as to our obligations under this Declaration. We decided to invite the French Government to join with us in considering how to carry them out should the need arise. The French Government have accepted our invitation and the three Governments are now examining together the nature of the action they might have to take.<br/>
The second method of reducing tension is to increase the strength of General Burns's organisation. Here, our intention has always been to work through the United Nations organisation. Both the United States and ourselves will be ready to support any recommendations to this end by General Burns and the Secretary-General of the United Nations.<br/>
We discussed the situation in Arabia and the Persian Gulf. My right hon. and learned Friend and I made clear that in the matter of Buraimi, Her Majesty's Government, acting for the Sultan of Muscat and Oman and the Ruler of Abu Dhabi, could not return to arbitration after their experience of Saudi Arabian behaviour. We should, however, be glad to restore friendly

relations with the Government of Saudi Arabia, and are ready to enter into direct negotiations with them for this purpose.<br/>
We also discussed the general economic situation in the Middle East. The United States Government reaffirmed their solid support for the Bagdad Pact. The reports that we were at odds with the Americans on this issue have no foundation in fact, like many others. We are both agreed that the Pact can be used most helpfully for the benefit of the populations of the member countries.<br/>
We reaffirmed our support of S.E.A.T.O. In the Far East, as elsewhere, our aims are to deter aggression, whether by force or by subversion, and to enable the countries of the area to develop in security and peace. There have been and are certain differences between us about Far Eastern policy. We discussed these together. We have not receded from our position, nor, it is fair to say, have the United States Government modified theirs.<br/>
However, as to the trade issue, the control of trade in strategic materials with China will now be reviewed. We hope that proposals to this end will be brought before the China Committee of the Paris Consultative Group in due course. It was decided that, in examining the scope of each control, the test should be the extent to which it serves the interests of the free world.<br/>
In the nuclear field, the House may recall that certain Agreements were concluded between our two Governments last June. We are both well satisfied with the way the exchange of information is now working under those Agreements and with the results which they are giving to us.<br/>
We also discussed the question of the possible regulation or limitation of nuclear weapon tests. As regards the effect of tests, the House will perhaps recall that a special Committee appointed by the Medical Research Council is still examining whether these give rise to any appreciable hazard. A similar examination is taking place in the United States. But I am bound to report that Her Majesty's Government and the United States Government at present share the conviction that the radiation dose to human beings arising from the testing of megaton weapons at the present rate is


insignificant compared with the radiation dose received from natural causes.<br/>
Finally, as regards the Washington talks, I want to report to the House with the greatest pleasure how much my right hon. and learned Friend and I were impressed by the renewed vigour and enduring friendship of the President of the United States.<br/>
At Ottawa, we were able to report on all these discussions to the Canadian Government. The Prime Minister, M. St. Laurent, expressed publicly his pleasure at their successful outcome. Intimate talks between two nations of the Commonwealth require no communique and no commentary. We went item by item with the Canadian Ministers through the results of our Washington discussions, and we were in complete accord. We also discussed matters of direct Anglo-Canadian interest, including the most helpful part which Canada is playing on the Commissions in South-East Asia. We spoke of trade and of the forthcoming meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers.<br/>
I have not yet referred to the Declaration signed by the President and myself. This is a restatement of principles which have been affirmed many times in this House, and from both sides of it. We do not contend that there is anything novel about it. No, Sir, but- it must be remembered that it will not only be read in the sophisticated and news-hungry West, but that it is designed also to bring comfort and hope to people in many other areas of the world. The reptition of Anglo-American agreement is better than banner headlines about discord between us.</p>

I would, ask him, first, whether the Government will find time for a debate on foreign affairs at the earliest possible moment? Meanwhile, I should like to put three questions to the right hon. Gentleman. The first concerns his remarks on the agreement between ourselves and the United States on the principle of support costs and the equal sharing of the burden of defence between Allies.<br/>
Will the Prime Minister be kind enough to explain a little more fully what those phrases mean? Does he mean, by "equal sharing of the burden," that each country should be devoting the same proportion of its national income to defence, or that a higher proportion should be devoted to defence by the wealthier countries? What precisely has he in mind in relation to the Federal Government of Germany? Is it not a fact&#x2014;we are told so by the newspapers, at any rate&#x2014;that the Federal Government do not seem to have accepted this principle at all? In that connection, will he say whether we are discussing jointly with the United States this question of the Federal Government? Are the negotiations bilateral, or taking
place in N.A.T.O.? In what form are they taking place?<br/>
The second matter upon which I want to press the Prime Minister relates to his remarks about the Tripartite Declaration. I cannot but feel that when he said that "doubt about action by the Powers concerned &#x2026; can itself be a cause of tension" he did not fully apply that principle in making this statement. Why did he say that we are ready to help to guarantee agreed frontiers? Does that in any way diminish our obligation under the Tripartite Declaration to go to the assistance of any country attacked across the present frontiers? The right hon. Gentleman stated that we were in agreement with the United States about our obligations. Can he tell us exactly what was agreed between the United States and ourselves upon this subject?<br/>
Thirdly, in view of the Prime Minister's earlier statements that the Tripartite Declaration involved the principle of maintaining the balance of arms, was that subject discussed at Washington and, if so, what conclusions were reached between ourselves and the United States?</p>

<p>First, with regard to support costs, no new principle was enunciated, nor have I enunciated one in anything that I have said this afternoon. Ever since N.A.T.O. existed it has always been an accepted practice between us&#x2014;if not a principle&#x2014;to share the burdens together. The right hon. Gentleman is quite correct about the Federal Government of Germany. Discussions are proceeding, and are being carried on upon a quadrupartite basis, that is to say, the three Western Powers&#x2014;the United States,


France and ourselves&#x2014;are discussing the matter with the Federal German Government. It is in that connection that I referred to the matter.<br/>
With regard to the Middle East, the right hon. Gentleman asked, first, whether anything I said was intended to withdraw from our obligations under the 1950 Agreement. Certainly not; the obligations of the 1950 Agreement include armistice lines. What I am referring to are agreed frontiers which might be reached at the conclusion of a settlement. Meanwhile, until a settlement is concluded, we remain bound by the 1950 Declaration.<br/>
Finally, on the question whether we could have made the position clearer in order to reduce tension, in relation to the action we could take, the right hon. Gentleman and the House will know that constitutional practices are not the same in all countries. Quite frankly, those practices being what they are, I do not think that we could have got the Declaration any clearer than it was.<br/>
I have no further statement to make at present about the balance of armaments.</p>

<p>As it is obvious that there must be a debate relating to these matters, can the Prime Minister say, for the convenience of hon. Members, whether a White Paper will be issued containing the joint Declaration and, at the same time&#x2014;as they will be relevant &#x2014;copies of the letters from Russia to the President of the United States, and the President's replies?

<p>I should be quite ready to do so, and the White Paper might include one or two other documents. As regards the exchanges which have taken place between the United

<p>I should like the right hon. Gentleman to elucidate one point upon which some misapprehension may exist. He appeared to say that the three Governments who are signatories to the Tripartite Declaration were about to proceed to examine the situation. Does that mean that they propose to examine the situation in order to decide what they ought to do, in terms of the Declaration, in the event of aggression by any Middle Eastern country&#x2014;or that they propose to take positive action in order to prevent any aggression taking place? At the same time, will the right hon. Gentleman say whether, in his discussions with President Eisenhower, the question arose of the provision of arms to Arab countries and, in particular, why it is that while arms are being supplied to Egypt and other Arab countries there is a refusal to supply arms to Israel?</p>

<p>The words were rather carefully chosen. As I explained to the right hon. Gentleman&#x2014;and I am sure he knows this&#x2014;constitutional processes in our country and in the United States are different in respect of some of these matters. That is why the words were carefully chosen. The sentence reads:
<q>Accordingly, we have made arrangements for joint discussions as to the nature of the action which we should take in such an event.</q>
In view of the constitutional position, that is about as definite as any statement can be.</p>

<p>No, Sir. I am obliged to the right hon. Gentleman. Preventive action at present is being undertaken by the United Nations&#x2014;the police action, if one likes to call it that, and the action of observers, and so on.

<p>I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.<br/>
This is a Bill of 53 Clauses and deals with a wide variety of subjects, the only connecting link between them being that each one deals with the administration of justice. I hope that I shall not weary the House by going into too much detail, but I feel that I should indicate the main changes proposed by the Clauses.<br/>
As the House will see, the first part of the Bill deals with Admiralty jurisdiction and other provisions as to ships. Despite its title, it does not trespass on the province of my noble Friend the First Lord of the Admiralty. That part of the Bill really has three objects. The first is to bring our law into line with a convention relating to the arrest of sea-going ships which has been signed on behalf of Her Majesty's Government. The second is to bring our law into line with a convention concerning civil jurisdiction in matters of collision, signed also on behalf of Her Majesty's Government. The third is to state the law relating to the Admiralty jurisdiction of the court in a convenient and up-to-date form.<br/>
In 1952, an International Conference on Maritime Law was held at the instance of the Belgian Government. We sent a strong delegation, headed by Mr. Justice Pilcher. That conference led to the two conventions to which I have referred. An implementation of those conventions will lead to a greater uniformity of practice in different countries in relation to the matters dealt with by those conventions. I may say that the conventions are supported by the shipping interests of this country, who consider that our shipping industry will benefit from them.<br/>
Most of the other States which are
parties to the convention exercise jurisdiction to arrest ships in circumstances in which no arrest would be made in this country. To ratify the convention relating to the arrest of ships, those countries will have to reduce the number of cases in which arrest is at present possible. We, on the other hand, in


order to be in a position to ratify these conventions, have to extend in some respects our law relating to the arrest of ships and to make some minor changes in the law governing jurisdiction in collision cases.<br/>
I do not think that the House will wish me to detail the changes involved in our law. I can say that the Bill fully implements the requirements of the conventions, but there is perhaps one change which I should mention. That change relates to the power to arrest a sister ship in certain actions against an owner or charterer if the sister ship is beneficially owned by the same owner or charterer as the ship in respect of which the claim arises. This, though not known to English law, is a concept well known in Scotland and on the Continent, and this change in our law will enable a foreign claimant to bring his action against the ship here instead of abroad, and that may help British owners.<br/>
I think that the real advantage of implementing these conventions lies in the measure of uniformity of practice in the countries of the contracting parties that will result. To be able to ratify the convention relating to collisions, we have to restrict in some degree the existing jurisdiction of our courts. The general effect of Clause 4 is to restrict jurisdiction <i>in personam</i> in cases of collision to cases where the defendant has his habitual residence or place of business in England or Wales, or the cause of action arose in England or Wales, within inland waters or a port, or the court has already heard or is hearing an action arising out of the same incident.<br/>
The House will, I hope, agree that the third object of this part of the Bill is satisfactorily achieved. Clause 1 defines the Admiralty jurisdiction of the High Court, Clause 2 of the inferior courts, and Clauses 3 and 4 relate to the manner of its exercise. The provisions of this part
of the Bill have been carefully considered by the President of the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division and Mr. Justice Willmer. They are satisfied that these provisions will enable us to give effect to the two conventions and also that the law as to the jurisdiction of our courts in Admiralty and the manner of its exercise has been well stated.<br/>
Part V of the Bill is designed to bring the law of Scotland into line with the conventions, and I hope that the House will not expect me to say any more about that part.<br/>
I now turn to Part II, which deals with a variety of matters. Clause 10 deals with the appointment and tenure of office of official referees. They were first created in 1873, and since then their functions have greatly increased. They deal with a wide variety of matters, particularly the trial of issues involving a mass of detail and often involving very large sums of money. They really function as assistant judges of the High Court and their status as such should be recognised. This Clause provides that they should be appointed by Her Majesty as our recorders and stipendiary magistrates on the recommendation of the Lord Chancellor, that they should take the oath of allegiance and the judicial oath and that their tenure of office should be certain, not determinable by the Lord Chancellor.<br/>
Clause 11 widens the field of recruitment to various offices. Oddly enough, though a county court judge can be appointed a judge of the High Court, he cannot at present be appointed an official referee. This Clause remedies that and also one or two similar anomalies.<br/>
Clause 12 makes it easier to appoint deputy district registrars of the High Court in case of illness or the unavoidable absence from duty of the district registrar. The present procedure in relation to that is rather cumbrous.<br/>
Clauses 13 and 14 are designed to facilitate the work of the district registrar of the High Court. Under existing laws pressure
of work can only be alleviated by the appointment of a joint registrar or the opening of a new registry. That is often not necessary. This power to appoint assistant district registrars which will be given by these Clauses is not expected to involve any increase of staff, for usually district registrars and county court registrars are the same people. There are more county court registrars than district registrars, and it is proposed to ask county court registrars also to act as assistant district registrars. Clause 14 will also enable one district registrar to help another in time of emergency.<br/>
Clause 16 is an important Clause which has two objects. The first is to clarify


the present position. The law as to the jurisdiction of official referees, masters and other officers and as to appeals from them is scattered indiscriminately over statutes and rules, and it should be one or the other, either in statutes or in rules. Practitioners are accustomed to look at rules. Procedural provisions are in modern practice usually left to rules of court, and rules of court have a greater degree of flexibility. They can be changed more easily if the situation requires it. This Clause gives wide rule-making power and repeals the statutory provisions so that rules can replace those statutory provisions.<br/>
The second object of this Clause is that it will enable certain recommendations of the Committee on the Practice and Procedure of the Supreme Court, which all the lawyers refer to as the Evershed Committee, to be carried into effect&#x2014;namely, their recommendations that the range of matters which may be referred to the official referee should be increased, that a right of appeal on fact should be given from an official referee's decision, that official referees should be given power to commit or to attach for disobedience to an order, and that appeals from certain decisions of masters and others should go direct to the Court of Appeal.<br/>
Clause 17 deals with a distinct and separate matter. It repeals two old Acts and a number of sections of the Debtors Act, 1869. These provisions in these old Acts and in the Debtors Act are entirely obsolete.
Warrants of attorney were abused by
Debtors to defraud their creditors,
and such warrants and cognovits by creditors to oppress their debtors. These two old Acts and these provisions of the Debtors Act were intended to prevent abuse of these legal instruments. They are no longer of any value. These statutory provisions require registers to be kept. Since 1886 no warrant of attorney has been filed, and only one cognovit.<br/>
I now turn to Part III of the Bill. Clause 21 makes similar provision in relation to the appointment of county court judges as Clause 10 does in relation to official referees. They will be appointed by Her Majesty and required to take the oath of allegiance and the judicial oath. It really is anomalous that county court judges should not do so, despite their much increased status and jurisdiction,

when they have to do so if they sit as justices of peace of quarter sessions.<br/>
Clauses 22 and 23 are intended to enable temporary congestion in the county courts to be alleviated. Odd though it may seem, a deputy judge can now only be appointed in the event of illness or the unavoidable absence of the judge. This means that on a county circuit where there is only one judge it is not possible to secure that he and his deputy can sit at the same time at the same court to dispose of a heavy list. Clause 22 seeks to overcome this difficulty.<br/>
It is not, of course, intended to make a practice of appointing temporary judges to do the work which could properly be done by a permanent judge. These two Clauses carry out recommendations of the Committee on County Court Practice and Procedure, which, again, we lawyers commonly refer to as the Austin Jones Committee.<br/>
I do not think I need say much about Clauses 24 and 25. They make useful changes with regard to county court registrars and their assistants.<br/>
Clause 27 is the next Clause of major importance on which I should say a little. It deals with a distinct and separate subject. The Austin Jones Committee described the ineffectiveness of the present machinery for compelling a judgment debtor to attend the hearing of a judgment summons for examination as to his means. The only sanction at present, if the judgment debtor does not appear to answer a judgment summons, is to fine him and so add to his debts.<br/>
If he does not pay the fine for non-attendance he cannot be committed to prison unless the court has made inquiry as to his means in his presence. The judgment summons requires him to attend personally. If he does not attend, he is fined, and so long as he does not attend the court and so long as he can consequently avoid an inquiry as to his means in his presence, in practice nothing further can happen to him. Thus the authority of the county court can be flouted with impunity.<br/>
The Clause proposes to remedy this in the following way: if the debtor fails to attend on the day fixed for the hearing of the judgment summons, the hearing can be adjourned and the debtor ordered to attend on the adjourned date. If he fails to attend then he can be sent to prison


for a maximum of 14 days. I should like to make this clear beyond all shadow of doubt: that will not be imprisonment for debt but imprisonment, if he is sent to prison, for disobedience of the court order requiring his attendance.<br/>
Clauses 28 and 29 carry out minor recommendations of the Austin Jones Committee.<br/>
Now I come to Part IV. The Evershed Committee recommended that the writ of elegit should be abolished. They found it a cumbersome anachronism. It involves an inquiry by a sheriffs jury as to the land the debtor possesses. There was some point in this process originally because a jury of local men would know what lands the debtor possessed. Nowadays that is by no means the case, and usually the jury is completely mystified by this procedure. Clauses 34 to 36 therefore abolish the writ of elegit and provide machinery in its place for enforcing a judgment as a charge on land and by the appointment of a receiver.<br/>
Clause 37, again, deals with a distinct subject. The clothes and bedding of the debtor and his family and the tools of his trade to the value of &#x00A3;5 are exempt from seizure under a warrant of execution. This amount of &#x00A3;5 was fixed in 1846. The Austin Jones Committee recommended in 1949 that it should be raised to &#x00A3;15. This Clause raises the exemption to &#x00A3;20, with power to the Lord Chancellor to prescribe a higher limit.<br/>
Clause 38 carries out the Evershed Committee's recommendation that deposit accounts at an ordinary bank should be attachable to satisfy judgments or orders made against the debtor. Clause 39 provides that judgments of the High Court should be enforceable by execution in the county court. This is another of the Evershed Committee's recommendations directed to the saving of costs.<br/>
I have now, I hope, summarised the main provisions of the Bill which deals, as the House will see, with a wide variety of subjects not closely related. The House will see that the Bill, although miscellaneous in its provisions, has three main objects. The first is to enable us to ratify the two coventions to which I have referred, and to do that we have to alter the Admiralty jurisdiction of our courts. The second is to make changes with regard to official referees and county court

judges and to recognise their present status. The third is to make a number of changes in the law relating to the High Court and county courts and in so doing to enable a number of recommendations of the Evershed Committee and the Austin Jones Committee to be carried into effect.<br/>
I should like to conclude by expressing our thanks to the members of those committees for the hard work which they did and for the valuable reports which they have presented.</p>

<p>We are very much obliged to the Attorney-General for his clear exposition of this bundle of miscellaneous items. This is, of course, essentially a Committee Bill rather than a Second Reading Bill. The Attorney-General has expounded the Bill and it is not part of my function to do so, but I will state briefly what is the attitude of the Opposition towards it.<br/>
The Bill has already had the advantage of consideration in another place, but when we reach the Committee stage we shall want appreciably fuller and more detailed explanations of at least some of the Clauses, although I do not necessarily say that we shall oppose them. As a whole it is obviously a beneficial Bill, and we welcome it. As a party we are in favour of international conventions and of international understanding, and, of course, we are in favour of the extension of international arrangements, particularly in such an obviously international field as maritime law. We certainly support the proposals in the Bill for giving effect to the maritime conventions which have been entered into.<br/>
The second series of reforms in the Bill affect official referees and county court judges, and anybody acquainted with the work of official referees and county court judges will subscribe immediately to the proposal for recognising the status which they hold in the profession. Those proposals will certainly commend themselves to us.<br/>
In addition, there are a number of minor reforms affecting official referees and county courts in general, as well as the High Court. They are tidying up reforms of a technical nature which may


require a little examination in Committee, but which obviously require no development on Second Reading.<br/>
I should like to join the Attorney-General in associating myself with the tributes paid to the Evershed Committee and the Austin Jones Committee. They spent a great deal of time doing very arduous work of a detailed nature on the High Court and the county courts and we on this side of the House are very glad that certain of their proposals have found their way into the Bill.<br/>
There is one matter about which I personally have a little misgiving, and perhaps I should mention it now. It concerns the proposal in Clause 27, which I recognize
was recommended by the Austin Jones Committee. It concerns the imposition of imprisonment in connection with a judgment summons where a judgment debtor fails to attend for examination on a judgment. It has been a principle of the law of this country for a long time that nobody shall be imprisoned for debt.<br/>
Let me say at once that I fully appreciate the point which the Attorney-General made&#x2014;that this is not imprisonment for debt; it may be regarded as imprisonment in the nature of imprisonment for contempt of court. But what it means&#x2014;and this is the troublesome part -&#x2014;is that a procedure the sole purpose of which is to be ancillary to securing the payment of a debt will be enforceable by imprisonment when the debt itself, the major matter, will not and cannot be the subject of imprisonment. I appreciate the Attorney-General's argument, and, of course, one treats with great respect proposals made by the Austin Jones Committee and the Law Officers, but this is a troublesome aspect and one which we shall want to probe further in Committee.<br/>
Taking the Bill as a whole, it is obviously beneficial and we welcome its Second Reading.</p>

I think that it is three-and-a-half years since a Scottish Bill of this length went through Committee and Report stages and reached its Third Reading with so few words being said by Scottish Members. The only reason that I think it fit to state why this Bill has gone through so smoothly is that it is obviously a Bill which is welcomed on both sides of the House.

<p>I beg to move,
<q>That the Draft Local Authorities (Stock) Regulations, 1955, a copy of which was laid before this House on 22nd November, be approved.</q>
There are two simple purposes which lie behind these Regulations. The first is this. As the principal Regulations now stand, it is necessary for the Minister of Housing and Local Government to give his consent to the raising of stock by a local authority in the form of a Ministerial Order. That Ministerial Order is not one of those which is laid before this House. It affords no Parliamentary control and it has proved to be an administrative inconvenience as compared with the alternative method of a consent letter, because it delays consent and involves unnecessary administrative formalities.<br/>
The second purpose of the Regulations, which will be found dealt with in Regulation 4 (2), is to bring the procedure of the sinking fund for the redemption of stock into accordance with the sinking fund accumulated for the purpose of paying off mortgages. At the moment, the rate of accumulation of interest on sinking funds for paying off mortgages is to be at a rate not exceeding that determined from time to time by the Minister, so there is prescribed by that procedure a maximum rate of interest. At present, the Minister's prescription of the rate, not a maximum rate but an absolute rate, at which interest is to accumulate on sinking funds for paying off stock, is unconnected with that of sinking funds for paying off mortgages.<br/>
It is clearly convenient that the rate of accumulation in both cases should be the same, that in both cases it should be the maximum, so that the Minister can make an exception where the rate of interest or the investments of a local authority justifies it, and that any changes in the rates of interest should come into force simultaneously. If these Regulations are made, the new rate of interest will apply both for mortgages sinking funds and for stock sinking funds from 1st April next and will be at a rate of 3&#x00BD; per cent.</p>

<p>About three months ago my hon. Friend the Member for Erith and Crayford (Mr. Dodds) raised on an Adjournment debate the economic plight of Gibraltar. I want to deal this afternoon with one of the main reasons, perhaps the only reason, lying behind the economic plight of Gibraltar&#x2014;reasons to which my hon. Friend alluded briefly in the course of his speech on 31st October. It is for that reason that I asked that this Adjournment debate should be answered by the Foreign Office today, and I congratulate the noble Lord on being already in his place at this exceptionally early hour for an Adjournment debate.<br/>
To appreciate what is going on in Gibraltar it is necessary to understand the position as it used to be before the announcement of Her Majesty's proposed visit to Gibraltar about two years ago, when all these things which I am about to describe started.<br/>
Owing to its peculiar geographical position and its special economic needs, Gibraltar has for a long time been dependent upon Spanish good will&#x2014; perhaps a better phrase would be "give and take&#x2014;for its economic viability, because the economy of Gibraltar hinges very largely on its dockyard, which needs many more unskilled and semi-skilled workers than are available within Gibraltar itself.<br/>
For many years there has been a system of workers' passes which used to be freely given to enable large numbers of Spanish workers to cross the frontier daily at La Linea to work during the day in the dockyard and to return to their homes in Spain in the evening. This system, oddly enough, continued to operate even during the last war, as I know from my own experience, because I spent some weeks in Gibraltar during the war. I would remind the House that it was a war in which Spain was officially neutral, although some cynics described her position as one of neutrality on Hitler's side.<br/>
I remember an occasion when three or four British ships were blown up and sunk during one night by human torpedoes and limpet mines which were dispatched from neutral Algeciras which is across the bay from Gibraltar. They were propelled by
Italians who took off from Spanish soil. Yet, even during that atmosphere, this system of workers' passes in Gibraltar dockyard continued, which indicates that it was of some value to the Spaniards as well as to us in Gibraltar.<br/>
I used to see a long line of workers going back across the frontier in the evening, each being given a loaf of bread as a kind of bonus, and, no doubt, as a special inducement to them to work in the dockyard, because without the bread their families in Spain would have been very nearly on the starvation level. It was a system of give and take from the Spanish point of view, largely because of Spain's chronic inability to provide adequate employment for her nationals in the

area around Gibraltar. It helped us and it helped Spain.<br/>
What happens today? Fewer workers' passes are being issued, and I should like to ask the noble Lord what is the precise position today. It is not very clear to me whether any new passes are being issued or whether merely the present number is being steadily and deliberately diminished by the Spanish authorities.<br/>
The Spanish workers are no longer able to take any goods out of Gibraltar, as they used to do, because they know from experience that such goods will be confiscated at the frontier by the Spanish customs authorities. They are, in addition, forced to change part of their pay&#x2014; I think the greater part of it&#x2014;which they receive in sterling in Gibraltar, at the frontier into pesetas at the official rate of exchange. This, incidentally, is much less favourable to them than the rate which they can obtain at any tobacconist's shop in Gibraltar, because I understand that all tobacconists in Gibraltar are also unofficial <i>bureaux de change.</i> There have recently been cases where Spanish workers have been told to change into pesetas more money than they actually earned in sterling in Gibraltar, and when they protested they were told that they must go back and ask their British employers to pay them more in &#x00A3; sterling per week. That ties up also with the fact that Spanish labour associations, which are not trade unions in any sense in which we understand those words in this country, are systematically trying to stir up industrial unrest in the dockyard in Gibraltar and elsewhere. So much for the new attitude of the Spanish authorities towards Spanish workers going into Gibraltar.<br/>
I would now like to say a word about their attitude to British subjects. Let us first take the Gibraltarians themselves, many of whom have lived for a long time, not actually in Gibraltar, but in what is known as the Campo area just over the frontier in Spain. Again, they used to have no difficulty in crossing the frontier, but today they are allowed to enter Gibraltar only for a very special reason&#x2014;perhaps to see a doctor or dentist, or something like that. Young men who have finished their schooling in Gibraltar and gone to live with their families in the Campo area are refused workers' passes to work in Gibraltar.<br/>
So many restrictions and difficulties have been placed in the way of Gibraltarians living on the Rock itself who want to enter Spain, that many of them have given up even trying to cross the frontier. This is a bad thing for Spanish shopkeepers also, because many people used to go over and buy goods in Spain and bring them back into Gibraltar. Nevertheless, the Spanish authorities are apparently prepared to cut off their nose to spite their face.<br/>
I should like to give one illustration of what is going on. A Gibraltarian decided recently that he would like to go shooting in Spain. He made inquiries and discovered that arrangements existed whereby foreigners could take sporting guns into Spain. So with his gun over his shoulder, he went to the frontier, where he was promptly turned
back by the Spanish guards. He said, I thought there was an arrangement for foreigners to take guns in." The frontier guard said, "But you are not a foreigner." The man answered, "Are you saying that I am Spanish?" The guard replied, "No, certainly not." So the man said:" I am a foreigner&#x2014;I must be. As a matter of fact, I am British. Here is my British passport." The frontier guard said," No, you are not British." At that, the man exploded and the frontier guard said," I am sorry, but that is what I am told to say. You are not British, you are not a foreigner&#x2014;you are a Gibraltarian."
Another restriction has been placed upon British troops in Gibraltar, and I understand that no troops under the rank of sergeant are allowed to cross the frontier. The ostensible reason for this, I understand, is to protect Spanish womanhood in La Linea and elsewhere.<br/>
Possibly of less serious effect from an economic point of view is the treatment which the Spanish authorities are meting
out to British subjects living in Spain in and around Gibraltar. This amounts to a sustained campaign of pin-pricking and humiliation. For more than a century, many British people have been resident in this part of Spain, many of them&#x2014;perhaps most of them&#x2014;earning their living in Gibraltar daily and going back to their homes at night. Until two years ago, they were allowed to move perfectly freely, to cross just as they liked and as often as they liked.<br/>
Now, these British residents in Spain fall, as far as I can gather, into three categories. The first category consists

probably of less than twenty individuals, most of them officials, who have white passes, which permit them to move freely, just as everybody used to be able to do before these restrictions were introduced. Secondly, there are some British subjects who cannot get an exit visa at all and who are consequently prohibited altogether from going to Gibraltar. Thirdly, there is the category&#x2014;perhaps the largest &#x2014;of those who are able to obtain exit and entry visas from a Spanish consulate, but with a maximum of three entrances in every three months.<br/>
As part of this campaign, however, the Spaniards closed down their vice-consulate in Gibraltar some years ago. Of course, they have no consulate in Spain itself and, therefore, these British residents, in order to get a renewal or extension of their three months' permit, have to go across to Africa and get a renewal from the Spanish consul in Tangier, for that is the nearest consulate. A friend of mine who was over there
wanted to take his child into Gibraltar to see the doctor. He had used up the three entrances that were permitted him in the quarter, and he had to go over to Tangier in order to get into Gibraltar.<br/>
One could go on indefinitely with this long list of irritations. As far as British subjects are concerned, it may well be that taken individually the irritations may be considered trivial, but they add up to a campaign of deliberate humiliation on the part of the Spanish authorities and the Spanish Government.<br/>
I should like to give just two more examples of what is going on. I am not an expert on football, but I understand that Spain and Gibraltar are both very keen indeed about soccer but no Spanish soccer team is allowed to go into Gibraltar to play. Some little time ago Sir Stanley Rous, the Secretary of the Football Association, interceded with his opposite number in Madrid about this and was told that nothing could be done because the instruction came direct from the Spanish Government itself.<br/>
Lastly, there are the arrangements about motor cars. There have been various arrangements over recent years, but the most recent one was called the Lilli Imossi Agreement, which permitted British people working in Gibraltar but living in Spain to have their cars


registered in Gibraltar, provided that they were guaranteed by the Gibraltar Chamber of Commerce. This agreement has been cancelled and the people have been told that the alternative is that they can have their cars registered in Spain; but this involves an enormous duty&#x2014;I believe, something like 300 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> duty&#x2014;and a permit to buy the car, which is normally refused.<br/>
I should like to ask the noble Lord why, in his view, the Spanish Government is behaving like this and what it all amounts to. Trivial as many of these complaints in themselves are, together they constitute a war of nerves and a conscious attempt on the part of the Government of Spain to impose, at any rate, a partial blockade on Gibraltar and to strangle her economically. Let us make no mistake about it, that is certainly what the people of Gibraltar think; and that is what the Spanish Press and radio say, for they have stated quite openly that the Spanish Government in the very near future will place Gibraltar in such an impossible position that Britain will have no alternative but to surrender Gibraltar to Spain. That is their avowed aim.<br/>
But there is nothing at all new in Spain's desire to get Gibraltar back. What is interesting is why this campaign should have started up about two years ago and why it has been steadily intensified since then. Here we come to the rather curious role in all this of our allies in the United States. For the last two or three years, as the House knows, the United States has been pouring millions of dollars into Spain, bolstering up her economy and, incidentally, bolstering up a regime as undemocratic as any regime on the other side of the Iron Curtain.<br/>
In its feverish search for reliable anti-Communist allies, the United States has been all too ready to clasp Fascist Spain to its bosom. This passionate wooing, after a period in which Spain had been cold-shouldered by most of the countries of the West, very naturally went to General Franco's head. With such a powerful friend, no doubt he felt the time had come when he could take a chance at the old game of twisting the lion's tail, and he felt strong enough to make what was, in his view, a real bid for Gibraltar.<br/>
Of course, very few of those American dollars have filtered through to the Spanish workers, but there are public works such as air bases, port development schemes, and the like, which are going on? and are paid for by United States money. I have described Gibraltar as being slowly starved of Spanish workers, but not immediately starved, and that, I submit, is because there are not yet enough works to absorb the displaced workers in that part of Spain. I understand, however, that one of the items in the programme is a port development scheme for Algeciras. No doubt, as that progresses, the Spanish Government will think it safe to withdraw more and more workers away from Gibraltar.<br/>
All the time the Americans in Spain are not only ostentatiously exempt from the restrictions placed on British subjects but a red carpet, as it were, is put down for them by the Spanish Government. One would think, incidentally, that Gibraltar was of some value as a N.A.T.O. as well as a British base. By keeping silent our American allies are condoning this anti-British campaign. One single word from the State Department and this nonsense would stop tomorrow. Of course, this silence may be unwitting. It is just conceivable that the Americans do not know what is going on, but I would ask the noble Lord whether they have been informed by us, and whether any help has been asked of them in the way of diplomatic representations to the Spanish Government, and, if such a request has been made, what reply we have received.<br/>
There have been American actions which have damaged our economic interests in Gibraltar which could not have been accidental. I will mention one of them. There is a large American shipping company called American Export Lines, which has run a regular passenger and cargo service for many years from New York to various Mediterranean ports, and its first Mediterranean port of call had always been Gibraltar. Suddenly, starting only last month, its port of call was made not Gibraltar but Algeciras, across the bay. This is a decision which, in my view, could not possibly have been taken on any commercial considerations.<br/>
One has only to look at the two ports. The only communication from Algeciras to Madrid is by means of an old, dusty, uncomfortable train journey which takes seventeen hours. There are no air services,


and there is not even an airport. There are mo dockside facilities. The ships will have to anchor offshore and passengers and cargo discharged by tender and lighter. There is one rather poor hotel. On the other hand, Gibraltar has excellent dock facilities, at least one first-class hotel, and air communications with Madrid and many other large cities. It is inconceivable to me that such a switch as this could have been made except under some political pressure. I should like to know where the pressure was exercised. I cannot imagine a large American enterprise being dictated to by the Spanish Government.<br/>
There are strong hints that the pressure came from Washington, in the pages of an American-owned newspaper called the <i>Moroccan Courier,</i> published, I think, in Tangier. In it was an article written by its American editor. Discussing this decision of American Export Lines, he said:
<q>It would appear logical that our Congress and foreign service would do well to seriously study the ramifications of the proposed change. Are we to further antagonise and possibly jeopardise an already proven friendship with our only natural linguistic ally, England, because of such a move?&#x2026;Are we to trade certainty of friendship with England for flowery promises from the land of siestas, fiestas and mananas?</q>
That is interesting, coming as it does from an American source.<br/>
I know that the action which the Americans took of withdrawing their consul from Gibraltar did not help at all. I gather that the official reason was one of economy. Only then did the Spaniards withdraw their vice-consul, and this was generally thought in Gibraltar to be due to the fact that the Spaniards took the American action as the green light for their being unpleasant to the British. If the American action was innocent, it was certainly thoughtless and unwise.<br/>
I thought it as well that the facts about the Gibraltar situation should be known in this country because I do not think that they are widely known at present. The Foreign Secretary has been very coy about it. I put down some Questions just before the Recess, to which the present Minister of Health, when he was Joint Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, replied, and I thought that there was an air of complacency about his replies. Certainly, that
opinion was shared by people in Gibraltar. I understand that a vigorous protest came from the Gibral-

tar Chamber of Commerce, claiming that one of the replies given by the right hon. Gentleman was distinctly misleading, and asking the Colonial Secretary to inform the Foreign Secretary what precisely was the situation in Gibraltar. I should like to know what representations have been made about these matters.<br/>
The people of Gibraltar undoubtedly feel that they are being let down by Britain. They feel very bitter about the friendly facade of Anglo-Spanish relations at a time when they are suffering daily humiliation at the hands of the Spanish authorities. They wonder why we appear to be falling over backwards to restore normal diplomatic relations with Spain, why we are seeking trade talks the whole time, why the Royal Navy has resumed courtesy calls at Spanish ports, why we backed Spain's entry into the United Nations, without a single concession to Gibraltar on the part of Spain. And well may they wonder.<br/>
Despite all this, it ought to be made abundantly clear that, from the information I can gather, the people of Gibraltar remain solidly loyal to this country. Indeed, a plebiscite as to whether Gibraltar wanted to remain British or to become part of Spain might be a very safe gamble for the British Government, and might be one way of putting a stop to this nonsense once for all. The general opinion in Gibraltar is that such a plebiscite would result in a 105 per cent, victory for Britain. Perhaps the noble Lord will say that the Government are not going to let this really intolerable situation go on indefinitely, that he is going to make protests and vigorous protests to the Spanish Government, and that he will, if necessary, seek the assistance of our American allies in putting an end to it.</p>

<p>There have often been moments when I have wondered whether it is ever right that matters pertaining to our rather strained foreign relations should ever be raised in the House; and although, as I think hon. Members opposite will agree, I am only too ready to exercise my own right to say what I think, yet I have sometimes wondered whether the timing of what we say here about such matters is right or wrong.<br/>
I am in no position to say whether the facts, as the hon. Member for St. Pancras,


North (Mr. K. Robinson) has related them, are correct or incorrect, and I know that the luck of the Ballot has a good deal to do with his having brought them up now; but I cannot help feeling that the timing of his remarks about our American allies has been unfortunate, when today we have had a statement from the Prime Minister on his return from Washington, and we have all been very impressed by the great success of his talks there. It would be singularly unfortunate if anything were said in the House today which would be likely to detract from that. As we know, there are many people who would be delighted if anything were said to make it seem as if the talks were not as successful as in fact they have been, and we have had news from Moscow over the weekend which is obviously designed for that very purpose.<br/>
Whatever our views on the regime in Spain&#x2014;and I should not like to live under it&#x2014;we should realise that if General Franco had not stopped a Communist regime from establishing itself in Spain, which was a risk, we might have found ourselves in a more difficult position than we are now in fighting the cold war. Therefore, I would qualify some of the hon. Member's comments in relation to General Franco and his Government.<br/>
If the facts which the hon. Member has given about conditions as they affect the individual British citizen in Gibraltar are correct, I hope that the Foreign Office will take appropriate steps to deal with the matter. As I have said, I am not in a position to know whether the facts are correct or not. But when the hon. Member asked the House why there has been an increased pressure by the Spaniards upon our position in Gibraltar, I should have thought that the answer was not so very difficult. If one looks at the record of the hon. Member's own Government when they were in power, and what a chain of calamities followed from the policy of getting out when things grew too awkward, it is not altogether surprising that pressure should be applied wherever we are weak.<br/>
I always remember that Stalin, in his writings, asked, "Where do you strike at Imperialism?" and answered himself by saying, "Where the chain is weakest." I think that he was then thinking of India.

There are those who believe that there is something wrong with British Imperialism, but my own view is that British Imperialism is the answer to many other means of managing world affairs. There are those who are violently antagonistic to British Imperialism, and they will try to push us out wherever they think the chain is weakest. If Gibraltar had to defend itself with its own population its chances would not be very great. Peace is maintained only because other Powers know what action against Gibraltar would lead to.<br/>
Nevertheless, this is a useful opportunity of discussing the position of Gibraltar, especially in the light of what has been happening in the last few days in Malta. I realise that the Foreign Office is not immediately responsible for our Colonial Territories, but it is important that we should bear in mind that there are some similarities between the position of Gibraltar and the position of Malta, although fortunately Malta has not the territorial problem which Gibraltar must inevitably have by reason of being on a land mass.<br/>
I sometimes wonder, however, whether there is not a missing link in our Commonwealth constitution, and if there is not a place for some status in between that of a Dominion and that of a Colony into which Gibraltar might one day fall. I think I am right in saying that most of the Crown Colonies which we have today are Colonies as a result of having been ceded by treaty, whereas the ordinary Colonies are often those territories which we have developed through our trade. It might well be that some redefinition is required, and that Gibraltar might one day become in status something between a Dominion and a Colony. Perhaps some such phrase as a "Sovereign Colony" would cover what I have in mind.<br/>
I hope that we shall never think that Gibraltar's constitution is static and should never be changed should the people who live in Gibraltar wish it to be changed. There is no doubt about it that all these smaller territories are in a very precarious position in the present state of the world. The smaller they are, the more they must turn to this country, and the more important it is that we should be ready to take the appropriate action at the right time.<br/>
If the hon. Member for St. Pancras, North had a direct complaint about Gibraltar itself it would probably have been infinitely preferable if he had written to the Foreign Office about the subject and given details.</p>

<p>I put a Question to the Foreign Office, and it was because of the nature of the reply and the fact that I thought that there was complacency that I decided to raise the matter on the Adjournment.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-02-13a.2117.1" hansard_membership_id="7738" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/17156" speakername="Major Legge-Bourke" colnum="2117" time="">
<p>I merely reiterate that I sometimes wonder whether matters affecting other Governments are best brought to light first by Questions in the House. I think that the Foreign Office is able to give a fuller reply if it is able to write to an hon. Member rather than answer him across the Floor of the House. It is sometimes extremely difficult for Ministers to answer these matters in the House.<br/>
I should like to say something about the American part in all this. I should not say it if it were not for what the hon. Member has said. It is important that if we think American business firms or other bodies not directly concerned with the American Government are doing things of which we disapprove or which we regret we should be very careful to distinguish the acts of private individuals from deliberate acts of Government. As far as I understand the hon. Member, his complaints are rather about actions by individuals or groups of individuals in matters of trade.<br/>
We can well understand the hon. Member disliking those alleged actions, but it is not always fair to blame the American Government, just as we should not think it fair if the British Government were blamed for what British traders did overseas. I hope that when my noble Friend the Joint Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs replies to the debate, a clear distinction will be made and that it will be made plain whether or not the acts alleged by the hon. Member for St. Pancras, North were the acts of the American Government or the acts of American companies. There is a world of difference.<br/>
I am sure that we are all quite certain in our own minds that, in resisting what is the real menace to the world, the Americans and ourselves are at one. We

might differ in the methods which we employ, but to suggest that the American Government are deliberately taking action designed to make our position untenable in Gibraltar or anywhere else is distinctly unfortunate. In the days of Abadan we did not like the actions of Mr. McGhee very much, and I was not very happy at times about certain actions in Cairo, but it is important that we should distinguish between the policy and action of the Government concerned and the action of individuals who are under the administration of that Government.<br/>
I would hope, therefore, that what my noble Friend says in reply will, above all, do two things. First, I hope that it will make clear that there is no rift whatever between the American Administration and our own in the matter of policy towards Gibraltar and Spain. Secondly, I hope that it will be made clear that we shall keep prominently in our minds the need to be united in the future in resisting all attempts to drive a wedge between us.<br/>
I hope the hon. Gentleman did not have that as his motive when he said what he did&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>I am glad to see the hon. Gentleman indicating that that was not his motive, because there are certain quarters of the world which might place that interpretation upon his remarks. For that reason I hope that none of us will do anything likely to weaken in the slightest degree the position of those who base themselves on the Christian religion and are stalwart in their fight against Communism. Had it not been that Spain prevented a Communist revolution taking hold we might find it more difficult today to fight the cold war than we do.</p>

<p>The hon. and gallant Member for the Isle of Ely (Major Legge-Bourke) has repeated again and again the dangers of driving a wedge between Britain and America. He seemed to forget that this Adjournment deals with the conditions in Gibraltar, about which I thought he would have known a little more when he rose to address the House. I am sure that the people of Gibraltar will be deeply grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for St. Pancras, North (Mr. K. Robinson)


for having brought forward this matter in connection with the Foreign Office. As one of a deputation which visited Gibraltar in January, 1955,1 can say that my hon. Friend has raised some of the matters which were very much to the fore at that time.<br/>
I must be fair and say that the Secretary of State for the Colonies has done his utmost to live up to his responsibilities to the people of Gibraltar, but it seems that the nigger in the woodpile is the Foreign Office, which appears to wish to flirt with Spain at any cost and to ignore its responsibilities to Gibraltar. I notice from his expression that the noble Lord the Joint Under-Secretary of State does not like that statement, so a little later I will quote words used by a former Governor of Gibraltar, Field Marshal Lord Ironside, who puts the point better than I can.<br/>
The people of Gibraltar are intensely loyal, as my hon. Friend has said. In fact, one cannot go to any part of the world and find as loyal a community inside the British Commonwealth as the Gibraltarians. Yet many of them have felt for some time that those who are intensely loyal are at the end of the queue when it comes to getting benefits from being inside the British Commonwealth. From correspondence in the <i>Gibraltar Post</i> every week I gather that many people there are beginning to feel that unless they copy some of the activities of the people of Cyprus, nobody will take any notice. In this respect it is felt that the Foreign Office is the worst offender. When statements have been made about Gibraltar in the Spanish Press, over the Spanish radio and by General Franco it is felt that the Foreign Office should have replied.<br/>
It is all very well for the Prime Minister to say that we will not give up Gibraltar, but more than that is needed. Surely the representative of the Foreign Office knows that the screw was put on by General Franco when the programme of the Royal visit to Gibraltar was announced. As a consequence, the visits of British warships to Spanish ports were suspended. These have now started again to Barcelona and other ports although the economic strangulation of Gibraltar is continuing. I have here a copy of the <i>Gibraltar Post</i> for 10th December, which shows that even at this late hour

the Colony wishes to be friendly with Spain. There were floods in the adjacent towns of San Roque and the Gibraltarians sent money to help the Spanish people there.<br/>
The editorial comments:
<q>&#x2026; it is equally true to say that a deliberate economic blockade can cause as much harm and damage as these floods have done. Spain will never be successful in her efforts to ruin us, but the fact remains that she is doing her utmost to do so. Our extended hand of friendship provides therefore a grand opportunity to the Spanish Authorities to wipe the sheet clean and return to a more normal state of affairs. We must live side by side, so why not behave in a sensible and civilised manner?</q>
The hon. and gallant Gentleman mentioned the dangers of Communism, but there are dangers from other isms" as well, and as a most intelligent Member of this House he should have known that during the last two years the Colony has been fighting against slow economic strangulation by Spain, with which Her Majesty's Government seems to be especially friendly. While the people of Gibraltar recognise that this is desirable, it should not be at their expense.<br/>
I will give some evidence to show that this is not just a question of hon. Members on this side of the House wishing to say something nasty to the Government because they are in opposition. This is what Field Marshal Lord Ironside, onetime Governor of Gibraltar, wrote in <i>Time and Tide</i> on 15th October last year:
<q>During our long occupation of the Rock, there has sprung up a loyal British population of over 20,000 souls. Have we the right to barter their birthright for any good which may come to us thereby in our affairs with Spain?</q>
Those words indicate what is happening over Spain. It is time that the Foreign Office told Franco that when we say that Gibraltar is to remain inside the British Commonwealth, we mean it. We also mean, even though it is a small community, that once they have so elected we will not barter their birthright for several million pounds' worth of trade with Spain.<br/>
Here is a glorious opportunity to indicate to the rest of the world, especially to communities still inside the British Commonwealth, that no matter how small they are, any matters affecting their happiness and their livelihood will be protected by this Government, who will see that they do not suffer from any economic embargo imposed by any other country.<br/>
I ask that in giving these people every opportunity of earning their living there will be acceleration of the discussions now taking place to help them in their economic fight. Last June, I tabled a Question to the First Lord of the Admiralty about the allocation of Admiralty bunkerage which would help the civilian authorities of Gibraltar to attract more liners to the port. I received a letter from the Admiralty stating that the Question had been transferred to the Secretary of State for the Colonies. I table another Question, this time to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, on the same point of oil bunkerage which was discussed in January last year. In reply, I received a letter from the Secretary of State informing me that I must put the Question to the First Lord of the Admiralty. That is the way things go on. Meantime, the Spanish authorities are taking special steps to improve the ports of Ceuta and Algeciras in order to provide facilities which will encourage even more American liners to transfer from Gibraltar to their ports.<br/>
The people of Gibraltar want to know why the Foreign Office is so favourably disposed towards Spain when it is obvious that Spain wishes to apply, and is applying, an economic stranglehold to Gibraltar. I hope that tonight, as a result of the work of my hon. Friend the Member for St. Pancras, North, a message will go out to the people of Gibraltar telling them not only that we are reaffirming that they shall stay within the British Commonwealth but that, at long last, we shall use some influence with Spain to ensure that the labour and economic blockade is brought to an end at the earliest possible moment; and, if it is not, that we shall stand by our friends in Gibraltar even if it means offending the people of Spain.</p>

<p>While I agree with my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for the Isle of Ely (Major Legge-Bourke) that problems like this are sometimes better raised in private than in public, now that the matter has been raised I should like to endorse one or two of the things which have been said by the hon. Member for St. Pancras, North (Mr. K. Robinson) as a result of a very brief visit which I paid to Gibraltar last August.<br/>
As I went there on holiday, I did not have time to investigate the situation as thoroughly as has the hon. Member for Erith and Crayford (Mr. Dodds). However, I found that the arrangements for permits to enter and leave Spain were exactly as the hon. Member for St. Pancras, North has said. This also applies to people who obtain Spanish visas in this country, go to Spain and visit Gibraltar and return to Spain, in exactly the same way as it applies to Gibraltar nationals. It seems absurd that there should be the restriction of three visits only in three months.<br/>
This is also affecting the Spaniards adversely in the sense that many people in Gibraltar&#x2014;there are many cars in Gibraltar; the traffic problem there is sometimes nearly as bad as it is here&#x2014; would take advantage of the opportunity to make frequent visits to Spain in order to go for afternoon runs, and so on. I am sure that the Spaniards themselves are suffering to a certain extent because of the restrictions which have been applied.<br/>
I also confirm what the hon. Gentleman has said about the attitude of the people of Gibraltar towards ourselves. I remember visiting Gibraltar two or three times before the war&#x2014;at least, landing there from a ship for a few hours&#x2014;and I find them very much more friendly towards us now than they were pre-war. I do not remember that they were particularly unfriendly before the war, but they are certainly much friendlier now. Many of them were here as evacuees during the war, and they were well looked after and learned a great deal about our way of life. I believe that they appreciate being part of the British Empire. As the hon. Gentleman said, I am sure that their only wish is to continue under our rule. Consequently, I hope that this very difficult problem will be solved.<br/>
I do not want to be in the slightest degree anti-Spanish. During the past four years I have had three motoring holidays in Spain and I have always found the people most friendly. There was no difference in this the nearer I got to Gibraltar. The only exception was provided by the Spanish Customs at the frontier between Gibraltar and Spain where for the first time in many visits to Europe, I had to lift a piece of luggage from the top of the car and


take it into the Customs shed to be examined. Naturally, that sort of thing happens every time one returns to this country, and one expects it then, but one does not expect it when travelling in foreign countries which have not much interest in what one is taking in and out because they are mostly one's personal effects and it is obvious that one is not trying to smuggle. When I took my bag back the Customs official, who made no attempt to help me in any way, asked for a tip. Needless to say, he did not get one. That is the only occasion when journeying to France, Spain, Switzerland, Germany and Italy during the last seven or eight years that I have had luggage examined by foreign Customs officials.<br/>
I hope that this trouble will be solved. I am sure that, given firmness by the Government, it can be. If that is not enough, I wonder whether the good offices of our friends in the United States could be enlisted. The problem ought to be solved as quickly as possible for the benefit of the people of Gibraltar and also so that we can bring to an end the unhappy situation existing between us and the Spanish Government.</p>

<p>This is one of those occasions when one rises solely because of a speech previously made in the debate. I listened with very great interest to the hon. and gallant Member for the Isle of Ely (Major Legge-Bourke), and as the Adjournment debate has begun early enough for us to be able to challenge statements of this kind, it seems proper to do so. The hon. and gallant Gentleman advanced arguments which I feel should most certainly be refuted if the debate is to represent in the OFFICIAL REPORT a fair balance of views in the House.<br/>
The hon. and gallant Gentleman, of all people, has advanced these views since he took the very courageous step of resigning from his party when he heard that it was contemplating an act of abdication in regard to British interests, and when in his view the act of abdication was absolutely clear, he took the opportunity of rejoining his party. However, we will leave that without comment.<br/>
We have here something which anyone who has followed the newspapers knows

to be part of a fairly long series of deliberately provocative acts by the Spanish against British interests and trade in Gibraltar. My hon. Friend the Member for St. Pancras, North (Mr. K. Robinson) has very properly raised the subject. We have been told that for three reasons this is an unhappy debate, and my hon. Friend's speech was an unhappy one.<br/>
The first reason given by the hon. and gallant Gentleman was that it is unfortunate to air these matters in Parliament. I try very hard not to do him an injustice, but if I were to accept what I understood to be his point of view, I should leave the House this evening and apply for the Chiltern Hundreds. The object of Parliament is to air the views and anxieties that hon. Members have about not only their constituents but British interests abroad and anything that we believe to be a matter of concern to the country.<br/>
My hon. Friend took the ordinary course of questioning the Minister and then the very proper course of notifying his intention to raise the matter on the Adjournment. I cannot believe that the future of the world so hinges on Anglo-Spanish relations that it is improper for my hon. Friend to raise the matter in the House.</p>

<p>I never for a moment suggested that it was improper. If it had been, I am certain that someone more important than I am would have taken the appropriate action. It was certainly not improper under our Parliamentary procedure to do so. I said that it was a pity.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-02-13a.2124.1" hansard_membership_id="372" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2405" speakername="Mr. Benn" colnum="2124" time="">
<p>It was obviously not improper. Neither the hon. and gallant Gentleman nor I would query the right of Mr. Speaker to allocate the subject for debate on the Adjournment. There was a suggestion from the hon. and gallant Gentleman that when a matter arose which might involve another Government it was unhappy to debate it in the House of Commons. However, when various hon. Members feel that the Foreign Office has been lax in its duty, it becomes our duty to raise the matter, and I understood that was the object of the exercise tonight.<br/>
The second of the hon. and gallant Gentleman's arguments against the course which my hon. Friend has proposed is


that in order to preserve a united front in the cold war, Anglo-Spanish relations must be kept warm and nothing must seem to come between us as a cause for controversy. That is something which in an ordinary Adjournment debate of half an hour would go unchallenged because there would not be time, but I should be very sorry if anyone reading the hon. and gallant Gentleman's speech in the OFFICIAL REPORT gained the impression that if one is anti-Communist, that is all that is necessary in order to be on our side in the cold war.<br/>
When the hon. and gallant Gentleman speaks about "our battle" with the Communist world, I take it that he means, as I do, that he objects to certain aspects of Communist rule. There is nothing magic about the word "Communist" which is evil; we object to Communism and Communist methods for the specific reasons that the people do not have an opportunity for expressing their view, that there is no free association under the law, that there is no treatment of people according to our Anglo-Saxon traditions of justice. I imagine that the hon. and gallant Member for the Isle of Ely would object to those practices whether they occurred in Russia, Spain, the Union of South Africa, or wherever they happened. Therefore, if only for the record, I challenge the fundamental view that one has only to be anti-Communist to be an ally of the West and of the free world.</p>

<p>I had better not go into wide issues like that which may take up a longer time than we have.<br/>
I come to the third very important argument which is whether the Anglo-American alliance is so delicate and fragile a relationship that we cannot raise with the Americans our anxieties about parts of the world where our joint interests are concerned. There is a view

&#x2014;I know that it is the view of some hon. Members opposite; I have never understood it&#x2014;that the basis of the Anglo-American alliance should be that we should never query each other's line or policy and that anything which suggests disagreement should be instantly suppressed.<br/>
I do not know what experience hon. Members have of the United States. My own experience&#x2014;and I go there for a few months every two or three years&#x2014;is that the more one is willing to discuss frankly with the Americans one's view, the better the relationship. The one thing
which Americans cannot stand is humbug, and I believe that the one besetting sin of British politicians is humbug. I am extending this to everybody. It is not intentional, but we all have a feeling that if one produces an agreed statement which says nothing, that is better than a statement in which everything is not agreed and which says something.<br/>
I am convinced that if the relationship between us and the Americans is to be fruitful we must have, as my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, East (Mr. Crossman) once put it, a sort of "creative friction "between Britain and the United States. To expect statesmen not to raise issues which are controversial and to say that that will impress the Russians and will make the Kremlin tremble, I very strongly doubt.<br/>
Here is an issue in which the Spanish Government have engaged in deliberate provocation of the United Kingdom and its interests in Gibraltar. It is something which affects the defence strategy of this country and Gibraltar's relations with the United Kingdom. In the cold war, the psychological value of the Anglo-Spanish alliance in the neutral countries of Asia and Africa is so slight as not to merit consideration. If the Anglo-American alliance is to be of perpetual value, as I fervently hope, the foreign policy of this country must be based on absolute frankness and expectation of co-operation. I hope that the Minister will feel able to answer the debate frankly so that we may all know what is his view.</p>

<p>I can say straight away that we certainly try to conduct our relations with the United States on the basis of absolute frankness,


and I think I can show that. The hon. Member for Bristol, South-East (Mr. Benn) merely exaggerated what my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for the Isle of Ely (Major Legge-Bourke) was saying. Nobody on this side of the House has ever suggested that there should never be any outspoken disagreement between ourselves and the United
States. The alliance, the comradeship, between us is strong enough to stand that sort of thing and, indeed, I think that I am right in recalling that the communiqu&#x00E9; itself mentioned one point of disagreement.<br/>
The hon. Member for Erith and Cray-ford (Mr. Dodds) employed a phrase which, he said, he noticed I did not like. He must have had that observation in his notes before he made it, because I did my best to show no reaction. I certainly did not dislike it when he said that he was accusing the Foreign Office of flirting with Spain at any cost. I do not mind that. It does not happen to be accurate, but nobody could possibly dislike any statement which the hon. Member makes, because he always speaks with such sincerity and charm. It was in those terms that he made that very accusation this afternoon.<br/>
The Foreign Office is not flirting with Spain or with anybody&#x2014;at least as far as I am aware&#x2014;at any cost. What we are trying to do is to maintain friendly relations with the Spanish Government, but not at any cost and certainly not at the cost of bartering the rights of those who believe in us and who are our friends. But because sometimes a government or an organisation of any other sort acts in such a way as to disappoint one, that does not mean one must fly off the handle and lose a sense of proportion, nor, equally, that one should turn one's back on it and pretend that it is not happening. That is the view of the Foreign Office and, therefore, of the Government about Spain.<br/>
It is really quite untrue to say that we are complacent. That was another word used by the hon. Member for Erith and Crayford and by others. Complacency is not part of our make-up, either here or in any other sphere. All is not well in respect of what is happening <i>vis-&#x00E1;-vis</i> Spain and Gibraltar and the hon. Member for St. Pancras, North (Mr. K. Robinson) was accurate when he described what was happening as "pinpricks." He was inaccurate, as I shall

try to suggest later, when he came to the part that the United States may be playing in all this.<br/>
However, in so far as he was saying that the Spanish Government are indulging in a policy of pin-pricking and humiliation, that was certainly not an exaggeration of what is unfortunately happening at the moment. On the exact reason why this is being done his guess is as good as mine. All one can say with certainty is that this kind of thing is the greatest possible pity, because it can do no good to anybody, let alone Spain herself.<br/>
The hon. Member for St. Pancras, North asked me specifically to let him know what was going on about the issue of passes to the labour force. I can give him a complete answer on that. The position is that no passes are being issued to the following: to new recruits to the labour force; persons who have not worked in Gibraltar during the last five years; and persons who have been residing in areas other than the Campo area during the last two years. That is the answer to his question. I am afraid that it is not a very encouraging answer, but it happens to be the right one. I do not deny the allegations made about the continuance of this pin-prick policy towards British residents. What he said was certainly perfectly true in its general presentation.<br/>
I wish to make it clear that Americans are not now exempt from restrictions at the Gibraltar frontier. The hon. Gentleman thought they were. At one time there was discrimination, but that has stopped. That may not exactly be an improvement, but it is not quite as bad as it was in terms of discrimination between the Americans and ourselves.</p>

<p>How does the hon. Gentleman square up this talk of pin-pricks with his reference to labour? Does he not appreciate that there is a very big wastage of Spanish labour and if no new passes are being issued, as he has stated, it can have a harmful effect on the economic life of Gibraltar? Does not he appreciate that that is being done at a time when there is widespread unemployment in Spain?</p>

<p>If enough pin-pricks are administered, in the end the victim is in a condition of considerable pain. That was the phrase used by the hon. Gentleman who opened the debate and I think it is accurate. It is just one thing after another.<br/>
I come now to the question of the American line, the shipping line, which the hon. Gentleman asked about. Unfortunately, it is true that this line&#x2014;the American Export Line is the company concerned&#x2014;have stopped calling at Gibraltar and call at Algeciras instead. It is a matter of the greatest possible regret to Her Majesty's Government, but there is no reason whatever to suppose that there has been any pressure from Washington. Here,
we get on to the point made by my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for the Isle of Ely (Major Legge-Bourke). As I am sure we all do, we must distinguish between individual actions, however unattractive, and Government-inspired action; and there is no reason to suppose that there was any pressure from Washington at all.<br/>
Whether it would not be extremely helpful if counter-pressure could be exerted is a different question. But I beg the hon. Gentleman opposite not to let it go out from this House that that has been done in response to some sinister political intrigue&#x2014;which is what it would amount to&#x2014;by our allies in Washington. It just is not so.<br/>
The hon. Member suggested that we were following the Spanish Government with far too much desire to please and had fawned upon it. One hon. Member said that we were seeking trade talks all the time. In fact, we are not. We are taking part in annual meetings of delegations to discuss the level of trade in each succeeding year. Less than that we could not do and conform with our duty as a Government.<br/>
Now I come to the matter of British policy towards Gibraltar. This has been stated quite fairly and squarely by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Colonies more than once recently. I simply wish on behalf of the Foreign Office to repeat and to stand by every single word which my right hon. Friend has said. We are not prepared to consider any change in the status of the Rock. I go further and say that in my view and

in the view of the Foreign Office the ventilation of this matter can bring only discord and will help nobody.<br/>
We shall never desert our friends in Gibraltar, who believe in us. I do not think it fair to say that they feel let down or bitter in any way. I had the pleasure of meeting their Parliamentary delegates when they came to this country a year or so ago, and I know quite well that they were encouraged and strengthened by the response they got from every department and from all quarters in this country.<br/>
Our policy is that we want friendly relations with the Spanish people and friendly contacts with the Spanish Government. That does not mean that we approve of what is going on now so far as Gibraltar is concerned. We beg our friends in Spain to desist from this fruitless activity which can only help our enemies. We shall be patient, and we shall also be firm, and then we hope that finally we shall be friends.</p>

<p>Well, it is difficult to divorce one side of one's personality from the other. I am now talking about something which happened a year or two ago. All I am saying is perfectly accurate in my memory. I did not think that I was barred from giving the hon. Lady the benefit of my memory, which is accurate in this case, nor did I think that the matter was in any state of controversy.<br/>
I am not saying that there are not a great many people who are worried now in Gibraltar, but this is some time after the delegation visited us. I was merely rebutting what I thought was an exaggerated charge of complacency made from the other side of the House.</p>

<p>On a point of order.

Secretary has very kindly attended the House. I was merely asking a question in the previous debate. We did have that agreement.</p>

<p>No, but I had an interview with Mr. Speaker, and Mr. Speaker's Secretary rang me up and said that if I obtained the agreement of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Housing and Local Government, I would be able to make my speech.

<p>Further to the point of order raised by the hon. Lady. As one Tyneside Member speaking for another, may I point out that what the hon. Lady did on two or three occasions was to interrupt the noble Lord who was replying to the debate. She always prefaced the remarks she made in her interruptions by saying "Before the noble Lord sits down&#x2014;,"which I understood was an interruption in the noble Lord's speech and not a speech of her own. I understand that the hon. Lady feels that she has not exhausted her right to speak because she has not yet made a speech. She has only interrupted the noble Lord, and, if I may say so, very effectively too. I suggest that that is a well-known way of getting into a debate without exhausting one's right to speak, and we have not yet heard the hon. Lady speaking except when interrupting somebody else.</p>

<p>Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy-Speaker.<br/>
I feel very diffident about keeping the House after the main Adjournment debate is over, and I do so only with the agreement of Mr. Speaker, whose advice I naturally sought on the matter, and with the co-operation of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Housing and Local Government, to whom I am very much indebted. But, as you know, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, one has to seize one's opportunities in this House, and my experience is that if one misses an opportunity, it does not often return. Therefore, I should have been very sorry indeed, since I have kept the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry here during the whole of the debate on the Gibraltar question, waiting to reply to me, if I were not able to put my point of view. I thank my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary very much indeed for his kind co-operation, and I promise not to detain the House for very long.<br/>
I want to make one point about housing. I am very interested in what will happen to what I have always referred to as the small fixed income groups. It has occurred to me that in the slum clearance programmes which are to be carried out by the local authorities, there is one matter which is contained in the Housing Act, 1936, which requires some explanation. I have therefore seized this opportunity to try to get the position made quite clear.<br/>
The Act provides that when there is a slum clearance project which has to go to the Minister for his approval, those persons displaced under the slum clearance order must be rehoused. When I looked at the Act, and at the appropriate Section 45, it did not seem to me to be very clear, at any rate to me&#x2014;and I am only an amateur in these matters&#x2014; whether the local authorities were bound to rehouse all the householders. That is to say, they would, of course, rehouse the married couples, but the Act did not make clear whether the authorities must also rehouse widows, widowers, bachelors and spinsters, or whether it was within their power, so to speak, to be selective.<br/>
I sought the guidance provided in the Housing Act, and I wish to read to the House the appropriate Section, of which I am asking my hon. Friend to give a rather broader interpretation. When I first read that Section, it struck me, twenty years after the Act was passed,


that the language of 1936 was very old-fashioned in relation to housing. Here is what Section 45 (1) provides:
<q>A local authority who have passed a resolution declaring any area to be a clearance area or an improvement area shall, before taking any action under that resolution which will necessitate the displacement of any persons of the working classes, undertake to carry out or to secure the carrying out of such rehousing operations, if any, within such period as the Minister may consider to be reasonably necessary.</q>
I understand from the investigations which
I have made that the Minister has never defined what the words "reasonably necessary" mean. I am very anxious that there shall be no loopholes.<br/>
I fully appreciate the power of the local authorities, and I am a supporter of and a believer in local government. Sometimes, however, the Minister himself finds himself in conflict with the local authorities. I might instance how very hard the Minister has tried&#x2014;and I commend him for it&#x2014;to get local authorities so to interpret their housing policies as to make possible the provision of houses for ex-Regular Service men who have done their duty to their country all over the world and now find it difficult to get their names on any appropriate housing list. I think all hon. Members of this House have found that to be an extremely difficult matter, on which it has been impossible to persuade the local authorities to do what the Minister wants them to do.<br/>
I am very anxious, before we embark on this very large scheme of slum clearance throughout the whole country, that there should be no loophole, and that local authorities will not themselves be able to be selective in regard to the people whom they can rehouse. I think that is a most important matter, and, therefore, first of all, I put down a Question. Then, this wonderful opportunity arises, and I must say to the right hon. Member for South Shields (Mr. Ede), as one Tynesider to another, how grateful I am to him for his support. It was very helpful of the right hon. Gentleman, and I thank him very much.<br/>
I want the Parliamentary Secretary to make it perfectly clear that when a slum clearance project is put before the Minister for his approval, all householders&#x2014;I am not trying to be dogmatic as to whether they live in houses or flats

&#x2014;affected under the Act will be entitled to new housing under the new scheme arising out of the slum clearance project.</p>

<p>Yes. Householders are people who are householders. They may possibly be owner-occupiers&#x2014;and I am as interested in the owner-occupiers as in the widows who may be tenants of rented houses. A widow, widower, bachelor or spinster may be an owner-occupier of his or her own house.</p>

<p>That is not the question. This is a very important matter, because in many slum clearance areas some of the houses due to be demolished are sublet, and one such house may be occupied by more than one family. Does the hon. Lady suggest that only the householder of such a property should be rehoused if the house is demolished, and not those who occupy sublet accommodation in the house? They are not householders; they are sub-tenants of the householder.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-02-13a.2136.3" hansard_membership_id="10293" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29892" speakername="Dame Irene Ward" colnum="2136" time="">
<p>I do not want to get involved in the wider aspect of the question. I am quite certain that that problem is properly covered in the slum clearance programmes, although I appreciate that there may be some difficulty about rehousing lodgers. I hope that the hon. Lady will not ask me to interpret the meaning of the word "lodger." Under Section 45 of the 1936 Act, the Minister has power to examine every project which is put before him, to see whether the local authority concerned is rehousing the people who were meant, under the original Act, to be rehoused.<br/>
I only require an assurance that no difficulties will arise in respect of people who are regarded as householders. As the hon. Lady knows, priority has quite rightly been given by some local authorities to rehousing married couples, couples who are living apart or with their in-laws and have never had houses of their own, and people living in overcrowded or unsuitable conditions. The people who have gone by the board are the widows, widowers, bachelors and spinsters. Everyone agrees that it was right, after the war, to give priority in these matters to the men returning from the Forces.<br/>
I want to know if it is absolutely clear that Section 45 of the 1936 Act gives the Minister power to say to a local authority which puts forward a slum clearance scheme, "You are not providing fairly and squarely for those people whom you have displaced." I leave out altogether the question of the various categories. I want to know whether that Section, in fact, gives the Minister power not merely to guide local authorities but to impose an obligation upon them.</p>

<p>I want to help the hon. Lady. Her plea is one in regard to which hon. Members on this side of the House have a great deal of sympathy. She says that persons who had previously had homes of their own and have been displaced, because of slum clearance, should once again be given homes of their own, but her whole emphasis has been upon the position of householders. In the case of slum clearance schemes in London or the vast majority of the big cities, most of the widows, widowers, spinsters and bachelors are sub-tenants, having their own homes or homes within a household which is in the charge of a householder. Her request to the Parliamentary Secretary excludes all those sub-tenants. Does not she mean to include them?</p>

<p>I am not out to interpret the whole Act, because I should not be capable of doing so. All I am trying to find out is what power the Minister has. If he has power to impose his will upon local authorities it is for the House of Commons to see that justice is done. The Minister has never defined what Section 45 of the 1936 Act really means, and I am anxious to know whether it gives him power to disapprove of a scheme and say to a local authority, "You are not in fact rehousing the people who have been displaced." My argument is directed entirely to finding out the power possessed by the Minister. Parliament passes Acts of Parliament and it is tremendously important, whether or not we are all in agreement with it, to know what powers the Minister has under a certain Measure. That is what I am asking my hon. Friend to define.</p>

<p>I should

like at the outset to assure my hon. Friend the Member for Tynemouth (Dame Irene Ward) that it is always a pleasure to be in attendance to answer questions upon matters which she raises, even at much more untimely hours than this. In this case, I believe that I can set at rest entirely the anxieties which she feels in regard to the interpretation and effectiveness of Section 45 (1) of the Housing Act, 1936.<br/>
I would first remind her that by the Housing Act, 1949, the words "of the working classes" were deleted from the 1936 Act and, therefore, the words "any persons" occurring in the phrase, "displacement of any persons" are now unrestricted in any way. I would further draw her attention to the fact that the approval of the Minister, implied in the words:
<q>as the Minister may consider to be reasonably necessary.</q>
applies not only to the period of rehousing operations but also to the operations themselves. He must be satisfied that the rehousing operations will meet the situation created by the displacements.<br/>
The Minister has, from time to time, drawn the attention of local authorities to their obligation in regard to rehousing. The most recent instance was the circular issued less than two years ago&#x2014;Circular No. 75 of 1954&#x2014;which drew the attention of local authorities to their obligation to rehouse any persons displaced in the course of these clearance operations. Perhaps I may be permitted to explain to the House how the Minister is in a position, in fact, to secure that the "reasonably necessary" arrangements for the rehousing of persons displaced are carried out.</p>

<p>This is very important. Will the hon. Gentleman please explain that the responsibility for rehousing relates only to those people who are living in the slum clearance area on the date when the schedule is taken? Will he make it clear that once notice has been given that a certain area is to be scheduled as a slum clearance area and that the houses in it have to be demolished, only those people living in that area when the schedule is made have to be rehoused? I ask because not only in my own area but in other parts of the country the idea exists that anybody living in a house pulled down in a slum clearance area


must be rehoused, whether or not they lived there when the census of those living in the area took place.</p>

<p>The Act refers to "persons displaced" in the course of the operations which are referred to. The displacement involved in the course of those operations is a question of interpretation, but I think it would be helpful if I were to explain how the Minister's judgment on the matter contained in Section 45 is, in practice, exercised.<br/>
The Section refers to
<q>A local authority who have passed a resolution declaring any area to be a clearance area".</q>
Such an authority must then adopt one of two courses of action laid down in Section 25 (3) of the Act. The local authority can either make a compulsory purchase order and submit it to the Minister for confirmation, or it can make a clearance order which,

similarly, requires his confirmation. The Minister does not confirm either of those kinds of order unless he has before him a detailed statement of the manner in which the local authority intends to carry out its rehousing obligations.<br/>
If he were not satisfied with the arrangements proposed for rehousing he would be quite within his rights&#x2014;indeed, he would be thoroughly justified&#x2014;in declining to confirm the relevant compulsory purchase or clearance order. Therefore, my hon. Friend may rest assured that the obligation exists in the Act and that, in the administration of the Act, the Minister has the necessary powers and the necessary opportunity to insist upon that obligation being fulfilled.</p>
