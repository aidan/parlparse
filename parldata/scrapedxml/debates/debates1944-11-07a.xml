<p>May I, by permission, mention to the House that next Session I propose to ask the Government to consider setting up a Select Committee to revise our Private Bill Standing Orders which have not been revised since 1876. The proposal is in accordance with precedent, and for the convenience of Members I shall shortly be placing in the Library copies of a report made to me by a small committee of officials and others showing how the existing code can be shortened, improved and modernised without any alteration of principle. I propose to amplify this statement at the appropriate time but I thought it my duty to bring the matter to the attention of the House before the end of the present Session.</p>

<p>asked the President of the Board of Trade if he is aware that the pottery industry was one of the first to be concentrated and suffered more in relation to other industries; if it is intended now to apply a policy of deconcentration in consultation with representatives of all interests concerned; if he will take into account the important contribution that could be made in our export trade and the fact that all materials used are obtained in this country; and if it is intended to organise a planned expansion of the industry in order to ensure the maximum production.</p>

<p>I am most anxious that the pottery industry shall be able to make its full contribution to the expansion of our export trade, in addition to meeting home demands, after the war. I am in consultation with the industry with a view to helping the closed potteries to prepare their premises and plant for re-opening, and, as soon as the progress of the war permits, a start will be made with reopening.</p>

<p>asked the President of the Board of Trade if he can make a statement on the consultations and negotiations that have taken place with representatives of the U.S.S.R. on future trade and the result of discussions between various industries or firms and representatives of U.S.S.R. concerns; what are the prospects of credit facilities; and is it intended to obtain the maximum trade between the British Commonwealth and the U.S.S.R.</p>

<p>Seeing that it is seven months since the U.S.S.R. and United States representatives arrived at an agreement, is it not time that we had a settlement; and is there any truth in the statement which appeared in the "Financial

<p>The answer to the second part of the question is that it is news to me, like a lot of other things that appear in the Press. I would advise my hon. Friend not to believe everything that he sees in the Press. I am sure he does not. He is a critical reader of these things. The Government are most anxious to get a commercial agreement with Russia mutually advantageous to ourselves and the Russians.</p>

<p>Having regard to the right hon. Gentleman's enthusiasm for this project, how does it come that out of applications for &#x00A3;35,000 worth of advertising in Russian trade journals &#x00A3;34,000 have been refused, as compared with &#x00A3;60,000 accepted on behalf of American newspapers?</p>

<p>The hon. Member is puting a question quite extraneous to what is on the paper. My only comment is that, in Russia, advertising in the Press is not quite so useful as in certain other countries. The thing to do in Russia is to meet the commissar concerned.</p>

<p>As I informed my hon. Friend, the Member for Morpeth (Mr. R. J.

<p>Yes, I am sure they do.

<p>Hon. Members will be aware that there are two schemes of repatriation to the Home Establishment from overseas theatres. By far the larger&#x2014;though it is not as large as I should wish&#x2014;is that for repatriation on grounds of length of continuous service abroad. The smaller is for re-posting on compassionate grounds. There is, of course, an infinite variety of circumstances which give rise to claims for compassionate re-posting and it has been a matter of great complexity to set up machinery for investigating them and classifying them in order of priority, it being understood that the claims far outnumber the places available. It has all along been made clear that Commands overseas have full discretion to return men or women on compassionate grounds whenever the circumstances are considered to be sufficiently serious to justify this action and undue hardship to the individual or his family cannot otherwise be avoided.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1944-11-07a.1233.2" colnum="1233" time="">
<p>In the middle of this year, Middle East Command found that they were getting a very large number of applications, a great many of which were of a kind that had no chance of succeeding even apart from the limitations of the quota of vacancies. They decided therefore to issue a General Routine Order on the subject setting out both the principles and the procedure according to which applications would be dealt with. In an Appendix to the Order was included a classification of the main types of case which could arise for the guidance of Commanding Officers of units. This was in effect a reproduction of a table originally produced by the War Office and sent to Commands both for guidance and for ease of communication of the results of any investigations undertaken by the War Office in this country. Commanding Officers in the Middle East Force were instructed to bring the Order to the notice of their units by means of a Notice Board Information. The text of the Order and of this Appendix are contained in Annex I and III to this statement.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1944-11-07a.1233.3" colnum="1233" time="">
<p>The publication of the Order had the desired effect of reducing the number of applications that had no chance of success except in one particular, namely, cases falling into the category "desire for children." Perhaps I should say that the military authorities did not just think up this

category. For months past the War Office has had a considerable number of applications on this count, so it naturally had to be included in any classification sent out for the guidance of Commands. Anyhow in this category the number of applications increased very considerably and Middle East Command found themselves in a position whether their machinery was being swamped. After consultation with the Compassionate Posting Committee, which includes other ranks as well as officers and has on it a Chaplain and a Doctor, and with the local representatives of the Soldiers', Sailors' and Airmen's Families Association, Middle East Command decided to issue a further order (Annex II to this statement) imposing conditions on applications of this nature. I have no doubt this was due to a desire to avoid disappointment as much as possible and in the interests of strict equity. It is clear after the event, however, that the terms of this Order are such as are liable to offend the susceptibilities of some people though&#x2014;as my postbag shows&#x2014;by no means of all, and that they also are such as are capable of being easily misrepresented. I have suggested to the Commander-in-Chief therefore that the second Order should be withdrawn. But it is clear that the withdrawal of the Order could not mean an increase in the number of applications entertained under this head and that, in fact, the Posting Committee would either have to adjudicate on such applications very much in accordance with the terms of the Order or to come to the conclusion that all applications under this head should be automatically rejected&#x2014;which would be a pity.</p>

<q>The object of this General Order is to explain:</q>
<ol>
<li>(<i>a</i>) The general policy laid down by the War Office to secure as far as possible a uniform standard for the selection of officers and soldiers for posting to the U.K. from overseas on compassionate grounds.</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) The procedure to be adopted in the Middle East for the selection of personnel for posting to the U.K. on compassionate grounds.</li>

<q>2. <i>General Policy.</i>
<q>Commands overseas have full discretion without previous reference to the War Office to return on compassionate grounds any officer,


soldier or auxiliary eligible for posting to the U.K. wherever the circumstances are considered to be sufficient to justify this action. The number despatched to the U.K. on compassionate grounds each month must necessarily be limited, and for this reason priority will be given to the most urgent cases in accordance with Appendix "A".</q>
<q>In order to implement the above policy a Compassionate Posting Committee is in existence at G.H.Q. having been formed in August, 1943 (this will be referred to in subsequent paras. of this General Order as "the committee"). This committee consists of both officers and other ranks. The committee's decisions on the applications submitted will be final.</q>
<q>One of the essential functions of this committee is the speedy examination of applications, and for this reason the committee is in constant session.</q></q>

<q>3. <i>Applicability.</i>
<q>The procedure set out in this General Order will apply to all personnel serving with the British Army, British Nursing Service and the A.T.S. whose "natural" home is in the United Kingdom.</q>
<q>It will not apply to personnel of the Indian Army nor to British officers and British other ranks attached to the Indian Army.</q></q>

<q>4. <i>General Standards.</i>
<ol>
<li>(<i>a</i>) Individual cases must be treated on their own merits, and it is not therefore possible to lay down any hard and fast rules setting out the grounds and types of applications that will be considered for posting to the U.K. on compassionate grounds.</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) Careful consideration has, however, been given to the classes under which an application may be submitted, and as a guide these are set out at Appendix "A" to this General Order. It should be noted that each category has been divided into four classes, and each class qualified by a separate head, i.e.:</li>
<ul>
<li>Class A&#x2014;Extreme compassionate case.</li>
<li>Class B&#x2014;A very deserving case.</li>
<li>Class C&#x2014;A genuine case.</li>
<li>Class D&#x2014;A weak case.</li>
</ul></ol>
<q>It is stressed, however, that this table is to be taken only as a guide, and is reproduced with the primary object of assisting C.Os. in assessing the value of individual applications.</q>
<q>(<i>c</i>) (i) Attention is drawn to paras. 4 (<i>a</i>) and (<i>d</i>) of General Order 646 of 1944, under which personnel who have (<i>a</i>) a break in U.K. exceeding six months or (<i>b</i>) who have served abroad in a civil capacity before enlisting in the Army, may submit applications on compassionate grounds for the consideration of the committee.</q>
<q>(ii) It is pointed out, however, that unless personnel whose break in U.K. exceeds six months have additional reasons of a compassionate nature similar to those shown at Appendix "A." or the period served abroad prior to the break was extensive, the applications are unlikely to be approved.</q>
<q>(iii) Cases submitted on the grounds of split civil and military service abroad will be dealt with strictly on their merits and subject to the

limitations of the last sentence of sub-para. (ii) above.</q></q>

<p>5. <i>Verification of Applications.</i>
<ol>
<li>(<i>a</i>) It is absolutely essential that the genuineness of the grounds for home posting should be established beyond a reasonable doubt before such applications are granted. This is necessary not only out of justice to other applicants but also to avoid resentment being aroused amongst unsuccessful applicants should a "doubtful" case be posted home and the facts become known to their families.</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) Normally no application will be considered by the committee unless the grounds under which it is submitted have been confirmed by competent and impartial authority. Only in very exceptional cases and due to extreme urgency will the personal guarantee of the unit commander be accepted. The unit commander will vouch for the genuineness of the case from his own personal knowledge of the applicant and his private affairs over a period, but even so it must not be taken for granted that such guarantee will be automatically accepted by the committee.</li>

<ol>
<li>(<i>a</i>) On receipt of an application for posting to the Home Establishment C.Os. will cause the pro-forma attached at Appendix "B" to this General Order to be completed and forwarded in duplicate to the S.S.A.F.A. Enquiry Bureau, G.H.Q., M.E.F., provided no other corroborative evidence, e.g., medical certificate, police report, etc., is available.</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) S.S.A.F.A. Enquiry Bureau will forward the request to the War Office (A.G. 4 (<i>a</i>)) by microgram, or in urgent cases by signal. It will assist therefore if the pro-forma is typed in order to avoid the necessity of copying. War Office will, after inquiry, notify G.H.Q., M.E.F., the class and category into which the case falls in accordance with the table set out at para. 4 (<i>b</i>) above. The War Office will make no recommendations as to whether or not reversion to the U.K. should be approved, and this decision will remain with the committee.</li>

<q>7. <i>Submission of Applications.</i>
<q>Applications for posting to the Home Establishment on compassionate grounds come under two headings:</q>
<ol>
<li>(<i>a</i>) those originated in the U.K., and</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) those originated in the Middle East.</li>
</ol>
<q>Applications originated in the U.K.</q>
<q>The following action will be taken by G.H.Q. on receipt of notification from the War Office that an application for reversion to the U.K. of an officer, soldier or auxiliary serving in the Middle East has been made to them. If the case is placed by the War Office in Class "A" or Class "B," the unit will be immediately notified and instructions given that, if the officer, soldier or auxiliary concerned is desirous of return to the U.K., he or she will be immediately despatched to his or her base depot to await onward passage to the U.K.</q>
<q>If the War Office notification puts the application in Class "C" or "D," the unit concerned will be notified accordingly. A brief statement of the grounds will be included and


the unit asked to submit an application to G.H.Q. for consideration by the committee. This case will then be examined by the committee in the normal manner and the decision notified in accordance with para. 8 below.</q>
<q>In the event of an application being rejected on the evidence submitted at the time and subsequent evidence being received which strengthens the case, the application may be resubmitted to the committee.</q>
<q>Applications originated in the Middle East.</q>
<q>All applications will be submitted direct to G.H.Q. (officers' applications to A.G.2 (<i>b</i>), other ranks' applications to O.2E.), in original, only.</q>
<q>Each application submitted to G.H.Q. must be summarised on the pro-forma reproduced at Apprendix "C" to this General Order. It is essential that all details are carefully and correctly stated. One certified true copy of all corroborative evidence only will be included with each application.</q>
<q>Unless applications are correctly submitted to G.H.Q., they will be returned forthwith to units, and will not be examined by the committee until they are resubmitted in the correct manner as defined above.</q></q>

<q>8. <i>Notification of the Committee's decision.</i>
<q>The committee's decisions are notified immediately after each meeting as follows:-</q>
<q>(<i>a</i>) Successful applications.</q>
<q>As soon as applications are approved personnel will be called in to their respective base depots under instructions issued by G.H.Q. (A.G.2. (<i>b</i>) for officers and O.2E. for other ranks), to await onward passage to the U.K.</q>
<q>(<i>b</i>) Deferred applications.</q>
<q>Applications deferred for further evidence will be retained at G.H.Q. to await the arrival of additional evidence, when the committee will reconsider the cases.</q>
<q>(<i>c</i>) Rejected applications.</q>
<q>Units will be notified of applications rejected and such applications will be retained at G.H.Q. Should further supporting evidence subsequently become available it will be forwarded to either A.G.2 (<i>b</i>) or 0.2E. for further consideration with the original application.</q></q>

<q>9. <i>Despatch to U.K.</i>
<q>Personnel who are posted to the Home Establishment on compassionate grounds will be despatched to U.K. by sea as and when opportunity occurs. It is, however, sometimes possible for personnel to return by air. This possibility is carefully watched by the committee, and when opportunity occurs the most urgent cases are despatched in this manner, but there is no guarantee of air passage even for these cases.</q></q>

G.H.Q. quoting the G.H.Q. reference authorising despatch. This reference will also be quoted on the A.F. W5133, which is the individual officer's, other rank's or auxiliary's authority for return to the U.K. No further individual authority is necessary. (General Order 704 of 1944 refers.)</q></q>

<q>11. <i>Arrival in U.K.</i>
<ol>
<li>(<i>a</i>) On arrival in U.K. cases are further examined by the War Office. Temporary release from the Army may be granted to those for whom home posting alone is considered unlikely adequately to alleviate the hardship.</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) Officers and other ranks posted to the U.K. on compassionate grounds will not normally be eligible for despatch overseas again, either in a draft or with a unit, until they have completed six months' service in the U.K. subsequent to their return, unless they volunteer to go overseas before the expiration of this period.</li>
<li>(<i>c</i>) Whenever practicable, and provided that they have not been granted temporary release, they will be posted to units which at the time would appear unlikely to be required for service abroad within six months. If, however, the unit is despatched for service overseas as part of an organised formation they will be required to accompany it.</li>

<q>Reference General Order 878 of 1944, Appendix "A," para. 7 B (i).</q>
<ol>
<li>1. All applications submitted for posting to Home Establishment on the grounds that the spouses have been separated for three years and there are no children must be supported by a medical certificate stating that the wife is capable and desirous of bearing children and that this will not be detrimental to the health of the wife.</li>
<li>2. No cases will be considered where the age of the wife is under thirty-five, unless there are exceptional reasons which make the bearing of children essential. Such cases must be fully verified from independent sources.</li>
<li>3. In cases where marriages took place twelve months or more prior to the date of embarkation, evidence must be produced as to why the wife was unable to bear children during this period, or why there are no children of the marriage.</li>
<li>4. Medical Certificates as required in para. I above should be obtained by the applicant direct from U.K. and not through S.S.A.F.A. It is pointed out that wives may have the certificate written on an air letter and posted direct to the applicant through normal postal channels.</li>

<p>The considerations mentioned by the hon. and gallant Member in the latter Question are, of course, well known to me, and I am glad to take this opportunity of adding another acknowledgment to the many which the fine work of Army chaplains has so justly earned. An Army chaplain enters the service with the equivalent rank of a captain and with pay at 15s. 4d. a day, increased to 18s. 2d. a day after three years' service, with a captain's allowances in each case. The ordinary combatant officer obtains his commission as a 2nd Lieutenant, almost invariably after a period of service in the ranks, with pay at 11s. 0d. a day, and as a lieutenant with three years' service he receives pay of 14s. 6d. day. Royal Army Medical Corps and Army Educational Corps officers enter the service as subalterns. The pay of an Army Educational Corps captain is 19s. 0d. a day and not 22s. 8d. The rates I have quoted are exclusive of the recently approved War Service increments.</p>

<p>It would be impossible and inappropriate to attempt to assess the value of an Army chaplain's services in terms of money, but, in comparison with the pay of other officers generally, and with the remuneration of clergymen in civil life, the Army Council were satisfied that they would not be justified in asking for an increase in the present rates of Army chaplains' pay. Before arriving at this conclusion, they were fully informed of the discussion at the Inter-Denominational Advisory Committee on the matter.</p>

<p>The answer to the first part of the Question is that Red Cross shipping between Lisbon and Marseilles was suspended after 16th May last, owing to the development and consequences of operations in the Mediterranean area and subsequently in Southern France. Four British Red Cross ships due to leave on 6th November should have sailed by now from Lisbon as a result of the re-opening of Marseilles Harbour and of the railways in Southern France. The inception of transport of Red Cross supplies from Gothenburg to Germany has been hampered by lack of suitable shipping, and the need to secure the combined agreement of the various Governments concerned, including the German Government, as well as the International Red Cross Committee, to special arrangements to make good this deficiency.</p>

<p>Can my right hon. Friend give any estimate as to when these 1,500,000 parcels in Lisbon will be passed to Geneva, as it is essential that a big reserve of parcels should be built up in all the camps? We do not want a situation to recur such as happened in 1940.</p>

<p>A certain amount of caution is required in this proposal to build up reserves in all the camps, because there are stories, which I believe to be true, that the Germans are ordering camps to consume everything on hand. That is the reason for a certain amount of caution. Secondly, arrangements are being made to ship direct from this country, which may be easier than shipping from Lisbon to Marseilles.

<p>No, Sir.

<p>Parliament and the nation have suffered a very heavy loss in the death of Lord Moyne, who died at the hands of foul assassins in Cairo last night. We have as yet received no official information which fixes the authorship of the crime or gives us a clue to its motives. The murderers themselves narrowly escaped lynching at the hands of Egyptian passers-by, and the Egyptian Government have stated that they were not Egyptian subjects. Very searching inquiries will be made into the origins and associations of these strangers to Egypt, and the House will doubtless require the fullest information as soon as it has been obtained.<br/>
This morning I speak only a few words of Walter Moyne and of the grief which all who knew him feel at his loss. I have known him almost all his life. For over 30 years, mostly in this House, we were intimate friends. Very young indeed did he succeed in getting out to the South African war, where he proved his courage and shed his blood. The bitter party strife which preceded the last world war made no difference to our relations, or to his relations with many of his opponents. He fought in the first world war with distinguished courage, rising to the command of a battalion and passing through the very worst of the fighting year after year, both on Gallipoli and in France and Flanders.<br/>
It was a great pleasure to me when I went to the Exchequer to find him appointed as Financial Secretary. He served more than 20 years in the House of Commons before going to the Lords.

When the present Government was formed at the beginning of the war he accepted without the slightest hesitation or demur the post of Under-Secretary of State at the Ministry of Agriculture, although he had formerly for several years been its chief. This was characteristic of his whole conduct towards the public. Everyone must help wherever it was thought that he could help the best, and all service was equally honourable. His work as Secretary of State for the Colonies was admirable, and only the exigencies of political change led to his leaving the Government for a short while.<br/>
At the beginning of this year he became Resident Minister in the Middle East, and this I must describe as the great period of his life. During this present year a press of the most difficult, tangled, anxious and urgent problems was thrust upon him, often forcing him to take decisions at the shortest notice and without reference home. These affairs affected not only matters in the Middle East, but the relations with Allied Governments and enemy Governments seeking to surrender, and were of a most complex character.<br/>
The despatches and telegrams which he wrote were a model of clarity and vigour. I was deeply impressed by the expansion of his mind under the stress of responsibility and events. Certainly I can testify, and so can my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary, to the marked impoverishment of our affairs in this theatre resulting from his removal and to the very great difficulty that will be found in filling the gap. In particular, Lord Moyne devoted himself this year to the solution of the Zionist problem, and I can assure the House that the Jews in Palestine have rarely lost a better or more well-informed friend. I feel sure the House will wish to express its sympathy with the children and relations he has left behind him, and also may I add, even in this time of cruel sacrifice darkening so many homes, that even those who did not know him will share the pain felt by all his friends at the passing of a charming personality and a good and faithful servant of the State.</p>

<p>I would like to associate myself in just a few sentences with what the right hon. Gentleman the Prime Minister has said. Although we do not know the perpetrators of this das-


tardly crime&#x2014;for political assassination is the worst form of crime&#x2014;and although we do not know who inspired it, the fact remains that Britain has lost the services of a man not of my political faith, but who has proved himself over many years a faithful servant of the public interest. The crime may lead to political repercussions, but that is not our problem this morning. It is our duty at the earliest opportunity to express our detestation of the crime and especially to express our deep regret at the loss which Lord Moyne's family have suffered. Our hearts go out to them. In this House of Commons, which is a generous-hearted institution, political differences do not affect personal relationships, and if a man dies in the service of his country, whatever his party, he will always be honoured. I hope that Lord Moyne's family will take from me our heartfelt expression of regret on behalf of all those for whom I speak in this House.</p>

<p>May I be allowed, both personally&#x2014;and particularly personally&#x2014;and on behalf of my hon. Friends, to associate myself with the moving tribute to a great public man of whose services we have been deprived? The war has blunted some of our senses, yet all of us in this House were moved when we heard this morning of the appalling crime. Assassination is a brutal, senseless and wicked crime and cannot be too much condemned, but in this particular case we have lost a man who could ill be spared at a time like the present. He was in such a situation that he could have enjoyed a life of leisure, particularly with his taste for art and science, justified by many years of public work. But he chose otherwise. He chose in the difficult period of the nation to give his services ungrudgingly to the Government and to the nation. I do not think that I knew Walter Guinness in this House as long as the Prime Minister, but as long as 30 years ago, in his first appearance in public life on the London County Council, I was associated with him. He did some fine work for London in housing, where he developed his administrative gifts. It is a sad day for his family. It is a great loss to the nation, and it is right and proper to take the earliest opportunity to express our sentiments.</p>

<p>I share with the Prime Minister the privilege of having been one of the oldest and greatest friends of the late Lord Moyne in this Assembly, and therefore it is appropriate that I should say a word, and, like the Prime Minister, I feel a heavy burden of private sorrow upon my shoulders in standing at this Box to-day. I was associated with Lord Moyne in this House for nearly 30 years. We worked together once in a private group. We were colleagues in the same Government. And at one time in the last war I served in the same Division as he did. It may be of interest to the House to recall a conversation which I had back in Gallipoli in the year 1915 with the General of the Division. He said:
<q>It is a pity that Walter Guinness is not a regular soldier. I have never seen a man who shows greater courage, coolness and capacity in a difficult situation than he does, and had he been a regular soldier I think he would have ended his military career as a full general.</q>
I said that I remembered the time when he was called to follow the profession of politics and statesmanship, and that I believed the days would come very soon, when he would become a Cabinet Minister. I think that no more worthy epitaph could be given to Lord Moyne than to say, "Most worthily he served his country in peace and war".</p>

<p>May I be allowed to say a few words strictly confined to this Clause? If the Committee will observe the actual wording of the Clause, they will see that it says:
<q>Sub-section (4) of Section fourteen of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920 (which relates to the duration of the House of Commons of Notthern Ireland).</q>
This Section 14 of the Government of Ireland Act clearly states that there must be a General Election every five years. The Parliament of Northern Ireland has no power whatever to prolong its own existence, and that seems to me to be a very reasonable Section, because five years is, after all, the limit imposed upon this House. There must be under the Parliament Act of 1911 a General Election every five years for this House, and even the Parliament Act does not enable this House to override that Section. It is one of the Amendments of another place to the Parliament Act, accepted by this House.<br/>
12.15 p.m.<br/>
Therefore we cannot complain in the least and do not complain that this restriction of a General Election every five years should have been imposed upon the Parliament of Northern Ireland. Twice has this House enabled the Parliament of Northern Ireland to prolong its existence and if this Clause goes through it will prolong its duration, provided the Parliament of Northern Ireland so desires, for another year, enabling it therefore to go on for eight years. But there is another very important part of this Clause to which I would draw attention. It says:
<q>If the said House so resolves.</q>
What this House is being asked to do is only to give permission to the House of

Commons of Northern Ireland to prolong its existence. We are not imposing a prolongation upon it. We are taking a very democratic resolution in order to enable the Parliament of Northern Ireland to prolong its existence if it so resolves. On two occasions it has so resolved. In 1942 there was no opposition to prolongation. At least there was no Division; only one Member spoke against it, and the House, <i>nemine contradicente,</i> decided to avail itself of the permission given by this Parliament. Last year, 1943, the matter did go to a Division, but only two Members voted against prolongation. Therefore, on two occasions when the matter has come before the Parliament of Northern Ireland there has been practical unanimity.<br/>
How do we account for this unanimity? For the same reason that there has been in this House also the very strongest approval of the prolongation of Parliament, and there is a very keen desire that those Servicemen who are abroad should be able to take part in a General Election. This is specially relevant to the Parliament of Northern Ireland, because the Bill setting up the new register &#x2014;to which the Home Secretary referred on Second Reading and to which the Prime Minister also alluded&#x2014;the Bill setting up the new register for the Parliament of Northern Ireland was, according to the Northern Ireland Hansard of last Tuesday, which I received from Ulster this morning, only just at that time going through the House. Therefore, it is essential to allow time for those Servicemen who are fighting abroad to get on to the register, and I cannot help thinking of those very great and historic regiments intimately connected with Ulster in which our men are serving, such as the Fifth Royal Inniskilling Dragoon Guards, the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, the Royal Irish Fusiliers, the Royal Ulster Rifles and last, but not least, the North Irish Horse. I cannot speak of the North Irish Horse without emotion to-day&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>

<p>I do not wish to give any further list, in accordance with the decision of the Chair, but I should like


to say that among our electors there are Ulstermen serving in more than 50 regiments in addition to those which I have mentioned, not to speak of the thousands of Ulstermen serving in the Royal Navy, in the Merchant Marine and in the Royal Air Force. As Member of Parliament for the Northern Ireland University I should be allowed to mention the Royal Army Medical Corps.</p>

<p>My point summarizes itself in this observation, that we must prolong our Parliament in order to enable these men to get on to the register. If that is done, then I look forward with every confidence to the future of our Parliament, and I can only ask, What would our Scottish and our Welsh friends not give to have such a Parliament? If Scotland and Wales had such a Parliament of their own, what amazing reforms they would be able to undertake. May I be allowed to quote in conclusion what is very apt in the consideration of this subject, and that is the admirable statement made by the Prime Minister in moving the Second Reading of this Bill? There are a very few words and they seem to me to be very much to the point:
<q>Nothing would be more shameful or more dishonourable than to deny the great mass of the soldiers, and Servicemen of the Air Force and of the Navy a full opportunity of recording their votes. In my opinion they have more right to vote than anyone else in the country, and we shall all be ashamed if anything were done which prevented these men, to whom we owe almost everything, from taking their full part in deciding the immediate future of their country."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 31st October, 1944; Vol. 404, c. 644&#x2013;5.]</q></p>

<p>Before we give this Bill a Third Reading and

send it to another place I would like to say a few sentences upon it. In moving the Second Reading, the Prime Minister emphasised to the House the importance of our keeping together until the end of European hostilities, and the House has most dutifully and willingly complied with all the implications of that request, and is about to give this Bill its Third Reading. The Prime Minister reminded us back-benchers of our obligations to the principle of unity and asked for our continued loyalty to the Coalition Government, and we are going to comply; but I am going to suggest that the obligation lies not only upon back-bench Members of all parties, but also upon the Government themselves. I would ask the Government, with great sincerity and respect, not to allow themselves to yield to the importunities of or political pressure from one partner in the Coalition, so as, by so doing, to strain unduly the loyalty and assent of the other parties. This intervening period which we know is in front of us will not be an easy one. The Prime Minister himself is fully aware of that fact. I would appeal to the Government not to make it harder for us back-benchers of all parties, nor, indeed, harder for themselves, by bringing forward unduly controversial legislation and thus to strain the bonds of unity too far. If the Government do insist upon doing so, and I hope that they will not, then they must not be surprised if those of us who are unwilling to sacrifice vital and sincere principles upon the altar of expediency show our disapproval in the Division Lobbies. I presume that the Prime Minister's pledge still stands, that he will not introduce&#x2014;</p>

<p>I will only recall to mind the statement of the Prime Minister, which must, with all respect, have some bearing upon this issue. I would merely ask the Government not to allow themselves to forget that statement, and I assure them that those of us who are among the rank and file in this House are certainly not going to allow them to forget it.</p>

<p>I am one of the hon. Members of this House who is not very anxious to support this Bill. I would rather see a new House of


Commons that had the people behind it, but, unfortunately, there is no alternative but to vote for the Bill. I hope that the next 9 or 12 months will not be a period in which we shall see the Government introducing controversial legislation, and I say that in support of the observations of the hon. and gallant Member for East Renfrew (Major Lloyd). It is quite possible for the Government to be subtle and to think "We will not survive the next election and we will make hay while the sun shines," and in that spirit to proceed to promote Bills which they know would not have a chance in the next Parliament, if it should be of the political complexion which I expect it to be. I also hope that some effort will be made by the Government Whips or some other body to put an end to absenteeism at Westminster.</p>

<p>I will approach the point from another angle. By giving the Third Reading to this Bill we give a new lease of Parliamentary life to a lot of hon. Members who do not deserve it. I refer to those Members who rarely put in an appearance here and leave it to others to undertake the responsibility of seeing legislation through in a very critical period. Something should be done. If we are going to extend the life of this Parliament there must be better attendance. Further, I think something should be done about hon. Members who, through the Press, give notice of their intention of not seeking re-election.</p>

<p>Well, I shall have to be careful of what I say, and I do feel that to extend the life of this Parliament does give an unfair privilege to certain Members who do not attend to their duties. I hope I am not out of Order in saying that. I am very keen that the period for which this Bill has extended the life of Parliament shall be really a live period, with the greatest interest in the

business of Parliament being displayed by hon. Members. With these few words I have no alternative but to support the Third Reading.</p>

<p>That was my interpretation of what the hon. and gallant Member said, and I think the meaning is much the same. He will no doubt remember that people in different parts of the House, who belong to different parties, have very strong feelings on the matter too, and it is necessary to compromise. I feel sure that the Government are animated with a desire to bring forward Measures which will give the maximum amount of satisfaction, but will certainly not please everyone. I support the Third Reading of this Bill. I can see no alternative to it at the present time. I am sure that the House, as a whole, will desire to respond to the appeal of the Prime Minister to give the Government every possible support until the war against Germany is won. Then, as the Prime Minister has indicated and as it is well put in a leading article in "The Times" this morning, there will be a consultation of the people some time during the next 12 months before this Bill comes to an end. The Bill enables a General Election to be held at any time within the next 12 months, and I venture to think&#x2014;and these are my last words&#x2014;that the electors then will focus their attention on the various White Papers on reconstruction laid before us and the test they will apply will be past record, sincerity, speed and vigour as represented by the different parties and candidates, and by that test they will be guided in the decision they make as to the formation of the next Parliament.</p>

<p>I rise to support the Third Reading of this


Bill. I welcome the fact, not from the point of view of any personal reasons, that this Parliament should not be ended at this particular period of the war. As I said a week or so ago, we are going through a period of crisis, and I think it highly desirable that all parties, in view of the blood that may be shed in the next few months, should hold together. But I would also like to support what has been said by the hon. and gallant Member for East Renfrew (Major Lloyd). In order to keep this Parliament together, it does not rest entirely upon the Members of the Parliament; it also rests very much on the Government, and I would say definitely that the Government must think twice before they present highly controversial Measures to this House, as my hon. and gallant Friend has said.</p>

<p>I merely followed the line of my hon. and gallant Friend, and the hon. Member should wait to hear my argument. Of course the Government should come to this House with Measures to say that we must embark upon the future peace well prepared. Of course we must. Of course the Government must come to the House and say that the men returning will have full employment and so on, but the Government must not, to my mind, bring in schemes which cut right into fundamental principles.

In my opinion, if we are going to continue the Parliament for perhaps six, seven, eight or nine months, then all of us must be prepared to compromise, but not to tread on each other's toes too much, as otherwise Parliament may well come to a disastrous end.</p>

<p>Everybody knows that these questions are closely allied, but I propose to direct by remarks to the question of the quality of Parliament as it affects the quality of the Government, and the real point is that if this Parliament is dissolved now and we have an election on party lines while the European war is still going on&#x2014;that is in Order, I think&#x2014;the chances are, seeing what the quality of this Parliament has been, that we should get returned some party&#x2014;I am not going to say whether Left or Right&#x2014;which, especially during the period when the


men who are still at the Front cannot return, would be of such poor quality that the party which was in a majority could not produce a competent Government to carry on the war. Heaven knows I am not an admirer of many of those who have been doing it. Heaven knows it would have been considerably worse if they had been all Conservative, all Labour or all Liberal, for I cannot see in any of the parties enough people of courage, initiative, ability and of really good brain to make a Government work.

<p>I beg to move,
<q>That the Fish Sales (Charges) (No. 2) Order, 1944, dated 13th October, 1944, made by the Treasury under Section 2 of the Emer-

gency Powers (Defence) Act, 1939, a copy of which Order was presented on 19th October, be approved.</q>
I think that by this time the House is accustomed to the recurrence of this Fish Sales (Charges) Order and is fairly well aware that the purpose for which the levy is imposed by this Order is to provide a fund out of which the Ministry pays carriage on fish in order to secure the widest possible distribution. This Order replaces the Fish Sales (Charges) Order, 1944, which has been in operation since 13th May, and was approved by the House on 8th June. The present Order came into force on 21st October and, on the same date, the Fish (Maximum Prices) (No. 2) Order, 1944, came into force increasing producers' prices for the winter months. The purpose of the present Order is to make corresponding reductions in the rate of charge in respect of first-hand sales of white fish. The Maximum Prices Order to which I referred increases producers' maximum selling prices of white fish by 11d. a stone, thus affording them some encouragement to fish during the difficult winter months. The charge payable by the first buyer is therefore reduced by the same amount, that is 11d., from 1s. per stone to 1d. per stone, so that there is no increase in the total buying cost or in the maximum price to the consumer. It has been our objective to have a uniform maximum price throughout the year. The rate of levy in respect of herring, pilchards and mackerel remains unchanged at 9d. a stone. These rates are the same as operated last winter. We did not change the levy on pelagic fish for reasons which have been explained to the House, and the reason for imposing different rates in summer and winter is to achieve the dual ends of seasonable prices to the producer and a stable price to the consumer.</p>

<p>I am in full agreement with the purposes of this Order, but there is one point which I would like to put to my right hon. Friend. It says at the end of paragraph 2:
<q>Provided that, if fish is bought on first hand sale through a licensed wholesale merchant selling on commission at or from premises situate elsewhere than at the port of landing, the said charge shall be paid by the licensed wholesale merchant who shall be entitled to recover the amount of the charge paid in respect of fish so bought from the buyer thereof.</q>


This is a point purely of administration. In the past there has been considerable delay in recovering these payments, and I want my right hon. Friend&#x2014;I do not ask him for an answer now&#x2014;to look into the point and see whether it will be possible to make the necessary reduction at the beginning, instead of having to transmit all the money South and then have it repaid back, perhaps two or three months later, and whether it would not be an easier bookkeeping transaction and prevent unnecessary delays and some inconvenience to certain sections of the trade if the whole thing could be got through, as it were, in one mouthful. I have had some complaints on that matter and I am wondering whether my right hon. Friend would give an undertaking to look into the administration.</p>

<p>I am glad that my hon. Friend has raised that point, because I hope that at some future date my right hon. Friend may be able to give us an answer to it. I do not know whether my right hon. Friend would be willing, on this occasion, to say a word or two about the way in which the distribution of fish under the Ministry of Food is being performed now. As he explained, the purpose of the levy is to create a fund to enable the Minister of Food to pay the cost of carriage. I think it would be in Order, and it would certainly be of great interest to the whole country, if we were informed now how that scheme of wider distribution of fish is proceeding. We have had Debates here indicating that distribution was by no means satisfactory to all. I think it is better now than it was, but it still remains true, as I think all here would agree, that there are places where one can get fish and other places where one cannot get fish, and it is with the greatest difficulty that one attempts to persuade one's housewife friends that it is all being done for the best. I do not want to ask something which my right hon. Friend is not prepared to answer now, but it would be very interesting if he could say something on that point.</p>

<p>My hon. Friends and myself support this extension of the variation of the Order and we are not aware of any serious complaints against its operation. I want

to say, also, that in the transport world we find it is a very great convenience, since it focuses all the charges into a common payment, and the operation of cartage is a great help to the railways where staff is short and traffic has enormously increased owing to war circumstances, and everyone is under a very great strain. Therefore, the arrangement with the Government is most excellent, and I would like to commend it and to say that we would like to see the necessary modifications for the winter season brought into operation.</p>

After fish, may I say chips? This Order, which imposes levies on certain types of potato sales at the rates which have applied during the last three seasons, involves nothing new. We have to introduce it at the beginning of every potato


season. It begins to operate on 1st November, roughly the beginning of the subsidised potato crop season, and ends with the end of the potato crop season. The levy is paid into the Ministry of Food, Potato Division, account, and the Order imposes charges on sales of ware potatoes, with certain exceptions set out in the Schedule, that is to say, potatoes that are passed into human consumption and others which were not originally intended for that purpose, at the following rates: On sale by licensed grower-salesmen, that is growers licensed to sell direct to retailers who are not licensed potato dealers themselves, and on sales made through licensed auctioneers, or under special licence, at the rate of Is. a ton. On sales by licensed potato buyers, that is to say retailers licensed to buy direct from the growers, at the rate of 2s. 6d. a ton.<br/>
It is provided that not more than one charge shall be paid when potatoes pass through the hands of two licencees who otherwise would be liable to pay. The levies do not increase the price to the consumer at all. They are direct impositions on the traders who do not use the normal wholesale channels, and this evens things out. The approval of the National Potatoes Advisory Committee, which is representative of all sections of the potato industry, has been obtained to this procedure and so, in presenting it to the House, we are able to report that it is agreeable to those concerned in this industry.</p>

<p>I rise at very short notice indeed to raise a matter which I raised at Question time to-day, the supply of bound volumes of HANSARD to hon. Members. The Financial Secretary to the Treasury has intimated that he will be present shortly, and I apologise to him for the very short notice that has been given. I would like to put a few points which have occurred, I think, to all hon. Members. Why should Members of this House be short of the necessary equipment to carry out their duty? Within the last two or three years the Prime Minister made a speech about the rebuilding of this House, and in it he said, if I remember rightly, that the House of Commons was of as great a value as a battleship, and that it should be properly equipped. What should we think if we found a battleship in which the sailors had to buy their own ammunition, and in which we found, when materials became rusty and unusable, that they were not replaced on the ground that there was too great a shortage and so no further equipment could be found? I think that we should at once question the conduct of the Admiralty in that connection. We should say that the Admiralty is responsible for equipping its battleships properly. In just the same way we say that the Treasury is responsible for equipping this House properly in the matter of HANSARD. I would go further than that and say that there can be few Government officials who would not complain if they did not get the necessary equipment and books of reference in their Departments. If Government officials are entitled to have their books of reference, surely this House is entitled to its books of reference.<br/>
I know it will be said that one can always go to the Library, but there are 615 Members of this House, and it is for their convenience that they should have these bound volumes of HANSARD at hand


so that they can get them, when they require them, in their own homes. I shall be told that the Select Committee has already reported on this matter. I would like to read the relevant passage in the Report of the Select Committee. Paragraph 5 says:
<q>The decision to suspend the free issue of bound volumes of HANSARD was originally taken in consequence of the report from Your Committee in 1940.</q>
I ask hon. Members to recall the conditions that existed in 1940; they were very different from the conditions which exist today. The Report refers to the acute shortage of labour and materials, and then we get this very revealing sentence:
<q>Your Committee are informed that this decision resulted in an estimated annual saving of about three tons of paper.</q>
All we ask&#x2014;and hon. Members on all sides have asked it, I think, quite clearly this morning&#x2014;is that three tons of paper should be released in order that we may have this equipment which is so necessary to our work. To-day industry is turning over in many cases from war to peace production. Surely in this very small instance we might have a turnover so that we can be given the paper we require. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman when he replies will take note of the very strong feeling in all parts of the House on this matter, and that he will realise that the public will not feel that the House of Commons in doing this are giving themselves something they are not giving to other people. The recommendation of the Select Committee is only a recommendation, and the House, of course, has the power to override it if necessary. Realising what the House feels on this matter, I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will do the sensible thing and will say that he is willing to reverse this very unfortunate decision.</p>

<p>I would like to support what has been said by the hon. Member for West Bromwich (Mr. Dugdale) in his request to the Treasury that this facility which has been taken away from hon. Members should now be restored. It is obvious that Members, during the time the House is not sitting, must of necessity be in their constituencies or at places where these official volumes are not available to them. It is essential, if they are to attempt to discharge their duties with that efficiency

which the public have a right to demand at this time, that any official documents&#x2014;so desire them. In his reply at Question whether they be records of the proceedings of this House or other publications &#x2014;should be available to Members if they time to-day the Treasury representative based his refusal on the Report of the Select Committee. Paragraph 5 has already been referred to by my hon. Friend. but I would like to quote further from that paragraph, which goes on to say:
<q>No evidence has been submitted to show that the shortages in view of which the decision was taken have been sufficiently alleviated.</q>
Was any evidence invited? As far as I know, no hon. Member who has raised this question and requested the Treasury to re-issue these bound volumes free to all Members, was ever called before this Select Committee, or, indeed, ever had an opportunity of expressing his views.<br/>
If my right hon. Friend bases his case on the shortage of labour and materials, evidence is constantly brought before hon. Members of an enormous amount of publications and literature which flood our post-boxes every day and in, I think, quite honestly the view of the majority of Members, quite unnecessarily. These have no connection at all with our official duties, but HANSARD is only available in the Library of this House, and, owing to the shortages, which we do not deny, is not available in the public libraries in our constituencies, and has been denied to the schools of this country, so that when we are in various parts of the country it is utterly impossible for us to consult this publication which is so essential for the efficient discharge of our duties. Some hon. Members of this House over a period of years have built up their own collection of these volumes. What this restriction really amounts to is a reduction in the salary of a Member of Parliament. We have, by the will of the House, agreed to make a contribution to the pensions fund which hon. Members enjoy under certain circumstances. No one quarrels with that. But here we have an additional charge which is deducted from our salaries in order to pay for these essential documents. The House has never agreed to such a course; the issue has never been submitted, and it must be obvious to the Financial Secretary and the whole House


to-day that if the House had had an opportunity of considering this matter on its merits they might well have taken a different view from the Select Committee. In view of that, I hope my right hon. Friend will take an early opportunity of reconsidering his decision.</p>

<p>I am glad indeed that my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich (Mr. Dugdale) has raised this matter so very promptly after this morning's episode at Question time. I am quite sure that if more hon. Members had known that it was coming on now, and if it had not occurred at this particular time of the day, the right hon. Gentleman the Financial Secretary to the Treasury would have had a very much larger number of Members to deal with, and that, judging from what was said this morning, they would have been quite unanimous in their support of the remarks made by my hon. Friend. Both hon. Members who have spoken so far have quoted from Paragraph 5 of the report of the Select Committee, and I would like to repeat one sentence from that paragraph, to which the hon. and gallant Member for South Cardiff (Sir A. Evans) referred:
<q>No evidence has been submitted to show that the shortages in view of which the decision was taken have been sufficiently alleviated.</q>
I wonder why no evidence was submitted. Was no evidence asked for? Did not the Select Committee consider it their duty to go fairly deeply into a matter like this, and ask for evidence to be submitted to show whether extra paper was obtainable? The hon. and gallant Member for South Cardiff referred to the mass of pamphlets, leaflets and documents of all kinds which load our mail-bags. That is true, and I quite agree with him that a great deal of it is pure trash, and a quite unnecessary waste of paper. But, on the other hand, I can see that certain difficulties would arise if you tried to censor or stop the publication of pamphlets, or leaflets, or material of that kind; and in any case I believe&#x2014;no doubt the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&#x2014;that all that kind of miscellaneous junk, if I may so call it, is almost always printed on what is known as free paper, and not on the paper which is allocated to publishers of either books or newspapers.<br/>
If the Select Committee had bothered &#x2014;as I think they should have&#x2014;to ask for evidence to be submitted about the alleviation or otherwise of the shortage, I think they would have found that in some respects the shortage had been alleviated. Newpapers and periodicals, within the last year, have been allowed one or two slight increases in their allocation of paper. Those increases have been a very small percentage of the toal consumption, but this increase we are asking for is infinitesimal. Three tons of paper a year must be an infinitesimal percentage of the total tonnage of paper consumed for all purposes in this country. Therefore, I hope the right hon. Gentleman will think again and decide to take other advice than that of this Select Committee.<br/>
One point which I do not think was mentioned at Question time is that the Members of another place still receive, I believe, the bound volumes of their HANSARD free. Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman will also confirm or deny that. If that is the case, then this does seem to be the most extraordinary and unfair discrimination between the Members of another place and the Members of this House. As has been so rightly said, these volumes of HANSARD are really a part of essential tools of our trade. I personally, as quite a new Member of this House, find that the rows of bound volumes which I have accumulated already are quite invaluable when constituents call to see me at my home with their problems, or I have to write to them. Having the full index available is the greatest possible help in dealing with all sorts of problems.<br/>
There is another point which is not strictly relevant to this, but which I hope I may be allowed to put, since I gather that we have plenty of time. I was going to ask a question of the Chair, by Private Notice, about it in a few days' time. It is such a trivial point that I think I may detain the House with it for a minute now, rather than raise it by Private Notice later, at the end of Question time. Moreover, it also arises out of the Report of the same Committee, and although it is not a matter for which the right hon. Gentleman is responsible&#x2014;it is a matter which comes under the Chair&#x2014;perhaps I may be allowed to put it on record now in the hope that Mr. Speaker, in his wisdom, may see fit to look into it. The


Select Committee have now decided that all the note-paper we use in this House, in the Library and elsewhere, is to have the crest printed on it instead of die-stamped. They have now decided that these horrible little mauve crests are to become the universal style of the notepaper of this House. I do not know what other Members feel, but I think these mauve printed crests look extremely shoddy and unworthy of the dignity of the House of Commons note-paper. I make that remark in passing, in the hope that Mr. Speaker may see fit to consider the matter and consult with other hon. Members to see what they think about this recommendation of the Select Committee &#x2014;which already, unfortunately, has been put into effect, for the Report states that
<q>the Serjeant at Arms was informed of these resolutions and gave orders to His Majesty's Stationery Office to print accordingly.</q>
I think that was a most unfortunate decision, and I hope it will be reversed. In conclusion, I would only say how very warmly I wish to support my hon. Friend who has raised the question of the free issue to Members of the bound volumes of HANSARD.</p>

<p>I wish briefly to support what has been said. The whole question is this: Can Members perform their duties more efficiently with these bound volumes of HANSARD? There is no one who will deny that they can. If one has to keep the daily parts there is great difficulty in keeping them in order &#x2014;at least, that is my experience&#x2014;but a bound volume can be referred to much more readily, and it means a great deal of time saving in giving a quick answer to a constituent's question. I say that these bound volumes should be supplied to Members. As to the cost, there are many in this House who must give away 10 to 50 times the quantity of paper which is included in these volumes. Some time ago, for instance, I turned out my office and gave away more than three tons of paper for salvage. I understand that another three tons of paper is the amount involved in this request, and I appeal to my right hon. Friend to reconsider this matter. I am loath to say or do anything which criticises the work of a Select Committee, or any other committee, because I fully realise that their intentions are perfectly honest, and probably they had information which has been

denied to us, but I think that this question is one which ought to be ruled by common sense.</p>

<p>I think that this is the first opportunity that the House has had of offering to the right hon. Gentleman opposite sincere congratulations on his promotion to the post of Financial Secretary to the Treasury. [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] That seems to have gone down very well, so I hope that he will give a favourable reply to this request to mark his assumption of office. The position, so far as I can remember it, is that six or eight months ago the right hon. Gentleman's predecessor told the House that only some 60 Members of 615 were in the habit of buying bound volumes of HANSARD. That is about 10 per cent. and probably those who spent the sum involved, about &#x00A3;5 a year, were those who were best able to do so, which, as I tried to suggest in a supplementary question this morning, is rather placing an obstacle in the way of others, on the basis of ability to pay. That, as I am sure we would all agree, is quite unjustified, and I therefore hope that the right hon. Gentleman will signify the Treasury's altered view. I think it is quite important not only to have the immediate bound volumes of HANSARD but those for the last two or three years, if that can be done. For an hon. Member preparing a speech on a particular subject, it is essential to look back to see what has been said on previous occasions. It is not simply a matter of answering questions by constituents; it is a matter of being able to prepare a proper case, because I am sure that most hon. Members find, as I do, that they are able to do better work at home than they are in the Library when the House is sitting.<br/>
I raised some time ago the question of the right of Members to have reprints of their own speeches, or other speeches, for circulation in their constituencies, if they desired, and were prepared to pay for them. The House will remember that the right hon. Gentleman's predecessor announced that Members could have only 1,000 reprints of their own speeches, and were not allowed to buy reprints of other Members' speeches, even if they had their permission. In these days, when the amount of room that the national Press can and does devote to Parliamentary

reports is limited, and in particular in connection with the reports of speeches made by the minority in the House, I think any other opening that Members have for circulating views that are not necessarily those of the Government should be as wide as possible.<br/>
I think the Treasury should now reverse the situation that arose six or eight months ago. I raised this matter at that time with Mr. Speaker, as one of Privilege. I see no justification why the Executive, the Government, should, by the direction of paper supplies and labour, limit the constitutional rights and privileges of any Member in a matter of this kind. It is a wrong interference by the Executive with rights which have been established for many years, since the time when Mr. Hansard gave up printing the daily parts and it was taken over by His Majesty's Stationery Office. Therefore this is a constitutional principle which should be supported, and I am sure would be if there were any way of testing the feeling of the House except by speeches alone.<br/>
We must always be aware of the risk of certain powers that be trying to derogate from the importance of Parliament and the rights and privileges of Members. I think the House ought one day to consider going a good deal further than we are asking it to go now. We are not just Members for our own constituencies but Members for Britain, and I think Members should have a right of free travel to any part of the country, provided that it is in performance of their public duty. I have often been asked, and I am sure others have, to go and investigate the situation in a certain dockyard at Portsmouth, or to go into the question of whether certain treatment was being meted out properly to various people. At present Members only have free travel between their constituencies and here, but it is important to bear in mind that we are Members of Parliament for the whole country, and, so long as we confine our journeys to our public duties, we should also have free travel as well as free copies of the bound volumes of HANSARD, and unlimited reprints of any speech that we might wish to have reprinted. The Executive must not, by direction of labour or paper, limit the privileges and rights of Members of Parliament. Last but not

least, we should have the right to go free to address public meetings in the right hon. Gentleman's constituency.</p>

<p>When we consider whether or not it is desirable that we should have bound volumes of HANSARD, it is a matter that ought to be considered from two points of view. Is it in the interests of democracy that Members should have bound volumes, and is any good purpose served, such as economy of paper or economy of labour, by denying us that privilege? I believe it was estimated that the abolition of the bound volumes of HANSARD would save some three tons of paper. That was first brought up at a time when the question of the paper supply was undoubtedly of very great urgency. We should be able to appreciate that urgency more fully were it not for the fact that every day publications which in no sense whatever can be said to serve any useful purpose shower into our letter boxes. I do not believe that denying us the bound volumes of HANSARD results in economy of paper, but very much the reverse. A Member having bound volumes can refer to them at any time he chooses. Many Members have not been able to keep daily copies because some of us have been blitzed, and some of us have had to move our houses a very large number of times, and the only way to get the HANSARD to which one may wish to refer is either to make a journey to the House of Commons Library&#x2014;and we are constantly urged not to indulge in unnecessary travel&#x2014;or to apply to the Vote Office. A large number of Members have told me that they have done that and looked up the speech to which they wish to refer and then thrown the copy away. It would be interesting if an estimate could be made of the paper that has been wasted in that way. If that is the idea of economy of paper, no case has been made out for it.<br/>
I concur in every word that the last speaker said. I regard this as a matter of very real importance. There is no possible doubt that, if you wish democracy to work, you have to make it possible for Members of Parliament to do their work efficiently, and I believe that at present there are a very large number of barriers in our way. The question of travel is not only difficult but it is beyond the means of a very large number of


Members. If we want secretarial help, an efficient secretary to-day is not only almost impossible to find but, if you find one, you have to pay a salary outside anything which a Member of Parliament, on the salaries they are paid, could possibly hope to pay unless they have private means. I maintain that a Member of Parliament should be able to do his work whether he has means outside his Parliamentary salary or not. All of us who attempt to serve our constituencies adequately are faced by the most appalling bill for postage and telegraphing. I believe that we should in the interests of efficiency be supplied with free, efficient secretaries and, where a Member does not need the whole-time service of a secretary, there should be secretaries to share the work of several Members. I do not ask for that as a privilege for individual Members of Parliament. I ask it as something to enable us to do the work we are sent here to do.<br/>
To be so pettifogging as to deny bound volumes of HANSARD and say that that is in the national interest for economy of paper, or because you have not a sufficient number of people to bind the volumes, is in my opinion to have no sense of relative values. Democracy is something that we have to fight very hard if we wish to preserve, not only in days of war but when the so-called peace arrives. Democracy is something which you have to work to preserve and which you have to arouse the interest of the people to preserve, and the best way to do it is to ensure that Members of Parliament shall be efficient and shall be given means whereby to do their work. To do away with the bound volumes is petty, stupid, idiotic economy, unhelpful to Members of Parliament and certainly unhelpful to democracy.</p>

<p>With regard to bound volumes of HANSARD, I gather that the actual trouble is the work of binding. There was a time when we were told we could not have HANSARD for two or three days, but the indignation of the House put that right in a few hours. Many things have been achieved during the war and we ought to be able to achieve the idea of binding HANSARD and not binding something else. If that is the trouble, it would be possible to have the parts stoutly stitched for the time being.

One must remember, too, that there is this very considerable disadvantage in the day-to-day HANSARD. The natural result of the combination of Members who do not speak up and reporters situated some distance away from them is that there are inaccuracies in the day-to-day copies, which are corrected in the volume. On one occasion a quotation was made from a daily part, and the Member alluded to got up and said: "I said nothing of the sort and, if you look in the bound volume, it has been corrected." With regard to paying Members' fares, I would point out that before the last war the German Government&#x2014;in ordinary matters the meanest on earth, and paying its Members a very small salary indeed&#x2014;provided its Members with a season ticket over all railway lines. It may be that it would be wrong to do that at the moment, because we want to keep travel down, but I would ask the Financial Secretary to consider this. Let him get some of his experts to form an estimate of what it would cost to give a season ticket to Members of Parliament over all lines. I have an impression that it would come to less than 30s. a week. Let him see what he actually pays and he will find that it it a great deal more than 30s., so that it would be a saving for the Government as well as saving a lot of time and paper.<br/>
I do not know that at any time they provided secretaries in Germany but they do in Sweden, the United States and Canada. That is impracticable at the moment, because you cannot get a good secretary, I will not say for love, but certainly not for money. The time will come, however, when it will be possible. The employment of a secretary makes a tremendous difference to one's efficiency. If I had no secretary I should either go mad, or leave the House. If we start the next Parliament with the idea that every Member has to be given a competent secretary, it will make all the difference in the world to the efficiency of the nation and of Parliament, because the old gentlemen who are just passengers and have no use for a secretary, would be much more easily pushed out by younger men who would really do their job. There are Members who spend hours writing letters in the Library. If they once got the knack of having a competent secretary, they would save two or three hours a day in which they could study the points that they wish to bring up in the


House. The only suggestion I have to make in addition to what the hon. Lady has said, is that it should be the duty of every appointed secretary to report on how much work she was getting, and if she was not getting enough work her employer should be "carpeted" by his constituency association.</p>

<p>I would have preferred this Adjournment discussion to have taken place at the normal pre-arranged time, because I have not ready the information that I really wanted. I have looked back at the detailed evidence that was submitted in 1940, when the decision on the bound volumes of HANSARD was taken. This matter has twice this year come before the Publications and Debates Committee, of which I am Chairman, and, relying on the evidence of 1940, we have seen no reason to alter our decision because there has not been much amelioration in the paper supply or in the labour available.</p>

<q>No evidence has been submitted to show that the shortages have been alleviated.</q>

<p>But we must be realistic about it; three tons adds up. I am one of the few Members who availed themselves of the free copy of the bound HANSARD. It used to go to my constituency, and was used for reference purposes by anybody who wished to consult it. I miss it and I would again readily avail myself of it, if it was possible to issue it, but I am not prepared to pay for it. It is obvious that while the war is on we cannot get everything as it was in prewar times, and there are bound to be a large number of restrictions. There seems

to be no alleviation in the paper shortage, and there is certainly no alleviation in the labour shortage, and the Committee could see no reason why, this year, our previous decision should be altered. It may be possible to vary it in a few months' time&#x2014;</p>

<p>Is it not true that six or eight months ago the Newspaper Proprietors' Association released 10 to 12&#x00BD; per cent. more newsprint to the Press; that some of it was not taken up; and that the "News of the World," with a circulation of 4,500,000, was able by this increase to make it 5,000,000?

<p>We did discuss that point, but not technically. We understand that newsprint is not suitable for the printing of HANSARD, which does not use the same type of paper. The Committee have considered the matter twice this year and they have tried to be realistic about it.

<p>Does my hon Friend appreciate that the ordinary daily issues have no index, and that, if one is anxious to look up a speech, there is no possible way of finding it? Did my hon.

<p>We did make inquiries, and the conclusion was that the general opinion of Members was, "We would be glad to have it as soon as it is possible to get it." I appreciate what my hon. and gallant Friend has said about an index. That is one of the reasons why I availed myself of the free issue. The Committee are now considering the question of an index separate from the bound volumes, with only a paper binding, so that Members can look up items in individual daily copies. The Committee are as anxious to make free bound volumes available as hon. Members are, but we ask them to be realist in the present situation, which is only a temporary one. The Committee will be glad to make the free issues available again as soon as it is possible to do so.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Newport (Sir R. Clarry) appealed to us to be realist in this matter, and we cannot do any better than ask his Committee to be the same. The suggestion for a separate index to the loose copies of HANSARD is too foolish to be considered. A Member who wants to go anywhere will, if he has to consult the OFFICIAL REPORT over a period, have to carry about 200 copies with him, with the separate index. The suggestion that the newsprint which has been released is not suitable for HANSARD is no answer. It is not the newsprint which is the trouble but the pulp. The question whether you produce paper for newsprint or for paper suitable for HANSARD is merely a question of what the mixture is for the making of the paper. Pulp is the controlling factor, and it is astounding that the Committee have not gone into it more closely. The hon. and learned Member for North Hammersmith (Mr. Pritt), who, apart from being a Member of the House, is a distinguished member of the legal profession, has told us that he could not afford to purchase the bound copy of HANSARD. If a Member of the legal profession cannot afford to buy a bound copy, I do not know who can. Those Members who are dependent on their Parliamentary salary most certainly cannot.<br/>
There is something very fundamental about this question. One of the things which will be essential in the immediate post-war period is that the public of this country should have confidence in this House. One of the things which I fear is the growing cynicism about this House among the people. One of the reasons for it, is that so frequently this House is sparsely populated. Perhaps this is a point that I ought not to raise, because I have been an infrequent attender myself of late, owing to being otherwise engaged, but I am speaking of the pre-war period. The House is so often sparsely populated because so many Members are tied down in the Libraries typing letters for three, four and five hours a day. It is a disgraceful business that a man who comes here to represent 100,000 people, who has some knowledge of the difficulties of his people, and who has a contribution to make to the governing of the country and the prevention of future wars, has to make himself into a third-rate clerk and typist and spend most of his time typing

letters to his constituents. He has to do that because he cannot afford a secretary. Membership of Parliament is the most sweated of all the industries. It is the only industry which has never had a rise during the war. I am not advocating that it should, because that would be unpopular. Nevertheless, it is true, and any Member who has tried to exist on &#x00A3;600 a year knows that it is a physical impossibility unless he lives near the borderline of poverty.<br/>
If we persist in treating Members as we do now, we shall perpetuate a system of subsidised Members of Parliament. They will be subsidised on the one side from industry, and on the other side from the trade union movement. Both forms of subsidy are undesirable. It will destroy the independence of the Member of Parliament. The Member, however, cannot exist unless he is subsidised in some shape or form. The Government ought to consider whether the time has not arrived when Members should be treated, at any rate, as well as those of some of our Dominions. When I was in Canada in 1942, I found that for every two Members of Parliament an office and a secretary were provided. Members are free to spend half an hour going through their letters before the House sits, and they are then able to go into the Chamber and do the job for which they were elected. In this House, if someone asks for you, you have to wander round draughty passages in order to find a seat, and then, in the full public gaze with people passing all the time, you have to discuss the most intimate details of cases which are brought before you. What a disgusting thing in this Parliament of the Empire that there is not a room&#x2014;unless you care to take your visitor into the smokeroom, the bar, or the dining room&#x2014;where you can discuss anything intimately with a constituent. It is a disgrace which the Government ought to remedy speedily.<br/>
There will be a big change in the constitution of this House after the present Parliament. I do not mean that politically. I am only pointing out that a lot of Members are not coming back and new men will be coming in. I hope that many of them will be very independent Members with no attachment. The job of a Member of Parliament is a full-time job, as it ought to be. It should not be something which a man takes up when he


has reached the end of his industrial life and is no longer any use for controlling the companies in which he has directorships. It is something to which a man ought to come when he is at the height of his powers and is able to give of his best to the country. That is not possible now because there are very few men who can afford to come to the House unless they are prepared to live on a very low standard. That is disgraceful, and I hope that, as a result of this Debate, the Government will turn their attention to seeing that this House is able to fulfil its proper function in the best possible way.</p>

<p>The hon. and gallant Member for Lichfield (Captain Poole) referred to the fact that the reason we are not getting the bound HANSARD is the shortage of paper pulp. The raw material of paper pulp is straw, and throughout the country there are stacks of straw all over the place unused and unwanted. May I suggest to the Government that they should take some of this surplus straw, convert it into paper pulp, and convert that puly into HANSARDS, and thus give us the bound volumes?</p>

<p>I have been here for 23 years and a fairly regular attender at that. Like other hon. Members I have missed the bound volume very much. I found it handy for reference purposes. I am not convinced by what the hon. Member for Newport (Sir R. Clarry) has said, because there is still plenty of paper coming by post to Members of Parliament. You cannot for instance say that there is a paper shortage when approved societies are attacked. I think that every Member has already received a bound diary for 1945 from Boots Cash Chemists. I can, of course, do with a bound diary, but a bound volume of HANSARD is much more useful. I wonder what happened to the Committee which dealt with this question and what they were afraid of when they arrived at their decisions. I have visited other Parliaments and I can never understand why we are so much worse off by comparison with a Member of Parliament of the United States of America. I do not want us to go quite as far as they do there. I understand that if we did, I

could stand at this Box and say: "Mr. Speaker, here is my speech. I do not want to deliver it but I want it printed in HANSARD." I understand that they go further even than that. They can get copies of speeches printed free of charge, to send to their constituents. Some of us have talked about 100,000 voters, but the Americans can speak in terms of millions of constituents. Senators and Congressmen have marvellous offices in the United States of America as well as secretaries provided at public expense.<br/>
The hon. and gallant Member for Lichfield (Captain Poole) referred to people coming here who have followed other occupations. As we are talking in a homely way as Members of Parliament, may I be allowed to say what has happened to me? Hon. Members had better realise that if one takes a very unpopular minority line in politics, as I do, he probably gets one of the largest post bags of all. Indeed, my post bag is very heavy. Before I came here, I was a full-time trade union official, and hardly ever wrote a letter with my own hand; I dictated my correspondence. I am entitled here to dictate my letters in the bureau down below by paying for it, but I cannot get anybody because of shortage of staff, so consequently I have a typewriter in my hotel, and one at home, and I do most of my correspondence myself on the type-writer. That is what a Member of Parliament has to do in order to perform his duties. I hope that this Debate, based upon the publication of bound volumes of HANSARD, will raise the very much bigger issues which I have mentioned. I have seen the Parliaments at Sofia, Belgrade and Budapest. In fact, I am not sure that the Members of Parliament in Iceland are not better catered for than we are here.</p>

<p>The trouble however lies in the Treasury, the Department represented by the right hon. Gentleman; and now that he is new to the job, I hope that he will do something drastic to blow the cobwebs out of the Treasury. Indeed, when the nation can spend &#x00A3;14,000,000 a day on this war and hon. Members never ask a single question about passing &#x00A3;1,000,000,000, why should we be quibbling about a trifle like the bound volumes of HANSARD? There are some journalist Members present. If they care to publish a book they can still get it


published. There are plenty of new books published every week. I publish a book occasionally myself; but hon. Members cannot read them because they are in the Welsh language. I think there may be a bigger sale proportionate to the population for Welsh books than for English books just now. If an hon. Member of this House writes a book he can not only get it published; he can get it covered too. I am not sure that he would not get it covered more easily than he could get a bound volume of HANSARD. I do not want to talk party politics, but there is such a thing as a conservative-minded Chairman. If there was a radical-minded Chairman of that Committee on our official records he would make a plunge in favour of what has been claimed. Certainly, if he were a Socialist we should get bound copies for nothing, as was the case before the war.</p>

<p>I intervened only because the hon.

<p>I am building my argument on that point of conservatism. I conclude by making an appeal to the Treasury. The fault does not lie with the hon. Member for Newport. The trouble, of course, is beyond him. May I therefore ask the Financial Secretary, if he is going to reply to the Debate, to tell us that after a given date, not only shall we be able to get bound volumes of HANSARD free but that we shall also get back numbers covering the period for which we have not received them before</p>

<p>If I intervene now it is not because I wish to bring the Debate to an end&#x2014;I have no power to do so in any event&#x2014;but because, as I explained to the hon. Member for West Bromwich (Mr. Dugdale) when he gave me notice at Question time to-day that he hoped to bring this matter up, I have an engagement at 3 o'clock this afternoon elsewhere, and therefore I shall not be able to stay here if the Debate continues. I am sure that my hon. Friend will understand that, and further will understand my difficulty in obtaining all the information I required for this Debate between 12 noon to-day, when he gave me notice that he was going to raise it, and Five minutes to One when the Debate began.<br/>
It is an admirable rule and practice of this House that hon. Members may raise anything they please on the Debate for the Adjournment, but it is also a wise Ministerial practice to reply only to those matters of which some notice has been given. The hon. Member for Nuneaton (Mr. Bowles) and my hon. Friend the Member for Frome (Mrs. Tate) will, therefore, forgive me if I do not discuss the questions of travel throughout the United Kingdom, free secretarial assistance for Members of Parliament, better accommodation in the House, and so on. The matter which my hon. Friend raised was the discontinuance since 1940 of the issue of bound volumes of HANSARD free of charge to Members of this House. I would make three observations on this matter. First, from the point of view either of money or of material, this is a very small matter indeed. In the second place, it is not a matter in which Treasury Ministers, who are answerable for the Stationery Office in this House, have any departmental interest. It is purely and solely a question for the House of Commons. The only concern which the Treasury have in the question is to endeavour, so far as practicable, to carry out the wishes of the House.<br/>
In this matter, the House is advised by the Select Committee on Publications and Debates Reports, of which my hon. Friend the Member for Newport (Sir R. Clarry) is the Chairman. I would point out in the first place that this economy, which was introduced in 1940, was not asked for, so far as I am aware, by His Majesty's Government. It was initiated


by the Select Committee of that time. I have not very much doubt in my mind that they thought&#x2014;I think it was in May, 1940&#x2014;that it was desirable for this House to set an example of economy in some small way to the nation as a whole, and to give a lead to the great campaign initiated about that time for savings of all possible kinds.<br/>
What has been the result? Before the 1940 economy there were 294 Members of this House taking bound sets of the OFFICIAL REPORT. At the present time there are only 62. The decision taken in 1940 did not preclude a Member obtaining a set of the bound volumes. What it meant was that he had to pay for it if he desired to have it. I am not at all convinced that there is very much connection between the introduction of the charge for the bound volumes and the decrease in the number of bound sets which have been asked for. I believe that very many Members gave up taking their bound volumes in 1940, not because it was going to cost them &#x00A3;4 or &#x00A3;5 a year to obtain a set, but because they thought that it was the right thing to do.</p>

<p>As one of those who gave up taking the bound volumes in that year, may I say that I did so solely and wholly for financial reasons?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1944-11-07a.1327.1" hansard_membership_id="10532" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/21417" speakername="Mr. Tinker" colnum="1327" time="">

<p>I am not saying that there are not Members for whom the question of cost was decisive in this matter, but, speaking for myself, I do not believe that if the privilege of obtaining the volumes free of charge were now to be restored, the number of sets asked for would immediately go back to the number it was in 1940. Therefore, from the point of view of money or of material, I say that this is a very small matter indeed. It would involve only two or three tons of paper and probably less than &#x00A3;1,000.<br/>
Some persons are born mean, some achieve meanness and others have meanness thrust upon them. In this matter, the Treasury stand in the third category because we have to have meanness thrust upon us. The only concern of the Treasury here is to carry out the desires of this House which, so far as we have

hitherto been able to interpret them, have been expressed by the Select Committee presided over by my hon. Friend who sits behind me. We have had this little meanness, as I expect my hon. Friend the Member for Westhoughton (Mr. Rhys Davies) would describe it, thrust upon us; and when my hon. Friend points to the Treasury, and says "They are the people who are behind this," I can assure him that he is utterly and completely mistaken.</p>

<p>Now the hon. Member is trying to lead me on to a very wide issue. On this question all we are concerned to do is to try to carry out the wishes of the House itself. It was the wish of the House in 1940, I think, that this economy should be made and when the matter was brought up before the Select Committee as recently as 12th October last, the decision taken in 1940 was confirmed, upon a Division in the Committee in which, I believe, four Members voted in favour of the recommendation that the economy be continued and the hon. and gallant Member for Ormskirk (Commander King-Hall) voted alone in the other sense. There is, of course, a good deal of room for difference of opinion as to the value of the bound volumes. I have heard of cases in which Members have passed over their bound volumes to some public institution or political institution with which they have happened to be concerned. I have even heard of a case, in the old days when Ireland was represented in this House, in which an hon. Member's bound volumes found their way direct to a bookseller with orders to be realised forthwith upon the Member's behalf.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that they fetched something like the cost price. It is perfectly clear from the Debate we have heard to-day that there is a considerable number of Members who are desirous of having this privilege once more restored to them. Our only difficulty in this connection is to interpret the wishes of the House of Commons. There is set


up, by Sessional Order, the Select Committee on Publications and Debates Reports. The Chairman of the Committee has expressed his view in this Debate today, and my hon. Friend opposite will also, no doubt, have something to say on the matter. This is essentially a House of Commons matter and the House as a whole will have a first-class opportunity of expressing its view on it when the new Session begins, and the Motion for setting up the Select Committee is once more before the House.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman has mentioned that something like 297 Members indicated that they wanted the bound volume. He said that only 297 ever took it. I think they had to indicate somehow or other, at the beginning of each Session, that they wanted it. That figure represents about half the House of Commons. Could he not resume the old procedure by which those who want the bound volumes can indicate their desire in the old way, and those who do not want them do not have to have them at all? In any case why I should be prevented from having them even if there is a majority or not who do not wish me to have them, passes my comprehension.</p>

<p>From the Stationery Office point of view, there is no difficulty, certainly no insuperable difficulty, in increasing the number of bound sets of HANSARD available for hon. Members in the immediate future. This, I repeat, is a House of Commons matter. We should have got into a great deal of trouble if we had acted in the face of a recommendation of a Select Committee of this House. All we have endeavoured to do is to carry out the wishes of the House, and I feel sure that the Select Committee, having heard the strong expression of views by

hon. Members here, will give the question further consideration. As I have said, hon. Members will have a very potent weapon in their hands when the new Session begins, because a Motion will then be put upon the Order Paper to re-establish that Committee, and at that stage hon. Members could raise a Debate and even, if they felt so inclined, take exception to the constitution and the composition of the Committee. I hope that the House will acquit the Treasury of any meanness on this subject. It is one on which we should be only too happy to spend a little more money if by doing so we should be carrying out the wishes of the House.</p>

<p>As a Member of the Debates Committee, I feel disinclined to allow the Chairman to have to bear the full brunt of the criticism in this matter. From my remembrance, this Committee was urged, with other Committees, to institute economies in the use of paper. At that time, there were general appeals throughout the nation that we should avoid waste wherever possible. I might say that upon this Committee there were at least four representatives of printing trade interests, and that it was up to them, as printing trade representatives, not to allow their sectional interests to interfere with their appreciation of the national interest. It was not only in the abolition of the free issue of HANSARD that we took action. We reduced the size of one or two publications, and we made other economies besides the economy of abolishing the free issue of HANSARD. I am very pleased to see the feeling here to-day in the direction of resuming the free issue of the bound volumes of HANSARD, but I must ask hon. Members to take into consideration that when this suggestion was first carried out, the Members of the Committee were dominated by national considerations, and were not as concerned as perhaps they might have been, with the individual desires of their fellow Members.</p>

<p>May I put this point to the Financial Secretary? He seems inclined to follow the wishes of the House. Could he put that a little more definitely than it has been put? I can well understand the Select Committee, in


view of the need for economy and the desire to save the nation's resources, coming to the decision they did. Perhaps all of us would have done the same in the early part of the war, with things as they were. The position is a little easier now, and what is weighing upon hon. Members' minds is that, by every post, we get volumes of advertisements and printing matter of all kinds, and when there is talk of economy we wonder where it is practised, in view of the fact that we do not get a valuable document such as the bound volumes of HANSARD, because of some reasons which may be technical. [HON. MEMBERS: "Because you have to pay for it."] No, I understand it is very difficult to get at all.</p>

<p>In that case there is no excuse at all for the Treasury, seeing that the wish of the House that this matter should be reviewed again with a view to returning to the old footing is almost unanimous. I would like to ask the Financial Secretary whether he can give us some understanding on that point. I think Members of the Select Committee are convinced of the feeling of the House. Would the Financial Secretary give that assurance and not harp so much about meanness being thrust upon him&#x2014;I am thrusting it from him now&#x2014;and indicate he is prepared to follow the old system? The hon. Member for Frome (Mrs. Tate) and I have given evidence that we ceased to take the bound volume because of financial embarrassment. I had taken it every year since I have been here, but when I was told I would have to pay for it I said, "I cannot afford it," and I did not take it. That is an example of what the present position means. I would like the Financial Secretary to give some assurance that he has been convinced by the free expression of opinion of the Members present which has been an endeavour to get him to change his point of view.</p>

<p>I wish to stand up here, first of all, in defence of the Treasury, because to-day they have adopted a new line and have definitely said that it is the sole desire of the Treasury, on all occasions, to carry out the will and wishes of the

House. One is also interested to notice, if I interpreted the Financial Secretary's remarks correctly, that the Treasury think that this action was a mean action, and that they regret having done it. I hope that is not too wide an interpretation of his remarks. As has been said, this decision was arrived at because of the shortage of paper and national necessity. That may have been true in 1940, but I gather from the Report here that the Committee arrived at the same decision on 12th October, 1944, without going into the evidence at all, or asking, apparently, for any fresh evidence. I submit that it is the considered opinion of the House that this decision should now be reversed.<br/>
I wish to ask the Financial Secretary what steps will be taken by the Treasury to ascertain what is the real opinion of the House. Surely this right&#x2014;not a privilege but a right&#x2014;is not going to be taken away, if the majority of Members of the House of Commons do not wish it to be taken away. It is definitely a right that we should have available to us bound volumes, so that we can refer to them from time to time. I make a further plea to the Financial Secretary. Other matters have been raised which are perhaps as important as, or even more important than, the issue regarding HANSARD. These are matters which obviously demand very careful and serious consideration. Can the Financial Secretary indicate that these proposals or suggestions will be given the most careful consideration at some early date, and that an opportunity will be afforded for him to come to the House in this generous mood, and say, "What is the wish of the House? We shall carry it out."</p>

<p>I add my voice for once to those of the forces of reaction, so widely expressed in different parts of the House to-day. I hope we shall soon go back to what was the practice before I had the privilege of being a Member of this House. I came to the House in the early part of 1941, and it was a disappointment to me to find that, contrary to my expectation, I was not to be presented with bound volumes of the Debates. I have regretted it ever since. I think the attitude of the Committee in 1940 can be well understood,


but we have now had various relaxations, particularly in connection with the black-out and so on. Things are not so difficult as they were, though there are still many difficulties before us. I hope all those concerned, particularly the representatives of the Treasury, are now convinced that in all parts of the House there is a desire that we should revert to what used to be the practice here, and I hope we shall do that now.<br/>
