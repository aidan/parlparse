<p>I am pleased to inform the hon.

<p>Is the Minister aware that that is a substantial number? The

majority of law-abiding companies that originally set out loyally to obey and comply with the regulations are now meeting with unfair competition from a tiny minority of unscrupulous companies that in some cases are using lorries designed to carry loads of 13&#x00BD; tons to carry loads of 22 tons.

<p>The object of the consultative document is to promote a discussion in the Province, and the measure of agreement will emerge from that. I am allowing approximately six months for a public debate, but it will not be cut firmly at that time if the debate is still continuing.

<p>Is the hon. Gentleman in a position to give a costing to the scheme as envisaged in his consultative document, or a scheme based on it?

<p>Is my right hon. Friend aware that one of the most agreeable and constant features of educational life in Northern Ireland is the equitable way in which the schools have been treated? Schools of all denominations have been treated with generosity and on an equitable basis. This has hapened under all Governments in Northern Ireland and here.

<p>Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that the consultative document uses the expressions "Roman Catholic sector" and "non-Roman Catholic sector"? Does he realise that "non-Roman Catholic sector" is an offensive way in which to describe the schools provided for the majority of Ulster people, when it is just as easy to refer to the controlled schools and the Protestant voluntary schools? Will he issue a correction to remove this offending description?</p>

<p>Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that the public debate to which he has referred has already begun? On the one hand, many teachers have been expressing their dislike of the 11-plus examination, but, on the other, the Association of Governing Bodies of Voluntary Schools has expressed the opinion that the abolition of the 11-plus, which so many teachers and others want, need not lead to the abolition of the 58 voluntary grammar schools, Catholic, Protestant and non-denominational, that have served Ulster so well?</p>

<p>It is estimated that Housing Executive tenants owe &#x00A3;3&#x00B7;4 million for rent, &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;7 million for rates and &#x00A3;0&#x00B7;1 million for heating charges. Arrears are being recovered by allocations of social security benefits, under which some 2,170 tenants are having deductions made, and a further 500 cases per week are now being referred to the Housing Executive for possible allocation of benefits.</p>

<p>The Department does not now divide the rent arrears between those who were involved in the rent strike and other defaulters. The former's arrears have been reduced to such an amount that it is hardly worth trying to divide them up. On the other hand, a new feature in Northern Ireland is that rent arrears are divided between the two communities.</p>

<p>This matter is dealt with in the Porter Report, on which I have made a statement. I hope that legislation will be brought before the House in due course. This is not a new point. Policing in certain areas is not yet in full force. This situation has been going on for some time. Private landlords can take these individuals to court.</p>

<p>It is not the intention of the Government to deprive parents of the right to have their children educated in accordance with their religious choice. A proposal for shared school governing bodies was made by Mr. Basil McIvor, Minister for Education in the power-sharing Executive, in May 1974. Consultation on this proposal subsequently did not reveal sufficient support to warrant legislation. I have noted a recent renewal of interest in similar proposals to these put forward by Mr. McIvor and I am at present reviewing how these might be further considered.</p>

<p>Does the Minister stick to the view that he firmly expressed about a year ago, that comprehensive reorganisation should be undertaken in Northern Ireland, and that this upheaval should take place without any move

towards practical desegregation at local level where it is desired and sought by local parents? Is he prepared to take a fairly flexible view, or to contemplate with equanimity a major educational upheaval on the issue of selection but with no change in the direction of desegregation, where it is sought?</p>

<p>The two issues of comprehensive or secondary reorganisation and desegregation are entirely separate. The consultative document was issued on the basis that the majority of Catholic parents will want to send their children to Catholic schools and the majority of non-Catholic parents will want to send their children to non-Catholic schools. I have not sought to depart from the existing arrangement in that respect.</p>

<p>Is my hon.

<p>Where there is a desire for children of both sects to go to the same school, there is provision in existing arrangements whereby that can be achieved.

<p>May I remind the hon.

The news release referred to being fully represented in all the democratic fora, and said that agreement had been reached.

None of the three strategies provides for an elevated urban motorway of the same standard as that contained in the original design.

<p>Violence has continued throughout July and there have been a number of recent terrorist incidents, some of them particularly brutal, in

which innocent civilians from all parts of the community have been killed or seriously injured. Fewer civilians have been killed than in previous months, but bombing attacks have continued at a higher level and substantial damage has been caused to property in Londonderry, Belfast and rural areas, notably in Castledawson and Kilrea.<br/>
There has been an increase in shooting and bombing attacks against the security forces. Only last night three policemen were injured in a booby trap explosion in Lurgan; one of them is very seriously injured. I regret also that a member of the RUC Reserve was shot at an Army checkpoint near Bessbrook. The RUC is investigating both these incidents. Two members of the security forces have been killed by terrorists so far this month, and 33 injured.<br/>
There have in the past fortnight been various disturbances among special category and remand prisoners, obviously designed to put pressure on the prison authorities. The Government's announced decisions on the future treatment of newly-convicted prisoners will not be changed.<br/>
As I have told the House on many previous occasions, the way to fight terrorism and to maintain the rule of law is through the processes of the law. The security forces continue to meet the challenge of terrorism from whatever quarter it comes and wherever it occurs. So far this year 659 have been charged with terrorist crime, including 55 with murder, and 57 with attempted murder.<br/>

I am sure that there was a great advantage in them a year or more ago. I am not prepared to go into details, but I can say that there have been no talks since the early part of this year, and no talks are in prospect. Anyone who talks about talks is not talking about talks in which anyone associated with me is involved. Whether other people outside the Government machine are involved, on their own initiative, in talking to the Provisional Sinn Fein is not a matter for me. Only a few weeks ago I was approached by some-

one who claimed to carry a personal message from David O'Connell, threatening increased violence in Ireland if there were an early political agreement between the parties. I did not seek that meeting; I did not know the man from Adam. I hope that because I received a message in that way no one will say that I am arranging talks.</p>

It has become fashionable to attack particular organs of government, but I have seen nothing of the work of the CPRS that leads me to believe that it has fallen away in quality. As one who has had the opportunity of seeing that body at work, I believe that it makes a valuable contribution.</p>

<p>Since the nuclear industry has not developed long-term methods for dealing with nuclear waste, and since there are wide safety and security implications in the wider use of uranium and plutonium, will the Prime Minister say whether the CPRS is involved in decision-making about the future nuclear power station programme of the Government, or is this being left to the Department of Energy?

<p>I think that the House should take notice, as this is a serious matter. The events that occurred yesterday affect every Member of Parliament as they suggest the possibility&#x2014;I put it

no stronger than that&#x2014;that the telephone system of this building is being monitored, with or without the authorisation of the Executive, or that it is possible for the telephone system to be intercepted and monitored by someone else.

<p>Further that that point of order, Mr. Speaker. Perhaps I may help the House if I make a brief intervention.<br/>
The statements made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Huyton (Sir H. Wilson) on 17th November 1966 and by the right hon. Member for Sidcup (Mr. Heath) on 16th July 1970 about the tapping of hon. Members' telephones apply also to telephones in the Palace of Westminster used by hon. Members.<br/>
There can therefore be no justification for the suspicions expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Mr. Litterick). I can only speculate on the incident referred to by my hon. Friend. I assume that his conversation took place on an accidentally crossed line&#x2014;which is not, I fear, outside the experience of any of us&#x2014;and that the third party took it upon himself to join in.</p>

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker. It is reasonable for the Home Secretary to refer to previous incidents. However, the House should also bear in mind that it was discovered in the past that the Executive did this. There have been previous cases.

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I seek your guidance in your capacity as defender of the interests of minorities and Back Benchers. Yesterday evening, a vote was taken on the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Bill at six o'clock and a further vote will be taken on the same Bill tonight between eight o'clock and nine o'clock. In his speech winding up that debate yesterday the Secretary of State quoted from the <i>South Wales Echo</i> a story which was only partially true. In today's edition of the paper, the story is printed in full, which gives a completely different picture from that given by the Secretary of State. In those circumstances, how can arrangements be made to allow the Minister to make a further statement to put the record straight for the House?</p>

<p>It seems to me that the hon. Member has put the record straight. What takes place in a debate is settled on the spot by the result of the Division. I accept the results given by the Tellers.

I think that we had better leave that matter until the debate later.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-07-29a.882.3" hansard_membership_id="10845" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/31254" speakername="Mr. Speaker" colnum="882" time="">
<p>Yesterday I was asked to give a ruling. The hon. Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Price) made a considered submission to me on how the Chair should exercise its discretion in permitting reference to be made to matters that are <i>sub judice</i> before the civil courts, in the light of the resolution of the House on the Question of 28th June 1972. I now want to reply to the important issues that he raised.<br/>
In the first place, I draw attention to the fact that the resolution of 1972 is prefaced by the phrase
<q>subject to the discretion of the Chair".</q>
This governs all that follows, and places upon me the responsibility of exercising my judgment in each particular case. The remainder of the resolution constitutes guidance by the House as to how it wishes me to exercise my discretion in certain classes of case. Of course I pay very close attention to that guidance.<br/>
I assure the hon. Gentleman that in the case with which he is particularly concerned I have considered whether the ministerial decision was one that could be challenged only on grounds of misdirection or of bad faith, and also whether the issues of national importance set out in the resolution of 1972 applied. I do not think that it would be helpful for me to seek to define those issues more closely than the resolution itself does, although the hon. Member invited me to do so.<br/>
I should like to say a word about the <i>sub judice</i> rule in general. It is, as the hon. Member quoted from the 1972 report,
<q>the fundamental responsibility of Parliament to be the supreme inquest of the nation with


the overall responsibility to discuss anything it likes.</q>
It is to enable them to perform that function that hon. Members enjoy absolute privilege to speak in this Chamber without any court being able to question them.<br/>
It is also an important principle that Parliament shall not influence, or seem to be seeking to influence, the administration of justice. The <i>sub judice</i> rule is therefore a self-denying ordinance instituted by the House in order to protect that principle. The fact that newspapers sometimes feel free to comment on issues that are still <i>sub judice,</i> as the hon. Member remarked, is another matter, since the courts may deal with them for contempt, and their views do not carry with them the weight of having been delivered in Parliament.<br/>
Having made those general remarks, I assure the hon. Gentleman that I recognise that the resolution of 1972 constituted a deliberate relaxation by the House of the <i>sub judice</i> rule in the area of public policy that it does go wider than the Industrial Relations Act; and that I shall exercise my discretion in favour of freer debate in every case in which I consider that I may properly do so.<br/>
The hon. Member and the hon. Member for Penistone (Mr. Mendelson) made a final point about the freedom of Back Benchers to make submissions to me about the exercise of my discretion in particular cases. I assure them that I am always prepared to consider submissions&#x2014;provided that they do not anticipate my decision by commenting on the matter that is awaiting judicial decision or contain comments that are out of order on other grounds.<br/>
In this particular case the hon. Member's object on Tuesday was to submit to me arguments that this particular issue did not fall within our rule on <i>sub judice</i> matters. Had he put forward his argument purely on the basis of the resolutions of the House and past precedents, as indeed he did yesterday, I would certainly have been prepared to hear him out. It was solely because, in my view, he began by reflecting on the courts that I intervened.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. Thank you very much for that ruling, which has clarified the

matter. The 1972 resolution mentioned, among other things, that you should take into account "the essentials of life". I asked you to rule on that, but I understand that you have not felt able to say what it means, just as previous Leaders of the House have not felt able to say what it means. I submit that it can cover social issues, such as the row we had earlier this week, which is continuing, as well as economic and national defence issues.<br/>
I very much hope that you would be willing to see the 1972 resolution in that wider context, which includes social issues, when using your proper discretion on this matter in future.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I seek your guidance now, particularly since we shall shortly be dealing with the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Bill.<br/>
In the past few weeks the representative of a public relations firm called International News Services has been using the House of Commons and Palace of Westminster facilities. I want to seek your confirmation that such a public relations firm can have no advantages just because it has two parliamentary advisers, but that its representative can be considered only as a member of the public and that if he wishes to go, for example, to the Terrace, the Strangers' Bar or other accessible parts, he must have the express authority of an hon. Member and be accompanied by an hon. Member.<br/>
In addition, will you confirm that such a public relations firm's representative is not allowed to use the telephones which are scattered around the building? The person to whom I am referring was seen using a police telephone.<br/>
This is a serious matter because many hon. Members are open to pressure and wish at some stage to withdraw from such pressure and to seek the haven of the Palace of Westminster for reflection. It seems quite untoward that an hon. Member can be open to hounding by a public relations representative who seems to treat the Palace of Westminster as though he owns it.</p>

Friends will not be putting down an amendment to the Opposition motion on Monday, bearing in mind that there can be no precedent for a Government not to have &#x00A3;2,000 million-worth of measures debated in their own time.</p>

<p>On the first question, I certainly appreciate what the right hon. Gentleman says about the inconvenience for the House as a whole and especially for the servants of the House, who have had very heavy burdens placed upon them over recent weeks. I certainly appreciate what he says about the high desirability of avoiding late debates on a Friday. We shall do the very best that we can to avoid that. However, it was the case that last Friday, particularly in view of the important Northern Ireland business that had to be discussed, the House had to sit until late.<br/>
On the second matter, the right hon. Gentleman says that I have referred to no obstruction or intrusion and he is assuming that we would not put down an amendment to the motion tabled by the Opposition. I should think that very likely that is so, but we must see what the motion is before we decide the matter. It would be very unwise for anyone to say that he would not put down an amendment before he had actually seen the motion. However, certainly if we can accommodate the Opposition on

that aspect of the matter as well, we shall do our best to do so.<br/>
As for the last question, all the proposals that have been put forward by the Government will be subject to the normal parliamentary processes at the normal parliamentary times. What the House will have an opportunity of doing on Monday is to debate the matter on a motion, which I should have thought suitable for the Opposition even if it turns out badly for them in the end.</p>

<p>My right hon. Friend will be aware of the genuine distress on both sides of the house about the problem of sick Members coming in. Without getting involved in the argument, is my right hon. Friend prepared to consider putting down a motion, perhaps next week, for a free vote, when the House would be asked to allow those who are sick to vote by proxy? [<i>Interruption.</i>] I said a motion on the Floor of the House on a free vote, so that all hon. Members will have the opportunity to say what they want to say, so that on the basis of producing a medical certificate, adequately signed, Members can vote when they are sick. Does my right hon. Friend not know that such a motion would receive the overwhelming support of the majority of the House?</p>

<p>I certainly listened to the views expressed earlier. What my right hon. Friend has suggested is one approach to the problem. If we could discover another solution to it, we should be very glad to do that. I certainly think that there ought to be some proper system for pairing Members who are sick. We would certainly be in favour of it. However, if the House would like to have a motion on the subject, we would consider that, too.</p>

<p>My right hon. Friend will recall that the Public Lending Right Bill passed all its stages in the House of Lords in the early part of this year, that it began its Second Reading in this House in May, that it is supported by both Front Benches and that there have been three bites at the Second Reading cherry. As this is not therefore entirely unrepresentative, what assurance can he give us on the subject? Will he


approach the Opposition officially with a view to ensuring&#x2014;as I know that he personally wishes&#x2014;that the Bill is secured and is on the statute book by the end of the Session?</p>

<p>It is not a question of the views of the official Opposition on the subject. I think that the Oppositon support the Bill. Certainly it is the Government's desire that the Bill should proceed. Some hon. Members in other parts of the House take a different view. It is our wish that the Bill should proceed to the statute book. It has passed through another place, and we hope that when the House meets after the recess we shall be able to carry the Bill through and put it on the statute book.</p>

<p>We have spent a long time discussing other parochial matters in this Bill. We have had a major row on a constitutional issue concerning one local company&#x2014;namely, Bristol Channel Ship Repairers Limited. I make no apology for raising a matter of vital concern not only immediately to the constituencies of myself and my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) but to the general prosperity and well-being of industry generally on North Humberside and of the shipbuilding and ship repairing industry in particular.<br/>
We had a short debate on this topic in Committee. In that debate I rehearsed the arguments why my hon. Friends and I felt that the Drypool Group should be back within the Bill. Originally, when we fought an election on Humberside, we fought it for the nationalisation of the


aircraft and shipbuilding industries. We fought it for the nationalisation of Brough and Drypool.<br/>
In the first Bill, which was published on 30th April 1975, the Drypool Group was included in the provisions for nationalisation. However, following the change at the Department of Industry, when the present Secretary of State replaced my right hon. Friend who is now Secretary of State for Energy, a second Bill was published, from which the Dry-pool Group was excluded.<br/>
We have to ask why the Drypool Group was excluded. The answer is that it went bankrupt and brought in a receiver. However, if that alone were the case for not nationalising or taking into public ownership any industry, there would have been no help given to Rolls-Royce, to Chrysler, or to many other nationalised industries that have been taken into public ownership.<br/>
The company went bankrupt. Immediately the announcement was made, my hon. Friends and I spent a considerable time lobbying Ministers, who expressed great sympathy for the situation, but did nothing other than to say that they would not now nationalise Drypool and that it would be far better for what was left of the group to be taken into private ownership and sold off by the receiver rather than be taken into public ownership.<br/>
I must say that that augurs well for those other parts of the shipbuilding industry that are said to be in a very precarious position. Some of them would not exist if they did not have the benefit of help from the Government, which was denied to Drypool and other shipbuilding industries on Humberside.<br/>
We were then left with a situation in which the Government recommended that the companies should not be nationalised. Supported by some of my hon. Friends, I tried in Committee to get that position reversed. I was not successful, and since that time a number of the companies within the Drypool Group have been sold off to private industry, including the Selby Yard and the Beverley Yard.<br/>
Therefore, we are left with what, in a parochial sense, is the core of the whole problem for me and my hon.

Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East&#x2014;in other words, the yards in our constituencies, which still employ about 300 men, to whom we gave an undertaking, both on the hustings and since, that we would press for the nationalisation of their yards, which undertaking we are carrying out now. I can assure the House that this is no part of any sham exercise.<br/>
We have the situation, theerfore, that parts of the Drypool Group have been sold off. Other parts have not been sold off. Though I regret to have to admit it, obviously it would be unsatisfactory if we tried to bring back into the ambit of public ownership those parts which have been sold off already to private industry. I concede that point, though I regret having to do so.<br/>
But there are the parts which are left, which are in my constituency and that of my hon. Friend, the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East. Those are parts that have not yet been sold off. Therefore the amendment has two objectives. It seeks to meet the changed situation of the Drypool Group, and it seeks to meet the situation in terms of the major argument which the Minister of State advanced in Committee that because of the period of time taken as the average over which compensation should be paid to shareholders, it would involve the payment of compensation to shareholders in a bankrupt company.<br/>
On that occasion I put it to the Minister that, if that was the substance of his argument against accepting my amendment, surely it was not beyond the wit of man, though perhaps it was beyond that of the Government, to find a way round the difficulty, as had been shown to be possible by the right hon. Member for Sidcup (Mr. Heath) when he was Prime Minister and was dealing with Rolls-Royce.<br/>
In my view, we could say that in the case of a company which was bankrupt the Government would merely pay the value of its assets. Therefore, the amendment seeks to say that where a receiver has been appointed&#x2014;as has happened in this case&#x2014;the corporation shall purchase from the receiver its existing assets held by the receiver at the time of the coming into operation of the Act at a value to be determined by agreement between the corporation and the receiver.<br/>
That is what the amendment says. It says nothing that could conflict either with public policy or with what is contained in the Bill. It contains nothing to conflict with public policy because we are not confiscating. We are paying compensation, and paying compensation for fixed assets.<br/>
I put it to my hon. Friend that he has an opportunity between now and the coming into operation of the Bill either to ensure that the jobs of the men concerned are protected, and that the industry is protected on Humberside, in my constituency and that of my hon. Friend, by being sold to some private industry&#x2014;which I should find difficult to accept from a Labour Government&#x2014;or to say that, from the date of the coming into operation of the Bill, the assets will be taken over by the new corporation.</p>

<p>As I understand Amendment No. 220, the hon. Gentleman is proposing that the corporation shall purchase from the receiver the assets of the company at an agreed fair market valuation. Does he think it would be right that the same principle should be applied to all the companies being acquired and that in each case the assets should be purchased at a fair price?</p>

<p>Every company in bankruptcy which is taken over&#x2014;[<i>Interruption.</i>] This company is bankrupt. I should hate to make the Bill a hybrid. I am dealing with only one class of company at a time. If a company is bankrupt, let us pay for the assets. We want the creditors to be treated honourably. I am after no quick buck and no confiscation. Let the creditors be treated honourably.<br/>
I am grateful to the hon. Member for Bridgwater (Mr. King) for enabling me to make this point, because it drives home that the hon. Gentleman supports my view that we should compensate the creditors fairly on the face value of the company's assets.<br/>
4.30 p.m.<br/>
My amendment will still give the Government time to do what was originally envisaged when the whole exercise of nationalisation was first thought of. It was envisaged that on Humberside, in an

area of very high unemployment and with few opoprtunities of skilled work for school leavers and where we had had a number of body blows to our economy, for which the Government had done very little to compensate&#x2014;the closures of Thorn Electrics in my constituency and of Imperial Typewriters in East Hull, the threatened close-down of Humber St. Andrews, partly in my constituency and partly in that of my hon. Friend&#x2014;here was an opportunity for the Government to say to Humberside, "We appreciate your need for skilled work and here on Humberside we can build a small boats division of the new shipbuilding corporation." That is what we were after. It is still possible. There are still being taken into public ownership the shipyards at Goole. There are still being taken into public ownership the ship repairing facilities of Humber Grading.<br/>
It is still possible for the Government to have a strong and viable nationalised shipbuilding sector on Humberside based upon the yards that are there. At this stage my right hon. Friend the Minister could say that what this party undertook as part of its policy, and what was its policy until the publication of this Bill, to the extent that it can be honoured, will be honoured and that he will take these parts of the industry into public ownership.</p>

<p>We have listened to an accurate and excellent contribution by my colleague the Member for Kingston-uponHull, Central (Mr. McNamara). Speaking as a Hull Member and Chairman of the Yorkshire Group of Labour MPs, I can endorse the facts of economic life as he has stated them. During Committee six months ago this firm was literally in a shambles and it was in the hands of Mr. Smith, an excellent receiver.<br/>
In this context I should also like to confirm the state of our economy. We in Hull and North Humberside have a continuing malaise and there is a curious dichotomy in our day-to-day life in that, on the one hand, we can boast of being the gateway to Europe with enormous prospects and benefits from the Common Market, with our motorways opening up&#x2014;the M62 and the M18 to the West&#x2014;and, on the other hand, when I talk to full-time union officials of the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers, the General and Municipal Workers, the Transport and General Workers, and the Boilermakers Society, men who are in the docks or employed in this industry, I find gloom and despondency about the future. All of them condemn the Government for what, for want of a better term, I can only call their nonchalance towards us on the Humber.<br/>
From time to time deputations descend on the Government in Whitehall to see Ministers on Bills such as this and the Fisheries Bill. We go back with no joy and no booty whatever. We are getting body blows like these and the Icelandic Agreement constantly, so our male unemployment is at least 10 per cent. and may be as high as 10&#x00B7;6 per cent. Candidly, my concern as a constituency Member is about jobs for my own people. To be quite blunt, I want jobs in whatever shape or form I can get them, whether in the public sector or in a mixed economy.<br/>
Five or six months ago shipbuilding affairs were catastrophic. I wish to quote and endorse what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon

Hull, Central in Standing Committee six months ago:
<q>But there is evidence that if something positive is not done, if we do not nationalise the yards, the important ship repairing and shipbuilding industries on Humberside are to be lost&#x2014;for ever."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee D,</i> 24th February 1976; c. 1158.]</q>
That was six months ago and time has marched on. As my hon. Friend said initially, Selby and Beverley are now back in business.<br/>
I understand from our city development committee, though here I may be corrected, that our yard in Hull may also have been the subject of discussion, certain people wishing to take it over. That is the current position, but that is not what the amendment is saying. As my hon. Friend was careful to point out, it talks of the present situation when there should be an agreement between the corporation and the receiver as on the date of coming into operation of the Bill. I shall listen with extreme care to what the Minister says in reply to this debate about the terms on which he views a possible transaction along the lines envisaged by my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, Central. How much compensation does he envisage? Does this make sense to my hon. Friends, to those in Hull, to the Minister and other hon. Members?<br/>
We have talked of bankruptcy and have used such terms as "hybridity" and "hybridisation", though I wonder whether there is such a word. I want a clear definition of what is meant by all this. I want the Minister to state the implications to the work force and to the Government.<br/>
In addition to feeling it my duty as a constituency Member to find out what the Minister intends to do, I also made an effort to find out the views of the unions in Hull on this subject. I have discussed it locally and I find intense scepticism about Government action. One union official, for example, felt that if the Government are to place orders, it would be better for this firm to be nationalised, since the Government could then be expected to place orders within its own public sector.<br/>
Offsetting this I found another view, which I emphasised earlier, the feeling that Humberside, is the last place to get


orders. We are last in the queue, unfortunately, unlike Scotland and Wales, about which we get argument and discussion about devolution, nationalism, chauvinism, and similar movements. In short, on Humberside, there is deep resentment by the unions, the work force, the businessmen and councillors about the way in which we tend to be placed not only down the queue, but even behind the corner. It is the view of the chairman of my city development committee that if we had been in Scotland six months ago, we should not have been put down as many people feel we were.<br/>
The message I wish to give to the Minister is that I shall listen carefully and weigh his words to me. At this moment I have no intention of voting against the Government. I shall wait to hear what the Minister has to say. I have never yet voted against the Government. It is not usually my intention to do so and I was not sent here to do so, but I shall listen carefully and weigh up all that he has to say.</p>

<p>I am not one to prolong discussion on a matter that is clearly very much the concern of the Hull area, but the important principles involved affect other areas, and matters brought up on this issue will be of some consequence to a number of constituencies when the reorganisation and rationalisation of the ship repairing industry takes place. One is not unsympathetic to the problems that will face ship building and ship repairing but perhaps this aspect has been overestimated in considering the problems of a shipbuilding area with some ship repair and not taking into account the contribution that can come from small ship development taking place in the area.<br/>
It is clear that the Labour Government attempted to include the Drypool group in the First nationalisation Bill that it introduced after the first election in 1974. We believe that the group should have been included in this new Bill, even though some parts of it have been sold off to the private sector.<br/>
I am sure that the Minister is well aware of the arguments that we have deployed to justify the cause of nationalisation in the shipbuilding and ship repairing industry. We use those same arguments now&#x2014;inadequate investment,

employment productivity, bad management. All these things contributed to the collapse of the Drypool group. The events were somewhat precipitated. If the liquidity problem with which this company is faced had occurred 12 months later, it would have been included in the Bill. This is no reason to leave it out. The fundamental arguments for naionalisation are still sound, apply in this case, and have directly contributed to the collapse of Drypool.<br/>
I have looked at the arguments put forward by the Government to justify excluding the Drypool group, but I find them very difficult to explain to my constituents. The Government have argued different points on different occasions. First, they have claimed that the company is now bankrupt and lacks liquidity to finance ships which it had on order, and this kind of money&#x2014;between &#x00A3;1,500,000 and &#x00A3;2 million&#x2014;is not made available under the Industry Act. Therefore, the company was allowed to go to the wall. I know that is rather simplifying the argument, but basically it is one of bankruptcy. This is not an argument against taking over the industry; the bankruptcy has been precipitated by the financial events of the time.<br/>
Secondly, the Government have given the reason why the group has had no new orders for two years. Very few shipyards in Britain or round the world are in the fortunate position of receiving orders in the last few years because there have been considerable difficulties in this field. But there is evidence that business is picking up. Our problem is no different from that of other yards.<br/>
What sticks in the workers' throats in my area when they are told that they are not being profitable or making enough money with new orders is the fact that our orders have been going to places like Aberdeen, which are being subsidised. It comes a bit thick from the Government responsible for the regional employment premium to give it to our major competitors and to say that our yards are not profitable. They are playing off other yards in other parts of the country against Humberside. When jobs are denied to us, they go instead to other yards, which are being given subsidies and which are our major competitors. This is not an argument that I accept with a great deal of conviction.<br/>
Thirdly, the Government claim that our yards are making a loss on each order. That also sticks in the throat. Very few yards anywhere in the world are making money on any orders. That is why Governments are falling over themselves to give money to shipowners to order ships in their own yards. Maritime Fruit Carriers is a classic example of that.<br/>
The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, when speaking on 27th July in the debate on the Belfast yards, referred to losses on orders. He said:
<q>The &#x00A3;60 million that we then provided to the end of 1978 was to cover prospective losses. Every ship being made is made at a loss. The &#x00A3;60 million is to cover losses in Harland and Wolff."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 27th July 1976; Vol. 916, c. 393.]</q>
Every ship being built is built at a loss, yet this is one of the points being made against our yards being nationalised.<br/>
4.45 p.m.<br/>
The point that is painfully clear to me is that the political consequences of allowing Harland and Wolff and Clydebank to go to the wall are far greater than those of allowing Humberside to go. In Humberside there is not enough political pull to make the Government realise the facts about unemployment in our area.<br/>
These arguments are hardly ones that a constituency Member can take back to his constituents. The Government have not given proper consideration to the contribution that Humberside can make to small ship development. At the moment Humberside takes 11 per cent. of small ship traffic into its ports. One of the reasons why we have the Dock Work Regulation Bill is the technical developments in recent years.<br/>
The Government's basic argument in letters and correspondence from the Prime Minister, the Secretary of State and the Minister of State for Industry is that the best formula is to allow these yards to go to the wall. They claim that the yards should be sold off separately to the private yards, as this is the best way of providing jobs. Against that background, the analysis is that somehow private capital will go in, buy the yards, and provide jobs, thus solving our problems. These firms have been given Government money to help them buy the

yards, and the money given has been greater in total than the amount asked for by the company to sustain it as a group.<br/>
We are left with unemployment in Hull, and jobs have been found in the Conservative areas, which is hardly likely to be attractive from our political point of view. We Labour Members in Hull are not convinced by the arguments put forward and we do not think that those arguments are borne out by the facts. It is necessary and urgent that the Government should carry out their election commitment&#x2014;the one on which we fought the election&#x2014;and include Dry-pool yards in the Bill. The Government should bear in mind the ever-increasing rate of unemployment in our areas. At the moment it is 15,000 in Hull alone, or 10 per cent. of the working population.<br/>
The Department of Industry has been very much involved in decisions in Hull in the last few years. We had the situation last year in which Imperial Typewriters collapsed. This company could have been saved by the Department, had it been prepared to take on the multinational and bring in import controls on typewriters. We have also faced the rapid decline of the fishing industry and the consequences of that decline. In addition, the effect of VAT on caravans has hit Humberside more than most areas. The Government should recognise that we have a special unemployment problem, which is not as massive as that of Belfast or the Clyde, but is exactly the same in terms of percentages.<br/>
On Humberside, we are also faced with 13 per cent. of youths being unemployed in a largely unskilled area&#x2014;more so than the national average. Opportunities for apprenticeships and training have declined in recent years. Four years ago 120 apprenticeships a year were provided in the shipbuilding and ship repairing industries. In 1974 there were 84 provided. In 1975 this number was reduced to 75, of which 30 were Government-sponsored. This year, there are less than 50 apprenticeships, of which 30 are Government-sponsored. It seems that the whole of the Humberside shipbuilding and ship repairing industries have opted out of this responsibility. Only the Goole shipyard, which is part of the Swan Hunter


group, has held its own and is taking apprentices and training youngsters. The State should make a larger contribution to that end, and I hope that the Government will look at this problem.<br/>
The Department have a report, which has not yet been made public, which shows that small ships have a future in terms of growth and development, and that Humberside is the best site for that. It is a pity that a nationalised industry has not chosen to build at Brigham &amp; Cowan, which was one of the yards taken over from Court Line, for which the Government must take the credit. They should now build on that sector and include the Drypool group, taking in Brigham &amp; Cowan to further the development of the building and repair of small ships.<br/>
If I am told that there are no orders I must tell my hon. Friend that the evidence of the last few months from the companies which are considering taking over the yards is that there are plenty of orders and that work is available. That is why these companies are in the market for some of the yards. If they can work under private ownership, why can they not work under nationalisation?<br/>
We politicians know that at times we fight elections and make promises which we are not able to carry out. We confess to the electorate and take the consequences. But there are promises about which we feel keenly, and the promise to nationalise Drypool comes into that category. We fought an election on nationalisation. I believe that it provides the answer to this industry's problems. We put the proposal in our manifestos and in our Bills. To withdraw now, on grounds that do not stand up to examination, is totally unacceptable.<br/>
I and my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, Central (Mr. McNamara) have two of the yards in our constituencies, and we appreciate what will be the consequences of unemployment there. Those consequences are unacceptable to us. If the Government cannot implement the policy on which we fought an election, it is up to the individual Member to attempt to get that policy through. The Government, we believe, must accept our amendment, or something like it. In Hull the Depart-

ment of Industry has a bad name. It has almost become the Department of Unemployment, and the electorate there talk about having to become Yorkshire nationalists before they get anything done. I reject this view but demand that the amendment be accepted by the Government.</p>

<p>Yes, it is lucky. It has my hon. Friends who represent Hull, and it has me, but it does not have the hon. Member for Bridgwater (Mr. King).<br/>
I appreciate the case that my hon. Friends have been advancing for a considerable time. If it were possible consistently and sensibly to accept their amendments I should be glad to do so. However, accepting them would not only do my hon. Friends and their constituents no good; it would do their constituents and the Labour Government positive harm. My hon. Friends are not happy about what has developed, but I hope that they will understand that the situation that has developed cannot be reversed, because time has gone by and changes have taken place.<br/>
Since my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, Central (Mr. McNamara) raised the matter in Committee the amendments have been overtaken by events. The receiver has sold the Selby yard to United Towing Limited, the Hull-based tug owning company. As well as building vessels for other owners, the Selby yard will be able to fulfil orders for its new owners' fleet. Whitby Shipyard Ltd. has entered into a contract with the receiver for the purchase of the Beverley yard. Until he has completed the remaining vessel at Beverley, which he contracted to complete, Whitby Shipyard and the receiver will occupy the establishment side by side. The receiver has also sold Nos. 1 and 2 dry docks in Hull to the Yorkshire Dry Dock Company, while he is continuing to seek purchasers for other facilities.</p>

<p>We are seeking to do that, and I shall acknowledge the fact if I am wrong.<br/>
The receiver is continuing to seek purchasers for the other facilities. In the Government's view the group was not viable as a whole and we believe that employment could best be preserved by allowing the receiver to find purchasers for the various facilities. His success so far bears out this decision.<br/>
That is the position about the disposal of the yards, but the amendments that my hon. Friends have proposed are not only unacceptable but positively damaging, because of the compensation arrangements. If the amendments were carried the shareholders of the Drypool Group Ltd would have to be compensated fully on the basis set out in the Bill. The shareholders would receive compensation equal to the estimated value of their shares in the reference period September 1973 to February 1974. At that time there seemed no reason to doubt the viability of the group. The managing director of the company wrote to my right hon. Friend the then Secretary of State for Industry on 19th August 1974 asking to be excused nationalisation on the grounds of the efficiency of the company. If the managing director's letter had turned out to be an accurate reflection of the prospects of the company during the reference period&#x2014;it is not possible to say whether that is so or not&#x2014;the share-

holders would do very well indeed out of my hon. Friends' amendments. The amendments would not do much good to the workers in Hull, however.<br/>
The investigations that took place following the appointment of a reciever last year have demonstrated to the Government's satisfaction that the yards in the group stand by far the best chance of survival as viable concerns if they are run as separate units rather than remaining under the umbrella of a single company.</p>

<p>I cannot see how the compensation clauses bear upon this issue, in view of the drafting of the amendment. My hon. Friend is putting forward the argument that we heard in Committee. I have taken advice on how to meet the problem he mentions&#x2014;a problem that has arisen since the Selby yard was sold. I cannot understand why, if we buy assets from the receiver at existing value under an agreement between the receiver and British Shipbuilders, we should have to pay the shareholders. The amendment provides that we should buy assets, not pay compensation.</p>

<p>I am sorry, but the situation is as I have described it. My hon. Friend may well have received advice, but it does not bear upon the problem that I have described.<br/>
5.0 p.m.<br/>
Many of the assets of the Drypool Group Ltd. have been sold to buyers or are under negotiation. Nevertheless, that is irrelevant to the payment of compensation. We have to pay compensation on the basis of the value of the group during the reference period, regardless of the amendment. My hon. Friend knows that, because of the assets that have been sold off, if we vest the Dry-pool Group Ltd. in the corporation the underlying assets will be very few. We shall be paying the full compensation value for the shares in the company because, if a company is named in a schedule&#x2014;that is what my hon. Friend seeks to do&#x2014;it follows that the shareholders of the company must receive compensation. That is how the Bill stands. Therefore, the device which my hon. Friend is seeking to adopt to circumvent the situation which I describe would not be successful.<br/>
The financial affect of Amendment No. 220 would be disastrous. I must make clear that there is nothing whatever in the amendment which in any way removes the need to pay full compensation under the existing provisions of the Bill to the shareholders of the Drypool Group Ltd. The amendment will impose an additional cost to the corporation because it requires it to purchase from the receiver the assets of the group at a value to be determined by agreement between the corporation and the receiver as on the date of the coming into operation of the Bill. That would not be a substitute liability; it would be an additional financial liability on the corporation. It would be paying a great deal for hardly any assets.<br/>
The practical effect for the group, if it were inserted in the Bill, would be on vesting date to repay all the creditors of the group their outstanding debts. This would be an additional expense to the corporation. My hon. Friend would be vesting hardly anything but paying out three times over to the shareholders and creditors of a bankrupt company to whom the Government are not liable under the Bill. My hon. Friend would not be doing anything for his constituents but would be doing a great deal for the shareholders and creditors.<br/>
The overall effect of my hon. Friend's amendment would be to increase the commencing capital debt of the British Shipbuilders Corporation by the amount of the compensation that would have to be paid to the shareholders of a company that is now quite worthless. It would also saddle the corporation with the cost of buying back the assets from the receiver and, in addition, paying off the creditors. It would be very good indeed for them, very bad for the finances of the corporation and not do an atom of good for the constituents of my hon. Friend who is speaking in favour of the amendment.</p>

<p>I hesitate to intervene in a private argument between the Minister of State and his hon. Friend, but he keeps on implying that none of his hon.

<p>I accept that the speculative population of Kingston upon Hull is not so numerous as that of Havant and Waterloo. I accept also that it is conceivable that the odd person in Hull might be a shareholder in Drypool, but my hon. Friends are not here speaking for the shareholders. That is not the purpose of their amendment. Its purpose is to try to do something for the shipyard workers in their constituencies. My hon Friends will not achieve anything in that direction by the amendment, but they will benefit other people whom they are in no way seeking to help who would be directly helped by the amendments.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) spoke about the problem of unemployment in Humberside. That is a different problem, and a serious one. I am sorry that my hon. Friend was so negative about the work of the Department of Industry there. As he will know from close acquaintance with the situation, although it is distressing in many ways, a number of initiatives have been taken that are achieving certain results. My hon. Friend was fair in saying that Hull is not a development area. On the other hand, it is an intermediate area and thereby receives many benefits. Regional development grants at 20 per cent. are available. Selective financial assistance is available for new investment projects. The area has benefited a great deal in recent years from advance factory building and it has a reasonably well-diversified industrial base. My hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. Johnson) pointed out that communications had been improved following the opening of the M62.</p>

<p>Of course it is higher. It is higher because of the policies of his then right hon. Friend Lord Barber, which he so happily espouses and of which he is now probably one of the few exponents in the House.<br/>
Hull has an important r&#x00F4;le to play in the offshore oil market. Several firms are already working on offshore-related contracts. The area is benefiting from three important projects under the Accelerated Projects Scheme introduced by the Government. They are a major new pharmaceutical factory by Reckitt and Coleman, the Lindsey oil refinery, and BP Chemicals' new acetic acid plant. These projects will consolidate Humberside's already strong position in the chemical and petrochemical industries.</p>

<p>I intervene only briefly. The Minister of State has explained to those representing Hull constituencies that there are appalling difficulties involved in offering compensation and that it would be impossible to prevent the creditors or shareholders of the previous group from receiving additional payments.<br/>
The Hull Members will now realise why we consider the present payment terms to be so ludicrous and the whole system totally inadequate. They have found the other side of the problem&#x2014;namely, that payments for compensation are unlinked with reality. The Minister of State has explained to them that the Government cannot pay compensation for what is now as they will have to pay for what was in terms of share prices in 1973&#x2013;74. Situations have changed and not only in respect of Drypool Group Ltd. A quite different situation now exists, but the Minister of State has said that he cannot do anything about it and that it would be necessary to pay on the basis of a previous situation. This is a problem that will have to be faced when dealing with other companies.<br/>
A Press report was issued on Government assistance and the funds that they are giving to help the companies they are taking over. It said that assurances were given that the Selby yard would remain outside the nationalised shipbuilding industry, and that the company had received from the Government an undertaking that there would be adequate protection for it against unfair competition and any disadvantage caused by operating outside the public sector.

<p>A Press statement was issued, which I shall make available to the hon. Gentleman. I do not wish to paraphrase it as it was a carefully phrased statement. I believe that he has not reflected it accurately. Therefore, it would be as well if I procure a copy for him.<br/>
Yesterday Opposition Members were critical of the practice of reading extracts from newspapers, but I now have the report of the tribunal, which is even more devastating than the Press report that I read to the House. However, I shall

make the Press statement available to the hon. Member for Bridgwater (Mr. King). As for assurances about fair trading, they are contained in the new clause which the House agreed. There is no special assurance apart from the assurance of fair trading that we inserted into the Bill, stemming from the amendment of my right hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, North (Mr. Willey).</p>

<p>With the leave of the House, I listened with interest to my hon. Friend the Minister of State, who confirmed the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) and I made, namely, that although negotiations are going on for Yorkshire No. 1 and No. 2, the dry docks, which do not involve either of the refit docks, we understand that contracts have not yet been exchanged and that the matter is still subject to considerable discussion. Perhaps the most important discussions are taking place tomorrow. There is doubt about the whole situation.<br/>
Even if my hon. Friend the Minister of State deals with Yorkshire No. 1 and No. 2 in my constituency, he will not have dealt with the situation in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East. The dry fitting dock is not included. That will mean the loss of a couple of hundred jobs come October. My hon. Friend has not really met the point. Nor has he mentioned the various points that my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull. East made about training, apprenticeships and the supply of skilled work. He has also failed to meet the amendment. He has spoken long and eloquently about compensation without mentioning any figures.<br/>
We took careful advice upstairs about the amendment. If the worst happened from my hon. Friend's point of view and the best from mine and the amendment were to be accepted, the situation would be no worse than when the White Paper and the first Bill were published. Money would still have to be paid. We would still have to pay the money that we would have been prepared to pay had the companies been strong at that time and come within the ambit of the second Bill.<br/>
In the face of this sudden favour that private industry has with my right hon. Friends, especially small shipyards, if the amendment goes through, the negotiations take place and we get rid of Yorkshire No. 1 and No. 2 and solve the problem of the refit docks, the clause will become another small part of shipbuilding history&#x2014;namely, a preparation by constituency members for a contingency that never arose. If we are to have the confidence that my hon. Friend has that the receiver will be able to sell off the yards, this little matter could well pass into oblivion as an attempt made by Members to protect the interests of their constituents, but big brother Government saying that they knew better. If it should not happen like that, at least we shall have tried to do our best for our constituents and met the contingency, should it arise, of the Government's hopes not being met.<br/>
I do not want to dwell too long on the points made by my hon. Friend about the help that the Government have given to Humberside. Who are we to complain about the assistance that has come in our direction and maintained a few jobs? However, it did not maintain the jobs at Thorn or at Humber St. Andrews, or Imperial Typewriters or the fishing industry.<br/>
In defence of the Government and of my hon. Friends, I say that the biggest run-down in employment will be in the fishing industry and in private employment. The Conservative Government negotiated our present weakness regarding fishing by giving Common Market countries the right to take fish right up to our beaches up to 1981. Any gains that later Labour Governments may obtain will result from their strength in negotiations, not from any position of strength that we have been left by the

Conservative Government. That is an aside.</p>

<p>Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I was trying to be courteous to the House when I adopted the usual Committee procedure of asking for leave to speak again.<br/>
The hon. Member for Bridgwater (Mr. King) will recall that I sat through the Committee stage and spoke on only three occasions, which took considerably less time than he had for the dribble that he has spoken on this Bill. I shall defend my constituents, my interests and my philosophy under the rules of the House as long as I like. I do not expect the hon.

<p>I come to my final point. Having vented my spleen upon the Opposition, it is with regret that I tell my hon. Friend the Minister of State that I shall have to divide the House on this amendment. I do so with regret, because I always feel sorry when a Labour Government let down my constituents. This is contrary to what we promised them at the hustings, in our


manifesto and in personal undertakings. Having made a promise at the hustings and since, my hon. Friend and I feel bound by personal commitment to divide the House on this amendment.</p>

<p>Before discussing the amendments to Clause 20, which deals with the acquisition of appurtenant assets and liabilities of parent companies, I should like to say a word about the contingent liabilities of British Aerospace, to which I was hoping to refer on Clause 11, which, unfortunately, was not reached because of the timetable. I raise the matter now because the appurtenant asset liabilities may include contingent liabilities of the kind to which I am referring.<br/>
It is our understanding that the companies which will vest in British Aerospace have large contingent liabilities related to indemnities given to United Kingdom banks in respect of advance payments by export customers. We do not, in advance of the passage of the Bill, know the details of these liabilities, but they are likely to be substantial in total in relation to the financing limit of &#x00A3;250 million in the Bill. The limits

included in the Bill do not include provisions for these contingent liabilities crystallising.<br/>
In the unlikely event of one of these contingent liabilities crystallising, there will be an immediate increase in the indebtedness of British Aerospace, which will ultimately be met either by an increase in borrowing from the banks or by the provision of further Government finance. If such an increase exceeded the sums available to British Aerospace at that time under the existing financing limits, the Government would forthwith seek the authority of Parliament for an increase in the limits to meet the situation.</p>

<p>In Committee I made frequent attempts to improve the Bill, but whenever I did so the Minister said "We connot do that, because it breaks the precedents from the Gas Act". I became almost obsessed with the Gas Act and, therefore, studied it to see the many excellent things in it which the Minister might not have noticed and which we might be able to incorporate in the Bill.<br/>
The clause defines the base value of listed securities for compensation purposes as being determined by reference to the average quoted values on each Wednesday in the six months to Wednesday 27th February 1974. Although some concern was expressed on both sides about whether the compensation was too much or too little, everyone seemed to agree that that was a very artificial and short period for the purpose.<br/>
The object of my amendment is to provide the stockholders' representative with an election between two periods for valuation purposes, which include one longer period in place of the single six-month period specified in the Bill. Is the selection of only one period unique, or has it been done before? As far as I can see, it is almost exceptional in nationalisation measures. I can find it in no other.<br/>
There is a choice of two periods in the Transport Act 1947, the Electricity Act 1947, even in the Gas Act 1948, in the Iron and Steel Act 1949, the Iron and Steel Act 1967&#x2014;a terrible Act&#x2014;and the Ports Act 1969, which was even worse. In that dreadful measure, the Iron and Steel Act 1967, and in the Ports Act, the choices were between six months, in the case of steel five years, and in the case of ports three years. It has been recognised in all nationalisation Bills that the only way to try to be fair in all the circumstances is to have a choice between a short period and a


longer period. Six months is a very artificial period and can be very unfair.<br/>
Apart from that, we must see whether the six months' period is entirely normal and fair. I do not think that it can be, because the six months to the end of February 1974 were most unusual. They were unfair and abnormal months to choose for stock valuation purposes. There were first, the Middle East War; secondly, the oil crisis; thirdly, the miners' strike; fourthly, the three-day working week; fifthly, the run-up to the General Election; and, sixthly, price and dividend control throughout the period.<br/>
I appreciate that, as the Minister of State has admitted many times, under a Labour Government, disasters come frequently. It could be alleged that a disaster period was a normal period for valuation purposes, but I think even the hon. Gentleman will agree that to pick those six months when we had all those dreadful and unusual things is not fair.<br/>
In addition, no matter what formula is arrived at, if the period is as short as six months it may be fair to some and very unfair to others. My suggestion, which is a compromise based on all the precedents of other nationalisation measures, will be fairer because it gives a choice. It cannot be as fair as Amendment No. 293, which refers to a "fair price". That is the right way, but the Minister has said time and again that he wants to do it on the basis of stock market valuations. If he is doing that, it is better to pick a long period than a short period.<br/>
I hope that as a gesture of good will the hon. Gentleman will accept my reasonable amendment. If he is not entirely convinced, I ask him to answer two brief questions. First, why do all the other nationalisation measures adopt what I propose while his is different? Secondly, does he honestly think that it is fair to pick a period when there were events such as the Middle East War, the oil crisis, the miners' strike, the three-day working week, the run-up to the General Election and price and dividend control?<br/>
We are moving into a time of cumulative disasters because of Socialist Government. In Scotland there are 165,000 unemployed, and projects such as the Hunterston steel project are not

proceeding. Terrible things are happening all the time. But we are here talking about a period just after the golden age of Conservative Government, when things were going well. Therefore, to pick that six-month period is very unfair and unreasonable.<br/>
I hope that the Minister will accept my amendment. The only way to be fair to a diversity of companies whose circumstances were different is to give a choice of periods which will ensure that what may be fair for one can also be fair to others.</p>

<p>When the hon. Gentleman asks for a compromise, I am reminded of the late Kingsley Martin's demand for a fair balance between partiality and impartiality. The hon. Gentleman's request for the Government to make a concession to the House is a perfectly understandable request that we make a concession to him. I should like to explain why we cannot do so, although I think that the hon. Gentleman will know some of the reasons, because Amendment No. 290 is identical to an amendment moved and rejected in Committee.<br/>
The amendment seeks to offer the stockholders' representative for each company a choice of reference period for the valuation of securities. The hon. Gentleman proposes, in effect, an extension backwards of the existing reference from six months to a year. From the middle of 1972 to early 1975 the stock market generally was in decline. The <i>Financial Times</i> ordinary share index fell from an all-time peak of over 500 in mid-1972 to a low of less than 150 in January 1975. I think everyone would accept that both those extremes represented exceptional circumstances. Both were an exaggeration of the true market situation.<br/>
Between those two extremes the <i>Financial Times</i> index averaged about 370, almost identical to the average of the index throughout the reference period prescribed in the Bill. Therefore, I think that it would be accepted by most fair-minded people&#x2014;from whom I exclude the hon. Gentleman only in this context, and not generally&#x2014;that the present reference period could not be fairer than it is. It accurately reflects the mid-point of the market over the past three to four


years and avoids the period of excessive caution which gave rise to the abnormal low at the start of 1975. At the same time, it does not reflect the high degree of speculation during the golden period of which the hon. Gentleman spoke, which gave rise to the mid-1972 high.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman seems to take the view that this fair, mid-point position is not good enough. He believes that shareholders are entitled to make a profit from the historical accident that stock market levels happened to be higher in the early part of 1973 than in the early part of 1974. I cannot accept that. The amendment would inevitably give more to the shareholders at the expense of taxpayers. That cannot be fair.<br/>
The fairness of the six months to February 1974, during the golden period of Conservative Government which the hon Gentleman recollects&#x2014;indeed, when it reached its apotheosis&#x2014;is that it was the latest period in which stock market prices were unaffected by the prospect of nationalisation. Nobody knew, not even the then Prime Minister, that we should have a General Election on 28th February. Until almost the time when it was announced, nobody could have anticipated it. Pessimists as we are, there were not all that many of us who expected that if such an election came it would result in the return of a Labour Government, pledged to nationalisation of these industries. I recognise that the result of the election was a matter of some concern to the hon. Gentleman although he did unusually well&#x2014;but he will understand that I hope he will not continue to do so well in the future.<br/>
When we discussed the dividend controls in the safeguarding provisions in Committee, hon. Members opposite made great play of what they considered to be the injustice of a remote basis financial year for determining the permitted level of dividends. They claimed that it was inappropriate to control current dividend levels by reference to a past year. But in Amendment No. 290 the Opposition are proposing to extend the reference period for compensation further back in time. If they really believed that for dividends the past was of no relevance, it is hard to accept that in terms of a valuation the past suddenly becomes the most important factor. One is drawn to

the conclusion that hon. Members opposite are concerned only with obtaining the maximum possible for shareholders, with no regard to the consistency of their arguments.<br/>
The existing reference period offers a fair basis of valuation for the securities of the vesting companies. The alternative proposed in the amendment would destroy this fairness by giving an un-covenanted benefit to shareholders at the expense of the taxpayers. I therefore urge the Committee to reject the amendment.<br/>
Amendment No. 290 represents the partisan case put by the Opposition throughout the passage of the Bill on behalf of the shareholders, irrespective of the cost to the taxpayer. The Opposition are suggesting that the existing terms of the Bill are less than fair. We utterly reject that.<br/>
The compensation terms in the Bill are for unquoted securities to be valued as if they had been quoted on the Stock Exchange during the six months up to the end of February 1974. The Stock Exchange is well recognised as an impartial and objective judge of the value of securities. Techniques for imputing Stock Exchange valuations to unquoted securities are tried and tested&#x2014;in the City of London as well as within Government. It is sheer hypocrisy for Opposition to claim otherwise. Where it suits their case they are quite prepared to make use of the value of the stock market indices, either to criticise the present Government or to demonstrate their own achievements. It is therefore right to take into account the condition of the stock market in valuing shares for compensation purposes.<br/>
But it now suits them and those whose interests they represent to say that a Stock Exchange basis is not good enough. Instead, they are seeking to set the valuation at what they are pleased to call a fair price. They go on to say that that "fair price" should take account of the trading record and future prospects of the company and its net assets. As everyone knows, without a separate independent assets valuation, which is a very lengthy process, the net assets of a company as recorded in its books reflects only the particular accounting conventions of the company. There is nothing objective


about that. The amendment sets no yardstick whatsoever for taking into account past records and future prospects. What the Opposition are asking the House to approve is a compensation package which is open-ended and says little more than "compensation shall be as much as the shareholders can get".<br/>
I therefore urge the House to reject Amendment 293 for what it is, a shallow attempt to benefit shareholders at the expense of the community as a whole.</p>

<p>In his attack on the amendment, the Minister particularly criticised its wording. But it includes a direct extract from the statement of the previous Secretary of State for Industry when he established the basis of the price that the Government paid for the Court Line shares. It is unusual that the Minister should choose to attack that wording as if it was a totally unrealistic basis on which to proceed. We tabled the amendment on that basis with the words of the Secretary of State in mind. We assumed that if that was the correct basis on which the Government chose to work, it would be acceptable. It is wrong that the Minister should accuse us of inconsistency, because the Secretary of State said that legislation would provide for fair compensation. We wonder what the Government mean by "fair compensation".<br/>
We have been through the problem before. We are talking about shareholders, and the Minister made an interesting Freudian slip during our discussions on the Drypool Group when he said that he was not interested in the speculator element in Kingston upon Hull. In other words, in his mind "shareholder" means "speculator".<br/>
Does the hon. Gentleman realise that involved in this industry are about 1,000 pension funds? That is the best estimate that can be made. There is also about &#x00A3;200,000 of private money invested by individuals with very small savings. Their interests and their voices should be represented and heard in the House.<br/>
The Minister said that the stock market price was a fair way to value the worth of a company, but that is not true. Stock market listed prices are prices for small parcels of shares in daily circulation on the stock market. Why did he support the Felix-

stowe Docks Bill when the price quoted was 90p and the British Transport Docks Board recognised that to acquire control it would have to pay &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;50p each for the shares? That is an example of the total inconsistency of the Government.<br/>
In Committee the Minister said:
<q>We are paying what the shares are worth to the sellers while they are in the hands of the sellers."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee D,</i> 9th March 1976; c. 1655.]</q>
But he failed to mention that none of these people is a voluntary seller. They are being compulsorily released of their shares and they are certainly entitled to a normal commercial price. Normally, in any acquisition of control of an undertaking, people will pay up to one-third more for their shares. Inflation has increased by about one-third since that time.<br/>
I shall illustrate my case by explaining the position of two particular companies. Vosper Thornycroft, which is likely to get about &#x00A3;4 million in compensation, will probably make a profit of about &#x00A3;4 million this year, and it has assets of just under &#x00A3;20 million. No hon. Member can pretend that the proposed compensation comes within any definition of fairness. Yarrow will receive between &#x00A3;4 and &#x00A3;5 million in compensation, but its profits this year will be in excess of &#x00A3;7 million and its assets are worth &#x00A3;10 million.<br/>
We are not fighting this case on behalf of a few speculators. We are fighting for fair compensation for the 1,000 pension funds and other investors involved. We regard the Government's present proposals as being quite outrageous and ridiculous. Therefore, we shall press our second amendment to a Division.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. You will be aware that earlier today reference was made by my hon. Friends on the Government side about the activities of representatives of a public relations firm called International News Services, which has been particularly active in trying to impress a particular point of view over the legislation that we are now discussing.<br/>
Immediately before the last Division, on coming into the Chamber I observed a representative of that firm standing in the Members' Lobby in conversation with a Member of Parliament. I believe that the Members' Lobby is reserved for the use of Members of Parliament and accredited Lobby correspondents and that the gentleman concerned, as he is not an accredited Lobby correspondent, has no business to stay in the Members' Lobby in conversation. I therefore ask whether action can be taken to ensure that this person is not allowed to stay in the Members' Lobby, as this obviously reflects on matters which were brought to the attention of the House earlier.</p>

<p>Further to the point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I believe that my hon. Friend the Member for Sowerby (Mr. Madden) made a mistake, as you will have observed, when he said that

accredited Lobby correspondents are allowed in. In fact, no one but a Member is allowed to be in the Members' Lobby. Even accredited Lobby correspondents are not allowed there, much as we admire and respect them. If it is good enough for them to have to withdraw, I certainly think&#x2014;</p>

<p>The effect of these amendments will be to delete from the Bill the names of three warship manufacturers, Vickers Shipbuilding Group Limited, Vosper Thornycroft Limited and Yarrow (Shipbuilders) Limited.<br/>
Whatever the case for the nationalisation of some parts of the aircraft or shipbuilding industry, the warship manufacturing industry has special factors. Vickers, at Barrow-in-Furness employs 13,000 people. Yarrow operates on the Clyde, and Vosper Thornycroft employs 7,000 people at Woolston, near Southampton, and at Cosham, near Portsmouth.<br/>
Warship manufacture is highly specialised. The basic cost of the vessel in substantially final form is normally only half or two-thirds of the total cost, which includes the weapon packs.<br/>
The warship manufacturers engage in design and construction and work with the customers in producing highly specialised vessels. The three yards that I have named are designated by the Royal Navy as "lead yards" for design and construction. This means that they not only design the ships but are instructed and authorised to carry out the construction of first-of-line vessels. This is extremely important, as close technical co-operation is needed during the period of construction. It is normal for the customer, be it the Royal Navy or the overseas customer, to place a team with the manufacturer during the period of construction, and the design evolves in that period. Often expensive changes take place in design during the period of construction. Immediate and important decisions, involving large amounts of money, are frequently needed to be taken at short notice by the warship manufacturer during the period of manufacture. Anything that damages the close local control of the warship manufacturers will be damaging for the industry.<br/>
Manufacturers of warships have an exceptionally successful export record. Vosper Thorneycroft alone has exported 60 different orders to 29 different countries totalling about &#x00A3;300 million in value


since 1960. It attributes that achievement to expert and flexible management, working with a skilful and willing work force, and to a strong team of designers of wide experience who rapidly and convincingly produce the designs of the ships that their customers require. In other words, it is a team effort. It tends to be a happy industry. It is hard working and has a good labour relations record.<br/>
Thornycroft has won a record number of Queen's awards to industry. Its turnover since 1966 has risen from &#x00A3;6&#x00BD; million to &#x00A3;57 million a year. Its profit has risen from &#x00A3;400,000 to about &#x00A3;4 million this year. About 70 per cent. of its products are exported. However, the Government propose to pay only &#x00A3;4 million in compensation when they nationalise that company.<br/>
The important point about warship manufacture is the range of customers especially overseas customers. The Vosper Thornycroft record is impressive It provided four cruisers for Brazil, a corvette to Ghana, three fast patrol boats to Kenya, 24 fast patrol boats to Malaysia and two destroyers to Iran. The geographical spread of customers is mirrored by the political backgrounds of the r&#x00E9;gimes to which they are being exported.<br/>
I address my remarks especially to those who feel that a delicate conscience should govern the decision whether a building should take place. There are large numbers of countries to which orders are exported, the r&#x00E9;gimes in control of which may well not be approved. With the Government now seeking to bring increasing trade union involvement into management, I must ask the people working for the companies, through the Minister, whether they feel that their livelihood and the work they do should be under the possibly prejudicial hand of people who will seek to use political pressure to stop an order being fulfilled.<br/>
There is another point of importance. The Minister of State will be well aware of this. There are currently being built in different yards in this country warships that are intended for customers who may be mutually antipathetic. I shall not name names; it would be inappropriate and harmful for me to do so; but there are orders in hand in different companies whose destinations are countries the r&#x00E9;gimes of which might not agree, and

where the ships might be used against those manufactured by another company.<br/>
Again, I must ask the people working for these companies, through the Minister, whether they feel that it would be damaging for the industry to be nationalised so that there was only one company where it would be difficult for manufacture to take place for different countries unless all the countries which were customers were happy with each other. The Minister will take on board that point. He knows that orders would have been lost if the industry had been nationalised.<br/>
The effect of central control on the direction of orders would be disastrous in this industry. Vickers and Yarrow both operate in areas where unemployment is higher than in the Portsmouth and Southampton area. The temptation that a Government would find politically impossible to resist would be for the diversion of orders from an area of comparatively low unemployment to an area of higher unemployment. Indeed, that has happened. Already the Government have placed orders with Swan Hunter, despite the clearly stated policy of concentrating ship manufacture on the three main designated yards.</p>

<p>Does the hon. Gentleman not recognise that since before the turn of the century the Tyne shipbuilders have turned out some of the finest warships that have ever been built for this and many other countries? Does he recognise the insult that he pays to the shipbuilding workers of the Tyne when he suggests that they do not have the capability or the skills to build warships of the highest class, from frigates to battleships, if necessary?</p>

<p>I did not say the words that were attributed to me by the hon. Gentleman. Nor was I seeking to deprecate the activities of Swan Hunter, which I am sure is a first-class yard. Since the Booz-Allen report it has been clearly stated Government policy that warship manufacture will be concentrated on three main warship manufacturers. On that basis, those three manufacturers have built up their productive capacity. The Press report in which the announcement was made of the Swan Hunter orders made it clear that the Minister announced the Swan. Hunter orders after receiving a


delegation of six Labour Members of Parliament. The Government will beyond peradventure be subject to intense political pressure to divert orders from the three main designated manufacturers to other areas where they would like the orders and the work.<br/>
Let each firm stand alone in terms of orders and let it compete fairly. Above all, for the sake of export orders, let not the industry be nationalised with the possible risk of diversion of orders from highly successful companies to those which have not been so successful in winning orders. The manner in which nationalisation control will be exercised also causes us alarm. I cite the example of the British Steel Corporation and its failure to take decisions on Shotton and Port Talbot. This is a record of dither and delay, which is clearly attributable to the nationalised industries.<br/>
Decisions are taken for the wrong motives. There is clear evidence of favouritism in yielding to special pressure, whether in Scotland, Wales, or even in Kingston upon Hull, when hon. Members sought to bring pressure so that orders were placed there. There is a clear need for a Government who act on behalf of all the people.<br/>
A special point is involved in warship manufacture. The Admiralty has a proud and jealous record of its own developments of projects. There is a catch phrase used in industry&#x2014;"not invented here". If a project is invented by the Admiralty it is more likely to obtain ready backing. If the design is thought up somewhere else, it is uphill work to develop the project.<br/>
6.30 p.m.<br/>
Many of the brightest and most innovative ideas in warship manufacture were "not invented here" from the Admiralty's point of view and the ideas win through only because of the persistence and enthusiasm of the individuals and firms that develop them. This takes not only enthusiasm but money from the firms, and if the dead hand of nationalisation should fall on the industry, "not invented here" will become an article of faith.<br/>
Nationalisation will not allow small firms to fritter away their resources on individual projects. There will be a

central planning agency and "not invented here" will become the spirit in which it will work. Anyone running a nationalised industry will be obliged to impose a planning policy to cut out a large amount of development by smaller firms.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman has not listened to a word that has been said about decentralisation.

<p>The Minister's last point is not true. He feels that the amendment will settle the matter, but I throw back at him the record of the British Steel Corporation and the deplorable statement by the Secretary of State for Industry on the failure to reach a decision on Port Talbot. Forget amendments: the Government must stand on their record, and it is pretty deplorable.<br/>
The awkward squad who want to develop new ideas and push through proposals which do not fit in with the Admiralty thinking will get in the way in a nationalised industry and may find it more attractive to work elsewhere rather than in an octopus spawned by the Government.<br/>
The financial record of warship manufacturers is outsanding. Vosper Thorneycroft has a magnificent record not only of profitability but of investment. Shareholders' funds increased from &#x00A3;12&#x00B7;9 million to &#x00A3;19&#x00B7;6 million last year, of which &#x00A3;4&#x00B7;9 million was accounted for by the revaluation of fixed assets, but a substantial amount resulted from the reinvestment of profits, which has been company policy for some years.<br/>
Warship manufacturers do not want or need nationalisation. One is forced to the conclusion that the Government are nationalising the warship manufacturers to balance and pay for the nationalisation of the other shipyards that need Government help. Nationalisation will reduce local control and flexibility. There is no reason for it, and it will do nothing to improve profits or investment.<br/>
Overseas customers like dealing with individual firms. They like our manufacturers, and this leads to orders, which lead to jobs. I am surprised that the hon. Members for Portsmouth, North (Mr. Judd) and Southampton, Test (Mr. Gould) who have Vosper Thornycroft workers in their constituencies, are not here. No doubt they are engaged in important work elsewhere.<br/>
The nationalisation of warship manufacturers will cause a loss of jobs to the nation. For the manufacturers in general and Vosper Thornycroft in particular, it will lead to a diversion of profitable enterprise and employment to other less successful yards.</p>

<p>I agree with the hon. Member for Gosport (Mr. Viggers) about the products of the Vosper Thornycroft group. It makes a wide range of fighting ships which are sold all over the world, and has a record of construction and design that is second to none.<br/>
However, I feel that the hon. Member was being too pessimistic about the role of the warship building industry under the new corporation. None of the places that he mentioned has naval design teams as large as those in the North-East, particularly in the Swan Hunter group. That team had to work hard, on a competitive basis, to secure the recent orders for the group on the Tyne.<br/>
I confess that I was one of the hon. Members who lobbied the Minister responsible for defence procurement in an attempt to obtain the contracts. We were successful not because of political favour or lobbying but because it was known that the design team in the group was there at the right time and the right price, and that the yard could start work immediately on these highly sophisticated ships.<br/>
Countries all over the world have a high regard for the construction of British naval vessels. I do not think that nationalisation will diminish their enthusiasm for placing orders here. Most would even go to a totalitarian country if it provided the right ships at the right price. These countries will continue to come here whether the yards that we are discussing are included in or excluded from the State corporation.<br/>
I also wish that the hon. Members for Southampton were here, but I can assure the people in Vosper Thornycroft, in the Southampton area, and those in Yarrow, on the Clyde, that there will be plenty of work in naval construction, not merely for our own Navy but for others, and that even under a State corporation there will be a high level of competition. There will be an improvement in the capability of obtaining orders, because there will be much more research into the design of vessels. This research is already operating in some spheres. There is no need for gloom or worry. The naval side of the industry has a bright outlook.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Newton (Mr. Evans) is more expert than I on shipbuilding and he will confirm that the workers, management and designers in the new corporation will be good enough to get out and win orders.</p>

<p>I support the amendment, and shall wish to emphasise some of the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Gosport (Mr. Viggers).<br/>
I should like to say first to the hon. Member for Wallsend (Mr. Garrett) that other shipbuilders can of course build warships, but the three yards with which we are concerned in the amendment do not construct any merchant ships. They are specialist warship builders. They are in a different category from other yards, and nationalisation is likely to damage the essential service that they give to our national defence effort and to exports.<br/>
Warship building is a very specialised type of shipbuilding, requiring large design teams and quality control and sales organisations quite beyond those needed in the less specialised sector. It is a special part of the industry, and there are good reasons why it should not be nationalised.<br/>
The first reason is especially important at present. About 60 per cent. of all orders for naval vessels placed by foreign governments come to Great Britain. This important contribution to our balance of trade surely cannot be overlooked by the Government.<br/>
It is questionable whether foreign Governments would be as willing to place orders with British State-owned yards as they are with British companies. We


have to remember that the commercial basis of and the secrecy built into contracts is a factor of which foreign Governments must take account. It is obviously essential to incorporate foreign equipment in warship design where overseas governments place orders. This must be a matter of the greatest possible secrecy to the Governments concerned. They must have complete confidence in that secrecy being maintained by the firms with which they place contracts. They need not necessarily wish our own Government to be aware of the full detail.<br/>
My second point is to draw attention to the progressive and continuing improvement in the volume and profitability of export sales. We have to remember that warship building was isolated or drawn away from the rest of British shipbuilding at the time of the Booz-Allen Report. It seems to me likely that there will be an increasing need to rely on exports than there was in the past.<br/>
Let me try to make that more plain. In the recent Defence Review, it seemed to some of us that the resources available for warship building or for maintaining employment in warship building yards were not to be very high and that there would be considerable concern about whether sufficient resources were available to maintain our own defences on what was believed to be the necessary level. If that is true, Government supporters cannot have it both ways. If they believe it right, in expenditure cuts, to reduce the amount of money spent on defence, they cannot then expect full employment in our warship building yards.<br/>
That brings me back to my first point, which is that the 60 per cent. of export orders that we now complete in our British yards will have to be increased still further. Therefore, consideration for foreign Governments placing orders here is perhaps higher than it has ever been since the 1920s. I hope that hon. Members who take a different view from me on defence will remember that.<br/>
I come, then, to my third point. In supplying the Royal Navy, the Government would be trading with themselves. I recall using the same argument in relation to former efforts at nationalisation.<br/>
I have never thought it a very good idea to have no competition between the person placing the order and the person making the goods. It will be said that as there are such massive grants it does not really matter, but I do not accept that. I think that there is room for considerable competitive spirit between orderer and builder. In trading with themselves, the Government are likely to damage the economic sense of the business, as there is not the same imperative need to arrive at realistic contracts.<br/>
Perhaps I can divert for a moment and illustrate what I mean by discussing briefly the position between the present Government and Govan Shipbuilders. It is well known, from exchanges in this House in recent weeks, that contracts have been taken on at a wholly uneconomic rate from a foreign Government in order to sustain employment. It may be that that has merit in cases where the situation is as bad as it would have been in Govan Shipbuilders had we not obtained these foreign orders from Kuwait, but the three yards with which we are dealing in this amendment are not in that position; they are in precisely the reverse position. They are earning for the country valuable contracts and they are carrying them out profitably, to the benefit of the country.<br/>
6.45 p.m.<br/>
In nationalisation, damage will undoubtedly prove to be caused, amongst other factors, by the removal of control from the man on the spot who is in the yard to the distant policy-making body. On this amendment you would not allow me, Mr. Deputy Speaker, to rehearse any of the arguments already put forward about distribution, to which the Minister of State referred. But, as my hon. Friend the Member for Gosport said earlier, we have very little faith in the breakdown of huge corporations. The Minister of State will have achieved a miracle which even he might be modestly hesitant to recommend at this stage if he thinks that, through the shipbuilding corporation, he will achieve the breakdown of bureaucracy which we have not seen so far in nationalised industries.<br/>
There will also be a slowing down of technological advance. This is a very important factor. Throughout our long debates on this Bill, questions have been asked about the way in which such


matters would be handled, and whether each yard would continue to do its own research and development. But we are not really assured, because the Minister of State simply does not know. In this respect, he is in the happy position of being able to shrug his shoulders and point out that there is a corporation building up. My point is that it will probably build up much too large and be a much more substantial body than we want to see.<br/>
It is clear that the Government want to retain the profitable part of our industry&#x2014;as profitable as it is now. I have heard Government supporters express the view that they wish to nationalise industries that are profitable because to date they have been able only to nationalise industries which, broadly speaking, are unprofitable. I have pointed out before that our shipbuilders&#x2014;especially our warship builders and, in this case, Yarrows&#x2014;have already had the experience of being taken into the amalgam that dragged them down from profitability. They have now regained a remarkable degree of profitability, and in no way will I support their inclusion in the nationalisation provisions. The three warship builders that we are considering have had quite sufficient changes in recent years. A further change at this stage would be very damaging. Once again they would be amalgamated with merchant shipbuilders which, throughout the country and throughout the Western world, are having a very difficult time.<br/>
I shall not go further into the question of the profitability of our warship builders, but, as I have said, there are considerable national assets in their success, in terms of advantage to our balance of payments. My hon. Friend the Member for Gosport spoke of the investment made by Vosper Thornycroft. We have also to consider the investment made by Yarrows. Government supporters tend to concentrate their interest on the grants which have been made to the yard. However, apart from those grants and apart from the naval construction orders, the firm of Yarrows has invested many millions of pounds and now has an extremely up-to-date yard. That is no doubt due in part to Government grants, but part is due to the investment of considerable moneys from the firm's own resources. It cannot be

charged with earning profits on money paid over to it in grant form.<br/>
I have said before, as I said 10 years ago in this House, when the first amalgamation was suggested after the Geddes Report, that we simply cannot strengthen the weak by weakening the strong. We have this tiny element of strength within the British shipbuilding industry. All I am asking the House to do is to support these amendments, so that the strong shall retain their strength and be the national asset that I believe them to be.</p>

<p>I shall not detain the House long on those amendments because, frankly, I am amazed by them. I should very much like to know whether the hon. Member for Tynemouth (Mr. Trotter) is supporting these amendments or wishes us to oppose them. To be honest, I am a little doubtful whether I should go into the Lobby with the Tory Party and support it on these amendments.<br/>
We have not actually faced the consequences of what would happen if the Government were to accept this amendment or were defeated on a vote on it; because the hon. Lady and others opposite have spoken of political pressure being used to persuade the Government of the day to transfer naval orders from Yarrow, Vickers and Vosper's to areas like Tyne and Humberside. If these firms were not taken into public ownership or were left out of public ownership, the political pressure on a Labour Government would be absolutely intolerable because the whole northern and Scottish groups of MPs would be pressing them constantly to ensure that Royal Navy orders were placed in publicly-owned yards. Rather than saving the yards by taking them out of public ownership, I suggest we are threatening them very much by suggesting that they should not be taken out of public ownership.<br/>
In considering the question of orders for the Royal Navy I recall serving a part of my apprenticeship in a warship, the "Albion", and I know a little about warship construction. I well recall that that ship was in Swan Hunter's so long, because of constant changes in design. that some apprentices&#x2014;fitters, boilermakers, painters and electricians&#x2014;served their entire five-year apprenticeship on it.


It was said that when the ship finally left the Swan Hunter yard the band played "Will ye no come back again?". Those who have some knowledge of warship construction will know that it is the fattest, healthiest, most profitable form of shipbuilding order one can get; because, frankly, tender prices for warship construction are meaningless. As has been said here, design changes almost weekly, sometimes even daily, so that the tender price is quite meaningless, and there is is always a fat profit to be made on warships.<br/>
It is not surprising that companies like Vosper's, Vickers and Yarrow went over almost exclusively to warship building, which is very profitable. They have been able to invest some of their profits in modernising their yards, but we cannot lose sight of the fact that those profits came largely from the taxpayer, because in the main it is the taxpayers who are placing the orders. I recognise that these firms have export orders, but I am making the point that the backbone of the yards and their prosperity have come from orders from the Royal Navy, and not only warships in the accepted sense but fleet oilers and other Ministry of Defence vessels, orders for which have been placed with these yards.<br/>
People on the Tyne&#x2014;and I now represent a Mersey constituency&#x2014;could not understand why we did not get a fairer crack of the whip on Ministry of Defence orders for warships. In the unlikely event of this amendment succeeding, that will be greatly welcomed by some shipbuilders in other yards because I say here in this House that undoubtedly we shall use maximum political pressure on the Government to transfer orders for these yards, if they are not publicly owned, into publicly-owned industry. Warship orders have always been political. It has always been the case that orders have been given or ships sent for repair to places where unemployment is heavy. That has happened constantly since particular areas were stricken with heavy unemployment.<br/>
I recall one vessel, a fleet oiler named "Iona" which was in and out of the Tyne so much that it was generally recognised it did not need a pilot or tugs and could manoeuvre itself alongside the jetty. Every time unemployment started to rise the Government of the

day, whether Labour or Conservative, would send warships, fleet oilers or Ministry of Defence ships to the Tyne for repair during periods of heavy unemployment.<br/>
An hon. Gentleman opposite talked on and on about nationalisation and centralised control, and made a strong point about the decentralisation proposals involved in the Bill. These will be successful because the shipyard workers themselves will ensure that they are, but orders for the Admiralty are completely centrally controlled, because they come from Bath. Many times shipyard workers have to wait days or weeks for designs, drawings or confirmation of changes to come from Bath. To use a classic phrase, they are waiting for "the man from Bath". Therefore, when we talk of local control we are not talking of the warship building industry, because that is centrally controlled and in the main is operated from Bath. I submit to the House that it is not in the best interests of the industry to suggest that these firms should be taken out.<br/>
Finally, on the export field, it is understandable that we have built a very strong, worthwhile business building warships for the Royal Navy so that in this field the yards have acquired expertise which they can use in obtaining orders from foreign Governments. I see no danger whatsoever that any of these orders will be transferred from these yards. That is simply trying to throw a scare into my hon Friends from Southampton, who will not be influenced by it. There is no danger whatever to these yards. I expect a fairer spread of orders, but I submit that those yards which have built up expertise in this field will continue to use that expertise. I expect a fairer spread of orders throughout the British shipbuilding industry, and I mean orders for all types of ships throughout the United Kingdom; because if we are to save our industry, undoubtedly we need a national plan. This Bill will give us that, and I am sure that the prosperity of yards like Vosper's, Vickers and Yarrow will continue even more under a nationalised setup than under a private enterprise set-up.</p>

<p>As my hon. Friend the Member for Gosport


(Mr. Viggers) has pointed out, we are talking here of a success story. These three are among the most successful private enterprise firms in Britain. They have given the Royal Navy a magnificent fleet and they are the leaders in exports of naval vessels in the whole world. If one looks through the Fleet lists of the world one finds that throughout the whole range, from the Argentine to Zanzibar, practically all the countries in the free world build their navies or other vessels in these three yards. It is a remarkable story of good design, good ships, and, obviously, competitive prices. It is a story that has resulted in profits for these companies, and very substantial advantage in balance of payments terms for the whole of Britain.<br/>
One must start opposition to the nationalisation of these three companies, therefore, by asking what possible further advantage can come from changing an existing success story. I can see no reason whatsoever to suppose that any good can come from these three firms passing into public ownership; and all the probabilities are that this will be a story of disaster. As for the effect of nationalisation on the Royal Navy, when the Russian destroyer "Obraztsovy" called at Portsmouth it was noted that an air conditioner of Japanese make was installed in the wardroom. I do not know whether we shall ever reach the stage when the Royal Navy will have to depend on Japan for part of its equipment.<br/>
Certainly I would have thought that the effect of nationalisation on the Royal Navy's three principal specialist suppliers could only be disastrous. As my hon. Friend, the Member for Gosport pointed out, it is essential that these three companies should retain efficient independent design teams.<br/>
One only has to look at the difference between the Type 21 and Type 22 frigates. The Type 21 frigate was designed by Vosper and Yarrow. It was built on time at a fraction of the cost of the Type 22 frigate, designed by the Navy Department's team at Bath. This is just one example of private enterprise producing an excellent ship on time, and far more cheaply.<br/>
Then there is the question of cost benefit to the public. I see no way in

which public ownership of yards can bring any advantage. We shall see two public bodies arguing with each other&#x2014;the Royal Navy versus British Shipbuilders. In that sort of argument only an optimistic person could believe that public funds would figure very much. There would not be the keenness of discussion and negotiation there has been in the past when the question of the survival of these three yards as private enterprises was at stake. The taxpayer will find himself paying more for ships for the Royal Navy.<br/>
I do not think that hon. Members fully understand the effect of the rundown of the Navy as is being planned and executed by the present Government. On 26th April I asked the Minister of State for Defence for an estimate of the number of people engaged in the construction of warships for the Royal Navy. His answer was that there were about 20,000. On 8th April I asked for an estimate of the number of jobs which would be lost as a result of the reduction in equipment orders, particularly in the Royal Navy. He replied:
<q>The Defence Review reductions in the Royal Navy's shipbuilding programme will mean that about 11,000 direct job opportunities in the shipbuilding industry will be lost over the next 10 years."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 8th April 1976; Vol. 909, c. 285.]</q>
The first answer referred to 20,000 on warship building, so there is a staggering reduction ahead of warship builders as a result of the defence cuts. And that is before the last cuts, a week ago.<br/>
These three firms face very serious problems indeed for the future as a result of the Government's decision to cut defence expenditure, in the Navy particularly. Therefore, they will rely more than ever on miantaining export successes. If they are not successful in the export field there will be most serious problems, and a very substantial loss of jobs. With 11,000 jobs already at stake, we shall need to export more warships than ever before to maintain job numbers. The Minister of State seems to think that State ownership will help to increase exports. Some of his hon. Friends share that view. They must be supreme optimists of all time if they believe that. The ordinary man in the street would not agree with them for one moment.</p>

<p>But it was the biggest to begin with, and the situation has not changed yet. British Leyland has not been going on very long under State ownership.<br/>
I am not suggesting that there will be any change in 12 months or so, but over five or six years, there could be a very substantial change in the export orders of the three firms I have mentioned. I cannot see confidence being retained by foreign Governments.<br/>
In the past we have seen the extraordinary antics of Government supporters over the countries we should supply with ships. A survey ship was built for South Africa by one of these firms. Would the Government allow that to be sold when the firm is nationalised?</p>

<p>Certainly there have been sales of merchant ships to the Soviet

Union in recent times. I do not think any hon. Members would suggest that we should sell warships to the Soviet Union. They have enough of their own. They are just starting to produce aircraft carriers when we are getting ready to dispose of "Ark Royal".<br/>
Foreign Governments will begin to look around to find a more stable situation in which to place their warship orders. They will want a situation without political interference and control of the shipyards.<br/>
There is the question of the supply of spares. In maintaining the modernity of a ship after it is built it is much more advantageous to return for refits to the country in which that ship was originally built.<br/>
Then there is a question of bureaucracy in State ownership. The image of State-Britain abroad is one of a very inefficient outfit. This is the pattern one finds as one travels around the world, and to apply it to the manufacture of warships will lead to our being out on the deal.<br/>
Another question is that of muddle. For example, what shall we see on the Clyde? Shall we see Govan and Yarrow reorganised as they were? I suspect that, if they are locked together in that way, Yarrow will no longer be with us. People working in Yarrow would not want to be brought back in a forced marriage with their colleagues in Govan up the road.<br/>
There is also the question of names. The federation wishes to see all the names put in the dustbin. Apparently it wishes to be referred to as British Shipyards&#x2014;Tyne, British Shipyards&#x2014;Solent, or British Shipyards&#x2014;Clyde, depending on the area of the country. That would be the height of folly, because Vosper, Vickers and Yarrow are world-famous names, particularly for warships. To scrap them would be the height of folly.<br/>
The Government believe in industrial democracy and the Secretary of State for Energy says he believes that no executive action should be taken in a State-owned organisation without the agreement of the work force. So if the trade union leaders in the shipyards say that a name should be scrapped, even if that would be the height of folly, perhaps under the industrial democracy envisaged by the


Government the trade union leaders will get their way. We have no idea of the Government's views on that sort of issue. All that is still entirely in the air. If we scrap the names of Vickers, Yarrow and Vosper we shall be throwing away assets of immense value to this country.<br/>
We have no idea of the organisation which is to be established under the new corporations. We do not know where the headquarters will be located, although the Government have had months in which to discuss that. We do not know whether there will be a specialist warship division, but it is only realistic to assume that, if a number of high-powered and expensive Chiefs are appointed at head office, they will want a considerable number of Indians beneath them to control.<br/>
Whatever the Government may say at the moment, I believe that we shall see a very large headquarters organisation with certain gentlemen specialising in the control of warship building. There is the suggestion that, for the sake of peace in the provinces, there will be a geographical layer of administration, and that there will be the amalgamation of yards under individual management. All this is uncertain. After two and a half years in office, the Government have said nothing on these points.<br/>
There is the possibility of work being directed. The Govan yard, for example, after some years of nationalisation, could get no orders without taking them at a massive loss which the Minister of State is, perhaps, unwilling or unable to quantify. It may be that in future orders will be diverted from Yarrow's up the river, to keep Govan going. Cammell Laird was one of the firms building Type 42 destroyers along with Swan Hunter and Vickers. Recently, two more Type 42 destroyers were put out for tender. Cammell Laird put in for one, and possibly two, because without them the company would be coming to the end of its naval work, but the orders went to Swan Hunter and Vosper Thornycroft. Perhaps the Navy was told that the orders should go to those companies; but it is unlikely, in view of the unemployment on Merseyside, for there to be a ministerial decision deliberately to divert work away from the Mersey. Perhaps Cammell Laird lost the order because it could not match the price or delivery of its competitors.<br/>
What will be the future position? The head of British Shipbuilders is the present head of Cammell Laird, a gentleman of strong views who wishes to see the headquarters of the corporation placed in that backwater of British shipbuilding on the Mersey. Perhaps he will have similar views about where the work should go in future. What evidence does the work force at Vosper's, Yarrow, or even Vickers have that in future orders will not be diverted to Cammell Laird just because the chief executive of the corporation thinks it is a good idea.<br/>
We have had no argument show that nationalisation will be of any advantage to these firms. The country cannot afford to nationalise these industries and those who work in them can ill afford it, either. There would be a saving of public funds if they were omitted from the nationalisation proposals. I am sure that the IMF would rejoice, and the Chancellor would find his problems that much reduced if the money were saved. These firms mus export to survive, and they are much more likely to do so if they remain in the efficient hands that have brought them to their present successful position.</p>

<p>I hope that the Government will resist the amendment. It is an exercise in necrophilia&#x2014;intercourse with the dead&#x2014;and that will happen after the vote. I want to see the warship builders in the corral. My favourite television programme concerns a place called Shiloh, and that means "corral of peace". I want peace in industry.<br/>
I know Yarrow very well and I can understand the loss of face felt by Sir Eric Yarrow under the nationalisation criteria. Throughout my time in this House I have been the big ear for Yarrow, lobbying Ministers. This place is one big pressure group, but where do the pressure groups come from after nationalisation? Tony Griffin will be the organising manager. Scott Lithgow builds submarines and warships on the Clyde, and Ross Belch is on record as saying that he will help to make the nationalised industry work.<br/>
The reality of life is that the big nationalised group must be the recipient of defence orders. Yarrow has a tremendous record. If one goes to its yard, one might as well go to the United Nations.


It builds for the world. I do not see anything to stop that yard, or any other, from building for the world after nationalisation. There will be only a change of name.<br/>
Perhaps it would be as well if I used less Greek than usual. Let me refer only to Pandora and, with her, Pyrrha and Deucalion, the brother and sister who threw their mother's bones over their shoulders. And so in the sense that these shipyards want to throw their bones out and remain outside the bigger group, they are making a big mistake.</p>

<p>We have heard about Yarrow. I hope that hon. Members will not consider that I am being partial if I refer only to Scottish yards.<br/>
On one side of the Clyde there is Yarrow and on the other is Govan Shipbuilders. At one time Yarrow was part of Govan and the organisation made a loss. Yarrow managed to get out, and since then, in the last four years or so, it has made a gross profit of &#x00A3;16 million with a net profit of &#x00A3;10 million. It has reinvested &#x00A3;8 million of that amount. It has increased its work force from 3,500 to 5,000. In other words, it has created a real and viable improvement. One of the prides of the world is to be able to say "That ship was built at Yarrow's". I do not believe that that record, that capacity and that skill will be sustained after nationalisation.<br/>
To confirm me in that belief I had only to listen to the words of the hon. Member for Newton (Mr. Evans), who said that, after nationalisation, the Members of Parliament representing the Clyde and the Tyne would no longer need to fight one another for the orders; he said they would not need to badger the Government or the Ministry of Defence because there would be a fair spread of orders.<br/>
Let us examine that philosophy. The Minister of State was responsible for steering through that crapulous Bill which claims as its ideal to make British industry more efficient and to remove over-manning. Let us consider the concept whereby we shall be fair to the yards of the Tyne and the Clyde. We shall say "One order for you, and one for you". Orders will be artificially created and granted, regardless of the

capacity of the yard to win, sustain and execute them. We shall introduce an element of inefficiency and bureaucracy. Who is to take this great decision?<br/>
When the work forces on the Clyde who have taken pride in the success of their companies see work being sacrificed to some other yard called British Shipbuilders (Tyne) will they not come to their Members of Parliament and say "What about our jobs?" Will the Government say, as I. fear is the lesson of nationalisation, "However many orders you have or however many orders you have not, whatever profits you make or whatever losses you make, there is a philosophy of nationalisation which permits us, your big brother and your kind father, to guarantee your job and to guarantee from the bottomless sack of international money the funds required to sustain the enterprise however much it may fail."<br/>
I have heard no argument to tell me that, when the yards are nationalised, they will be more efficient, more profitable and better employed, or that employment will increase. I have heard arguments that employment will be guaranteed, and that, regardless of the creative capacity of the yard, orders will be spread amongst the yards, but I have heard no word to suggest that the yards will be more efficiently or more imaginatively run.<br/>
The yards will be run by bureaucracy. The instant decisions that have to be taken daily at Yarrow will take months. A decision will first have to be taken about which piece of bureaucracy shall decide. The country has a disease, easy to contract and difficult to cure, and that is the justification for bureaucracy. As soon as there is one tier, there is justification for a lower tier and another below that. That is what will happen.<br/>
I regret that the great and proud quality that made Yarrow will be lost. We threw away the markets of Southern Africa. They were proud to say that their ships had been made in Yarrow. Now they are made in France. I cannot believe that there are many foreign countries which will order boats, sail them and say that they are proud that they were made in British Shipbuilders (Clyde). The Bill is destructive of a great craft in Scotland, and I regret that tonight we


shall purblind see the fate of British shipbuilding.</p>

<p>The Opposition are telling us that it is inappropriate and unsuitable for warships to be manufactured under the chairmanship of Admiral Sir Anthony Griffin, Controller of the Navy since 1971; educated at the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth; joined Royal Navy 1934; went to sea as a midshipman in 1939; war service in the East Indies, Mediterranean, Atlantic, North Russia and Far East; specialised in nagivation, 1944; Staff College, 1952; Imperial Defence College, 1963; Commander HMS "Ark Royal" 1964&#x2013;65; Assistant Chief of Naval Staff (Warfare) 1966&#x2013;68; Flag Officer, Second-in-Command, Far East Fleet, 1968&#x2013;69; Flag Officer, Plymouth, Commander, Central Sub Area Eastern Atlantic, and Commander Plymouth, Sub Area Channel, 1969&#x2013;71; Commander 1951; Captain 1956; Rear-Admiral 1966; Vice-Admiral 1968; Admiral 1971.

<p>No, I shall not give way. The hon. and learned Gentleman has tilted at his windmill. He has talked even more irredeemable rubbish than usual. I see that the hon. Member for Hampstead (Mr. Finsberg)&#x2014;speaking for the shipyard workers of Hampstead&#x2014;has come to reinforce the rubbish spoken by the hon. and learned Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fairbairn).<br/>
We are told by Opposition Members that this man, with this flimsy and irrelevant record, is inadequate to have anything to do with the building of warships. We are also told that it is inappropriate to have a publicly-owned warship building industry because the customers will not like it. Who are these customers? Are they private mariners? Are they enthusiasts who go around collecting warships as a hobby? No, they are Governments. The only people I know who buy warships are Governments, and they are publicly owned. It is an interesting concept of public ownership that the armed forces of foreign Governments will be repelled by the idea of buying warships manufactured by the publicly-owned British Shipbuilders under Admiral Griffin.</p>

<p>No, I shall not give way. Had it not been for the speech of the hon. and learned Member for Kinross and West Perthshire, the hon. Member for Gosport (Mr. Viggers) would have talked the greatest rubbish in the debate. I see that the hon. Member for Blaby (Mr. Lawson)&#x2014;speaking for the shipyard workers of Blaby&#x2014;has come in. I do not know whether his mask is slipping.<br/>
The hon. and learned Member for Kinross and West Perthshire, the hon. Member for Gosport&#x2014;who has taken no interest in the Bill until tonight&#x2014;and the hon. Member for Tynemouth (Mr. Trotter)&#x2014;who has taken a great and informed interest in the Bill&#x2014;have all disregarded the statements made over and over again by the Organising Committee and in the House by Ministers that it is almost certain that the component companies of British Shipbuilders will retain their present names. All the fanciful romancing about British Shipbuilders (Tyne) and British Shipbuilders (Clyde) served to fill up the speeches of hon. Gentlemen who have taken no interest in the Bill until its final stages, but it is completely inaccurate.<br/>
Opposition Members appear to subscribe to the theory that only loss-making companies shall be taken into public ownership. That is what the Conservatives did when they were in power. They nationalised Rolls-Royce when it went bankrupt. They nationalised Govan Shipyards&#x2014;which is held up to us as such a paragon of failure. They did it. They were the people who had four years of nationalising loss-makers, and they believe that a Socialist Government should nationalise only loss-makers.<br/>
The Government do not accept that proposition. We do not believe it is right that losses should be nationalised and profits "profitised". Nor do we accept a shipbuilding industry that is privately profitable on the basis of public funding.<br/>
It would be extremely illogical if, in taking the shipbuilding industry into public ownership, we were to exclude precisely those companies that are most dependent on the Government for their survival. Yet that is what the amendment seeks to do.<br/>
Hon. Members have placed great stress on the warship building sector. The Government believe that as a nation we must have an overall plan for our national shipbuilding resources. Arguments advanced of the importance of warship building are arguments for including this sector in the future public sector.<br/>
7.30 p.m.<br/>
The significance of warship building to the industry is clear. In a booklet commissioned by two of the warship builders named in the Bill&#x2014;namely, Vosper Thornycroft Limited and Yarrow (Shipbuilders) Ltd, entitled "The Special Case For The Naval Shipbuilders"&#x2014;it is claimed that in five years the two companies have secured export orders worth &#x00A3;273 million. The three warship builders give employment to 20,000 men. Those are all good reasons for vesting the companies in British Shipbuilders and not for excluding them.<br/>
Great play has been made of the fact that a considerable part of the profits of these companies comes from export orders, but it is not trumpeted so loudly that those orders are obtained only because the warship builders are major Ministry of Defence contractors. It is on that that their standing as naval builders depends. The fact that their products are acceptable to the Royal Navy means that they are acceptable to other nations' navies. In addition&#x2014;this confutes what many Opposition Members have been claiming&#x2014;they obtain a great deal of assistance from the Ministry of Defence in winning orders. That is the purpose of MOD Defence Sales. Construction grants provided under the Industry Act 1972, enacted by the Conservative Government, were paid on export warship contracts but not on Ministry of Defence orders. That is a point that the hon. Member for Gloucestershire, South (Mr. Cope) got completely wrong in Committee.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Renfrew-shire, East (Miss Harvie Anderson), who has explained why she cannot be here, and the hon. and learned Member for Kinross and West Perthshire dealt in great detail with Yarrows. Anyone would think that the company was the epitome of sturdy, independent private enterprise. In fact, the company was

rescued from insolvency by a Ministry of Defence loan of &#x00A3;4&#x00BD; million in 1971. Sir Eric Yarrow's letter to shareholders on 12th March 1971 indicated that the loss for the 10 months ending 30th June 1970 would be about &#x00A3;3 million.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Knutsford (Mr. Davies), when he was Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, announced to Parliament on 10th February 1971 that it was the Government's decision that the Ministry of Defence would make a loan to Yarrow (Shipbuilders) Limited towards meeting its requirements for working capital. The right hon. Gentleman said:
<q>Both Yarrow (Shipbuilders) and UCS have encountered difficulties in recent years and both face problems of serious cash deficiency."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 10th February 1971, Vol. 811, c. 809.]</q>
If it had not been for Government aid, the company's shares would now be completely worthless. Without public money Yarrows would not be in a position to receive any compensation.<br/>
Opposition Members have talked about the profitability of Yarrows, but let us look at what lies behind the profits. Pre-tax profits include over &#x00A3;4 million in Government grants, including &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;8 million in construction grants and &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;2 million in regional employment premium. To get a clearer view of the picture, we need to look at the six years from 1970 to 1975. The 1970 results showed post- and pre-tax losses of &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;72 million. Cumulative pre-tax profits for the six years were &#x00A3;13&#x00B7;93 million. Post-tax profits were &#x00A3;7&#x00B7;59 million. Government grants in this period amounted to &#x00A3;4&#x00B7;36 million.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman is gibbering on so much that he does not listen to what is said.<br/>
When the right hon. Member for Renfrewshire, East spoke in Committee in February 1971 about Yarrows profits she conveniently excluded 1970 from her calculations. In that year certain provisions for future losses were set up&#x2014;provisions that contributed &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;45 million to profitability in the five subsequent years as those provisions were written back. It is also a fact that net interest received,


after deducting interest paid, contributed &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;8 million of profits during the years in question. This is a perfectly proper credit to profits; it is not an operating profit.<br/>
The case put up by the Opposition is bogus. The case for the nationalisation of the warship companies is unanswerable, and I hope that the House will support the Government in that proposition.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-07-29a.975.0" hansard_membership_id="6882" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2933" speakername="Mr. Tom King" colnum="975" time="">
<p>As we draw towards the end of these long sessions on the Bill, we get to know the Minister of State better and better. One of the Kaufman laws that we now recognise is that the weaker the case, the greater the abuse and the more supercilious the approach.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman, speaking as he does with great authority for the shipyard workers of Manchester, Ardwick &#x2014;that is the way in which he referred to several of my hon. Friends&#x2014;was unwise to refer to Admiral Griffin. He brought him into the debate; no one else did. The admiral is someone with distinguished naval service, but unfortunately&#x2014;the Minister of State raised the matter&#x2014;he has never built a ship in his life. He is now to be Chairman of British Shipbuilders.<br/>
I am bound to say that there have been criticisms by a Select Committee of certain of the ways in which warships were ordered by the procurement department. I thought that the Minister of State made a singularly prolonged non-point when he read out the distinguished war service of someone whom the Opposition have not criticised. However, in all that record of service there is no experience of shipbuilding.<br/>
The whole point of the debate on the warship builders&#x2014;I hope that this is the concern of all hon. Members&#x2014;is whether those who work in the industry are likely to be better or worse off when nationalisation takes place. I shall explain why we believe that the future of the yards, the prosperity of the people who work in them, the prosperity of the regions where they are located and, therefore, the national interest would be better served if they remained independent.<br/>
The hon. Member for Wallsend (Mr. Garrett) said he could promise that there would be plenty of orders both for specialist warship builders and for other

yards in the United Kingdom. I do not know what special access to the placing of shipyard orders the hon. Gentleman has. I do not know how he is able to override the projections that I think are accepted by the Government of a worldwide slump in shipbuilding and a 100 per cent. excess of capacity over demand. At present there is twice as much capacity as projected demanded over the coming years. In those circumstances, a promise of ample orders is obviously unrealistic.<br/>
The hon. Member for Newton (Mr. Evans)&#x2014;I notice that neither the hon. Member for Wallsend nor the hon. Member for Newton has been in the Chamber to hear the Minister or myself&#x2014;said that there would be a fairer spread of orders. The hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Mitchell) wisely absented himself from the debate at that stage. What do his hon. Friends mean? A fairer spread of orders in terms of someone who works for Swan Hunter can only mean fewer orders elsewhere. Surely the logic of that is inevitable.<br/>
When we hear where the real threats to employment lie, we must be struck by the figures quoted by my hon. Friend the Member for Tynemouth (Mr. Trotter). He quoted figures from an official parliamentary answer. According to that answer, there are now 20,000 people engaged in warship building. The likely job losses forecast by the Government in their own answer amount to 11,000 over the next 10 years as a result of the defence cuts. If we look to find where the damage to these industries is likely to come from, we find that the real responsibility lies with the defence cuts which have been announced. If that is true, the only hope for the yards lies with an even greater export achievement.<br/>
The main burden of our case is that export orders are likely to be damaged by a nationalised corporation. The Minister of State thought that he had made a telling point when he said "How can people object to buying from a Government when most of those who buy warships are Governments?" That might sound a quite good point until one thinks about it. It is the experience of all who work in the industry&#x2014;I do not think that the Minister of State has had that privilege any more than I have, but I refer to my experience and intelligence &#x2014;that Governments prefer not to deal


directly Government to Government in these matters, some of which are confidential.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I distinctly heard the hon. Gentleman say that he "formally" moved the amendment. The usual custom is that an hon. Member formally moves an amendment, and that is it. I was hoping that the hon. Gentleman would then sit down.</p>

<p>I move the amendment, and I do so with complete informality.<br/>
In view of the Government's provisions for the computation of compensation, it is reasonable to assume that there will be arbitration proceedings in each of these 43 cases. It is necessary, therefore, that a pattern should be established and that it should be known to all those taking part as representatives of stockholders in the discussions before arbitration tribunals.<br/>
We know that a considerable period of time is likely to elapse before all the hearings can take place. We know that there are 43 sets of books to be examined by a firm of auditors on behalf of the Government. Therefore, it is important that we should have the speediest possible arbitration hearings when that stage is reached, to determine the amount of compensation.<br/>
It will be of great assistance to those representing stockholders if they are aware of decisions on previous hearings in other cases brought under the Act. That is the purpose of this amendment, so that if any stockholders' representative in any one case agrees, there should be made available to the stockholders of other companies the reasons given by the arbitration tribunal for its findings, to provide a pattern for use in establishing a precedent between cases.</p>

<p>I sympathise with the hon. Gentleman's sentiments, but his amendment will not achieve anything that cannot already be achieved, because under the existing Tribunals and Inquiries Act 1971 and under the appropriate regulations governing the procedure on tribunals, for which provision is made in paragraphs 5(1) and 10(1) of Schedule 7 and also in Clause 42(10) of this Bill, the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Arbitration Tribunal will be included in Schedule 1 of the Tribunals and Inquiries Act 1971; so that not only does this Act require tribunals listed in Schedule 1 to furnish interested bodies with
<q>a statement, either written or oral, of the reasons for the decision, if requested, on or before the giving or notification of decision, to state the reasons</q>
but in addition to that, we intend to make regulations under Schedule 7 to achieve the result that the hon. Gentleman desires, in the same way as was done in the regulations governing the


conduct of the Iron and Steel Arbitration Tribunal. In the light of the reasons that I have just listed, and also in the light of a letter written to the hon. Gentleman by my hon. Friend the Minister of State on 28th April, I hope that he will now be able to ask leave of the House to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.<br/>
In doing so I should like to say although this may not be the last occasion on which we discuss this Bill in this House &#x2014;because, for example, another place may want to pass a minor amendment or two with which we shall have to deal &#x2014;I should like to thank my hon. Friend the Minister of State, the Under-Secretary of State and my hon. Friends the Members for Glasgow, Kelvingrove (Mr. Carmichael) and Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Helfer) for taking this Bill so far success, fully up to this Third reading stage. They and my hon. and right hon. Friends who were members of the Standing Committee must take credit for getting the Bill this far. The Minister of State and the Under-Secretary had to bear the brunt of the 58 Committee sittings and the hundreds of hours of debate, and we have all come to admire not only their hard work but their skill and, not least, their stamina. When this Bill reaches the statute book, as it will, it will be my hon. Friends who not only deserve but will get the credit. They argued successfully for the public ownership of the aircraft and shipbuilding industries during those debates throughout the consideration of the Bill.<br/>
Public ownership is urgently needed for both industries, and it has been asked for by the workers in those industries. On Second Reading, I set out the case for taking the aircraft industry into public ownership. The need to combine the resources of the two main airframe companies is widely accepted. I believe that it is accepted by the Opposition. Ten years after the Plowden Committee's report, private enterprise has failed to bring that about. A merger under public ownership will improve public account-

ability in an industry that is heavily dependent on Government orders in the military field and on Government support in the civil field. Under public ownership it will be possible to take key strategic decisions on a coherent basis. This powerful case has never been challenged effectively.<br/>
The need for the British Aircraft Corporation and Hawker Siddeley Aviation to combine their strengths is illustrated by the recent discussions between aircraft manufacturers in Europe and America about collaboration on future civil aircraft projects. These discussions have made a unified approach even more urgent. The British Aircraft Corporation has its Concorde and Jaguar links with France and its MRCA-Tornado links with Germany and Italy. Hawker Siddeley has its European Airbus links with Germany and France and its Harrier and other links with McDonnell-Douglas.<br/>
Over recent months the stark reality has forced itself increasingly on the aircraft industry that the United Kingdom must speak with a single authoritative voice. We must sort out what project to back and which partners to work with, and we cannot do that while we are divided. We must combine our resources urgently.<br/>
At last the companies have begun to work together in this sector, with the Organising Committee taking the initiative and giving the lead. The Organising Committee, which is now in business, provides a talented team to lead the industry at a critical time. It includes some of the ablest men in industry, and able and experienced men from the trade union movement and outside industry. All of them are committed to making a success of the industry after vesting day and they are hard at work in preparation.<br/>
The case for nationalising the shipbuilding industry is overwhelming. Britain's shipyards have lost their formerly dominant position since the war. In 1955 our merchant ship output of 1&#x00B7;3 million gross registered tons was larger than that of any other country and amounted to 26 per cent. of the world total. In under 20 years after that, our share of the market in tonnage terms slipped to only 3&#x00B7;6 per cent.<br/>
Management and unions now accept that to survive as a world shipbuilding


nation we must have a coherent shipbuilding strategy. Moreover, the problems of over-capacity in shipbuilding are now worse than they have been since the 1930s. New Orders for ships over the next five years are likely to fall far short of world capacity. In these circumstances, the case for a concerted national effort is overwhelming. In the Government's view, the public ownership proposals in the Bill offer the only satisfactory prospect of a unified national shipbuilding effort, and without a unified effort the industry will simply not survive.<br/>
In ship repairing, there is a clear need for new investment in more modern facilities, for which Government funds will be essential. Without this modernisation, employment in the industry will undoubtedly decline.<br/>
The most significant ship repairing units are those which are located on the main estuaries in Great Britain&#x2014;fox example the Mersey, the Tyne, the Thames, the Bristol Channel, the Humber, Falmouth or the Lower Clyde. The Bill will bring into public ownership all the large ship-repairing companies located on the main estuaries. This will enable the corporation to produce a coherent strategy for the larger ship-repairing yards as a whole.<br/>
Nationalisation of the specialist makers of slow-speed diesel marine engines is equally necessary, because they are dependent on the rest of the shipbuilding industry. The future survival and success of these companies are completely bound up with their role as makers of 80 per cent. of all engines supplied to the merchant shipbuilders named in the Bill.<br/>
At the present difficult stage in the affairs of these industries, we must end uncertainty quickly. We have assembled a first-class team in the organising committee, which has made an outstandingly good start. We have begun a series of important tripartite discussions between Government, the Organising Committee and the trade unions in which we are looking at ways of tackling the problems of shipbuilding in a united way. But the Organising Committee cannot really get to grips with the problems confronting the industries until the Bill is on the statute book. Failure to achieve this would have serious consequences for all those

involved in shipbuilding, ship repair and related activities.<br/>
One of the Bill's main themes is industrial democracy, and this is an aspect of the Bill which has been significantly extended on Report. Industrial democracy is central to the Bill in a number of ways. First, we decided to introduce the Bill partly as a result of the expressed wishes of the workers in the two industries, through their representative unions. Second, one of the social priorities of this Government is to bring about an irreversible shift in the balance of wealth and power in favour of working people. This measure is one part of the fulfilment of that priority in industry. Third, there is the plain fact that efficiency follows consent.<br/>
Industrial democracy reflects one of the most hopeful themes of the nation's present mood. It is an opportunity to enlist the commitment and enthusiasm of workers, at all levels, to the industries of which they are a vital part. Participation and consent are at the heart of our strategy for the regeneration of British industry.<br/>
It is right, therefore, that the most important changes to the Bill on Report have been made in the field of industrial democracy. The amendments, taken together, place a positive duty on the corporations to promote industrial democracy, to enter into consultations with the unions within three months of vesting on how it should be done, and to have regard to industrial democracy in drawing up their organisation and reviewing it periodically.<br/>
The Bill already contained a requirement to include in each annual report a report on progress in promoting industrial democracy. These provisions clearly establish industrial democracy as one of the main terms of reference of the corporations. The Bill lays down a framework which will keep industrial democracy to the front of the corporations' minds, but it avoids thrusting down the industries' throats a particular structure which may not be suitable and which may not be what the workers in them favour.<br/>
Yesterday evening I said that the Government were considering what they could do about the situation referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol,


North-West (Mr. Thomas) in relation to staff associations when he spoke to Amendment No. 329, which sought to limit the definition of "relevant trade union" to CSEU unions.<br/>
This is a complex matter. We have given careful and sympathetic consideration to the problem, and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Employment has authorised me to say that the Government agree that the general legislation relating to certification of independence is unsatisfactory and needs tightening up. The existing provisions result in certificates being granted in circumstances where there is a risk of their being used to upset stable collective bargaining arrangements and to create damaging inter-union disputes.<br/>
Accordingly, we intend to take action at the earliest opportunity in response to this unsatisfactory situation by tightening the arrangements. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Employment will be consulting the main interested organisations, including the TUC and ACAS, about the form such action might properly take. I have informed the Chairmen of the two Organising Committees of the Government's intention, which affects them as well as other employers, and I shall invite them, like other employers, to take it into account in their own dealings with staff associations in their industries.<br/>
In view of the Government's intention to take action on this general basis, we did not feel it right to accept Amendment No. 329, and I am sure that my hon. Friends, in the light of what I have said, will understand why.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State is telling the House that once more the freedom of individual employees to decide how they want to be represented is to be curtailed in favour of a centralised system negotiated without any consultation by the TUC.

<p>That is an exaggeration of what I said, typical of the hon. Member for Henley (Mr. Heseltine). I hope that the hon. Gentleman will study what

I said. The general legislation relating to certification of independence is unsatisfactory and needs tightening up. The Government accept that and will take steps to do it in consultation with the organisations concerned.<br/>
Public ownership of these two industries is needed if we are to have a coherent strategy for them. Public ownership will bring about the necessary structural change and will improve public accountability and the quality of decisions in important areas of the United Kingdom economy.</p>

<p>After a timetable motion, it is customary not to spend a great deal of time on the Third Reading debate, so I shall be brief in the way that the Secretary of State has been brief.<br/>
I hope that, like the Secretary of State, I can trespass on your good will, Mr. Deputy Speaker, to say a personal word of thanks to those of my colleagues who have borne such a remarkable load in opposing the Bill. It has been the longest Committee stage and the most protracted opposition to any Bill in the history of Parliament. That is an indication of our determination to use every constitutional means at our disposal to prevent the Bill reaching the statute book.<br/>
I single out particularly, conscious that it is an invidious distinction, my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgwater (Mr. King), who played a conspicuous part in Committee. While we have not agreed with a great deal of what the Minister of State and the Under-Secretary of State said in Committee, we have never disagreed with the way in which they said it, apart from one or two occasional lapses such as happen in any Committee. I utter a word of congratulation to the Secretary of State, who had the foresight and wisdom to entrust the Committee proceedings to the Minister of State and thus avoid for himself the 58 sittings.<br/>
The speech made by the Secretary of State is typical of speeches made by every Labour Minister on moving the Second Reading or Third Reading of Bills to nationalise industry after industry. Exactly the same words are to be found enshrined in the <i>Hansard</i> record of those occasions&#x2014;the need for public accountability and a more rational planning


mechanism, the need to encourage democracy in industry and so on. In reality, everyone who has taken an interest in the nationalised industrial sector of the British economy is all too well aware of the fine intentions that never work out in practice.<br/>
There is no doubt that the present problems of the nationalised industrial sector are among the most severe facing our managerial and industrial economy. We have not found a method of giving it the clear sense of purpose that is required. That is because the very generalities with which the statutes are built preclude managements from knowing those things that are expected of them. The removal of any of the constraints on free enterprise activity in commercial terms, or in financial disciplines, have meant inevitable recourse to the taxpayer on an ever-increasing scale. That has been the reality, and totally absent from it has been any progress or any sense of natural planning worthy of the name.<br/>
In industry after industry there has been a sense of drift, punctuated only by improvisation by various Governments who have usually been about to be overwhelmed by crises in the industries themselves. I accept that the price control impost of 1972 is an example of the political activity to which all Governments have been forced in one way or another, and it has undoubtedly been harmful to the nationalised industries. The conclusion that we should draw is that industry should be kept at arm's length from politicians so that such a situation is far harder to bring about.<br/>
I had not anticipated&#x2014;I doubt whether anyone else in the House had&#x2014;that the Secretary of State would seek to use Third Reading to make an announcement about the curtailment of staff associations. All of us who are involved in industry politically have spent much time speaking to representatives of trade unions and staff associations. There is no doubt that in the aerospace industry many thousands of workers&#x2014;in some cases the majority of employees in a company&#x2014;have decided voluntarily to join staff associations. They have done so as a matter of choice, and that choice has been exercised freely. Individual citizens have felt that staff associations can meet their legitimate aspirations

more effectively than a trade union in the conventional sense.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman has referred to staff associations and to people joining them freely. He has suggested that they are not dominated by employers. Will he explain why the rules of the British Aerospace Staff Association were drawn up by a Mr. Mitchell, who is the executive director of Hawker Siddeley? He was not only the first secretary but the first chairman. The association's head-quarters are situated at Hawker Siddeley, Kingston. Will the hon. Gentleman explain that?</p>

<p>The important matter is that there is legislation to govern the registration of staff associations. In fact, several associations have complied with the existing legislation, which is designed specifically to ensure that they are not dominated by management and that they are genuinely independent. Under that legislation, some associations have been able to satisfy those who question whether they are genuinely independent. Therefore, they have begun to establish for themselves a real presence in terms of being representative of the people in the industry. The result has been complaints by unions&#x2014;for example, the union of which the hon. Member for Nelson and Colne (Mr. Hoyle) is a member and, I assume, an active recruiter&#x2014;that the associations are rivalling the activities of the unions. Pressure has been brought to bear on the Government that the law should be changed to preclude the right to opt for staff associations.<br/>
That is what is happening. That is what the right hon. Gentleman has said tonight. That is capitulation of the worst sort to outside union pressure. We are not dealing with opposition to trade unionism, but it is unquestionable in the minds of my hon. Friends and myself that people should be allowed to choose the organisations that shall represent them. It is intolerable, when they opt for staff associations, that the power of the trade union establishment should be brought to bear on this weak Government to obilterate their legal rights to behave in that way. That is what the Secretary of State has done from that Dispatch Box tonight.<br/>
I should like to place on record the five reasons why my right hon. and hon. Friends and I will vote against the Bill tonight.<br/>
First, its very existence over the last three years has caused immeasurable harm to the two industries principally concerned. I have listened to the Secretary of State talk about the need to end uncertainty. It is curious why the ending of uncertainty should be entirely at his timing. The right hon. Gentleman was happy to create the uncertainty three years ago; to introduce the Bill in the last Session of Parliament and then not to proceed with it, but to allow the uncertainty to remain; to proceed with the Bill at a most leisurely pace; and, at the very end of this three-year process, to argue that there is a need to end uncertainty.<br/>
As the Labour Party has created the uncertainty, not only in these two industries but in industry after industry that it has added to its shopping list as soon as an industry comes off the top and passes into public ownership, I should have thought that "uncertainty" was hardly the word that the Secretary of State would want to use to describe his preoccupation.<br/>
The fact that uncertainty is damaging was proved beyond peradventure in the deal that was done with Marathon, because the precise need for that deal was to ensure that there was no uncertainty hanging over that company. The thing that characterised Marathon was that it was an overseas company which had the right not to come to this country. In orde to ensure that it did not exercise that right, the Labour Party in opposition, was prepared to do a deal to remove the uncertainty, in spirit, by turning this measure into a Hybrid Bill.<br/>
I believe that it is arguable and demonstrable that the uncertainty that was clear in the case of Marathon, and was therefore removed, existed with the other 43 companies, listed in the schedule, which have acted in the way that companies act when faced with uncertainty &#x2014;namely, to hold back on their decisions and to cut back on their investment programmes, to the incalculable harm of the companies and industries and the employees within them. I believe that that is what has happened and that it

is the total responsibility of the Labour Party.</p>

<p>I shall be coming to the hon. Member for Newton (Mr. Evans) at the end of my second point. I shall give way to him at that point, because he happens to be enshrined in my notes.<br/>
The second reason why I recommend my right hon. and hon. Friends to oppose the Bill is that it will impose a framework on the industries least suitable to cope with the genuine problems that exist.<br/>
There is no disagreement in this House that there are genuine problems facing both industries. They are problems of rationalisation of the structure, of work load, of redundancy and of how Britain is to be competitive in two internationally oriented industries. They are all genuine problems. I think that we should serve the country and this House a great deal better if we spent time discussing how do deal with those problems rather than whether the industries would be better served by moving into the hands of the State. Whenever an industry has moved into the hands of the State, any solution to the kind of problems that I have listed has been prejudiced.<br/>
There is a curious and sad relationship here to the fact that only a fortnight ago the Secretary of State for Industry told the House, once again, that he was delaying the investment programme for the steel industry. That was not for the first time, because only a few months ago the right hon. Gentleman announced a similar delay. The Labour Party, again in opposition, announced a total review because it was electorally convenient, and that had an obvious effect on the investment programme.<br/>
The consequence is that the British Steel Corporation is now sadly behind. It is nothing like competitive by international standards. When the economy turns up&#x2014;if it ever does under this Government&#x2014;we shall find that we are short of the steel that we require at the prices at which it can be bought internationally. That will be the fault of the Labour Party which created the uncertainty. It now intends to do it to two more industries. In the process of doing it, it is building up an expectation among the workers in those industries


that simply by moving from the private to the public sector there will be a sort of cosy option. [HON. MEMBERS: "No."] Oh, yes.<br/>
Let us now come to the hon. Member for Newton, who this afternoon was saying, not for the first time, that once we have public ownership we will be able to share the orders. He implied that there would be a greater spread of opportunity as though some divine oracle from Whitehall will allocate the international customers' orders regardless of whether they want to come. It will be a question of where the votes lie and where unemployment is heaviest. It will have nothing to do with where the yards are most efficient, where costs are lowest and productivity is greatest. The hon. Member for Newton and his Friends below the Gangway will say "It is my turn next. I do not care about the viability of those industries as long as I get work at any price, with taxpayers' support, in my constituency."</p>

<p>The hon. Member badly quoted me. If the day ever dawns when we build a ship in the Newton constituency it will be the most peculiar ship anyone has ever seen because Newton happens to be 25 miles from the sea. [An HON. MEMBER: "It will be a hybrid ship."] It certainly will be a hybrid ship.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman alleged that the Government's proposals were, in effect, holding back the forward plans of the industry. Can he give one firm example of where any plans, proposals or suggestions in the shipbuilding and ship repair industry have been held back since the Government introduced their original proposals? Will he also take on board that the major problem in the British shipbuilding and ship repair industry since the war has been an almost complete lack of investment in it?</p>

<p>I hope I am not misrepresenting the hon. Gentleman by suggesting that he was involved in the shipbuilding industry. I listened to him yesterday explaining that he worked for seven companies in two years, and I assumed that he also lived among the people with whom he worked. I did not realise that he left the areas of shipbuilding behind him in the course of those years.<br/>
I have no wish to run away from the hon. Gentleman's question, but how does

he honestly expect 43 companies, which are now trying to face up to getting from the Government a reasonable price for the assets which are being expropriated, to lay on the line the decision which they are or are not taking? If he cannot read from the precedent of Marathon&#x2014;which would not have invested a penny piece if it had not been exempted from nationalisation&#x2014;the effect that it might have had on the rest of the industries, he has not begun to understand.<br/>
Why was it that the former Prime Minister constantly said that there must be a clear divide between the public and private sectors? Was it not because he wanted to ensure that the private sector could invest with confidence? That was what it was all about. I realise that Labour Members do not believe in the argument about encouraging success. I realise that that is the fundamental dilemma which divides the Labour Party. Do not Labour Members understand that this will lead to a totally Marxist-dominated State in which every decision is taken by the State and every resource is allocated by the State, so that we get investment where the politicians want it? The only alternative that the Government can pursue is profits and a return on investment. That is the only alternative within which a private sector economy can work.<br/>
The Secretary of State for Industry told us that what he is actually after is to get a single rationalised organisation within the aerospace industry as though this is something new. I have told him, and it is publicly known, that in 1973 agreement in principle had already been reached by the two major airframe manufacturers in this country to bring about precisely the rationalisation which today the right hon. Gentleman says he is still after. It was a voluntary agreement at no cost at all to the taxpayer, because they were prepared to discuss how the companies could be restructured within the private sector. What has happened, therefore, is that because it did not suit the dogma of the Labour Party the rationalisation has been delayed for three years. Secondly, it is being achieved at a cost of hundreds of millions of pounds in taxpayers money to do what could have been done two or three years ago on a voluntary basis.</p>

<p>I am Chairman of the Regional Policy and Transport Committee of the European Assembly. We have just had a document placed before us, produced by the EEC Commission, on a proposal for the aeronautical sector of the Community. Will the hon. Gentleman read that document, which makes clear that the aeronautical industry in Europe has been an almost complete disaster since the end of the war? The Commission's proposal is that the whole industry within the nine member countries be taken over by the Commission. That is hardly a success story.</p>

<p>I am delighted to hear that on the Labour Benches there is a flicker of interest in the European movement. Curiously enough, in 1973 I not only succeeded in obtaining agreement in principle to the idea of rationalisation but started the first intergovernmental discussions on how we could achieve a European policy for the European aircraft industry. When the Labour Party came to power, it slammed the door on those discussions because they did not suit its referendum posture. There has been delay not only in rationalisation but in European terms while the Government have reluctantly come to the conclusion that an Organising Committee chosen from people outside the industry should take over the responsibility from people who have spent their life in the industry.<br/>
When we hear from Labour Members about the Europeanisation of the industry, I remind them that the Minister of State is now pleading with the French to allow Hawker Siddeley back into the Airbus project that the Labour Government cancelled in the late 1960s because the Airbus did not meet the European problems of the Labour movement at the time. There is now another total turnabout by the Government on the policy they created in the late 1960s. I welcome the new faith that the hon. Member for Newton shows in the European movement. It is a tragedy that it took Labour Members years to get round to it.<br/>
The third reason why we shall oppose the Bill is that it has been sold in both industries as a means of creating or preserving jobs. One understands the argument. The impression is given by Labour Members at constituency level

that once the taxpayer owns the industry there will be a fund of taxpayers' resources to maintain people in it, regardless of the industry's work flow. That is the impression given in the steel review. It is the impression that Labour Members give in every speech they make about the problem.<br/>
That creates a wholly illusory atmosphere about the real industrial dilemma which we face. We must find a way to sell products that people will buy at a price they will pay. The longer we go on suggesting that public ownership is a way to achieve that, the longer we shall be simply building up expectations which have never been fulfilled and which the Government now do not even have the money to fulfil.</p>

<p>Will the hon. Gentleman accept from me that aircraft workers in my constituency are not that stupid and are fully aware that they must make planes that people will buy if they are to keep their jobs? They are equally aware that under private enterprise they do not have a chance of continuing in employment as civil airframe workers, and that it is only with Government funding&#x2014;if and when they get it&#x2014;that they will have that chance.</p>

<p>As I negotiated with Hawker Siddeley the HS146, the first civil project to be negotiated in this country for 10 years, despite the fact that for most of that period a Labour Government were in power, I am not prepared to take that from the hon. Lady. Government procurement is involved in all the high-technology industries across the world. That will always be the case. The question we must ask ourselves is why, alone among the free world countries, we believe that industrial strength can be developed by public ownership, even where there is Government procurement behind it, which no other advanced country of our sort has chosen as a means of conducting its industrial economy.<br/>
That leads to the conclusion which constantly recurs in the debate&#x2014;and the only reason why one comes to that conclusion is that there is a group of people in the Labour Party who are interested only in political solutions. They are not interested in industrial solutions. Every


time they examine an industrial situation, they come up with the identical solution&#x2014;that the problems can be solved only by nationalisation. But in practice, as the people of this country understand more and more clearly, nationalisation has not only failed to solve those problems but has usually aggravated them.<br/>
My final reason for opposing the Bill is that we are spending &#x00A3;300 million to compensate shareholders to persuade them to leave an industry which the vast majority of them have no wish to leave. We are putting up public money to satisfy the appetite of the Labour Party for nationalisation. As a result, we are keeping interest rates in Britain higher than they are in competing economies and, therefore, we are destroying investment throughout the private sector and consequently destroying the very jobs that the Government claim to have so much at heart.<br/>
As long as public expenditure policies remain as they are, we shall have levels of unemployment that are too high. It is a hollow mockery for the Government to talk of a clear divide between the public and private sectors. By that they mean that one can have a resting point policy while we digest a little more of the private sector. The moment that we have digested those bits that are the subject of current legislation, we shall move on with hungry progress to take over other industries such as banks, insurance companies, pharmaceuticals, the construction industries and the various industries associated with agricultural machinery and equipment which have been listed by the Government for acquisition. There is no such thing as a clear divide. The only issue is how fast one moves down the appalling road which the Government have decided to take.<br/>
We shall vote against the Bill tonight and we shall continue to resist nationalisation with all our constitutional might. If the Bill reaches the statute book, hon. Members should have no doubt that when we come to power we shall return these industries to the private sector as fast as possible.</p>

<p>This measure was contained in the Labour Party manifestos of 1974 and it can therefore be said that the Government

are carrying through a policy that was a commitment to the electorate. In view of that, hon. Members on the Government side can only welcome the opportunities that are provided by the measure.<br/>
I attended about 50 sittings of the Committee on the Bill. As is their wont, Opposition Members represented their class interest as effectively as they could, Their role as representatives of big business has been to keep these industries in private hands for private profit. At no time have they been interested in the social aspects of public ownership. They have made references to the work force, but those references were invariably based on their usual approach to labour as a commodity that is bought, used and set on one side when no longer required at the will of the owners, or managers acting on behalf of the owners.<br/>
Because of that approach, Opposition Members found it impossible to accept the concept of industrial democracy. The Opposition do not wish to accept the concept that the right of management to manage should be challenged. The proposals for industrial democracy rightly challenge that concept. If the workers in an industry that is being taken into public ownership are to respond to a variety of challenges, their loyalty will be harnessed only if they become involved in the decision making in publicly-owned industry. Anything short of that means that we shall attempt to do what private enterprise has woefully failed to do over the years, namely, to call for loyalty and then to proceed to exploit those workers.<br/>
The hon. and learned Member for South Fylde (Mr. Gardner) referred yesterday to the talks he had had with shop stewards at Warton. When the Committee stage of this Bill began, I set up a series of meetings, with shop stewards at the BAC works at Warton, during which consultations took place over the amendments that were felt to be necessary to clarify industrial democracy and a host of other problems. On some occasions the shop stewards came to the House and meetings took place here; on other occasions we met the representatives on their home ground. At no time was any opposition to the Government's plans put forward by those shop stewards.<br/>
In those meetings the subject of job security was rightly raised on many


occasions. The question of involvement in decision making was also canvassed. Despite the efforts of the Opposition to delay the Bill's passage, the Government in the last few days have taken steps to ensure the industrial progress in this sphere that is required by workers.<br/>
I was appalled to hear the hon. Member for Henley (Mr. Heseltine) say that the compensation paid to the owners of the aircraft and shipbuilding industries was inadequate, in view of the sacrifices made by those owners.</p>

<p>I shall not give way to the hon. Gentleman. He was allowed to make his speech and I hope that I shall be allowed to make mine. It is on this question of compensation that I am being interrupted. In the Standing Committee and again on the Floor of the House today, the Minister of State gave us some extremely interesting figures about public money ploughed into the aircraft and shipbuilding industries in recent years.<br/>
Some of us believe that when public money has been given to companies in the sort of situation that has obtained in recent years, when the question of paying compensation arises the contribution already made from public funds should be taken into account. Unfortunately, the Government have not proceeded along that path, but I would not wish to suggest in any way that we should not vote for the Third Reading because of that.<br/>
Clearly, it is my intention&#x2014;and it is the desire of the aircraft workers in my constituency&#x2014;to support the Third Reading, and I do it wholeheartedly.<br/>
The problem of compensation has been raised in a perfectly bare-faced way by the Opposition, as if in some way the shareholders were being sold short, when in my view it is the public generally who have contributed to these industries and have been sold short.<br/>
I am glad that we have now reached the Third Reading of the Bill. I hope that in a very short time we shall be welcoming vesting day, in order that we may build two industries in the interests of the British people.</p>

<p>This is a sad night for a proud industry, the British aircraft industry. The Minister of State must know in his heart that it is, and so should the Minister who opened the debate.<br/>
Those hon. Members who speak about the benefits that will accrue to this industry are simply not in touch with what the industry is like on the shop floor, in design offices or in the laboratories. They do not know the contribution that the industry has made to the wealth of this country, or the contribution it has made to the defence of this country. We hear only about the handouts given to the industry, when without that industry we should not be properly defended or employed today. The wealth of this country would be less by &#x00A3;500 million each year in exports.<br/>
Tonight we have listened to the Minister saying that he is frightened of the designers and the laboratory technicians who have formed themselves into staff associations to protect their own jobs. This shows the way in which the Labour Government have become frightened of the people of this country. The Government ought to be ashamed of what they are trying to force through the House tonight by the guillotine. Fewer than one in five of the people in this country want more nationalisation. We shall have a steamroller going through the Lobbies in the cause of Socialism. I wish the Minister of State were present while I read out what he said at the second of the 58 sessions we had in Committee. He said he wanted it to go forth from the Standing Committee
<q>that we are nationalising these two industries in order to further Socialism in this country."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee D,</i> 16th December 1975; c. 98.]</q>
He said nothing about jobs or wealth, or the wellbeing of the people of this country; he spoke only about Socialism.<br/>
In 1904, on what George Bernard Shaw described as a wet Saturday afternoon in the football season, Clause 4 of the Labour Party constitution was devised&#x2014;the nationalisation of the means of production, distribution and exchange. Seventy-two years later we are still bogged down with the stupidity of


Socialism. It cannot move without nationalising. It does not care about people, let alone the workers in an industry that it is about to nationalise.<br/>
We have been told over and over again that nationalisation will save jobs. Labour Members know that nationalisation never saves jobs. The whole history of the nationalisation of coal, steel, the Post Office and the railways has been one of lost jobs.<br/>
The aircraft industry workers, if they do not know it already, ought to be told tonight that they will lose jobs. Whole factories will be closed. For two years the Government have done nothing to protect the interests of the aircraft industry. They have also failed to carry out their duty under the Civil Aviation Act 1949, under which it was the Minister's task to encourage measures for the development of civil aviation, and for the design, development and production of civil aircraft. That duty is abolished under this Bill. There is a limitation on the amount of money that the workers may expect to receive as help from a Government whom they are supposed to support. The Minister must know that the workers do not support the Government. I wish that the hon. Member for Preston, South (Mr. Thorne) were still in the Chamber. He knows the result of the shop floor ballot at Warton. The workers said that they did not want nationalisation.<br/>
Let us consider the question of industrial democracy. It is a load of twaddle, although that may be an unparliamentary word. "Industrial democracy" is a meaningless phrase. It takes away people's right to be heard. As a result of the setting up of a panoply of bureaucracy inside the proposed corporations, the workers will not be heard. They are never heard in any nationalised industry. Nor are the customers allowed to be heard. We do not believe that this nationalisation will be different, although the Minister of State told us when he introduced the Bill that this nationalisation would be different.<br/>
Under the Bill the sum of &#x00A3;250 million will be allowed for new projects. That sum is enough for one new project these days. The Minister did not have to wait two years to bring the Bill forward; he could have done the work that was required before.<br/>
The hon. Member for Welwyn and Hatfield (Mrs. Hayman) knows how much the workers on the shop floor at Hatfield need help. The Minister could have provided that help under the 1949 Act. What will happen? This Bill limits the amount of assistance that a Socialist Government will be able to give to the workers. What will be the result? Jobs will be lost. That will be the effect of this measure on the people who create enormous wealth. They do not wish to make vacuum cleaners, they want to work in the aircraft industry, where they know that their skills are wanted. The Government should lead this aircraft industry with vigour. We should be standing up against the French and the Germans. The Minister of State should not be obliged to go to France to talk about European or French projects.<br/>
This leads us to the question: which factories will close? Within two or three years the words "Brough", "Chadderton", "Woodford", "Hurn", "Weybridge" and "Fitton" will be heard in the House, when we discuss the question of those workers going to the wall. The guilty men of the Government will have driven them there, as a result of the failure of the Government in the past two years. The Minister of State may look round but he will not find many Government supporters present. It is amazing how many Government supporters failed to speak in Committee on behalf of the workers, or have failed to support the Minister tonight. One Government supporter never spoke in Committee. That is not the way in which to look after the interests of workers.<br/>
I ask the Minister and his cohort on the Front Bench why they do not have the guts to tell the truth. They have got this industry into trouble. They have told the workers that nationalisation will get them out of it. They know that that is not so. Why have the Government not got the guts to tell these chaps that they will be in the dole queues faster than they ever believed?<br/>
The hon. Member for Welwyn and Hatfield knows that there are 19 Tridents left on the Hatfield order book. The Hawker Siddeley 146 cannot be made at Hatfield, nor may the BAC X11 be made at Weybridge. When nationalisation takes place, the workers' jobs in factories will be weighed in the balance.


That is the way in which the Government will treat those who voted for them. We hear that the workers voted for the Government. It is scandalous that the workers should be used as the tools of Socialism.<br/>
I come to the question that seems to rile Socialist Members; it is the magic word "money". The compensation is poor. After 30 per cent. capital gains tax, &#x00A3;70 will be left from every &#x00A3;100 paid in compensation. There will be a further 30 per cent. reduction. The investors will receive &#x00A3;49 for every &#x00A3;100 paid in compensation. In today's money, that will be worth only &#x00A3;25 compared with the 1973&#x2013;74 valuation. Those who invested in those industries will receive &#x00A3;1 for every &#x00A3;4 they saved and invested. That may sound satisfactory to Socialist Members who do not care about people's savings. I am worried about where the money will come from with which to nationalise the industry.<br/>
We have never heard from the Minister&#x2014;because he dare not tell us&#x2014;how much this will cost. I doubt whether he is going to get the money. This is the worst and crudest cut of all. It has been estimated that &#x00A3;400 million will be needed to buy these industries, and the Minister knows that we shall need about the same amount of working capital to keep them going. About &#x00A3;800 million must be found.<br/>
Last week, Socialist Members trooped through the Lobbies to support cuts of &#x00A3;1.000 million in borrowed money in order that they should be able to afford the nationalisation of the British aerospace and shipbuilding industries. They made the choice; they decided that they wanted nationalisation in preference to schools, roads, hospitals and better pensions. That sword hangs over them, and the next election will find it dropping hard upon the heads of many hon. Members on the Government Benches who believe that Socialism will save their seats. It will not.<br/>
The whole story has been one of robbery with violence. We have had the robbery of people's savings and, I regret to say, as one who served his apprenticeship on the shop floor, the robbery of the livelihoods and futures of many good men and women with whom I was proud to work.</p>

<p>I hope that the hon. Member for Hastings (Mr. Warren) will forgive me if I do not follow his observations except to put him right on one point: we have not yet trooped through the Lobby&#x2014;for or against&#x2014;on the Government's economies. That comes on Monday.<br/>
I wish instead to concentrate on the speech of the hon. Member for Henley (Mr. Heseltine), who was his usual emotional and exaggerated self. His inability to control himself in the House is now well established. The hon. Gentleman tends, as did Hitler and as does the editor of <i>The Times,</i> to use the expression "Marxism" as a term of abuse. If he thinks that this is a Marxist Bill or Bolshevism run mad, he cannot be living in the real world. I am a democratic Socialist and I regard this measure as a necessary extra instalment of public ownership within the context of a mixed economy.<br/>
The Conservative Party has been converted to support of a mixed economy. In that case it means that when a Labour Government are in power the mixture will be thickened with a little more public ownership, which will be restrained when the Conservatives are in power. If the Conservatives truly believe in a mixed economy, its present objection to a Labour Government extending public ownership is going beyond the bounds of political reality. What do they expect?<br/>
I wish to refer to the aircraft industry. The nationalisation of this industry is almost inevitable. Vast sums of public money are needed to support advanced technologies. It is increasingly difficult to get the money from private sources. Other reasons for nationalisation include the dependence of the industry on State orders and the need for further structural rationalisation&#x2014;which is not denied by the Opposition. The engine side of the industry has already collapsed into nationalisation. Another reason, which I hope will not shock Opposition Members, is the superior strength and wishes of the trade union movement, as against the management side, in the industry. For a very long time the relative strength was the other way round.<br/>
Conservative Members must understand that the historical balance of power has shifted. They must take that into


account. At heart they know this. They understand that, in the end, this kind of legislation is inevitable. If a Conservative Government come to power in the near or distant future, I doubt whether they will denationalise the industry, despite what the hon. Member for Henley said. If they attempt it, they will not then have the support of the management in the industry. They had years in which they could have denationalised the other industries which had come into public ownership. They have had to accept that, once made, a change of this depth continues.<br/>
The hon. Member said that Labour Members had sold this legislation to the workers by promising jobs where there was no economic basis for them. That is not true. Together with my colleagues from Bristol, I often visit BAC and we discuss in a realistic way at all times the employment situation. Of course, the change of ownership in itself will not create jobs. The creation of jobs depends on market opportunities, on skilled management and on the support of the workers in improving efficiency.<br/>
Once this measure goes on to the statute book and the Organising Committee takes over, it will be necessary to climb down from the heights to the plain. As a superannuated revolutionary once said, "I discovered after the revolution that I still had to do the washing up". This is the case in the aircraft industry. It is not that we do not have a very good aircraft industry&#x2014;it is excellent&#x2014;but there are world-wide difficulties in finding markets which the workers well understand.<br/>
I was glad to hear my right hon. Friend refer to the importance of the MRCA. I hope that there will be no question, whatever may be said in some sections of my party, of cancelling that necessary project for the defence of the country. But, apart from the fairly busy military side, on the civil side there are not many good prospects at present of any new wholly British aeroplane, leaving the Concorde out of account. I believe that to be a fact. We may get a greater share in the Airbus, the joint European project. I hope that we shall, and that we shall press that very hard with the French and the Germans.<br/>
The employment situation in the aircraft industry is undoubtedly worrying to

all those who are concerned with its future. I say that without any criticism of the present management. At BAC, I know most of them very well. But the threat of nationalisation cannot be blamed for the present problems of the aircraft industry. Those difficulties have arisen under the present ownership. The hope is that the new people coming in&#x2014;what might be described as a new management wave&#x2014;will give a leadership that will be different and be better able to cope with difficulties.</p>

<p>No, I shall not give way to the hon. Gentleman. I am pressed for time, and I am coming to the end of my remarks in any event.<br/>
We have to change things for the better, not simply as a management and sales effort, important though that is, but as a joint effort by all those who work in the enterprise, on the basis of employee participation and full trade union opportunities. The hon. Member for Henley referred in a disparaging way in this connection to the TUC. Does he not understand that in this country TUC affiliation is the hallmark of genuine trade unionism? [HON. MEMBERS: "No."] It certainly is, and within the TUC, as my hon. Friends know, there are plenty of unions affiliated to the TUC which are available in the aircraft industry to organise management employees to the very highest level. There is no reason at all for managers at any level to go outside TUC-affiliated unions, and these are by definition all genuine unions.<br/>
This industry has had a very great past it has a good present and I believe that we can hope for an excellent future for it. I hope that the Organising Committee in dealing with rationalisation will make haste slowly, because a tremendous amount of damage can be done in the first few years through rationalisation being too swift. But I wish this industry well, as I know my constituents do. The House should give the Bill its Third Reading.</p>

<p>This Bill is very largely a measure of industrial archaeology for the


preservation of manufacturing monuments. If it eventually becomes law, after an initial and very painful period of slimming down&#x2014;an ordeal the Government have yet to face, if they are still the Government when the Bill is enacted &#x2014;these two great industries, to the country's great loss, will join Stonehenge, York Minster, Fountain Abbey and Barnsley Town Hall as sacred objects which must be shored up and patched up for ever, regardless of their inutility. This disaster is compounded by the extraordinary difficulty that the Government have found in obtaining curators for these potential monuments. After a tremendously long seach some very anomalous characters have been produced.<br/>
The origin of this unfortunate essay in expensive conservation, like so many national disasters, lies in the period of the last Conservative Administration, when the two industries made themselves enormously vulnerable. Not all the units, but many, in both industries, made themselves vulnerable to the perfectly understandable charge that millions of pounds of taxpayers' money should not be sunk in industries of this kind without a large measure of public control. If only the Conservative "gravy train" had not been so lengthy and well stocked, and had not trundled around all the aviation and shipbuilding areas in a desperate search for votes, those industries would not have been so vulnerable to the attack of the nationalisers.<br/>
The result will be that for years to come, unless some extraordinary freak result arises under present electoral system, or there is a change in it, capital will be locked up in these industries far in excess of what they should be using&#x2014;and, far more serious human lives, human skill, diligence and industry, will be locked up likewise. This is the great disaster of nationalisation&#x2014;that it concentrates national resources in the wrong places, ill-adapted to Britain's modern industrial r&#x00F4;le.<br/>
The Bill should not leave this place without some other minor comments. In the first place, it should have been in the form of at least two quite separate Bills. The troubles in Standing Committee and the extraordinarily tedious length of the proceedings were due almost entirely to the intolerable confusion caused by the

fact that we were leaping from an industry that is rather ancient in its modes and is situated in certain areas of the country to an industry that is highly technological and modern, concentrated in quite different areas of the country.<br/>
We in the Liberal Party believe that Bills to nationalise manufacturing industries should all be treated as hybrid Bills from the start, so that petitioners can be heard and the legislation can be considered properly.<br/>
The worst charge that we can level against the Bill is that it applies to manufacturing industries of great sophistication, which are largely dependent on export orders, the same old dreary type of nationalised structure used for public service industries that exploit the consumer with their monopoly powers. One cannot treat foreign customers with the same overriding contempt as that with which the Post Office and the Gas Board treat their customers when they want to make a profit in order to please their political masters.<br/>
There are many follies that currently contribute to our enormously swollen foreign borrowing requirements. This Bill is one of the greatest follies of all.</p>

<p>Many of us in the Scottish National Party have very severe doubts about whether the Bill will protect jobs. The OECD forecast is that the capacity for shipbuilding in Western industrial countries should be reduced by about 30 per cent., and the Government are entering tripartite talks in order to get a policy in which the shipbuilding industry will be slimmed down. Therefore, it is clear why we have doubts about this matter.<br/>
The Bill seeks to deal with the shipbuilding and aircraft industries in Scotland as well as in other parts of the United Kingdom. It would be very strange indeed if this House were to allow any of these vital industries to be taken over by other countries and taken outside the control of those who live in the United Kingdom, yet that is what the Government are proposing in relation to these industries in Scotland. In the Bill there is no form of Scottish control at all. At best we have the sop of decentralisation and the recognition that there


should be some Scottish interest in the organisation. It will be very difficult indeed for the Government to marry these decentralisation proposals of giving power to the yards with a Scottish structure in British Shipbuilders.<br/>
The overall effect of the Bill will be to establish British Shipbuilders with its headquarters organisation in Merseyside. The right hon. Member for Sunderland North (Mr. Willey) believes that the headquarters will be on Merseyside. I do not know whether that is true, but certainly they will not be in Scotland.<br/>
Once again we will have the removal of vital Scottish industries outside Scottish control. It makes a mockery of the Government's proposals for devolution. How can they have devolution in terms of a Scottish Assembly when they take political control outside the country? The Government have missed the opportunity to bring in any effective form of Scottish control.<br/>
What about the Government's policies for shipbuilding? I made it clear on Second Reading that the United Kingdom has had no real effective policy for shipbuilding for the last 15 years. Only last week the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that he would reduce the regional employment premium, and that will affect male jobs in the shipbuilding areas. He also intends to increase national insurance contributions. That, too, will have an effect on the shipbuilding areas, because most of the jobs in the companies are for men and this will be an extra burden which will have to be carried whether the Bill succeeds tonight or not.<br/>
Judging from what has been said by Sir Anthony Griffin and Mr. Graham Day, it seems that the individual units in the industry will be judged on their

merits. The development areas have benefited from the regional employment premium, and they in particular will lose. An additional load will have been placed on employment in these areas which did not exist before. The Bill is supposed to retain shipbuilding jobs, but the Government are placing additional difficulties on the cash flow of these industries.<br/>
I cannot see why the Secretary of State has allowed this to happen. He must go back to the Chancellor and explain that if this additional burden is to be placed on male jobs there will be a loss of employment for men. In the areas that I represent, as in Strathclyde, and in the North-East and the North-West of England, one of the prime needs is for more male jobs. The Government must make up their minds what they want to do.<br/>
We have the promise of rationalisation, but to Scottish hearts and Scottish minds rationalisation means redundancy. Already trade union shop stewards have been in touch with us in the SNP seeking our support to protect Scottish jobs, even under the nationalisation structure which the Government have in mind. They are also trying to get Labour Party support, but that is difficult to obtain when it comes to supporting jobs in the face of Government policy.<br/>
The Government have failed to take up their opportunity to provide for effective Scottish control. Once again they are proceeding with a nationalisation measure which will take opportunity and decision-making power away from Scotland. They will be placing the shipbuilding industry under the overall control of British Shipbuilders, which will be based on Merseyside, Teesside, Wear-side or some such place. That is unacceptable to the people of Scotland.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson) is mistaken if he thinks I believe that the headquarters of British Shipbuilders will be on Merseyside. I believe they will be on the North-East Coast.<br/>
We spent a long time in Standing Committee, but for once I think that it was time profitably spent. The Bill contains three entirely new features. It provides for industrial democracy, and that it not unimportant. Secondly, it provides for decentralisation. In the February 1974 General Election I told the men in the yards at Sunderland that we would have centralised bureaucratic nationalisation over my dead body, and I am obliged to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for affording me the opportunity to remain alive. The Bill contains decentralisation based upon something which I also argued in Standing Committee&#x2014;profit centres. That is another important change in our approach to nationalisation.<br/>
Thirdly, we have moved some way from the Morrisonian concept of nationalisation. We have brought in the concepts that we were discussing last night. The hon. Member for Dundee, East referred to unemployment and regional policy, and these are dealt with by the Bill. My right hon. Friend mentioned the certificate of independence. This is important to those who have made representations to me. Legislation on industrial democracy is expected. If agreement is reached before the Bill passes through all its stages in another place, I hope that provision will be made in it for these two industries.<br/>
Reference has been made to management under nationalisation. Sunderland Shipbuilders are nationalised. The yard was profitable, but Court Line got into difficulty and it was nationalised. There is the same management now as there was before. It is showing enterprise and fighting for orders.<br/>
The largest capital investment has been in Austin and Pickersgill&#x2014;&#x00A3;35 million. That investment was after the election of the Labour Government. The firm applied for help to the previous Conservative Government but it received aid from the Labour Government. All

this has been done under the shadow of nationalisation. It has made no difference. That was mixed investment. The money could be raised only if the Government put in &#x00A3;9&#x00BD; million. During the negotiations, Austin and Pickers-gill offered the Government 25 per cent. of its equity with no condition about nationalisation, but the Government provided the loan without taking 25 per cent. of the equity.<br/>
The returns have just come in and they show that, in terms of compensated tons, new orders taken in United Kingdom yards during the first six months of 1976 were three times as much as for the whole of 1975&#x2014;more than four times as much in terms of gross registered tons. That shows that the threat of nationalisation has not prejudiced the yards. It is untrue to say that the threat of nationalisation prevented orders being placed.<br/>
How does the shipbuilding industry fare? During the time we have been debating in Committee, the nationalised and private enterprise parts of the industry have been working hard and have had some return. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State remembered the days when British shipbuilding yards produced one-quarter of world output. I have spoken in the House at a time when British shipbuilding accounted for more than half of world output.<br/>
Japan is cutting back its projected capacity by 20 per cent. Everyone in the industry knows that the present degree of nationalisation means that the whole industry must be nationalised.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman has not read the Booz-Allen Report. I have read it and I have repeatedly referred to it. It was pointed out in that report&#x2014;this projection was made several years ago&#x2014;that next year one of our eight yards would be closed. That was realised by Austin and Pickersgill. If an industry is largely publicly controlled, that will very much affect the way in which it is treated. The private yard knows that in that situation it cannot survive, however profitable it may appear to be.<br/>
The shipbuilders I have spoken to are disturbed by the protracted discussions in the House. They are anxious to


have the matter settled in the interests of the industry. We should not be too doctrinaire. We must face realistically the difficulties that confront the industry&#x2014;for example, Sunderland Shipbuilders Ltd., Govan Shipbuilders Ltd., Harland and Wolff and Cammell Laird Shipbuilders Ltd. We must realise that the industry is facing the most intense competition that has existed since the war. It is necessary to have a national structure within which to deal with it, and that is what we are providing today.<br/>
I hope that the Bill will afford the industry the opportunity that it needs so that we need not talk about its being a national monument. The speech which included that phrase should be circulated to the Sunderland Liberal Party. It is interesting that there are Members in the House who talk about one of our basic industries being a national monument. It is a disgrace to say such things. There is a great ability in the industry. There are those within it who have fought very hard for it. There are workers within it who have worked hard and who are second to none in many skills. It is their livelihoods for which we are fighting. By agreeing to a Third Reading, we shall at any rate be giving them a chance.</p>

<p>There is little left to say at the end of the Bill's prolonged passage. I suppose the best thing that can be said is that at least and at last we know the worst&#x2014;namely, that these great industries are being taken into nationalisation. They are to be brought under one impersonal and remote form of management. They are to be brought within a system which has not worked for any other industry and which shows no signs of working for these industries.<br/>
To do the Secretary of State credit, I did not think that he had his heart in the words that he read when making his speech this evening. It was a load of nonsense that bore no relationship to the real facts.<br/>
What will face these industries? The shipbuilding and aircraft industries have in them successful and unsuccessful companies. The successful ones make millions of pounds for our exports and

balance of payments while the unsuccessful ones offer many people employment. They will not all be brought under the same heading. There is no prospect of seeing any improvement in management. It is a tragedy that the only thing that can possibly result for those who now work in these industries is a struggle to outwit the worst effects of nationalisation.<br/>
I shall mention one of the smallest companies that is to be nationalised, because it is in my constituency&#x2014;namely, Scottish Aviation Ltd. at Prestwick. It is a firm which, for the aviation industry, has a long history. For over 50 years it has been one of the pioneer companies in British aviation. It has had its good times and its bad times. It is worth remembering that the 10 years which ended in 1974 were the most successful years in the company's history. It is a small company that will form a very small part of a monster of a nationalised industry. It will take all the skill, devotion and courage of those who work: in it, manage it and represent it to ensure that it is not swallowed up and completely obliterated. I warn the Minister that I shall continue to fight hard for the company under nationalisation, regrettable though nationalisation may be. The company must continue and it must be protected.<br/>
The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson) has a nerve to come here and say what he did tonight, because some weeks ago the Scottish National Party had the opportunity to demonstrate positively that it was on the side of those who were against nationalising these industries. The SNP ran away from that opportunity in the most ignominious way. It was not by accident. It was because the Government realised that they would be in difficulty in that vote. What did they do? They brought in the frighteners, the heavy mob. Trade union representatives in Scotland went to see the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends&#x2014;they demanded to see them&#x2014;and they put the screws on. But they did not need to do very much. They simply needed an interview, and the hon. Gentleman went back to his parliamentary colleagues to railroad them into deserting the Opposition on that vital night.</p>

<p>On that vital night SNP Members gave the Government time to win the two by-elections that were pending. It is no use having the support of the SNP now. It will be welcome if it comes, but it is no longer of any use. The hon.

<p>I have been rather amused, because the hon.

In fact, as he knows, for the second time running a Conservative Member was absent from the vote. I am suspicious that, whenever it comes to a major vote in which the Government might be defeated, there is always a Conservative Member absent. Does the hon.

<p>It is no use the hon. Gentleman hiding behind a technicality. The fact is that he let down the people who were looking to the SNP to help to defeat the Bill. Therefore, the hon. Gentleman cannot get out of it that way.<br/>
The Bill will do nothing but harm to many people who work in highly successful industries. I wish that the Government would have the sense to recognise that fact and, even now, realise that the Bill can do nothing to help them.</p>

<p>I hope that the House will forgive me if I do not join in the argument between the official Tories and the tartan Tories. We had an interesting speech by the hon. Member for Henley (Mr. Heseltine), but it was a speech that we had heard at least 10 times before.

I suggest that it was as daft on its tenth rendering as on its first.<br/>
The Conservative Party, now joined by the Liberal Party, has adopted scare tactics to pretend that public ownership of the shipbuilding industry will lead to unemployment. However, the whole House knows that the opposite is the truth. If the Bill had not been introduced, there would have been widespread bankruptcies among shipbuilding companies with consequent widespread unemployment among workers in the industry.<br/>
When I first read the Bill, there were a number of matters about which I was not happy. However, it has been greatly improved both in Committee and on Report. All the credit must go to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Industry and his junior Ministers.<br/>
I particularly welcome the amendments dealing with industrial democracy and decentralisation. I am also pleased with the assurances that have been given by Government Front Bench spokesmen and the Organising Committee, which is doing a very good job, that the units inside British Shipbuilders will have a great deal of local autonomy and that not all the decisions will be referred to headquarters.<br/>
I should like to make one critical comment. I hope that the Organising Committee will be allowed to choose the site for its headquarters wherever it thinks best for commercial reasons and that the Government will not be bound by any rash statement made by former Ministers.<br/>
I welcome the fact that the warship-building section of the shipbuilding industry is to remain in the Bill. There was an attempt earlier to take it out. What an absurd situation we should have had if the warship section had been taken out of the Bill and had remained outside public ownership.<br/>
I am one of those who believe very much that the three specialist warship yards of Yarrow, Vickers and Vosper Thornycroft are getting orders from the Ministry of Defence because they are the most efficient warship construction yards. What would have been the position had they been left out of the Bill? I think


there would have been every temptation for the Ministry of Defence in future years to place its naval shipbuilding orders with the yards that are in public ownership rather than those outside it.</p>

<p>I am sure my hon. Friend is aware that when he and I accompany the Minister of State on a visit to Vosper Thornycroft tomorrow one of the main issues the Company will wish to discuss with the Minister is the urgent need to get a contract for a Type 42 frigate. Would my hon. Friend venture an opinion as to whether the firm's chances of obtaining such a contract, either now or in the future, would be improved or worsened if it remained outside the British Shipbuilders Corporation?</p>

<p>In my opinion, its chances will be very much improved by being inside British Shipbuilders. As my hon. Friend well knows, he and I have continually pressed the Ministry of Defence to place defence orders at Vosper Thornycroft because it is one of the there most efficient shipbuilding yards in the country. If the rest of the industry was nationalised and that company remained outside, there would be a very great danger indeed that it would suffer and there would be a loss of jobs in those three specialist yards. The men in Yarrow, the men in Vickers and those in Vosper Thornycroft know that very well.</p>

<p>I will not give way to the hon. Gentleman. There is a shortage of time and other hon. Members want to speak. The hon. Gentleman made a speech earlier.<br/>
Because of the decline in world shipbuilding orders, the British shipbuilding industry faces a difficult time in the next few years. No one pretends that the path will be easy. I believe, however, that the Bill provides the best chance of survival for the British shipbuilding industry. Let us have no further delay.<br/>
The tactics of the Opposition in delaying the Bill have created uncertainty and caused all sorts of trouble. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) should read a speech made by the chairman of the organisation that the hon. Gentleman represents in this House.

The chairman said that the worst thing we could possibly have was continuing uncertainty, and he said that we should reach a decision one way of the other. The quicker the Bill gets on to the statute book, the better it will be for the British shipbuilding industry.</p>

<p>The Bill is a tragic one. It is also a bad Bill. We Conservatives have been criticised during the debates, yesterday and before, for speaking too much about compensation, arbitration, safeguarding and so on. But more than half the clauses in the Bill are about these matters. More than half the clauses in the Bill are about the act of nationalisation. Very little of the Bill is about the future of these two industries, and that is what matters to the country and to those who work in them.<br/>
When we looked at the details of the Bill in Committee, we saw that the provisions for accounts and audits, in which I take a special interest because of my professional expertise, are very sketchy indeed. They are much more flimsy than those provided for private companies in the various Companies Acts over the years. Similarly, the provisions about industrial democracy are extremely vague and are only a little less vague as a result of the amendments which have been made on Report.<br/>
It has been said that private industry has failed to introduce industrial democracy. But what about the nationalised industries? They, too, have failed to introduce industrial democracy&#x2014;whatever that means&#x2014;in the way that Labour Members want. If hon. Members on the Government side have brilliant ideas about introducing great new schemes into nationalised industries, let them put them into practice in the existing nationalised industries first instead of taking new industries into public ownership in order to experiment on them.<br/>
I return to the main point, that the Bill is not about the future of the industries. In spite of the debates, we still do not know what the Government will do with them. We have been able to pick up a few scraps of information here and there. A little piece of the jigsaw puzzle began to be filled in on Monday by the Minister of State, when


our local paper reported him at Yeovilton as once again holding out the idea that nationalisation was good for jobs and saying:
<q>If we get more Concorde orders, then fine for Filton. If we don't, there is a possibility we will have to look at other projects when the industry is nationalised.</q>
He tries all the time to imply that jobs are safe only if&#x2014;or "when", as he puts it&#x2014;the industry is nationalised. It is grossly misleading to my constituents and others involved.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman added that he hoped more work would come to Filton from the building of the MRCA. I hope that it does, as a result of orders for the Tornado which this Government and the Governments of other countries are to place. But I also hope that the Members representing Preston are satisfied that work should be transferred from there to Filton, and that my neighbour, the hon. Member for Bristol, North-West (Mr. Thomas), is happy that even more of the jobs of his constituents and mine should depend on the defence budget. Many of them in Rolls-Royce in my constituency already depend on the MRCA, and they will depend on it in the future. Maybe more workers at Filton will depend on it.<br/>
We also picked up another piece of the jigsaw puzzle on the shipbuilding side, not from the Department of Industry but from the Secretary of State for Employment, who said in his constituency of Barrow-in-Furness that three yards were to have priority. One was the Vickers yard at Barrow. I do not know whether the hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Mitchell) has taken that on board. He obviously hopes that his is another of the yards. We have not been told which are the other two yards. We have been told nothing else about the future of these two industries, in spite of the long debates on this ghastly Bill.</p>

<p>As we come to what will be, one way or the other, the final stage of the Bill in this House, I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Henley (Mr. Heseltine) for his kind words, which I reciprocate. I commend him for his drive and energy in leading the opposition to the Bill. I also particularly

thank my hon. Friend the Member for Southgate (Mr. Berry) for the most energetic way in which he whipped us into order on a number of occasions, and I thank all my hon. Friends who supported us in the protracted consideration of this long Bill, which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Henley said, we have fought by every constitutional means open to us.<br/>
I wish that I could say that the Government had opposed us in the same spirit and in the same way. The Committee stage and further consideration of the Bill will go down in parliamentary history as the longest ever. I hope that it will never be surpassed in the deviousness and sordid behind-the-scenes manoeuvres that have marked the succeeding stages of the Bill. These have gone on so long that many hon. Members may have forgotten some of the events leading to the Government's saving the Bill only by a broken pair on one occasion. They have dealt behind the scenes with certain other parties, and those parties probably now bitterly regret this. They must now realise how they have been hoodwinked at every stage.<br/>
I agreed with the hon. Member for Colne Valley (Mr. Wainwright) when he said that the Government were largely to blame for many of the problems. By any standards, the provisions of this measure should have been contained in two Bills. Having only one Bill led to difficulties at Second Reading and in Committee when we had to dodge from one industry to another. Many of the problems would have been avoided if the Government had recognised at the start that the Bill was hybrid. It must grieve the Secretary of State that we would have progressed faster if more thought had been given at the beginning to the way in which the measure was tackled.<br/>
I approach Third Reading and the end of our opposition&#x2014;and we have fought as hard as we could&#x2014;not in a spirit of anger but with a deep sadness. I sincerely believe that it will not help British industry. If I believed that it would help British industrial performance, if I believed that employment would be more secure or that it would help exports, I would consider the measure seriously. British industry


faces many problems and handicaps, and I believe that Clause 4 is one of the albatrosses which Britain sadly has to carry, to its cost. It is a relic of a previous industrial policy which is totally discredited, which the Government do not have the courage finally to repudiate and which still has to make its turgid and damaging progress.<br/>
The Government's solution is the least suitable to the genuine problems that these industries face. They are supremely international companies. The aircraft and shipbuilding industries cannot hope to survive unless they can attract a substantial amount of overseas business. They are not domestic service industries. They do not have a monopoly in their markets. They will live or die by service, quality and competitiveness. In that situation, does anyone seriously believe that putting them under the bureaucracy of national State ownership will solve any of their problems?<br/>
Yesterday I spoke of decentralisation and I challenged the Government to explain what is likely to happen to the marketing functions of these industries. I asked whether they were likely to remain separate. I asked what would happen to wage negotiations and whether they would be negotiated in the individual companies or at national level. I asked what would happen to the purchasing functions and pricing policies.<br/>
Inevitably, centralisation will occur. The right hon. Member for Sunderland, North (Mr. Willey) has said "Centralisation over my dead body." A former leader of his party used the same expression about grammar schools, and we have seen what has happened to them. I would not sell a life insurance policy to the right hon. Gentleman because of the speed with which I expect centralisation to happen. The Scottish nationalists and others have been grievously misled over the idea that there will be a separate Scottish Shipbuilders Corporation. Centralisation will undoubtedly come to pass.<br/>
There are many pious hopes in this regard. Indeed, the hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Mitchell) said how splendid and how much improved the Bill was. But when the amendments are examined, it can be seen that they do not amount to a row of beans. All that the corporations have to say, within

the proper discharge of their functions, is "We are reporting to you within three months as required under the legislation, and we discover that we cannot decentralise this, that or the other function." In other words, the protection in the Bill will be destroyed at a stroke. So much for local determination. There will obviously be a move towards centralisation.<br/>
Furthermore, political considerations will come into play. It will be said "Where is the unemployment, where are the Labour marginal seats? Therefore, we consider that the orders will have to go to this or that yard". When a foreign customer is sent to a yard which he does not like and which falls down on the job, that will be the last time we see him.<br/>
It has been said by Labour Members "If the Bill does not go through, there will he unemployment in the yards ". Announcements have already been made in the House that 20,000 men will be affected by the present defence cuts. Indeed, it is estimated that in the next 10 years 11,000 of them, or more than half, will lose their jobs. So much for the protection of employment offered under nationalisation. Yet at the same time the Tribune Group advocates the cancellation of the MRCA Tornado. The Secretary of State for Defence has already made clear that such a step would mean the loss of 25,000 jobs in the industry and the virtual destruction of the British airframe industry.<br/>
Finally, there is the claim that these proposals will give protection to the industry and those who are employed in it.<br/>
While all this argument has been taking place, crucial time has been lost in terms of providing orders for shipyards. Equally, a great deal of time has been lost in negotiating with our European partners possible collaborative airspace projects. Perhaps if we had taken advantage of the two years that have been lost we would now have had a share of new projects. Now, however, those projects could be lost for ever.<br/>
On the horizon is the prospect that the Government will try to bring in similar proposals for the banks and the insurance companies. If the worst were to happen in that respect&#x2014;and my colleagues and I are determined to prevent that happening&#x2014;we might well face the situation in two years' time that we


are accused of delaying tactics that will damage the future of the banks and the insurance companies.<br/>
Against that background, and in the knowledge that the Bill will do nothing for these industries but damage and endanger employment, we shall oppose it with all our vigour.</p>

<p>Every vote cast against the Bill will be a vote in favour of the destruction of the civil airframe industry. Every vote cast against the Bill will be a vote in favour of the destruction of the merchant shipbuilding industry in this country.<br/>
The result of the lack of initiative of the aircraft industry under private ownership is that not a single new significant project has been launched by it during the whole of this decade. The only new project has been the SD330, launched by the nationalised Short Brothers in Northern Ireland, whose Unionist Members plan tonight to vote to deny the benefits of public ownership to the rest of the United Kingdom. [<i>Interruption.</i>] The Government have more confidence in the aircraft industry than its private owners, and I have evidence of this for the House.</p>

<p>Earlier this year the Civil Aircraft Division of the British Aircraft Corporation requested an extension of the Government's underwriting of the BAC111 production line which was announced to Parliament in June 1975. This request was subsequently

supported by the Organising Committee for British Aerospace.<br/>
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has now agreed, subject to negotiation of satisfactory contractual arrangements, that the potential liability falling to the Government can be increased by a maximum of &#x00A3;3 million at July 1976 economic conditions. If these arrangements can be negotiated, this will mean that BAC will now be able to go ahead on the production of a further five BAC111 aircraft and this should be able to retain in its work force a considerable number of people at Hurn and Weybridge&#x2014;both, of course, in the area of Labour marginal seats&#x2014;who otherwise would have been forced to find other work.<br/>
In accordance with the underwriting agreement, profits from further sales will be applied towards reducing the liability incurred by the Government and actual payment by the Government would be made only if an overall loss remained when BAC111 production finally ceased. Under the agreement&#x2014;</p>

<p>To meet the Government's decision of December 1974 to keep open the possibility of launching that aircraft, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has agreed in principle to the company undertaking the proposed programme. The Di million required to fund this work will be the responsibility of British Aerospace on vesting day and will therefore be met from within the funds of the new corporation relevant to the Bill. The Organising Committee of British Aerospace has endorsed the Hawker Siddeley Aviation proposal. I am now writing to the company setting out the terms of the Government's approval, which will be reported to the House when the necessary contractural agreements are concluded.<br/>
If the arrangements go ahead, Hawker Siddeley Aviation will not have to announce a substantial number of redundancies which otherwise would have been necessary in the immediate future at Hatfield. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Welwyn and Hatfield (Mrs. Hayman) for her pressure on the Government for all this.</p>

<p>In that case I shall continue.<br/>
Perhaps I may deal with the background to this matter.<br/>
It has been raised with the Minister both in terms of my constituency and from time to time in the broader context of the rest of the country. I had considerable correspondence with the hon. Gentleman in 1974 and 1975, touching on matters such as the problem of safety for the road trike, arguments over design, and difficulties in obtaining spare parts and servicing.<br/>
Last Friday's announcement was the end of a campaign conducted by hon. Members on both sides of the House. Let me remind the Minister of correspondence we had at the time, in respect of Mrs. Jane Image, of Littlehampton. She was a classic example of someone who found difficulty with the trike. Over


many years she made her views known through the Disabled Drivers' Action Group and other bodies. A whole range of questions which I put to the Minister over a period were fed to me by Mr. Peter MacBryan, of the Disabled Drivers' Action Group.<br/>
The background to last Friday's announcement is important, therefore. The work undertaken by the all-party Disablement Group is important, because it is on that theme that I should like to put some questions to the Minister. I do so in no party sense, as I hope he will appreciate.<br/>
In view of the widespread criticism that had gone on about the trike, last Friday's announcement was received with some satisfaction, in certain parts of the House and the country. But, unfortunately, I could not be here last Friday. I was in my constituency, and on Saturday, in travelling around in my mobile advice centre, I received some of the first reactions to the announcement. They were very strong and they reflected the anguish of a number of my constituents and disabled drivers elsewhere in the country.<br/>
I sent the Minister three letters that are typical of the kind of reaction that has come up so far, and I should like to quote briefly from them. Other letters were sent to me after it was known that I had tonight's Adjournment debate, but I shall concentrate on those from my constituents, since they are typical of many that I have received since.<br/>
The first letter was sent to me, before last Friday's announcement, by Mr. John Sachs, of Bognor Regis. He raised the problem of a disabled driver who was the owner of a trike&#x2014;in this case in 1969&#x2013;70. This constituent gave up the trike because, as he says, he accepted the general view then put forward regarding doubts about the safety of the vehicle. Having given it up he found that when the disability allowance was subsequently made available and he applied for it in January this year, he was refused.<br/>
The question that arises from this case is: how does a constituent manage in that situation? That brings us back to the announcement last Friday, when the Secretary of State made clear that

<q>as for the eligibility of those beyond pension age, I have already mentioned that those who already have trikes and who will be allowed to continue with them after pension age must be allowed to continue with the alternative, which is mobility allowance, after pension age. Obviously this will produce pressure for the provision to be extended from those who do not have trikes but who have a mobility allowance that ends at pensionable age."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 23rd July 1976; Vol. 915, c. 2233.]</q>
The Secretary of State went on to say that he would resist that pressure. My constituent has not been granted an allowance, and he gave up the trike before reaching pensionable age.<br/>
The Government appear to deny the allowance precisely at the moment when it is most needed&#x2014;at a time when retirement age is reached and earnings decline. At the moment when a person is unable to take advantage of any Employment Service Agency payments and when his overall means are at the lowest pitch, the allowance would be most valuable. What hope does the Minister hold out for my constituent and others like him?<br/>
One of the best summaries of the problem is contained in a letter written by Baroness Sharp to <i>The Times</i> earlier this week. She recalled the long drawn-out debate that led to the announcement that the trike was to be phased out. I draw a veil over some of the arguments in that debate over many years. The background is not entirely happy, and it has not left people with overwhelming confidence in the role of the Department of Health and Social Security in this connection.<br/>
Baroness Sharp put my constituent's case in a nutshell. She welcomed the phasing out of the trike, and added that the decision to phase it out had been a relatively easy one; the much more difficult decision was what should replace it. That is the question to which I hope the Minister will address himself.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-07-29a.1028.1" hansard_membership_id="8954" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/32702" speakername="Mr. Marshall" colnum="1028" time="">
<p>I do not think that there is much point in going back to the debate


about phasing out the trike. That decision has been made. I should like to make my speech in my own way. I am drawing to the Minister's attention what Baroness Sharp&#x2014;whom we all respect&#x2014;said in <i>The Times.</i> She asked what should replace the trike. The Government's answer to that question is an allowance of &#x00A3;5 a week. Again, Baroness Sharp puts is fairly:
<q>The truth is that &#x00A3;5 a week is not a mobility grant at all &#x2026; It will help those who can afford cars to run them; it may help others to meet the cost of occasional transport. But it dens nothing to solve the problems of those in greatest need; those unable to buy a car but whose need for personal transport is compelling.</q>
That is a fair and valid point of view.<br/>
So far we have been unable to get any assurance on what would be an adequate amount. When we come to the letters from my constituents the relevance of the level of the allowance becomes all the more obvious. One constituent wrote to me as follows:
<q>As one of many thousands of paraplegics with similar problems I would ask you, please, to put it to the Minister that (1) the &#x00A3;5 a week would scarcely help me, since I could not board a bus even if I could reach one. My world will shrink to a radius of about one mile (if I can find a sturdy pusher). (2) I shall be forced to ask others to choose my purchases and library books, perform monetary transactions and arrange meetings for me, thus depriving me of every scrap of privacy, In fact, life in a goldfish bowl&#x0021;</q>
I have had a letter from another constituent and, again, the Minister has a copy. The lady says that she left school at 16 and did not have a job until last year. She continues:
<q>I now work part-time and also because I earn less than &#x00A3;7 per week get the invalidity benefit, how does the Social Services Minister think I am going to be able to buy a vehicle to get around in with an extra &#x00A3;5?</q>
She concludes:
<q>Disabled people want to be independent, not dependent.</q>
That is the spirit of the constituents who have approached me. I am sure that it is one that is echoed throughout the country. I appreciate that it is a difficult problem, and I am not in any way underestimating the Minister's difficulties, but the answer to Baroness Sharp's question appears to be that the Government have pinned their faith on the cash allowance. Therefore, we want to hear from the Minister rather more

than we have heard so far about what the allowance is likely to be.<br/>
At present we have the reference to &#x00A3;5. We know that the matter is to be reviewed again next year. We hear rumours that it might be increased to &#x00A3;7. However, the real thrust of the reaction that I get, which I suspect all hon. Members will get, is that the figures we are talking about are totally inadequate, because of the capital cost of covering some sort of replacement vehicle.<br/>
It is in that context that I have to strike a somewhat critical note. I believe, with all respect, that in the Secretary of State's statement last Friday there was an element of self-congratulation, which is rather hard to swallow in relation to the figures that have been announced. I must put that charge to the Secretary of State, but I exempt the Minister. He did not make the statement last week, and over the years I have not found him to adopt that line. I suggest that with the background that I have described there is no room for self-satisfaction.<br/>
I urge the Minister to give us some real assurance. I am sure that he is aware of the reaction and the worries that have been promptly expressed on all sides. In the two minutes that remain to me I ask him two specific questions. First, do the Government accept the need to make more cash available so that drivers can acquire a suitable successor to the trike? Do they accept the need to make cash available so that an alternative vehicle to the trike can be obtained, whether it be on hire purchase, by way of capital grant, or on any other basis? Secondly, what are the Government doing specifically to encourage the production of a successor?<br/>
It is obvious that &#x00A3;5 is not an adequate sum. We must face the fact that during the next 12 months there may be people who on safety grounds wish to give up the trike and use the present allowance. The worry about the recent announcement is that it seems actively to encourage people to hang on to the trike after their true safety, as it were, has already been undermined by the Department. It is possible to refer to a number of references made to that point last Friday&#x2014;namely, to carrying on with trikes until they are worn out, which involve about five years' use, and then considering the matter again. This is worrying.<br/>
There is little evidence that the Government are doing anything directly about the production of a possible successor vehicle. The whole tone of the Secretary of State's answers to questions last Friday suggested that there was no urgency. He said:
<q>we expect to be able to maintain the supply of trikes, for those who want to keep them, for at least five years and possibly a good deal longer.</q>
Subsequently, he said:
<q>When the time approaches we shall assess the extent of the need for specialised vehicles for the remaining vehicle scheme beneficiaries and see which alternative vehicles and electrically powered wheelchairs, are available on the home and world markets."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 23rd July 1976; Vol. 915, c. 2236&#x2013;7.]</q>
That surely suggests that it will be a long time before the Government feel that they are forced to take any action. Surely they should encourage the fastest possible breakthrough in terms of designs and replacements for the trike during this run down period. We cannot wait for five years and then expect a Government, of whatever political complexion, to consider the matter.<br/>
There should be scope for co-operation within the EEC. Some hon. Members with great experience of these matters have looked at work in other European countries, and there are examples of conversions that might be worth looking at.<br/>
These are some of the worries that have been expressed by my constituents. I accept the difficulties, but I ask the Minister to recognise that the points that I have put to him are mild compared with some of the criticism that has been thrown out. Indeed, he will be aware of the words of Mr. Reginald Ralph, of the Invalid Tricycle Action Group, and others. Compared with those arguments, I believe that I have put forward the mild but strong views of my constituents. I seek some further assurances from the hon. Gentleman tonight.</p>

<p>This is a rather unusual adjournment debate. The hon. Member for Arundel (Mr. Marshall) was good enough to let me know the day before yesterday that the matter he would raise was not the one that he originally noti-

fied as the subject of the debate. I understand his reasons for having raised this alternative subject instead of a matter concerning payment of the attendance allowance, as he originally intended.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman has raised a number of matters. I understand that I have 12 to 13 minutes in which to reply. As the hon. Gentleman said, this is an extremely complex and difficult subject. Indeed, I am sure that his hon. Friend the Member for Exeter (Mr. Hannam), whom the whole House respects as secretary of the all-party Disablement Group in the House, will agree with both the hon. Gentleman and me that there are few more complex subjects exercising the minds of right hon. and hon. Members at present. Naturally, I shall do my best to reply as fully as possible to the points that have been made.<br/>
I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving me this timely opportunity to explain our policy on phasing out the invalid tricycle and extending the mobility allowance scheme and to answer some of the ill-informed comments that have been made on the policy announced by my right hon. Friend on 23rd July.<br/>
First, I must make it clear that there is no question of immediate withdrawal of tricycles from existing users or of not dealing with applications for the vehicle which are already in hand. As my right hon. Friend said, existing users will be able to keep their tricycles and, for as long as replacements and spare parts are available, they will also be able to have them replaced when they wear out.<br/>
I have seen it suggested in the Press that replacement vehicles will cease to be available within a matter of months. We heard from the hon. Gentleman about the anxieties felt by some of his constituents. The suggestion that replacement vehicles will cease to be available within a matter of months is utterly without foundation.<br/>
My right hon. Friend explained to the House that we expect to be able to maintain the supply of tricycles to those who want to keep them or have them replaced, for at least five years and possibly for a good deal longer. We shall be building up a stockpile of spare parts expressly designed to enable us to keep


our residual fleet going for as long as practicable after production has ceased.<br/>
That does not mean I can guarantee that, in every single case where a tricycle wears out within the next five years, we shall automatically be able to provide a replacement vehicle. A small proportion of the tricycles on issue have been extensively adapted to suit individual disabled people's needs, and there is the possibility, even today, that we may be unable to provide suitable replacements when such tricycles wear out. Components used in an adaptation may have ceased to be available, or the tricycle may have been an early model and it may not be possible for the Model 70 to be similarly adapted, even though generally the Model 70 is more readily adaptable to a variety of needs than were its predecessors. In the vast majority of cases, however, I have no hesitation in saying that we expect to be able, for at least five years, to continue to provide and maintain tricycles for those who have had them and still want them.<br/>
There are two other points from the announcement made by my right hon. Friend on 23rd July which I should like to stress. The first concerns people who were not so severely disabled as to be eligible for a vehicle on medical grounds alone and who, under the old scheme, were provided with a tricycle only for so long as they needed it to get to and from work. It was one of the worst of the cruelties of the old scheme that their tricycles, or private car allowances, were liable to be withdrawn if they lost their jobs. Tricycles may not have been withdrawn immediately, but if the holder was unable to find another job in a reasonable time he had to surrender the tricycle, and he thus became deprived of all mobility help. That rule was, rightly, much criticised for causing hardship to people who had come to depend on their tricycles and for making it more difficult for them to continue to look for another job.<br/>
We are now making two changes affecting these former beneficiaries of the old scheme. First&#x2014;and this change takes effect immediately&#x2014;we shall now no longer withdraw their tricycles or private car allowances when they lose their jobs. I know that this will be most warmly welcomed by the many thousands of disabled people concerned.<br/>
Secondly, the legislation that my right hon. Friend has undertaken to introduce will provide a right to switch to mobility allowance when a tricycle, or private car allowance, is given up, or, for those who hold on to their tricycles for as long as they can, when the trike eventually wears out. Taken together, these changes amount to a substantial extension of reserved rights for disabled drivers.<br/>
My right hon. Friend also referred to the legislation that we shall be introducing to enable awards of mobility allowance to beneficiaries of the old scheme to continue in payment without age limit. Again, the legislation will enable tricycle holders over pension age, and those receiving private car allowances under the old scheme, to switch to a mobility allowance. This, too, is an important undertaking for disabled drivers, because about half of our 21,000 tricycle drivers are at present ineligible for mobility allowance, either by reason of age or because eligibility for a trike rested on the old and bitterly criticised employment criterion.<br/>
The old vehicle scheme had no age limit, and when it was superseded by the new mobility allowance scheme on 1st January 1976 the eligible disabled drivers were accorded reserved rights to continue, without age limit, to receive the benefits of the old scheme. We feel it is right, therefore, that they should now similarly enjoy, without age limit, the right to switch to a mobility allowance.<br/>
The policy statement of 23rd July is in close accord with the principles that led us, in 1974, to make the new mobility allowance the main mobility benefit for disabled people. The two principles were equity and flexibility&#x2014;equity in relating benefit to the degree of disability and not to the ability to drive, and flexibility in providing cash for people to use as they think best in helping to meet their mobility needs. We have been seeking to make the amount of the allowance as high as possible within the available resources and consistent with meeting the proper claims of other groups, including other groups of disabled people.<br/>
Although "cash not cars" has been our broad policy since 1974, the Government did not then see compelling reasons for withdrawing the tricycle and it was retained as an alternative to the main


benefit. But there is now a decisive new factor, to which my right hon. Friend referred on 23rd July. It is now clear that before long the limits of the present design of the tricycle will have been reached. Here we have had to recognise that the future type approval requirements, linked as they will be to international standards, will make it impossible for the tricycle to remain part of our policy in the longer term.<br/>
The Shadow spokesman on the social services made it plain in the House last Friday that he recognised that this was an extremely difficult area of policy, particularly at a time of public expenditure constraint. If my right hon. Friend appeared self-congratulatory I think the hon. Member for Arundel will agree that his right hon. Friend was by no means condemnatory of the statement that was made by the Secretary of State.</p>

<p>As we have already announced, we hope to improve not only the amount but the value of the mobility allowance.<br/>
By its reception of my right hon. Friend's statement on 23rd July, the House made plain its understanding of the basic principles of our policy. There were many sympathetic interventions from right hon. and hon. Members who have given deep study to the problems of disabled people. Of course, there are some anxieties and reservations about the way in which individual groups will be affected. I hope to comment later on a few of those, including two matters raised on 23rd July by the hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Boscawen). He was good enough to say that he thought we were doing the right thing in phasing out the trike, just as the hon. Gentleman said that he thought we were pursuing the correct policy objective in that regard. That view will be widely respected, coming as it did in the case of the hon. Member for Wells, from a member of the all-party Disablement Group who has had a strong commitment to helping disabled people over a long period.<br/>
I must deal with criticisms of the amount of the mobility allowance. I accept that the allowance is not in itself enough to buy and run a new car. Even at its current level, however, the allowance is an important contribution to the mobility costs of disabled people. Even a Minister responsible for the disabled is not free to ignore the intimidating pressures of the present economic crisis. As in every other field, there is a limit to the money available for all the improvements I have been seeking. We shall, as my right hon. Friend said, review the amount of the allowance next year. Our aim will be not only to restore but to improve its value.<br/>
Some commentators on our policy seem persuaded that we should devote far greater resources to some disabled people than others because they can drive and want to run vehicles of their own. In a letter to <i>The Times</i> on 28th July, Lady Sharp suggests that we should give cars on a means-tested basis to drivers who need them for work or to maintain a household. She does not propose any additional or special help for people who cannot drive but who incur especially heavy expenses in getting to work or maintaining a household.<br/>
I cannot accept that we should determine the value of benefits by reference to people's ability to drive, nor do I accept that means test, with all their implications, should apply to the main mobility benefit for disabled people. Means tests would have to be reviewed regularly, and although Lady Sharp does not spell out the implications, cars would have to be withdrawn from disabled people whose financial situation had improved. Moreover, with means testing, administrative costs would take up much too high a proportion of the total resources of money and staffing that the Government could devote to mobility benefits. In contradistinction to many Press reports, the employment factor&#x2014;</p>
