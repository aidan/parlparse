<p>I am aware that that and many other views are held about this subject, which is difficult and complicated. As the House is aware, my right hon.

<p>asked the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether, in reviewing the grants payable to students at Home Office training courses, his Department will regard these courses as entitling a student to a grant without parental means test, as is done for the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research or Ministry of Education state studentships.</p>

<p>Grants

<p>Will the right hon. Gentleman have another look at this? Is he not aware that many of the people engaged in these extremely important studies, which are essential to the welfare of children, and on probation work, are mostly over the age of 21?

As the parents cannot be compelled to maintain them in the legal sense, how does he expect those concerned to be able to carry on their studies if the income of their parents has to be taken into consideration in this way?</p>

<p>During 1963 traffic patrols escorting abnormal indivisible loads through the Metropolitan Police District covered 253,600 miles and the duty occupied 21,600 man-hours.

<p>Would not my hon. Friend agree that this is a waste of police manpower, which is short anyhow?

<p>Suggestions to this effect have been made from time to time, but the practice of the police is not to make any charge for their services on the public highway or any public place.

<p>It depends on the gravity of the case, but in a number of cases representations are made to the head of the mission concerned, and in the most serious cases it is sometimes thought right to request a waiver of the offender's immunity to enable a prosecution to proceed.</p>

<p>From 7th August, 1958, when the Litter Act, 1958, came into force, until the end of 1962, the last year for which statistics are available, 10,242 persons were prosecuted, of whom 938 were convicted.

<p>Is my hon. Friend satisfied that the Litter Act is doing what it was intended to do?

<p>I gave an incorrect figure in my Answer. I should have said that 9,938 people were convicted, which gives a slightly better picture, but I agree that there is a considerable amount of litter. This is something about which we are all worried. It is principally for the local authority to take proceedings under the Litter Act, though it is open to individuals to do so. The police cannot normally undertake the primary responsibility of enforcing the Act because of their many important commitments. The provisions of the Act are for my right hon.

<p>Yes, Sir. A local authority is required under the Children Act, 1948, to board out a child in its care unless this is not practicable or desirable, and there has been a steady increase


in the percentage boarded out in England and Wales from 37 per cent. in 1950 to 52 per cent. in 1963.

<p>I have accepted the arguments in paragraph 174 of the Report of the Departmental Committee on the Probation Service which recommended the merging of small probation areas in larger units. This policy is now being pursued throughout the country, and I have been unable, after very careful consideration, to find sufficient grounds for making an exception in the case of Merthyr Tydfil.</p>

<p>Is the Home Secretary aware that there is nothing dogmatic in the reference that he has made to the Morrison Committee? Has not he already complimented the splendid work of the probation service in Merthyr Tydfil? Is it not a fact that he has made no practical suggestions in respect of all the representations made to him as to how that service can be improved? Is not he aware that his action now is regarded literally as an offence against the excellent Merthyr Tydfil probation service?</p>

<p>No, Sir. It is in no sense a criticism. As I told the hon. Member, my decision in no way reflects upon the


value which I attach to the close interest which the Committee has taken in the work of the probation officers. But the Morrison Committee recommended that any probation office which could not sustain a staff of at least six probation officers and a principal probation officer should be merged with a larger administrative unit. Until recently the Merthyr Tydfil probation service had only two probation officers. Now it has only three.</p>

<p>I have asked the Glamorgan and Merthyr Tydfil probation committees to consult together and to advise me about representation on the committee for the new combined area. After combination, it will be the duty of the justices acting for the county borough of Merthyr Tydfil to provide a probation case committee.

probation officers such help and advice as they can.</p>

<p>On a point of order. May I raise with you again, Mr. Speaker, a question which I raised with you on Tuesday? I apologise to you and the House that I have to raise it again, but it concerns the increasing transfer of Questions addressed to the Prime Minister to some of his colleagues.<br/>
According to Erskine May, it is possible for Questions to be redirected, but the assumption in Erskine May is that there was some confusion in the assessment of departmental responsibility when the original Question was put down, and Erskine May could not have anticipated the new situation which has arisen in the last few years in which the Prime Minister is taking a groater direct interest in matters of policy and is taking personal responsibility on these subjects in speeches in the country.<br/>
It is my submission to you that the Prime Minister should be accountable to the House of Commons as well as being accountable to interviewers on television. As you will have seen, there is only one Question today on the Order Paper to the Prime Minister which has, in fact, stayed there and remained addressed to


him. Although the Table had accepted five or six further Questions, all those Questions have been transferred elsewhere.<br/>
Is it in order, in particular, for the Prime Minister to run away from his responsibilities in regard to our relations with Spain? I refer, in particular, to Question No. 69 on the Order Paper, addressed to the Secretary of State for Defence. This was originally put down to the Prime Minister, as it is clearly his responsibility to co-ordinate the actions of Ministers. How is it possible for the Secretary of State for Defence, unless he has been appointed Deputy Prime Minister, to co-ordinate the actions of the Foreign Secretary, the President of the Board of Trade and other Ministers in regard to our relations with Spain?<br/>
May I also refer you to the fact that a number of my hon. Friends, including my right hon. Friend the Member for Easington (Mr. Shinwell), my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Mr. Swingler) and my hon. Friend the Member for Wood Green (Mrs. Butler) put down responsible and serious Questions to the Prime Minister for answer today which have all been transferred? I believe that this matter is of some constitutional importance and it is of interest to back bench Members on both sides of the House. I ask you whether you would consider, without necessarily replying today, how the rights of back bench Members can be protected in this matter.</p>

<p>That is not the point of order. It is not a matter about which I can help the House and, for that reason, it is no good raising it with me. As the House knows, this is a matter of complaint very often, and that has resulted in a mass of precedents by my predecessors which all say, in effect, the same thing, which is what I had to say on Tuesday: I cannot accept any responsibility for the transfer of Questions, I have no power to prevent it and, therefore, it does not raise a point of order.<br/>
If hon. Members want authority for this statement they will find two good samples from my predecessors in column 1242 of 18th February, 1953 and column 869 of 27th July, 1953. I do not think that I will cite them to the House, because they are of a familiar type. It

is not a matter about which the Chair can help the House.</p>

<p>That might arise if objection were taken to the Question being in order in any circumstances. I follow the point which the right hon. Gentleman makes.

<p>May I direct your attention, Mr. Speaker, to the fact that we submit our Questions to the Clerk at the Table? On this occasion the Questions were addressed to the Prime Minister. Surely in those circumstances the Clerk at the Table is in a position to say whether the Questions are properly addressed to the Prime Minister, or should be addressed to some other Minister.<br/>
To take an example, if I submitted a Question to the Clerk which dealt with the subject of housing, he would immediately direct my attention to the fact that it should be submitted to the Minister of Housing and Local Government. If I submit a Question addressed to the Prime Minister, surely the Clerks are in a position to inform we whether it is properly addressed to the Minister responsible. Does the matter not, therefore, to some extent, come within your responsibility?</p>

<p>With great respect to the right hon. Gentleman, the practice of transfer is very well established and of long standing. No doubt if the Clerks seeking to help the right hon. Gentleman saw an obvious instance of the kind which he has been discussing, they might say, "Would it not be better to start this off with Minister X or Minister Y?". But transfer is effected on an intimation from the Departments which are acting for Ministers, and we could


not undertake responsibility for censoring them in any way. I am sorry, but it cannot be done.</p>

<p>May I correct an impression which my hon. Friend the Member for Wednesbury (Mr. Stone-house) may have inadvertently given? One of the Questions to which he referred is my Question No. 68, which was originally and properly put down to the Prime Minister two or three days ago. Yesterday, the Prime Minister transferred it to the Secretary of State for Defence, presumably on the ground that the leakage probably took place from that Department.<br/>
Yesterday I protested, and this morning I received a letter from the Prime Minister in which he has agreed to transfer the Question back to himself. With the agreement of the Table it will be transferred to next Tuesday, and the Prime Minister will answer it.<br/>
I do not know what lesson is to be drawn from this. It may be the lesson that if all hon. Members will forward a letter to the Prime Minister, making a special request, they may be able to get some of their Questions transferred back.</p>

<p>While accepting that you have no responsibility for the transferring of Questions, Mr. Speaker, the Table Office has a mechanical responsibility in connection with transfers&#x2014;mechanical in the sense that it must record the transfer from the Prime Minister to another Minister.

<p>On a point of order. This has to do with Questions and is not about the transferring of Questions. May I ask whether hon. Members have any protection from Ministers who are not answering Questions when, according to the Order Paper, they should be answering them? I ask you this because I have had two letters from Ministers.<br/>
The first concerns a Question which I put down to the Secretary of State for Education and Science. This letter I received at approximately six o'clock


last night, saying that he was very sorry not to have been able to answer my Question.<br/>
The second letter is from the Minister of Transport, to whose Ministry a Question which I had addressed to the Ministry of Agriculture had been transferred. He says that he is very sorry that although the Question has been transferred to him for answer next Monday he will not be able to answer until next Wednesday.<br/>
Have not hon. Members some sort of protection? Are they not entitled to expect an Answer according to the timetable of the Order Paper?</p>

I have already submitted Questions to the Table asking the Prime Minister if he will say how many Questions have been put down to him for Oral Answer during the last six months and how many of these have been subsequently transferred to other Ministers.<br/>
It would seem to me that that is quite clearly a Question which only the Prime Minister can answer. It may well be&#x2014;and I have not yet been out to the Table Office to see why the card has been sent to me&#x2014;that the Question only requires amendment, but if it means withdrawal of the Question, does not this raise a very substantial point which comes within your purview as protector of the ordinary back benchers of the House?</p>

<p>On a point of order. This is on another question. You will recall that yesterday I sought to ask a Private Notice Question of the Home Secretary with reference to his apology to the Court of Criminal Appeal on the de Courcy affair. Two things will be noted. The first is that today is probably the last time on which the Home Secretary will be answering Oral Questions in this Parliament. [An HON. MEMBER: "The last time ever."] The proceedings in the Court of Criminal Appeal were not made known until too late on Tuesday afternoon to put down a Question for today. While you did not give your reason why I was not allowed to ask the Private Notice Question, I assume that it was probably because my hon. Friend the Member for Barking (Mr. Driberg) had an allied Question, which is Question No. 56 on today's Order Paper.<br/>

<p>On a point of order. In view of what my hon.

<p>Further to this point of order. Could you give some advice and guidance to the House on this question? Repeatedly, when hon. Members on both sides of the House seek to table a Private Notice Question they are ruled out on the ground that there is a Question on the Order Paper.<br/>
It would be useful to the House to know whether such a rule is mandatory on you or discretionary. In this case the Home Secretary's responsibility is very clearly involved. He has then to go to a court outside and, in the most grovelling manner, apologise for his incompetence, and we are not able to put what would have been a normal Private Notice Question on such an issue because there is already a Question on the Order Paper to which, when it comes up, the Home Secretary does not even trouble to reply.<br/>
In those circumstances, could we be told whether you have any discretion to allow a Private Notice Question if there is a Question on the Order Paper and there is reason to think that the Minister concerned is not going to answer it?</p>

<p>I must say to avoid any confusion that it is not right, with respect, to assume the reasons for which a Private Notice Question was disallowed. That is a matter which we do not state. The rule about the other thing is stated on page 362 of the current edition of Erskine May in these terms:
<q>A question cannot be asked by private notice in order to anticipate a question of which notice has been given. The latter must first be withdrawn; withdrawal becomes effective on publication of an Order Paper no longer containing the question.</q>

<p>Since we have such a wealth of tremendously important legislation next week, will the Leader of the House ask the Prime Minister whether he will take the opportunity of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' conference to discuss with the Prime Minister of Canada whether it would possible to make new arrangements so that the time of this House is not taken up by legislating on British North American affairs, for example, having to give one of the most senior Commonwealth countries authority to establish contributory pensions? Could this matter be discussed with the Prime Minister of Canada while he is here?<br/>
Secondly, the right hon. and learned Gentleman will be aware that, on the last four Thursdays, we have raised with him the question of a statement from the Minister of Aviation about the VC 10s and, week after week, for four weeks running, we have been put off. Now that not only the Minister's intentions but Cabinet decisions, everything that the Minister has said in the Cabinet and out of the Cabinet, and everything else has leaked into almost every newspaper, when can the House of Commons be told what someone seems to be willing to impart to all the Press?</p>

<p>On the first question the right hon. Gentleman asks, I think that we were both present at the time when that matter was raised informally.

<p>I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.<br/>
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is disappointed that he cannot himself be here to introduce the Bill. The Second Reading, unfortunately, clashes with a commitment for him to be host at the opening of an international conference in Edinburgh; and, in this connection, I am sure that all hon. Members of Scottish constituencies are glad that the European Free Trade Association&#x2014;E.F.T.A.&#x2014;like other international bodies, has recognised the advantages of Edinburgh as a centre for international conferences.<br/>
This Bill is a modest Measure to provide powers to deal with what may increasingly become a problem in certain parts of Scotland. The problem arises from a development of spray irrigation as a technique in fanning. This method of irrigation is a valuable one which can substantially improve the quality and production of crops, but it can involve the use of large quantities of water and, unlike most other uses of river water, very little finds its way back to the stream.<br/>
While we are fortunate, in general, in Scotland in having abundant supplies of water, there are areas, particularly in the East of Scotland, where the use of spray irrigation could seriously affect the quantities of water left in rivers and streams. Such reduction of the normal flows can create problems, not only of water conservation but of pollution, since purification measures often entail the dilution to the safe proportions of effluents.<br/>
In passing, it might be helpful if I pointed out that the word "stream" is used frequently in the Bill, and that under the relevant definition this term covers any river or other watercourse.<br/>
While the Government favour the use of spray irrigation in appropriate circumstances, because of its benefits to agriculture, we recognise that some control and co-ordination is necessary in view of the recent increase in popularity of this method, and its possible


spread in the future. The Bill seeks to provide a sensible and flexible form of control to deal with the problems that may arise from the development of this form of irrigation. My right hon. Friend received a unanimous recommendation from the Scottish River Purification Advisory Committee to the effect that there should be powers to control the abstraction of water for spray irrigation in any area where this was shown to have been necessary. The Government have accepted this advice.<br/>
I would remind the House that the Advisory Committee was constituted in 1956 under the terms of the Rivers (Prevention of Pollution) (Scotland) Act, 1951, and the Committee quite properly carried out a review of the development of spray irrigation. The Committee covers a wide range of interests&#x2014;local authorities which have statutory duties for water and sewerage, agriculture, fisheries, industry and amenity. The Committee's good work in encouraging improvement of conditions in Scottish rivers is widely appreciated, especially by my right hon. Friend.<br/>
I have mentioned that there is a direct link between the abstraction of water and river purification. One important principle of purification is that all discharges of effluent into rivers and streams should be of such quality that the available volume of water will ensure their dilution and thus prevent pollution. The aim of the river purification boards, which operate under the 1951 Act, is to raise standards of sewage purification and effluent treatment. The boards have done much excellent work to this end, but the need for ample river flows for proper dilution of some effluents is still most important.<br/>
I want now to turn to the legal position of those who take water from rivers or streams for spray irrigation purposes. The position is that a riparian proprietor has a right at common law to take water for what are known as the primary uses, namely, drink for man and beast and water for ordinary domestic purposes. This has been the law for a long time, but it is open to doubt whether the abstraction of large quantities of water for spray irrigation is within the common law, and it would certainly be unwise to suppose that a farmer today is beyond reasonable challenge at law if he

is doing this. Fortunately, there are many Scottish rivers which have such an abundant flow of water, and such a relatively low amount of pollution, that the development of spray irrigation is unlikely to create any problems for other interests.<br/>
Certainly, there is no need at present to visualise control being exercised on a grand scale throughout Scotland. Indeed, the Bill does not impose such overall control. What it does is to make it possible for the question of control over a particular area to be examined carefully in the light of all the interests concerned. If it is found that control over that particular area is necessary, action can be taken accordingly.<br/>
I am glad to say that the principles of the Bill have been widely welcomed. They have been discussed with the National Farmers' Union and the Scottish Landowners' Federation, which have both accepted the need for this limited form of control where circumstances call for it. My right hon. Friend accepts the view of these bodies that when a control order is made for any area, as proposed in the Bill, the river purification board concerned should have added agricultural representation. He would be able to provide for this under the terms of the 1951 Act.</p>

<p>But does the Under-Secretary appreciate that the decision to strengthen the landowners' and farmers' interests on these purification boards under the 1951 Act&#x2014;not under this Bill at all&#x2014;when a control order has been made, will be very greatly resented, because a control order will be made very largely in the interests of the purity of the river, and the hon.

<p>I understand the point that there might be a danger of one interest receiving increasing weight on the board, but I can assure the hon. Gentleman that it is the intention that all the interests should have a voice in these matters; and that when a question like this which, as the hon. Gentleman says, particularly affects agriculture, adds to the duties of the board, it is open to the Secretary of State to add agricultural


members to the board. I have noted what the hon. Gentleman has said, but I can assure him that the Secretary of State intends to review all the interests, and that he certainly would not have decided on this if he had thought that it would throw out the balance of interest&#x2014;</p>

<p>Is the Under-Secretary sure that he has dealt with what my hon. Friend has said? When the purification boards were set up, there was a suggestion about putting interests on them. The "interests" were people in manufacture, coal mines, and other things in the area, and their interest was to slow up purification because it would involve them in expenditure; in other words, it is suspected that some boards would work more quickly if it were the public interest that was being looked after instead of the interests of many of those who are pouring stuff into the rivers.</p>

<p>I did understand what the hon. Member said and I have noted the point that his right hon. Friend has also made. I assure them that my right hon.

<p>I have an interest as I have something to do with angling interests being represented on the river purification boards. Is the Under-Secretary certain that there will be complete protection against the emission of effluent from a spray irrigation plant? The water will not always be clean. It is not always used for watering a plant. Chemicals might be used to control insect life and if a seepage occurred back to the stream or river, it could result in the loss of a great deal of money spent by anglers in stocking the river, and so on. There is danger in this. Will the hon. Gentleman consider strengthening the angling representation,

which, I believe, is only one member per board?</p>

<p>I know of the hon. Member's interest in angling. As he said, anglers' interests are represented on the boards. What the hon. Member has said brings out one of the main factors in the formulation of the Bill, and that is the balancing of the various interests. The whole concept of bringing in control of spray irrigation is to ensure that other interests are not adversely affected. The strength of effluents in a river, to which the hon. Member has referred, and the possibility of a large decrease in the quantity of water in a river are things that we are trying to guard against by the Bill. What the hon. Member has said about angling interests is an important factor and is certainly one of the factors behind the Bill.<br/>
Clause 1 of the Bill leaves with the river purification boards the initiative to apply for a control order, subject to the reserve power of the Secretary of State to require a board to apply. The Schedule to the Bill provides for the full processes of advertisement of the application for an order, notice of which is to be given to all bodies likely to be affected, and, if any objections are maintained, for public local inquiry. These requirements should provide safeguards for consideration of the interests involved. It will be observed that we have based the procedure in the Schedule upon the existing procedure under the Flood Prevention (Scotland) Act, 1961. This procedure has already been considered and approved by the House and, in practice, it has been satisfactory.<br/>
Clause 2 provides for licensing control once a control order has been made. In considering the size of the maximum fine of &#x00A3;50 for contravention of the licensing control, one should note also the provision in Clause 6 for revocation of licences if the holder is convicted of an offence under Clause 2.<br/>
Clauses 3 to 6 govern the administration of the licensing system with the object of holding a proper balance between the interests of all concerned. Under Clause 3, the aim is to enable farmers to make their spray irrigation plans in good time. They should know


where they will stand on licences well before the period in the year for which licences will apply when their operations will be started. At the same time, there is provision for the boards to publish brief particulars of all applications received and to maintain for inspection a register of applications and of licences granted. Those wishing to object to applications will be able to follow what is happening and to make their views known.<br/>
Clause 4 makes a reasonable provision for contingencies, such as changes in tenure of land or sudden illness, which can legitimately give rise to applications out with the normal autumn period. Clauses 5 and 6 leave room for necessary changes such as transfer of licences. If applications for upward variation of licences are made under Clause 6(2), the safeguards for other interested parties in Clause 3 will apply.<br/>
Clause 7 recognises that from time to time on; must expect exceptional conditions to arise concerning rainfall and river flows. It provides for regulation of licences on an equitable basis if there is exceptional shortage of water or, more happily, such abundant supplies that suspension or relaxation of restrictions is a proper course. Circumstances can be expected to vary widely in different areas and in particular cases. The Bill accordingly aims to give a proper discretion to the boards.<br/>
We are seeking in the Bill to make reasonable powers available for use as and when local circumstances make their exercisable desirable. I hope that the Bill will commend itself to the House.</p>

<p>The Under-Secretary of State, who so felicitously opened the debate on the Bill, was rather modest about it. This, after all, is the major Scottish legislation of the year. We must not underestimate its importance simply because it is not being introduced by a private Member. I hope that we will give it the importance and consideration that it merits.<br/>
What interests me is that when we started this Session in 1959&#x2013;60 we were faced with a shipping breakdown. We had no ships, so the Government introduced a Bill which virtually gave us nationalised ships. Here we are, ending

these five years of glorious Tory rule with a shortage of water. One of the things which, I notice, has been said more than once by the Government spokesman in another place was that we have an abundance of water in Scotland, and that is true. But we get tremendous shortages also, because the water is not in the right place and we have not so far taken steps to ensure that the water is conserved and will be there when it is needed.<br/>
When we look at the Bill and see all its terms&#x2014;licensing, permission, compulsions and controls&#x2014;it reeks with all those terms that send a shudder through the breasts of the dowagers and the matrons of the Primrose League when the Prime Minister warms to his theme of Socialist terror. In fact, the Bill is sound common-sense bearing in mind the circumstances which it is designed to meet.<br/>
At certain times of the year, in particular areas in Scotland, irrespective of the spread of spray irrigation, there is a shortage of water. In many of our burghs small and large, given about a fortnight's dry weather we are in difficulty. The result is that the Government have been trying hard, but belatedly, to get regional co-operation concerning water supplies. Local authorities are ascertaining the exact costs of providing water for all the various needs. Ayr County Council has recently committed itself to a scheme costing well over &#x00A3;1 million to provide water and to transport it across the country for one new industry which it is determined to attract.<br/>
We can, therefore, appreciate that in such circumstances, when water is taken out of a stream considerable difficulties might well be caused to other users of water. These users of water are strictly controlled in what they take out of, and what they put into, the stream. Those who have interests in fishing know that if the level of the water is reduced, and there is no reduction in the polluting substances put into the river by agriculture and industry, then the fishing interests will suffer. We know what pollution has done to fish in the past.<br/>
We know that the level of streams and rivers falls at a particular time of the year because of lack of rainfall&#x2014;and yet it is when there is no rainfall and when the level of the river is falling that the agriculturist wants to use his


expensive spray irrigation equipment. If he uses it, it may cause problems in the cleanliness and amenities of the river, and all the work of the river purification boards will go by the board.<br/>
At the moment, they have no power to do anything about it, because they have no rights in respect of the river. Yet the people who are taking water out of the river have no right to it, either. The farmer who is using organic irrigation through the main supply is paying for it. Farmers taking water out of the river or stream in respect of organic irrigation are covered by the Bill, but those taking water from the tap, from the main, are paying for it and they are excluded from the provisions. But they will be envious of the person who is exercising his privilege&#x2014;I do not know whether it is a privilege, but it is certainly not a right&#x2014;and is taking advantage of the present situation because no one so far has questioned his practice.<br/>
There is an increasing use of this form of irrigation, which may be applied not only to green crops, but to early potatoes, and it may leave the river in a desperate state.<br/>
As a result of this situation the Scottish River Purification Advisory Committee, which, I understand, had support from the river purification boards, came to the unanimous conclusion that something had to be done. People with varried interests, faced with the practical situation, came to the conclusion that something must be done, and the Government, despite all their postures outside the House about control, realised that this was the only way to do it.<br/>
Under the Bill, anyone who wants to abstract water from the stream for spray irrigation can do so only if he has a licence. I understand that he will need a licence if he is within an area in respect of which the river purification board has applied to the Secretary of State and has been authorised to proceed on the basis of making it a control area. The Secretary of State takes this so seriously that if the board does not do so and he thinks that something should be done about it he can force the board to make the application. That is my reading of the Bill.<br/>
We have progressive farmers who have spent a lot of money in some areas, par-

ticularly in the West and in the South-East, where farmers are doing well. But they are creating this difficulty, and we can see that it will be more troublesome as time goes on. What will be their position? They will have the equipment but no guarantee that they will be able to use it. Certainly, there is less likelihood that they will be able to use it at the time when they most need it and at the time for which they bought it.<br/>
This is one of the uncertainties. Once a man starts using spray irrigation, he must keep going until natural rainfall takes over. Let us not underestimate the difficulties of those who buy the equipment and who will be faced with the uncertainties which will come with licensing, for getting a licence may be a tricky business. There will still be a limited amount which can be taken from the stream if it is within a control area, but there is no guarantee that there is a limit to the number of people who will want licences.<br/>
I was terrified by the figures given in another place by a noble Lord who mentioned a river in the South-East where, he said, there were eight pumps capable of pumping 15,000 gallons an hour and there were likely to be 20 such pumps within the foreseeable future&#x2014;that is to say, 300,000 gallons an hour, free, coming out of a stream which is valuable from the point of view of others with interest in it, and a stream which, if this were allowed to continue, would be polluted, to the detriment probably of the health of man and of beast. It would also be an eyesore. The river purification board is to be given the job of sorting out those who will have a licence and those who will not and, even after they have a licence, when to limit the supply, when to increase it and when to suspend it altogether. These are considerable powers to give to a board which is not an elected Board.<br/>
Here I come to the point which the Minister made about the board. The definition of the board is laid down in Section 3 of the Rivers (Prevention of Pollution) (Scotland) Act, 1951. The local authorities&#x2014;county councils and large burghs&#x2014;appoint between three-fifths and two-thirds of the members. The remainder are appointed by the Secretary of State&#x2014;one-third, with the possibility of another one. Working it out arithmetically, a


reasonable size for a board will be 15, so that either nine or ten will be from the local authorities and six or five from the Secretary of State. This is the amount of leeway which is available.<br/>
The boards for each area are probably already appointed, and the five or six whom the Secretary of State can appoint and with whom he can man&#x0153;uvre are appointed already on conditions that he thought fit. They are appointed to deal with such interests as agriculture, fisheries, and industry.<br/>
What scope is there for manoeuvre, or do the Government intend to change the rules? It may mean another Clause in the Bill. It is not right for Ministers to make pledges unthinkingly and without considerable consultation. This House ought certainly to have been consulted. We are talking about rural areas. Many people already on the county councils are representing agricultural interests. Indeed, it may well be that most of the boards are already over-weighted with agricultural interests. In many circumstances the people representing agricultural or county council interests will have a difficult task. Is it likely that an agriculturist sitting on a board will adjudicate in respect of licences for which he himself may be a competing applicant? If so, this is wrong.<br/>
The Secretary of State ought to think again about the pledges that he has given. Would we ever dream of handing the administration of valuable licences to people who are themselves interested? This is what we are virtually doing. The Secretary of State is to ensure that the dominating interest will be agricultural. We would never put the apportionment of public house licences in the hands of publicans. Nevertheless, we are handing the right to abstract water to people who at the moment have no right to the water, and we are guaranteeing them against any legal action arising from what they do under the licence, and all we are charging them is &#x00A3;5 a year. It is a valuable licence, and these people should not be handing out such licences.<br/>
There is a way out. Under the original Act, any power exercised by a river purification board can be delegated to a county council. Have the Government thought whether that is possible in this case? Indeed, the Secretary of State

will find that a statutory water authority can ask to have certain powers delegated to it. There may be some requests about these powers.<br/>
This is not a simple Bill. It is tricky. It arises from our failure to ensure that the abundance of water that we have at a certain time is conserved for use when needed. The real way out of this is to have pond storage schemes for certain farmers or groups of farmers to ensure that water is available in time of shortage. The Bill is merely a makeshift made necessary by our failure to appreciate the importance of water. I do not think the Prime Minister appreciates the importance of water, unless it is in his whisky when he is campaigning in Kinross.</p>

<p>It was not the good peaty water of Perth that the Prime Minister was drinking, according to a recent photograph. He bought his constituents beer, but he was drinking whisky.<br/>
It must be realised that in many respects this Bill is tied to the original Act, which I do not think has been properly appreciated. Take the penalties. The immediate purpose is to prevent pollution. The Bill prevents pollution just as it prevents industry or agriculture depositing in the water something which would be deleterious to it. But the standards of penalties are entirely different. The original provisions were unbalanced and favoured industry and agriculture.<br/>
The penalty under the Bill is the simple one of &#x00A3;50 for abtracting water without a licence, which can do tremendous damage, but the penalty for positive pollution is &#x00A3;200 on indictment and if the pollution persists, six months' imprisonment and a fine of &#x00A3;500. We might well look at this for the sake of fairness. The penalties for obstructing the river purification board in the exercise of its functions might well be higher than those for abstracting water wrongly.<br/>
I hope that the Government have noted the difficulties and will be prepared to do something about them in Committee. We have already been told when the Committee stage will be, and I take strong exception to the fact that a matter of this importance should be dealt with on a Friday and at such short notice. Most hon. Members have already fixed other engagements.<br/>
Have the Government thought any more about the &#x00A3;5 annual licence fee? It is a valuable right. In some circumstances it may be regarded as a derisory fee. Perhaps we should look at it with the idea of making the whole exercise more self-sufficient financially. I find it difficult to see why local authorities should have to bear the burden of the expense, for they get little out of it. Yet the local authorities, with some help through the equalisation grant, will pay for it.<br/>
This ought to be paid for by the people who will benefit from the scheme. It is wrong that rates or taxes should be increased to deal with a problem which arises from people taking advantage of doubts or local good nature and abstracting water which is of very considerable value to them and their crops. Now they are to be given absolute immunity from legal action for &#x00A3;5 a year. This may well be an aspect we should closely examine.<br/>
Nor am I entirely happy about Clause 7. Like other Clauses, it could do with amendment. The Government plan to give boards within the control area the right to vary the conditions and eventually, if necessary, to suspend licences altogether. But one of the dangers is that the legal immunity is given in respect of the licence. What happens to that immunity if a licence is suspended? As time passes, more and more people will be refused licences and there will then be more likelihood of the legal rights being challenged. I wonder whether our lawyers have looked at this from that point of view. No doubt we shall hear from them in due course about it.<br/>
The Bill will create difficulties for quite a number of people, including the river purification boards, which are not over-endowed with administrative staff for the work that they are to carry out.

This is not just a matter of adjudicating licences, but of the whole rigmarole of receiving applications by 15th September, the administrative work which must be done by 15th October and the decisions which must be taken by 15th November to be in time for the following year. Have the Government considered whether sufficient staff is available to deal with all this work?<br/>
It is unfortunate that, despite the Act with which my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton (Mr. T. Fraser) was associated, the Government have been able to achieve very little in relation to the control and purification of our rivers because of the expense involved in the installation of purification plant. Perhaps we would not now be required to be so harsh about spray irrigation licensing had there been better measurement and standards of purification of effluent. The Government have failed by not taking more positive steps and now we must fall back on negative action to ensure that there is not extraction of water to such an extent that it reduces the flow and, therefore, the dilution of these deleterious effluents.<br/>
Finally, I put three points to the Government. First, will they look at the whole question of Scotland's water? Surely by this time they have some plans not just for a survey&#x2014;we should be beyond that stage&#x2014;but for action to provide a proper and adequate water supply readily available wherever wanted for agriculture, industry, or the domestic user.<br/>
Secondly, we want an assurance that the Government are pressing on with steps for positive purification. It may well be that many industries are too ready to ride off on the excuse of expense, but, nevertheless, especially in the light of our hopes for tourism, for the greater purity of our rivers and for fishing, we should press on with purification.<br/>
Thirdly, we must ensure that, wherever possible, there will be strengthening of the river purification boards and in the right way so that there can be no suspicion of there being handed out to friends what will virtually be scarce and valuable licences for spray irrigation.<br/>
I regret that, once again, the Government have allowed events to overtake


them and that what is now available to industry and agriculture for the support of our crops after a time when our farmers had to stand by and watch them the is to be denied to Scottish farmers because we have not yet taken action to ensure that the water will be there.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Kilmarnock (Mr. Ross) made slightly heavy weather of the Bill. Had it applied to England I should perhaps have agreed more with him. I had to follow in considerable detail the passing through the House of the Water Resources Act which concerned England and Wales, and I then learnt the great importance of using England's water resources to the best advantage.<br/>
But, because of the geography, the problem in Scotland is quite different. Any angler will know that almost every river starts in a hill and comes bubbling down over the stones and that it is only in the lower regions of a few of the hills that the problem of spray irrigation can arise at all. I doubt whether parts of more than half a dozen rivers will be affected by the Bill, so I think that the hon. Gentleman, in the metaphysical disquisition he made on the details, was making rather heavy weather of a rather minor piece of legislation.</p>

<p>I agree that it is important to those who may be affected.<br/>
As my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State mentioned pollution, I would like to refer to it, in particular, to pollution by detergents. The Sixth Progress Report of the Standing Technical Committee on Synthetic Detergents stated that about 51,000 tons of detergent a year is used in the United Kingdom and that this is likely to increase. This large amount of detergent has to be passed through the drains and eventually into the rivers. Paragraph 34 of the Report said:
<q>Complaints of problems resulting from the production of foam in rivers and sewage works continued to be received.</q>
If we are to abstract, or to allow farmers and others to abstract, water from our rivers then it is very important that the problem of foam from deter-

gents should be kept in mind before any licence is granted.<br/>
Clause 3 uses the word "contiguous" and I am not sure what it means. It says:
<q>A person may apply for a licence to abstract water for the purpose of spray irrigation from a stream specified in his application where he is the occupier of land contiguous to that stream. &#x2026;</q>
That does not mean the owner and may be, I presume, a tenant farmer, for the reference is to the occupier of the land.<br/>
Here is a problem which does not arise in England, but which can arise in Scotland where there are special and separate hereditaments for fishing. When someone buys fishing rights in Scotland, he also buys part of the bank to give him access to the fishing. If a man who is farming alongside a stream, which is in the ownership of a different person for fishing rights, wants to abstract the water, is he entitled to abstract over the bank which is owned by someone else? What does "contiguous" mean in this context?<br/>
If we are to encourage farmers to abstract water for the improvement of their farms, the Bill ought to provide that, notwithstanding any ownership of the fishing rights in the river and notwithstanding any small gap between the actual water and the field lying next to the river, the farmer should have the right to abstract the water over the bank. I hope that my hon. Friend will make this clearer in Committee&#x2014;</p>

<p>&#x2014;but I hope that it will not be on Friday. It is a matter of some importance.<br/>
The Bill deals only with streams, but streams are not the only source of water. There are many wells and boreholes and, whatever the Scottish Office may know, I do not think that we know how much underground water there is in Scotland. I know of one man who sank a borehole and got an almost inexhaustible supply of water from a bore about 200 ft. down. I do not think that the flatter areas of Scotland have, ever been subjected to a dowser, but if we are to deal with this matter properly and as a whole it is advisable to


extend the Bill's operation to boreholes and wells as well.<br/>
If too much water is taken out of a river or stream, the water table may be lowered all round. Similarly, if there is a borehole used for spray irrigation in a big way, that may lower the water table all round. This would dry up all the wells, whether the water was used for human consumption, cattle drinking, sheep, or anything else, and it might have a serious effect on the neighbourhood all round.<br/>
I hope that my hon. Friend will consider extending the operations of the Bill beyond streams. I do not know what the word "localities" means in this context, but if it includes areas from which water is abstracted for spray irrigation, whether underground or from surface streams, that would complete the picture and make the Bill more efficient.<br/>
In an intervention, the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel) mentioned angling. I have already mentioned the dangers of pollution from foam. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that the most likely time for the use of spray irrigation machines is during the growing periods of the crops, that is to say, May, June and July, for instance, which may be the driest period of the year.</p>

<p>I agree, but I am dealing with large masses of water used in spraying potatoes, for instance. The problem of horticulture is a separate problem.<br/>
We should carefully take into account not only the provision of water, but the effect of spray irrigation on angling. Pollution of a river may kill the whole crop of trout or salmon for the whole of that year and do immeasurable damage to the angling interests of Scotland, which means not only the angling interests, but the tourist interests, because we have to bear in mind that the Scottish rivers are potentially an extremely valuable tourist attraction, and that the more we can encourage better fishing the better it will be for the tourist trade.<br/>
The hon. Member for Kilmarnock mentioned balance on the boards. I am rather sorry that the Government have gone so far to increase the representation of the farmers on the boards. It may be&#x2014;I do not say that it is&#x2014;that in some rural areas the existing boards are too weighted with representatives of the farmers. Up to now, the duties of the boards have been anti-pollution. One of the biggest headaches of a pollution board in a rural area is the pollution from farming, particularly from silage pits. So far, the balance on the boards has been such that the farmers have been prosecuted and told that they must drain their silage pits properly and not into burns or streams.<br/>
However, if the boards are overweighted with agricultural representatives, not only may that have an effect on the proper drainage of silage effluent, but it may also affect the licensing of the distribution of the water. Therefore, whatever pledge may have been given to whomever, I hope that steps will be taken to keep the balance, either with the reduction of time, or through the appointment by the Secretary of State of people not interested in agriculture if he believes that the existing boards are too heavily weighted with county council and other local authority representatives.<br/>
This is a good Bill, although it is not extremely important. I hope that my suggestions will go some way towards improving it by making it more complete and that this question of what is contiguous will be dealt with today, because it is more than a Committee point. It would be a great pity if a tenant farmer, or even an owner-occupier, who did not own the rights to the river were unable to use the water for the irrigation of his crops.<br/>
The hon. Member for Kilmarnock said that spray irrigation was for the improvement of agriculture. It undoubtedly is in some respects, but we should beware of trying to improve potatoes through irrigation.</p>

<p>I know that many people do and they may get extra tonnage, but if the hon. Gentleman reads last month's "Scottish Agriculture" he will find that many people doubt whether the keeping or tasting qualities of the


potatoes are as good. If potatoes have to be kept through the winter and then sold in highly competitive markets against the new varieties which are coming along, it is not necessary in the interests of agriculture to have large crops of potatoes which will not keep.<br/>
The Bill can affect only a few parts of rivers when they come down to the alluvial part of the valley before entering the sea, but, with the suggestions that I have made, I think that we can make if a better Bill.</p>

<p>I agree with much of what was said by the hon. Member for South Angus (Sir J. Duncan), but I have a higher regard for the Bill than he has. The hon. Gentleman said that it was a good Bill, but not a very important one. I think that it will be of considerable importance in some areas.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman said that many rivers would not be affected, and I agree with him about that, but many streams could be affected. As horticulture as well as farming come within the scope of spray irrigation, I think the hon. Gentleman will agree that in some areas the abstraction of water from streams could be a matter of major importance.<br/>
The Bill is entitled "Spray Irrigation (Scotland) Bill". Is it intended to cover merely irrigation? Is there to be a safeguard that nothing will be added to the water which is extracted for the purposes of spray irrigation? Will it be possible to add insecticides to control pests? If it will not be permissible to do that, I should like that written into the Bill. I agree that it will be extremely difficult to prevent people from adding chemicals to water abstracted for spray irrigation, but I think that something ought to be done to try to ensure that this cannot happen.<br/>
It is obvious that the Government have in mind the possibility of pollution, because one sees in the Bill a reference to the Rivers (Prevention of Pollution) (Scotland) Act, 1951, and the fact that the river purification boards are to have additional members. The hon. Member for South Angus probably has some idea of what the farmers think of this aspect of the Bill. Farmers do

funny things, and they do not always tell everybody what they do. They sometimes use methods which are frowned on, and possible the hon. Gentleman could assist us on this matter. I am thinking about the angling interests when I say that we should not allow the addition of insecticides and so on to water withdrawn for spraying operations.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Kilmarnock (Mr. Ross) was right when he said that the abstraction of water for spray irrigation was an important matter during periods of drought. We must ensure that during such periods no abstraction at all takes place. At the moment we are abstracting from many rivers and streams the maximum possible amount to provide adequate supplies of water for housing and industry. We must make certain that during periods of drought there is the strictest possible control to ensure that the water does not drop below a certain level.<br/>
I wish that the Bill had been brought forward at an earlier stage. It is ridiculous that a Measure of this importance has been brought forward in the last weeks of this Parliament. We are told that the Committee stage of the Bill is to be next Friday. Most hon. Members have engagements far in advance of a week, and this method of getting the Bill through is a negation of democracy. It is not good enough to allow us so short a time in which to put forward considered Amendments.<br/>
I should like to write into the Bill a provision that if farmers want to abstract water under licence&#x2014;and we must realise that this licence is to cost only &#x00A3;5 a year&#x2014;they must construct on their land a holding tank of a capacity to be decided by the Board. Water could then be abstracted when the river or stream was in spate, and stored for use during a period of drought, instead of being drawn off then, with the danger of the water level falling dangerously low. This provision would help the angling interests in Scotland, because already they suffer from the fact that far too much water is abstracted from our rivers and streams.<br/>
There is no worse sight than seeing a river drying up during a long drought. When it does, one gets a horrible smell from what should be a clean, clear, stretch of water. Fish die, and plant life is killed. If we claim that we are keen


to promote tourism, we should take every possible step to ensure that we keep our streams, rivers, and lochs as clean and as full as possible. I suggest to the Joint Under-Secretary that one way in which we could do that would be to lay down in the Bill that, when the licence is granted small conservation points should be constructed, so that supplies could be taken for spray irrigation purposes from holding tanks on the farms. The farmers have plenty of money for that. We are giving them enough money each year to build hundreds of tanks. All that I am asking is that they should construct a few holding tanks.<br/>
I suggest that this proposal should be looked at where there are areas of drought. There may be areas where lack of abstraction by industries and towns make this unnecessary. I am not asking for this if the need is not there, but where the need is there we should make every effort to lay down safeguards for the conservation of water.<br/>
I do not see any safeguard in the Bill other than payment for a licence. Perhaps the P.P.S., who has been examining this and who will be watering, irrigating and spraying all over the vast areas on which he grows crops, would tell us: "Is it all for &#x00A3;5 down and do as you like?". Where people abstract water or get a water supply from the water authority, it goes through the meters and they have to pay for it. When people are paying for something they are more careful about using it. I am only saying that all users of water from a water authority pay for the water they use. If the water that it is proposed to abstract were not abstracted, it would go into the ownership of the water authority which could then relay it to customers and industries in the neighbourhood. In Ayrshire, we sell much water to I.C.I. and other industries, and all of it is metered.<br/>
I want to be certain that our rivers are kept clean. I should like to know if some addition will be made to the Bill in Committee by which the Government can make certain that where abstraction occurs if the water seeps back into a stream or river it will not cause pollution.<br/>
It would be an excellent step if the Joint Under-Secretary could assure us

today whether a definite pledge has been made that the River Purification Board is to have added farmer representation and, if so, I would suggest that he ought to bring in angling interests. Would the Joint Under-Secretary consider whether the angling clubs affected should have representation on the Purification Board? It would be an excellent thing for the Board and for the areas where abstraction is taking place for spray irrigation if the angling clubs affected had the right to nominate from their membership one member to serve on the Board. That would be an added protection. We are all keen to keep our rivers and streams clean, and I think that we should endorse wholeheartedly any action along these lines that the Under-Secretary can take.</p>

<p>I believe that on both sides of the House there is already full and general agreement that this is a Measure well worth while for Scotland. I agree with the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel) that this is, however small, an important Measure. I am inclined in that respect to disagree with my hon. Friend the Member for South Angus (Sir J. Duncan), who has temporarily left the Chamber, when he said that it was not particularly important. I think that it is important. The Measure itself is important, and it is even more important for the future of Scotland that increasing consideration should be given to the conservation and purification of water in Scotland. As the Scottish nation grows in population, and its industries expand, the necessity for water will become increasingly important.<br/>
It is some considerable time ago&#x2014;a matter of years&#x2014;when the matter contained in this Bill was brought to my attention as a Member whose constituency covers a great proportion of the Tweed River. I noticed that the hon. Member for Kilmarnock (Mr. Ross), who opened the debate for the Opposition, referred to streams, but I am sure that he would not deny the Tweed as being a river, which, with all respect, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, passes through your constituency, but to which you are not allowed to make reference.<br/>
While this is important to other areas of Scotland, the proposals contained in this Measure may well have originated in the desire of the Tweed River Purification Board and other river boards in and about my constituency and elsewhere that something needs to be done. The hon. Member for Central Ayrshire said that this Measure was late in coming. I agree with him that it is. But now it is here and I think that this is the time to look forward to similar Measures in the future which will provide for the purification and conservation of water.<br/>
The hon. Member for Central Ayrshire suggested that it would well be within the compass of farmers to have on their farms water storage tanks. He is not a farmer and I am not a farmer, but we both have farms and farmers in our constituencies. When one considers the vast quantity of water required to deal with the requirements in the Bill for spray irrigation, it would be most unlikely that a series of farms could have the number of water tanks that would be effective. There would have to be a main catchment to conserve water for irrigation. That leads me to a rather dangerous point, and I shall watch the Chair, because I believe that in my area of south-east Scotland and the Tweed there are potentials for the catchment and saving of water in very large reservoirs by the expenditure of funds which will be available at those times of the year when water is scarce in the rivers.<br/>
I notice that you are becoming restive, Mr. Deputy-Speaker. I will not pursue this point further. I merely wanted to follow the remarks made by the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire.</p>

<p>That is not what I have said. I had in mind something, but I must watch the occupant of the Chair when I say that if water is to be abstracted that might be done apart from the provisions of the Bill. If there were a financial aspect related to abstraction which could apply to those who build catchments for water to be used at times of scarcity that would be an advantage.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for South Angus made a reference to other matters contiguous to the waters of a stream, burn or river. I have with me a considerable amount of correspondence that has taken place between my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State of various organisations and persons, and part of that correspondence deals with this subject. I had occasion to write to my right hon. Friend as a result of a representation by the River Inspectors Association. His reply was that:
<q>The River Inspectors' third point related to the proposal that control should cover abstraction for spray irrigation from all sources other than public water supply mains. The suggestion made by the River Purification Boards Association about the control of boreholes"&#x2014;</q>
a matter to which my hon. Friend the Member for South Angus referred&#x2014;
<q>covers rather similar ground. One could not rule out altogether the possibility of a borehole being sunk within a few yards of a stream in favourable conditions for seepage of water from that stream, but our advice is that the construction of a borehole on this basis would not only be quite uneconomic but the quantities of water likely to be available would be totally inadequate for the purposes of spray irrigation. Those few boreholes which have been constructed could, in the areas where spray irrigation is developing, draw water from underground sources and the fact that such abstractions would be out with the Act would mean that the farmer concerned might well be challenged at common law over this abstraction of water.</q>
That is not in the Bill, but it is part of the answer to the question raised by the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire.<br/>
I have risen because I feel that as this was a matter of thought for so many in the south-east of Scotland, particularly in the counties which I represent, and for those in neighbouring counties&#x2014;including you, Mr. Deputy-Speaker&#x2014;we should welcome this. it does not go all the way to solving the problems of conservation and abstraction, and all the things to do with the water services of Scotland, but it is a first move, and as such it should be welcomed.<br/>
The hon. Member for Kilmarnock almost had crocodile tears in his eyes when he referred to the absence of the Secretary of State for Scotland.</p>

<p>It has certainly been mentioned, but I will not pursue the matter further.<br/>
I welcome the Bill from the point of view of the interests not only of my constituents but of those in the surrounding areas. When the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire talks about farmers, he gives the impression that they are all men of substance, but in my three counties there are many who will not be encouraged one way or another by the Bill. However, many small farmers may benefit from its provisions.<br/>
The prime object of the Bill is not to say, "You chaps get together to extract water for spray irrigation," but to make clear that there will have to be licences in respect of the control of the supply of water and that an obligation will be placed not merely upon farmers but upon local authorities, including county councils, to have regard to the necessity for sewerage works and purification. That will be necessary if we are to have a sufficient quantity of water flowing.</p>

<p>The Joint Under-Secretary need not have apologised for the absence of the Secretary of State, because he read his brief rather better than the Secretary of State reads his.<br/>
There has been some argument whether the Bill is a major or a trivial piece of legislation. As usual, the truth lies somewhere between the two. I believe that it is of some importance in two respects, and that it will become increasingly important. I refer to the question of pollution and conservation. Pollution will become increasingly important as the quantity of effluent being discharged into the rivers increases, and conservation will become increasingly important as the community generally consumes ever larger quantities of water.<br/>
Only a few years ago Edinburgh thought that its water problems had been solved by the Talla Reservoir. We used to boast about it. But now Edinburgh is faced with an expenditure of several million pounds on the supply of additional water. I understand that the obtaining of water is now becoming a pressing problem all over the world. We

should not sit back and say, "We have plenty, and do not need to worry". We thought that a long time ago, but considering what has happened to some Scottish streams even since the war we must have some concern about water conservation.</p>

<p>The hon. Member has referred to Talla, which is in my constituency. I agree that that was the situation. I understand that there is a stream contiguous to my constituency to which the Edinburgh Corporation is now looking for further supplies, probably in Selkirkshire. By taking feed water, Edinburgh would be helped as well as the Tweed Valley.</p>

<p>I only point out that what was considered an ample water supply a mere twenty years ago has now become a totally inadequate supply, although there has been little increase in population. Every person in this country is responsible for using two, three, four, five and six times as much water as a person used years ago.</p>

<p>I have gone into this matter at some length, and I find that much of the increase is due to the fact that thousands of occupants of municipal houses now have baths installed in the houses and more extensive facilities for washing than they have ever had before. Previously they were the "great unwashed". Now they have proper water supplies.</p>

<p>I am not disputing what are the causes. I am pointing out that it is happening on a vast scale, not simply as a result of a greater number of baths being provided. Cars are being washed and water used for gardens. The result is that water supplies are inadequate. Industry uses vast quantities of water, much more than in the past. We must recognise that this is one of the problems which faces us. It is a problem which confronts Glasgow as well as Edinburgh, and in respect of Edinburgh millions of pounds will have to spent in the constituency of the hon. and gallant Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Commander Donaldson).<br/>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn)


referred to pollution. I have a river in my constituency about which I ask Questions regularly. At one time people caught salmon there, but now nothing comes up the river. The last salmon gave itself up in disgust to a wee boy with a pin. There is nothing now in the Esk. Despite the fact that local authorities in the area have undertaken a large-scale sewerage scheme, the river still smells at times and people object. They ask whether the authority responsible for river purification has sufficient power to deal with the matter. A problem arises in connection with the expenditure involved.<br/>
Both pollution and conservation are matters of importance, and so I think that this Bill is important. If we permit the extraction of large quantities of water we shall increase the degree of pollution. If we extract large quantities of water we shall affect the amount of water available. Representations which I have received from river inspectors indicate that water used for spray irrigation evaporates or is soaked up by the earth and does not return to the stream. In this way the levels of water in an area are affected.<br/>
If pollution results from uncontrolled extraction of water, it poses a question which ought to be settled in other ways than by putting additional representatives of agricultural interests on the river purification boards. It seems to me that this should be the concern of other people. If there is a considerable extraction of water from the River Esk above the town of Musselburgh, or Dalkeith, and a degree of pollution results, it is not the farmers upstream who suffer but the good residents of Musselburgh. They have to put up with the smell and the intolerable conditions. I cannot understand what the Government mean when they talk about increasing the agricultural interests on these boards. Why should we do that? They are already represented. Surely those people who represent the agricultural interests know something about spray irrigation? Why should we suddenly increase the agricultural interest?<br/>
I do not know what pressures were put on the Government, but I imagine that they came from the Scottish landowners. That is the most effective form

of pressure which is ever brought to bear on a Tory Government. As soon as the Scottish landowners raise their heads the Government&#x2014;at least a Tory Government&#x2014;are on their knees. I was charmed by the manner in which the Under-Secretary of State read his brief, but I was amazed at the manner in which he tried to explain this point. He said that we have agreed that there should be added agricultural interests, without in any way disturbing the balance of the Committee.</p>

<p>I do not know whether a bigger committee is more capable of looking after things than a small committee. I should feel more inclined to accept a smaller committee. Members of a bigger committee might not bother to attend the committee meetings. They might say, "I have not the time to attend a committee meeting this afternoon, there will be plenty of others present". The attendance will be smaller, therefore, and less interest will be taken in the work. A smaller committee would be preferable. To increase agricultural interests in order to add other interests seems to me to be fruitless.<br/>
The Government representatives receive powerful representations from hon. Gentlemen sitting behind them&#x2014;the land-owning interests and the farmers&#x2014;that there should be a greater representation. The Government promised the farmers a greater representation on the boards&#x2014;</p>

opposite&#x2014;whenever they run short of something worth while to say&#x2014;to start taking a rise out of the wretched Parliamentary Private Secretary, whose ability to take part in the debate is limited.

<p>I was talking about the Scottish landed interests. I think it was a fair comment. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, North (The Earl of Dalkeith) is one&#x2014;he is one of the very large ones. I suggest that the Scottish landed interests brought pressure to bear on the Government&#x2014;not the hon. Gentleman but the Scottish Landowners' Association, which represents those interests. That is all it exists to do, and it would not be doing its job if it did not represent those interests. I do not blame them, for that is why they exist. I blame us for allowing these interests to continue for so long and to have such great power. I do not blame the hon. Gentleman but those who allow this.<br/>
What do the Government expect to achieve by increasing the size of the committees? In spite of what the Under-Secretary said, he has to confess that there will be no change at all in the actual balance on a committee. Already those committees have 15 members. That is not a bad number if a committee is to work rather than to be merely consultative. I was rather disappointed about these additional agricultural interests, but having heard the hon. Gentleman's explanation that there is nothing in it and that other people will be put on the committees, I see that there will be no change, and I do not understand why it is being done.<br/>
I tried to trace this Bill as it went through in another place to find what happened to some of the representations made by river inspectors. I understand that they made certain representations, and it seems that some of them have been met. The first concerned extraction of water from subterranean sources. In spite of the letter which the hon. and gallant Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles received from the Secretary of State, we would be assisted if the Under-Secretary could make a statement

about this. There is some concern about it. Simply to have the matter referred to in a letter sent to the hon. and gallant Member is not good enough. I should like the Under-Secretary to give us some information about this. Are the river inspectors right in fearing that the Bill does not go far enough? If the hon. Gentleman thinks mat the river inspectors are wrong, will he give his reasons for thinking they are wrong?<br/>
Another point concerns the time for granting licences by the Board. I understand that in another place this was altered from a fortnight to a month. It seems that the point has been met. I would not have raised these points during the Second Reading had it not been for the fact that the Government place us in an awkward position by rushing Bills through other stages on Fridays. It is difficult to find time to discuss them in Committee. It would, therefore, help if the Under-Secretary said something on these points today.<br/>
The original paragraph 3 of the Schedule said mat a copy of the notice with a copy of the application and any relevant plan had to be sent to every person known to the river purification board to have any interest in any land to which the control order applied. This was objected to as it was considered impossible to carry it out. Am I correct in assuming that the matter has now been dealt with in another place and that if the board find that they cannot comply certain steps will be taken to meet the position?<br/>
I had no intention of occupying all this time, but I got led into one or two little byways, as often happens in Scottish debates. The problem is that byways are so often more pleasant than main roads. I think that the Bill is a good one and will be useful. We have to recognise that these are growing problems. They are important now and may become worse. It is much better to tackle them early than to allow them to get into a position to cause very serious damage.</p>

<p>I apologise for having to leave the House for a few minutes during this debate. As my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) said, I have had a


great deal to do with these problems and I am interested in their solution.<br/>
I welcome the Bill as a small contribution to tackling the problems, but they cannot be tackled adequately until the whole of our water supply system is dealt with in a proper way. It is tragic to find local authorities, as it were, scrambling over the mountains to find places where they can establish reservoirs and competing with each other for the use of streams. This system has to be brought into some sort of order sooner or later. When we were passing legislation to deal with drainage it was seen that in this problem we should plan in a businesslike fashion. Hon. Members will know of the steps we took to drain hillsides. That seemed a wonderful contribution and, as a result, we recovered much agricultural land and mountain pastures. But the net result was that when floods came, instead of the water being held in the hills and undrained, it rushed down into the rivers which flooded and swamped more good land than we had recovered. These things cannot be dealt with in isolation.<br/>
Although I welcome the Bill for what it does in regard to small streams, I wish to ask about the position over reservoirs. When they are built the law provides for compensation water so that the water can go down from the reservoirs to the sea. How far would these streams be invaded by this kind of reservation? That is a point which must be looked into. The question of irrigation will become of increasing importance. I have seen what happens in the French irrigation scheme, which in a way is one of the wonders of the world. The French have used their great River Rhone, not only to provide for basic load electricity, but for an irrigation scheme which has turned the whole Camargue and Marseilles area from a bog into fertile land irrigated by pipes. The fertilisation is controlled by the pipes going to crops, and they have turned what was a bog into a great fruit garden. They are training people to manage it. They are growing crops which they have not grown before, and it has been a remarkable development.<br/>
In addition, they have used the power of the stream to take water to areas in which there was sun but never water, and they have been able to irrigate areas

of high land and to bring whole areas into cultivation. I understand that it was the inspiration of the Mississippi scheme in America which led to this work. The work in France is being done by the State. Hon. Members opposite may be disappointed to know this, but it is the kind of planning which can be done only by the community. It is worked by people who are giving their lives to this kind of work, and the results have been fantastic. Anyone who has an opportunity of seeing it should take that opportunity.<br/>
Scotland needs to do something of this kind, because although there is a scarcity of water developing, millions and millions of gallons run to waste down the rivers at times when water is plentiful. Hydro-electricity is doing something to preserve this water, and atomic energy and pumped storage will recover some of the water and use it over and over again. I agree that subterranean sources can provide a considerable amount of water. The flooded pits of Lanarkshire, which have tremendous quantities of water, are being drawn on for industrial purposes, as should be the case.<br/>
Moreover, with atomic energy there is bound to be a great deal of surplus energy during the night&#x2014;energy which cannot be used. In the Far East and elsewhere we see methods of converting seawater into fresh water. All this provides the opportunity to take water to the right place with energy which might other-wise be lost. We could use that energy and the heat available to turn our land into a much more fertile and beautiful land. Quite near the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East, or in it, is one of the most adventurous horticulturists perhaps in the world. Certainly he is not surpassed in his ideas. He can produce vegetables in the early part of the year by spraying, by cover to keep out the frosts, and by the use of a certain amount of heat. He has indicated what is possible. He was not afraid of the Common Market because he saw in it a great opportunity for marketing his vegetables.<br/>
At one time he had the idea, which I tried to encourage&#x2014;I was disappointed when it did not come off&#x2014;of going to the softer climate of Argyllshire, where there is never any scarcity of water, where


there is warmth and good soil, and trying to provide early vegetables for Glasgow and the West Coast. I am sure that this could be done. If Sir David Low, who is building up the town of Livingstone, were called upon by the Government to tell them how to do it, I am sure that he could show them how to use the Bill to develop irrigation in the west of Scotland&#x2014;not to flood the land when it does not need water, but to conserve the water and to use it on the land when it is required. I am sure that if this could be combined with proper fertilisers, the West Coast could be a great producer of food. In some parts it can grow palms. It seems to me that with a climate like that there is no reason why the land should not be properly used.<br/>
But it must be part of a national plan. Politics apart, there is only one sensible way to do it, and that is to bring the water supplies of the country into a great national plan. I understand that when we come to power it will be the policy of the Labour Party to do this. This is not an easy matter because it involves, as the hon. and gallant Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Commander Donaldson) said, there are problems of drainage, sewerage, fresh water, evaporation and many other problems. It cannot be done easily.<br/>
I agree that interests must be consulted, but the point is that interests are not the executive power. They are the consultative power. Our objection is not to the farmer or even the landowner being consulted. One might even take the butcher's advice when dealing with vegetarianism, but one does not necessarily put butchers on the body to control the propaganda for vegetarianism. One might as well say that cigarette manufacturers should be put on a committee to see whether anything should be done to stop people smoking because of the danger of lung cancer. It is in their interests to do so, but they are unlikely to be missionaries in a campaign to stop people smoking cigarettes. We found this with the purification board. People were there not to get things done but to prevent them from being done, in some cases because it would cost them a great deal of money.<br/>
This is important because the cost of purification is sometimes greater than the

benefits which would come from it. All this must be taken into account. I wish that the Government would bear this principle in mind&#x2014;that experts should be on tap and not on top. The people who should be there are those who judge in the public interest, and they should take everything into account just as the Government do when preparing a Bill. As the board is created, with too many people who do not want things done, the Government are apt to tie their own hands from the point of view of the success of the Bill. I hope that they will keep this in mind when appointing these people. If they are to appoint people of this kind they should consider the principle of setting a thief to catch a thief, but they should not have vested interests appointed who will simply prevent things from being done.<br/>
We have this legislation&#x2014;a little bit on drainage, a little bit of control here, and a little bit of building there. The Department should get down to the fundamental problem of what is to be the future of our water supplies. As my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East said, we must think of this years in advance. It was 20 years in advance when Talla was made, when they thought that Edinburgh would never need any more water. We have all these advertisements about soap and washing whiter than white. A tremendous amount of water is bound to be used. Cleanliness is said to be next to godliness, and there is bound to be considerable increase in the use of water.<br/>
I hope that the Government realise that this is only a small part of a very big problem which will not be solved until there is some authority which has at least a guiding control over what happens to the water when it falls on the hillside and flows down to the sea. We may have to pump it back. We may have to create fresh water from the sea. It may be used for hydro-electric power, we may have reservoirs and all kinds of things. But the water must not be wasted. We should not allow it simply to run into the sea when there is plenty of it if the result is that water is not plentiful when it is needed. I therefore believe that the Government should have a comprehensive plan which will embrace the supply of water generally. Up to


that point I welcome the Bill as one small candle in lighting up this great problem.</p>

<p>With the leave of the House, I should be glad to answer some of the points raised during the debate. AU hon. Members have drawn attention to various aspects of the need for conservation and purification in certain areas of Scotland. The right hon. Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn) has had great experience of these matters, and I was most interested to hear some of the problems which he mentioned and some of his suggestions. What the hon. Member for Kilmarnock (Mr. Ross) said at the beginning, and what has been echoed by other hon. Members, shows that the Measure is necessary.<br/>
I should like to underline again that when the Bill, as we hope, is approved and enacted the position will be open for applications for control orders to be made. It is only in the areas where control orders subsequently become effective that licensing will be necessary. In the large majority of the areas of Scotland we do not expect licensing to be necessary.<br/>
I should like to deal with the points on representation on the boards at greater length than I could in reply to interventions. As I mentioned to the hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis), the intention is that there should be added representation for agricultural interests but that at the same time the balance between the interest should be maintained, so that other new members may also be added. This could be done under the 1951 Act by the Secretary of State and he would consider the composition of each board at the time that a control order was coming into effect and the position required his attention.<br/>
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, East asked what it should be necessary to make the boards larger in this way. It is for the simple sort of reasons which I am sure would occur to him and other hon. Members. If, for example, there are only two members representing agricultural interests on the board and these important questions of spray irrigation came up it could be that through illness or other reasons outwith the control of

the members concerned only one&#x2014;or indeed neither&#x2014;might be present. We feel that an increase in the representation of other interests would not be detrimental to the boards. It would mean that at any meeting when these questions came up there would be more certainty that the various representatives would be attending and expressing their views. Many hon. Members have represented that this is a matter of balancing interests including, for example, as the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel) said, angling interests in contrast to farming interests.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman will appreciate that the same difficulty arises with all the other interests. Their representatives might not be able to attend but if he adds representatives of all interests there will be tremendously big boards.</p>

<p>It is not the intention to appoint what the right hon. Gentleman calls a Grand Committee. It would be simply a matter of adding a small number and increasing membership to balance the interests. To increase the number representing agricultural and other interests would make it much more probable that the other members would be able to attend the meeting as well. I do not think that hon. Members can object to this. I have explained that the point is not to increase relative to the other interests the agricultural interests so that they might be considered to be over-weighted.<br/>
The hon. Member for Kilmarnock spoke of there being no right to take water. The legal position is that a riparian occupier has a common law right to take water for certain primary uses. I did not say that a farmer abstracting water, if he were a riparian owner, had no right. I said that if he was taking large quantities it was open to doubt whether he had the right and therefore we are trying in the Bill to improve on the position and remove doubts. The hon. Member thought that a &#x00A3;50 penalty too little, and I would point out that there is also the penalty of the revocation of the licence which is a valuable licence for the holder.<br/>
My bon. Friend the Member for South Angus (Sir J. Duncan) asked me about the meaning of the word "contiguous". He gave as an example the farmer who might be separated from the water of the river by a narrow strip owned by a fishing interest. I can only help by saying that we have looked into this possibility to see whether special provision should be made for this kind of case.<br/>
Firstly, situations of this sort seem likely to be infrequent in the areas most affected now by abstraction for spray irrigation. I recognise, nevertheless, that such a situation could arise. The basic legal point, as I have indicated, is the common law right of a riparian proprietor to take water for certain purposes. The non-riparian proprietor has no such right and therefore a person whose land is separated from a river, by no matter how narrow a strip, does not appear to have a common law right.<br/>
After careful examination we have reached the conclusion that to try to change the law in this respect, or to make exceptions for non-riparians, would lead to confusing anomalies. If a strip of five yards were excepted, why not 25 yards or 100 yards? However, if a farmer whose land is separated from a stream by a narrow strip of land should become interested in installing spray irrigation equipment, he could try to purchase back a short part of the riverside strip and thus become the owner of land contiguous to a stream and entitled to apply for a licence, but I recognise that he might be unsuccessful in this attempt. We understand that "contiguous" means the land actually washed by the waters of the stream or river.<br/>
I have explained the legal position and this is all I can do to help my hon. Friend. I know that it does not do what he was hoping for, but nevertheless I think that it is the most helpful thing that I can do, because it makes the legal position clear to anybody who finds himself in this position.<br/>
My hon. Friend also raised the question of boreholes, as did my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Commander Donaldson). First, he asked about the word "localities". I should explain that it is used because there may be areas where it is far too complicated to try and follow the

whole network of small watercourses and streams and much easier to designate an area.<br/>
I can confirm that the best technical advice available to me is that the construction of boreholes for the purpose of obtaining supplies of water from a river bed by means of seepage would not only be quite uneconomic but that the quantities of water so obtained would be totally inadequate for spray irrigation. The amount would be so small as to be of limited value.<br/>
The question arises whether boreholes should be included in the scope of the Bill. Few boreholes have been sunk in Scotland for spray irrigation and those draw their supplies from underground strata. As I have indicated, it is most unlikely that a borehole could draw water in sufficient quantity for irrigation. Normally the water is pumped into a pond and from the pond, in due course, it is sprayed on the land. It is our intention therefore that boreholes should not come within the scope of the Bill.<br/>
We shall consider whether this should be made absolutely clear by an Amendment. If we think that this is necessary or desirable we propose to table an appropriate Amendment in Committee. I think that this will help farmers, because farmers who can at the moment sink boreholes on their land and obtain water from the strata below without in any way interfering with the flow of streams will be happier to think that they can do that without being involved in the licensing procedure of the Bill. Secondly, as we have agreed during the debate, the purpose of the Bill is to deal with the flow in streams and not to go into the question of wells and strata.</p>

<p>I understand the force of the hon. Gentleman's argument, but whether a borehole near a stream would take a large seepage would depend upon the nature of the strata. Although in many cases it might not take very much, it is conceivable that it might well take a great deal. It was the river inspectors themselves who were concerned about it, and they are by no means ignorant.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1964-07-09a.680.1" hansard_membership_id="2094" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29607" speakername="Mr. Campbell" colnum="680" time="">
<p>Yes, this was an important point which they raised, and it enabled us to go very carefully into the technical and geological considerations. As a result of our investigations,


I can state categorically that boreholes are very unlikely to affect the flow of streams and that farmers are much more likely to be embarrassed if we bring them within the scope of the Bill than if we exclude them. Of course, if the findings had been otherwise, we should have had to bring them in.<br/>
The hon. Member for Central Ayrshire asked about the addition of chemicals or insecticides. This is not likely to be a technique used in spray irrigation. It is certainly not at present, and it is most unlikely to be. Moreover, as the hon. Member for Edinburgh, East pointed out, one of the attributes of spray irrigation is that the liquid does not return to the stream.<br/>
The hon. Member for Central Ayrshire asked about storage tanks. If water is abstracted from a river and placed in a storage tank for the purposes of spray irrigation, it will fall within the scope of the Bill. Under the agricultural water supplies scheme of 1937, it is possible for farmers to obtain a 50 per cent. grant for such storage tanks. I imagine that the boards are likely to favour applications which include such tanks or ponds because, obviously, their use will assist the conservation of water. The hon. Gentleman asked also about fishing interests. Most of the boards have at least two members representing such interests. I know that the board he is thinking of has only one, although some of the members have a dual interest. We shall take account of the point which he made about that.<br/>
In reply to the hon. Member for Edinburgh, East, I can confirm that both Amendments dealing with the points he raised were made in another place. The second one is in the form of the proviso added at the end of paragraph 3 of the Schedule.<br/>
The hon. Member for Kilmarnock made three general points. First, he asked about water policy. We recognise the importance of a water policy as a whole. Important steps to reorganise water services for Scotland, and for Ayrshire in particular, are in hand. My right hon. Friend regards the positive encouragement of purification&#x2014;the hon. Gentleman's second point&#x2014;as extremely important.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman's third point was on the quality of the boards. I can assure him that my right hon. Friend recognises the need to have very high-quality representatives on river purification boards. So far as it lies within his power, he will assist to that end.</p>

<p>I beg to move,
<q>That the Cinematograph Films (Distribution of Levy) (Amendment) Reglations, 1964, a draft of which was laid before this House on 30th June, be approved.</q>
As the House knows, cinema exhibitors pay a statutory levy the proceeds of which are distributed to the makers of British films. The subventions from this levy, which run at about &#x00A3;4 million a year, are an important addition to the income of our film makers. Under the existing Regulations governing this statutory levy, a producer whose film is booked to television at the time when it comes to be registered at the Board of Trade for cinema showing loses his entitlement. He is similarly disqualified if his film is exhibited to the public on television earlier than twelve months after its registration.<br/>
The experimental services of pay-television announced by my right hon. Friend the Postmaster-General on 11th December will be on a restricted scale. Hence, it is unlikely that these services will be able themselves to generate the major part of the material which they will require, let alone all of it. Therefore, they are likely to show a considerable number of cinema films.<br/>
However, as these experimental pay-television services will be limited, returns to our film makers from this source are likely to be small compared with those from cinemas. Nevertheless, they will be welcome. Moreover British film makers are keenly interested in the long-term possibilities of pay-television. They think that it will offer them a real chance of regaining their lost cinema audiences.<br/>
The disqualification in the existing Regulations to which I referred a moment ago means that the maker of a British film would lose his levy benefits, possibly amounting to &#x00A3;100,000 or more on a really successful film, if it were shown on pay-television before it was a year old. This would make it virtually certain that no reasonably new British film would get on pay-television, while foreign films, having no levy privileges to lose, would not be similarly deterred.<br/>
Clearly, this would be in direct contradiction to the purpose of the levy, namely, to help British film makers.<br/>
The amending Regulations now before the House, therefore, remove in respect of the pay-television experiments the television disqualification in the existing Regulations, subject only to one condition. This condition is that the film concerned has not been shown on pay-television during the six months before its registration. This condition has to be made so as to discourage any tendency that there might otherwise be for people to get round the Government's arrangements as a whole in respect of cinema films and pay-television.<br/>
The House will no doubt wish me briefly to describe these arrangements. It has to be remembered throughout that we are dealing with experiments, and not with permanent services of pay-television. We also have to remember that there is a body of films legislation, none of which was drawn up with pay-television in mind. It is perhaps fortunate that the expiry of this legislation in 1967 should fall more or less at the point in time when experience of pay-television will be accumulating from the pay-television trials.<br/>
The arrangements that we are making for cinema films and pay-television during the experimental period are in two main parts; first, certain safeguards for exhibitors in the trials areas and, secondly, a voluntary system for the collection of a levy from the pay-television operators. The safeguards have been drawn up in the light of views expressed in the Cinematograph Films Council on the two occasions when it considered them. The Council also recommended a voluntary rather than a statutory levy scheme for pay-television. Most important of all, the change in the Regulations now before the House is in accordance with the views of the Council, which has been consulted in accordance with the requirements of the 1957 Act.<br/>
The safeguards for local exhibitors are, of course, a matter for my right hon. Friend the Postmaster-General, and they were described to the House in general terms on 5th May by my hon. Friend the Assistant Postmaster-General in answer to a Parliamentary Question.<br/>
Perhaps I may remind the House that these safeguards include a provision for the withholding of certain types of cinema films from pay-television until the local exhibitors&#x2014;unless, of course, they agree otherwise&#x2014;have had six months in which to play them; and a limited amount of compensation in each area against the possibility that a cinema exhibitor can point to the prior showing of cinema films by pay-television and can demonstrate a loss of box-office takings reasonably attributable to that cause.<br/>
The Post Office, in consultation with the Board of Trade, is now in the final stages of drafting the detailed rules embodying these safeguards. My right hon. Friend the Postmaster-General will secure any necessary undertakings from the pay-television operators before issuing their licences, and the final texts of the rules will be placed in the Library when they are completed.<br/>
Then there is the question of statutory levy. It is our view that during the experimental period the pay-television operators should not be included in the statutory levy scheme, but rather that they should contribute to the fund voluntarily. The reasons for this are a little technical, but I do not believe that the net effect will be very different.<br/>
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Industry, Trade and Regional Development has secured an undertaking from the pay-television operators that they will contribute, for as long as he wants them to do so during the period of the pay-television experiments, to a non-statutory levy scheme on a contractual basis. The Board of Trade will shortly arrange a meeting at which we hope to set the film producers, the distributors and the pay-television operators to the task of working out a detailed scheme to which my right hon. Friend can give his approval. He will expect any such scheme to reproduce the main features of the existing statutory one&#x2014;</p>

<p>It is admitted by the very fact that compensation provisions are to be made that the pay-television operators are in competition with the cinematographic exhibitors. Why should they not be subject to the statutory levy?</p>

<p>The hon. Member is tempting me to go into the technical reasons. I think that the Cinematograph Films Council came to the same conclusion as ourselves, remembering that this is for the experimental period only. I could go into some of the technical reasons, not the least of which is (hat, at this stage, when none of these trials has yet been done, we have no idea as to the quantity of films they are likely to be playing. We do not know for how long some of these trials; will go on, and the arrangements we are proposing cover the trial periods only. When the trial periods are over we may find, with the experience behind us, that the hon. Gentleman may well be right, and that it might be the proper thing to do, but that will be when the whole country will or will not, according to the results of the trials, be covered by pay-television.<br/>
We then come to the further point that when the Cinematograph Films Council considered the proposed levy on the experimental pay-television operators, it recommended that the levy should be collected in respect of all cinema films, even if they were not identifiable as cinema films at the time when they were playing on pay-television. We shall be asking the organisers of the proposed nonstatutory levy scheme to try to work out arrangements to meet the Cinematograph Films Council's point. It seems to us probable that such arrangements would involve some retrospective collection.<br/>
Then there is the final matter of what rate of levy contribution it is appropriate to expect the pay-television operators to pay during the experimental period. The Government have decided that since there will usually be a six-month delay in the showing by pay-television of new cinema films, the position of the pay-television operators is more analogous to that of the subsequent-run cinema exhibitors than to that of the first-run.<br/>
My right hon. Friend has therefore decided that the pay-television operators should be required to contribute to the non-statutory levy at a rate of 6 per cent. of their gross takings, and this figure has been accepted by them. At that figure they will, we believe, be making an appropriate contribution, since sample figures for the experimental areas show


that the average for all cinemas is 7&#x00B7;2 per cent. and, for subsequent-run cinemas, 4&#x00B7;3 per cent.<br/>
In the course of our consultations with the Cinematograph Films Council, the Council recommended to my right hon. Friend that the pay-television operators should contribute to the non-statutory fund at a rate equal to that at which the big first-run cinemas contribute to the statutory fund. After mature reflection, we came to the conclusion that this was not entirely the right basis of comparison for what will be, after all, only trials. Therefore, my right hon. Friend, with regret, was unable to accept the Council's advice on this point.<br/>
In conclusion, I should like to repeat that we are dealing only with short-term experiments in pay-television. There is nothing here that in any sense commits us beyond the experimental period. I hope that, with this explanation, the proposed change in the Regulations to waive the television disqualification in respect of pay-television will meet with the approval of the House.</p>

<p>We should make it clear that while we would not oppose this Statutory Instrument, we are rather concerned about it. The Minister will himself appreciate that we are dealing with a very awkward situation owing to the experimental period, to the number of imponderabilia, and to the difficulty of forecasting what is likely to happen. Quite frankly, I have a very poor view of the experiment altogether. I think that it is very largely a phoney experiment, and one in which it will be extremely difficult to make a judgment except on narrow technical matters. Owing to the artificial conditions of the experiments agreed by the Postmaster-General, it will mean that in those areas designated, and for the period designated for the experiment, a disproportionate amount of film material will be used on the programmes, for reasons into which we need not now go.<br/>
There is also the problem that if certain relaxations are made, as are now proposed for the pay-television experiment, the B.B.C. and the I.T.A. may, in due course, also ask for some re-

mission of their obligations. Therefore, although this is a very small and limited change in the Regulations, it causes a great deal of concern, as it might be used as the thin end of the wedge in subsequent periods.<br/>
I appreciate that there is no time limit in the Regulations other than by reference to an experimental television service. On the other hand, as the Minister has pointed out, they will lapse automatically with the lapsing of the legislation in 1967 and the two things would roughly coincide. We have, however, just been told that it is likely that the pay-television experiment, instead of starting this autumn, will not start until a good deal later. That is what the trade Press, at least, is saying.<br/>
Therefore, we wonder whether it is really necessary in those circumstances to bring in the Regulations at the end of the Session with so many things still not fully determined. We do not know, for example, exactly what the contractual agreement will be between the television operators which will be supervised, I understand, by the Board of Trade. It seems in some ways a pity, if there is to be a revised timetable for the introduction of the pay-television experiment, that the Regulations should be brought forward before those other matters have been fully decided.<br/>
This is causing some disquiet in the exhibition side of the industry. The people in that side of the industry would like a statutory levy arrangement for this experiment. For a number of technical reasons which were fully discussed at the Cinematograph Films Council, we came, some of us with great reluctance, to the conclusion that a voluntary scheme would have to be accepted in the initial stages. The exhibitors, however, who would have liked the statutory scheme now, say that the exemption which is being provided for under the Regulations means that the pay-television companies will have obtained the benefit without accepting the specific obligations which should form the other side of the bargain.<br/>
We are really put in a position in which we have to take all this on trust, including the negotiating ability of the Board of Trade to produce a form of contract for the pay-television people concerning the levy. We understand, of


course, that the other safeguards are being looked after by the Department of the Postmaster-General, but the levy is within the purview of the Board of Trade. Unless an adequate basis can be established, we are being asked in the Regulations to agree to a relaxation which will be for the benefit of certain people without knowing the precise terms of the other side of the account.<br/>
I was a little disturbed to find that the Board of Trade has, apparently, disregarded the advice of the Cinematograph Films Council on the percentage of gross takings. At one time, we were talking of something a good deal higher&#x2014;10 per cent. It has now been brought down to 6 per cent. That is rather unfortunate.<br/>
The other thing which worries me is that we should not have had a very firm declaration from the Minister that the films which will be particularly dealt with by the Regulations&#x2014;those which might be shown on television before they are registered as cinematograph films&#x2014;will carry retrospective levy obligations. I regard this as vital. We are here waiving a condition and saying that a film which has been shown unregistered, provided that it was six months after its first showing, will be entitled to obtain its cinema levy payment at a later date. One of the great arguments has been that this loophole should be firmly closed. We ought to have been told especifically that there will be retrospective payments.<br/>
I do not want to delay the House, because other business is to follow. In the circumstances, it is a pity that we should have to take the Regulations now if it is true, as we are told in the trade Press, that pay-television is not likely to come into operation until quite a time later than we had originally supposed.</p>

<p>We ought to spend a certain amount of time on the Regulations because they have certain important features, especially for those who have been interested in the rather complex system of legislation which has been built up over a long period of years about the cinematograph film industry. I do not envy any of those in the Board of Trade who have to deal with this matter. It is an extraordinarily complex system which has been built up over three or four

decades for the purpose of maintaining a thriving British film-producing industry and of trying to maintain a choice for the consumer. The system has many difficult features about it and we have had many complicated and delicate discussions upon it.<br/>
The Government must realise that something very important has happened in regard to pay-television. As revealed in the Answers to some Questions which I put down on this subject concerning the right to exhibit cinematograph films on pay-television, the Government have decided in this case to intervene directly to create a privileged position for the pay-television operators. Let us be quite clear about it.<br/>
As spelled out in an Answer by the Assistant Postmaster-General not long ago, the use; of cinematograph films by the major television circuits has been a matter of commercial negotiation between the bodies concerned. It has been a matter for the B.B.C. and the independent television companies and, on the other side, the Cinematograph Exhibitors Association and the British Film Producers' Association, who have conducted the negotiations. The film industry has developed a protective skin about the matter. Realising the ways in which its interests might be damaged by the widespread and indiscriminate use of cinematograph films on the television circuits, it has developed an organisation to defend its interests and to lay down certain conditions which hitherto have debarred the major television circuits from getting films that were less than 10, or even 20, years old for exhibition on the television circuits.<br/>
As the Assistant Postmaster-General said in reply to Questions, that was a matter of commercial negotiation. It had nothing to do with the Government. The Government, rightly or wrongly, refused to take a view one way or the other about the exhibition of films on the major television circuits. Therefore, the B.B.C. and the I.T.A. have so far been denied the right to exhibit for the benefit of viewers films that were not extremely old.<br/>
Now, however, when the Government are bringing forward Regulations of this kind, they have taken an entirely new step. For the benefit of the experimental pay-television operators, the Government have intervened to enable them to get


comparatively new cinematograph films. As the Parliamentary Secretary has frankly admitted, they have done it because, otherwise, the pay-television experiment simply would not get off the ground. As my hon. Friend the Member for Flint, East (Mrs. White) has just mentioned, it is a big question today whether the pay-television experiment will get off the ground at all. We should like to know tonight in the reply from the Treasury Bench exactly what is the position.<br/>
There are stories in the trade Press of postponements and procrastinations, and it seems likely that the date of the bringing into operation of the pay-television experiment will be considerably postponed. Therefore, the first question that we are raising is whether it is necessary to make any haste at all, in considering Regulations of this kind&#x2014;</p>

<p>I rise to commend the new Clause to the House. The Bill envisages, most conspicuously in Part II, Clause 5, the compulsory acquisition on a large scale of private property by the London County Council, who are the promoters of the Bill. It is relevant, therefore, for the House to consider the methods used by that authority to assess and value the compensation to be paid to private owners who are the victims. The new Clause,

which I and hon. Friends of mine have tabled and which we are now debating, is designed to ensure that these valuation methods shall be such as to command public confidence.<br/>
The methods currently used by the London County Council do not, unfortunately, as I shall seek to show, command public confidence. This is not the first time that I have drawn the attention of the House of Commons to this problem. I did so on the Third Reading of the Consolidated Fund (No. 2) Bill, when my hon. Friend the Joint Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Housing and Local Government, whom the House will be glad to see in his place, encouraged me in his reply to pursue further my researches into the matter. I had not expected to have anything further to submit to the House so soon on this subject. Indeed, on Second Reading of this Private Bill I felt that no useful purpose would be served by further discussion of it.<br/>
Since then, however, I have received a remarkable letter from a source so revealing, so authoritative, of such a nature and so relevant to the argument that I feel that it would be only right to put it on record for the information of the House and of the public at large. I do that in the hope that the House may be persuaded to improve the Bill in this respect, even at this late stage.<br/>
Before I read the letter to which I have referred, it might be for the convenience of the House if I summarise briefly the argument which is at the heart of the new Clause. It is as follows. When compulsorily acquiring private property most local authorities pay&#x2014;and, in my submission, all local authorities should pay&#x2014;compensation to the dispossessed owner at the value assessed by the district valuer. The district valuer is an official of the Department of Inland Revenue. He is entirely independent, especially in so far as he is not employed by the local authority which is acquiring the property compulsorily. If he was employed by that authority, he might be thought to have an interest in paying little rather than more.<br/>
The London County Council, which is promoting the Bill, is one of the authorities which do not follow that practice. The London County Council uses its


own employees to say what compensation would be fair. The Council is, therefore, in the position of appearing to be judge in its own cause. That transgresses the first principle of justice and causes the dispossessed owner to suspect that he may not have got a fair deal.<br/>
I know that the answer which the London County Council would give in its defence is to say that the dispossessed owner can always appeal to the Lands Tribunal if he is not satisfied with what the County Council's&#x2014;the acquiring authority's&#x2014;employee tells him the Council is prepared to pay in the interests of the people which it represents. That answer, however, is altogether too slick for the House to accept. Life is not as simple as that, as the monkey found when he tried to pull the nut out of the jar after he had closed his fingers around it.<br/>
In the first place, it takes no account of Section 30 of the Land Compensation Act, 1961, and no account of Section 22 of the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1963. This is a matter on which the National Chamber of Trade and the National Farmers' Union have expressed anxiety and strong feeling, and it particularly affects small shopkeepers on quarterly or weekly tenancies.<br/>
In the second place, there are two factors which operate. One is the risk of incurring costs in appealing to the Lands Tribunal, which deters many small property owners from appealing and coerces them into knuckling under and accepting the acquiring authority's valuer's offer.<br/>
The other factor is the need for the small occupier to conclude the transaction swiftly so that he can collect the cash and buy himself another home, because he cannot finance the delay of an appeal. So I am afraid that the existence of the Lands Tribunal is not the complete answer by any means to the anxieties of the victims of compulsory acquisition.<br/>
So much for the argument. I will now summarise the grounds on which it is based. First, we have the testimony of the hon. Lady the Member for Peckham (Mrs. Corbet), which appears in column 283 of HANSARD of 20th February, 1962. She referred to a "large staff of valuers,

who acquire land for the use of the council, who negotiate to get the best terms &#x2026; in the council's interests", and she confirmed that philosophy almost at once, after an interruption from me, with the words:
<q>the valuers should get the best terms they can".&#x2014;[OFFICIAL. REPORT, 20th February, 1962; Vol. 654, c. 283.]</q>
That was the hon. Lady's view, and that is the considered view of a responsible leader of the authority which actually employs the valuers. That, therefore, must be the duty laid upon them, as they see it.<br/>
Secondly, I will further quote from the decision of Mr. J. P. C. Done, a Fellow of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, of the Lands Tribunal, in the case before him of Ansaldi <i>v</i>. the Stoke-on-Trent Corporation, 1960, reported in 12 P. &amp; C.R., page 220, in which Mr. Done said of the local valuer:
<q>During the cross-examination &#x2026; he admitted that his valuations were the basis of negotiations. &#x2026; It was implied that he was bargaining, not valuing. It is desirable to distinguish his function from that of a district valuer who is an independent official whose duty is to assess value and advise, and try to conclude, a settlement at that figure.</q>
Mr. Done went on to say that the local authority valuer:
<q>acts as</q>
the local authority's
<q>agent and he reflects the obligations of his principals to ensure that the ratepayers acquire property as cheaply as is reasonably possible".</q>
Thirdly, still as to authority for the argument, let the House look at the decisions of the Lands Tribunal itself in appeals against the London County Council. Between 1951 and 1960 the <i>Estate Gazette Digest of Cases</i> reports 22 cases against the London County Council. In only four of those cases was the decision in favour of the acquiring authority; in two cases the costs were split; and there were 12 cases in which a straightforward comparison of prices can be made between the authority's final offer and the Lands Tribunal award. In the aggregate these 12 cases accounted for sums totalling &#x00A3;109,517, and the sums awarded totalled &#x00A3;192,267. In other words, when the authority's offers as assessed by its employees were put to an impartial test before the Lands Tribunal they had to


be increased on average by about 80 per cent.<br/>
Fourthly, the House might be interested to consider this example, which I have taken from the books of one estate agent&#x2014;</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1964-07-09a.695.0" hansard_membership_id="12203" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20698" speakername="Mr. Arthur Skeffington" colnum="695" time="">
<p>To make the picture clear, would the hon. Gentleman give the figure of the actual amounts claimed? He has given only the amount offered by the council and the amount actually given by the Lands Tribunal. The other figure would be helpful to the House.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1964-07-09a.695.1" hansard_membership_id="6548" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/16537" speakername="Mr. Iremonger" colnum="695" time="">
<p>I have not got the figure. I have merely extracted these figures. The House will recognise that as the victim of the compulsory purchase is bargaining with someone who is the employee of the compulsory purchaser, he probably starts as far above what he hopes to get as he thinks the compulsory acquirer is starting below what might be considered fair.<br/>
I was saying that the House might be interested to consider an example taken from the books of one estate agent, who is a member of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. Over a range of 18 consecutive cases of his which I examined, the aggregate initial offers by the acquiring authority totalled &#x00A3;15,782. The final prices conceded totalled &#x00A3;17,945, and that represents an increase of about 12&#x00BD; per cent. on average. One might say that as this is. frankly, negotiating and bargaining and not an impartial assessment, that was fair enough, and that divergence was what one would expect in negotiation.<br/>
But in six of the negotiated cases the negotiations took over a year, in four they took over two years, and in one case they took nearly three years. In the six cases in which the negotiations took over a year, the average increase was about 72 per cent. compared with the 12&#x00BD; per cent. overall. So it is obviously a very important factor in getting a fair price whether the victim of a compulsory purchase order, who is often in humble circumstances, can afford to wait and hold on while his representative holds out and negotiates further with the acquiring authority's employed valuer.<br/>
So much for the principle, for the broad lines of the argument and for the grounds upon which the Clause is based. When all is said and done, however, the most disturbing element, to my mind, is the undermining of public confidence which this situation of a local authority quote a remarkable document which came to me unsolicited from a Fellow Surveyors who is the head of a highly-of the Royal Institution of Chartered regarded and old-established firm of chartered surveyors.<br/>
being judge in its own case is bound to engender. It is on this specific point of public mistrust that I now want to<br/>
Before I quote his words, which I find very disturbing, I want to say something&#x2014;with all sincerity. And I know that in this, if in nothing else, I shall carry the House with me. It is vitally important, in recognising public mistrust of the system and the policy for which we are ultimately responsible, that there should be no possible imputation against the personal and professional integrity of the unfortunate individual officials who are placed by public policy in this invidious position. If they are mistrusted, as it would seem that they are, it is the fault of the system, and the system is the fault of us in this House. With that supremely important reservation, I will now read the letter.<br/>
My correspondent says:
<q>I was intensely interested to read in one of the journals</q>
it was the <i>Real Estate Journal</i>
<q>that you had called attention to the London County Council's methods of valuation of compulsorily acquired property.</q>
That was a reference to col. 1788 of HANSARD of 20th March this year.
<q>I have had a very long experience and was</q>
I will not give the details of this gentleman's career for reasons which, unhappily, will be obvious to the House "and my father was the surveyor for" a big public institution "for fifteen years."<br/>
The experience of my correspondent runs back to the year 1910. He goes on to say:
<q>I have always said&#x2014;why is it possible to settle with the District Valuer and never with the L.C.C. without unpleasantness and a tremendous fight. In fact, I have called the


County Hall 'the den of the Forty Thieves'. When I acted for</q>
a certain company which my correspondent names
<q>over the acquisition of</q>
a certain estate which he names
<q>I had to fight to obtain the after-damage value on the sites where the houses were bombed. After the last interview I had with them, two valuers came to see me and I asked them whether it was not a case of now hunting in pairs&#x0021; After a great scrap I managed to obtain what I considered to be my clients' just deserts and a few days afterwards one of the valuers, who had called to see me, came and asked if I could offer him a job as he was disgusted with the whole set-up. I am now engaged in fighting them over the widening of</q>
a certain road which he mentions
<q>where they are taking</q>
so many feet
<q>off the front of a block of fiats belonging to</q>
his clients' company
<q>and they are trying to maintain that the front land is practically valueless because my clients cannot build on it&#x0021; &#x0021; I have come to the conclusion that all the affairs of the County Hall are governed entirely by politics and the word 'justice' simply does not exist. I simply cannot understand why it is necessary for the L.C.C. to have their own Valuation Department when the whole of their area is already covered by the District Valuers.</q>
In quoting that view, perhaps I should say again that it is not the view of an irresponsible crank with some small petty grievance. It is the view of a professional man who has been engaged in this business for 50 years, and his father before him, and it is a view commonly held among professional people who have had experience in dealing with district valuers and with the London County Council valuers, too. These people do not complain in public because they fear that the London County Council&#x2014;they have often told me this when I have discussed it with them&#x2014;would take it out on them in various ways and their livelihood would suffer&#x2014;</p>

<p>I am glad that my hon. Friend supports me. He and I know that this is the view expressed by estate agents. They say, "We wish you could do something about it. We can-

not come out in public about it because we have to negotiate with these people in the interests of our clients and our business would suffer". They trust the district valuer, and they distrust the county council's valuer. They find the district valuer expeditious, fair and courteous; they find the London County Council valuer, shall I say, less so.<br/>
In view of what my correspondent says, I submit to the House that it would be irresponsible to give a fair wind to this Bill without recognising a proper anxiety on the score of the evident public mistrust of the system which, in passing the Bill, we are condoning.<br/>
In the meantime, in the context of this Bill it is only fair to consider the statement circulated to hon. Members on behalf of the promoters of the Bill. I am struck at once by paragraph 7 of the statement, which reads:
<q>The question of the valuation of property compulsorily acquired by local authorities has already been debated by the House of Commons in the present Session &#x2026;".</q>
Reference is then given to my speech on the Consolidated Fund (No. 2) Bill:
<q>when it was raised by Mr. Iremonger on the Third Reading of the Consolidated Fund (No. 2) Bill.</q>
That is perfectly true, as I have indicated. But if the House is meant to infer from this observation by the promoters that the promoters have heard quite enough of this and would be glad if the House of Commons would kindly lay off the subject and shut up, then I think the House would like to say this to the promoters: "You may have your own methods of and your own pressures for making people desist from criticism which you find inconvenient or embarrassing outside this House, but they do not reach beyond the Bar of this House. The subject certainly 'has already been debated by the House', as you observe, and it will be debated again and again, as long as any hon. Member feels that there is something wrong here which ought to be put right." That is the answer that this House should give to the clear innuendo in paragraph 7 of the Memorandum.<br/>
But that is by the way. The main point in the statement is that the L.C.C. should not be deprived of the benefits of being


judge in its own case while other mammoth local authorities are to be allowed to get away with it. Put another way, this is the argument deployed by the waiter, in the limerick, to the old man of Peru,
<q>Who found a dead mouse in his stew.</q>
<q>Said the waiter, 'Don't shout</q>
<q>Or wave it about,</q>
<q>Or the others will all want one too&#x0021;'.</q>
It may well be that this practice of t local authorities being judges in their own cases should be stopped forthwith. It may well be that we should bring them all into better ways. I can only speak as I find. I have no experience of mistrust or otherwise of other local authorities&#x2014;apart from the L.C.C.&#x2014;which act as judges in their own cases. They may or may not be mistrusted.<br/>
However that may be, I do not see why the L.C.C. should seek shelter under the umbrella of other local authorities which may be less mistrusted. But if the House is really moved by this plaint on the part of the promoters of the Bill to the effect that others are getting away with it, then perhaps I and my hon. Friends who support this new Clause may introduce a Bill&#x2014;which I am sure the promoters would wish to support&#x2014;to apply the principle of this Clause to every local authority in England, Wales and Scotland.<br/>
In any case I am not impressed by the objection&#x2014;that other local authorities are doing it&#x2014;to the Clause which I invite the House to accept.<br/>
I shall not necessarily press this question to a Division if the promoters' apologists plead for leniency in the matter, although the system has to go some time and, like a rotten tooth, the sooner it is out the better. But I do hope that the House will take seriously the warning I have given about public mistrust and the very dramatic and authoritative evidence of that mistrust felt by my courageous correspondent, whose letter&#x2014;I emphasise&#x2014;to me was entirely unsolicited. And I hope that the House will at least take this one modest step towards the maintenance of the good name of public administration.<br/>
For these reasons, I ask the House to accept the new Clause.</p>

<p>I rise to oppose the Clause. It is misconceived in its purpose. The method which the hon. Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Iremonger) has adopted is quite inappropriate for changing the general law. If the Clause were carried it would apply only to one local authority and even then to a very limited part of that local authority's public acquisition of land. For all these reasons the Clause is, I repeat, entirely misconceived.<br/>
I am merely astonished that the hon. Member should go on pursuing what seems to be a kind of vendetta against the valuers of the London County Council. The time of this House might be better spent in some other way. The evidence he has produced is almost entirely that which he produced in March and a great deal of it, as I shall hope to show, is not absolutely accurate.</p>

<p>I do not intend to give way every other minute to the hon. Gentleman. If he has a valid point, I will see that he has an opportunity to make it.<br/>
This annual Measure&#x2014;the London County Council (General Powers) Bill&#x2014;contains provisions for the public acquisition of land in connection with some important road works. That is the only matter which would be affected by


the Clause. It is inappropriate, even if there is substance in the hon. Member's general case&#x2014;I suggest that there is none&#x2014;to use a Private Bill of this kind to try to effect a general alteration of compensation law in respect of one authority for a very limited type of land acquisition.<br/>
The hon. Member kept on saying that the L.C.C. attempts to be judge and jury in its own case. In fact, the L.C.C. and every other local authority acquire land only in accordance with the provisions, particularly Section 1, of the Land Compensation Act, 1961. I am quite certain that, if there were any suggestion that the L.C.C had not scrupulously followed the law of the land, this would have been taken either to the courts or to the Lands Tribunal. But there is no suggestion that in any case the L.C.C. has been anything but scrupulous it its attitude.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman perhaps does not know&#x2014;if he does not I excuse him for not mentioning it but he nevertheless should know, and if he does know it is an unfortunate suppression&#x2014;that, in fact, the L.C.C. itself consults the district valuer in respect of a large number of its acquisitions. Yet, since it has a separate Money Bill every year the L.C.C. has not the same obligation, as the Joint Parliamentary Secretary pointed out in March, that is imposed on every other local authority to consult the district valuer. Nevertheless it does so. In these cases it approaches the district valuer to find out what value he puts upon the land. Those who think that the L.C.C. does not bring the district valuer in are not aware of the facts. But the hon. Gentleman should have known and recognised them. But of course it greatly weakens his case.<br/>
But the whole case that the L.C.C. is some powerful organisation crushing the little landowner, who is always assumed to be defenceless and without resources&#x2014;that may be so in some cases&#x2014;falls to the ground when it is known that the L.C.C. always advises those with whom it is treating to employ for themselves properly qualified valuers and, what is more important, pays the fees of those valuers. That is a complete answer to his suggestion that powerless individuals are having to combat the mighty L.C.C. The fact is that the L.C.C. goes out of its way to see that those with whom

it is deaing have the best independent advice freely given and for which the L.C.C. pays. This is stated on every notice to treat. That destroys the whole of the hon. Member's argument.<br/>
The hon. Member again referred, as he did in the debate in March, to cases which had appeared in the <i>Estates Gazette</i>. He said there were 22 cases listed between 1951 and 1960 and that in only four cases in which these matters were submitted to the Lands Tribunal was the award of the L.C.C. upheld. That statement was wrong. In seven cases the L.C.C.s figures were either upheld or actually reduced. But he did not give the figure for which I asked him in our March debate because that would throw into relief the fact that the total claims of these 22 cases made on behalf of these individual landowners were as high as &#x00A3;947,000. The L.C.C.'s offer was &#x00A3;139,000 in the 22 cases and the Tribunal's final awards totalled &#x00A3;180,000. So the difference between what the L.C.C. offered and what the Tribunal finally settled was very small. But the amounts claimed were quite astronomic.<br/>
There have been a number of other cases of which, apparently, the hon. Member is not aware. Other cases went to the Tribunal between 1951 and 1963 and in every one the Council was upheld by the Lands Tribunal and to the extent that in three cases that the Lands Tribunal actually awarded less than the County Council had offered. This accords very ill with the picture of a crushing machine trying to get the land for the least possible payment.<br/>
Perhaps he does not have better ammunition, but I do not know why the hon. Gentleman keeps referring only to ancient cases. I could give him many more which have occurred since 1960. Ten cases have been brought to my attention since then which were referred to the Lands Tribunal. In only one did the Tribunal award the same amount which was offered by the County Council and in seven out of the other nine cases, the amounts awarded were less than the County Council had offered. In the claims during the period from 1952 to 1964 the total amount claimed by owners came to more than &#x00A3;1 million, the Council offered just less than &#x00A3;200,000 and the Tribunal awarded &#x00A3;237,000. On that volume of cases that is a very


accurate valuation, supported by an outside independent tribunal with but slight variation. It makes complete nonsense of the hon. Gentleman's argument.<br/>
I therefore hope that we can dispose of the suggestion that the County Council in these cases has acted unreasonably in the amounts offered, or in the way in which the amounts have been negotiated. If the picture is as bad as the hon. Gentleman has suggested, it is extraordinary that there has never been any suggestion of duress in the counties of Middlesex, Surrey and Gloucester or the county boroughs of Birmingham, Plymouth, Bristol and Brighton, and the City of London&#x2014;which, I am sure, is very dear to the hon. Gentleman&#x2014;which all employ precisely the same method as London County Council.<br/>
In his very full and comprehensive reply on 19th March, the Parliamentary Secretary said:
<q>I do not think it either fair or accurate to dub this particular procedure"&#x2014;</q>
that is the employment of qualified valuers&#x2014;
<q>as the local authority or anyone else acting as a judge in his own case because the district valuer is no more of a judge in this case in the sense that he is an independent arbitrator than any other valuer which a local authority might employ &#x2026; I should want a great deal more evidence from records of cases to be convinced that the London County Council valuers are overruled more often than district valuers or any other form of valuer."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 19th March, 1964; Vol. 691, c. 1799&#x2013;1800.]</q>
From the information which I have quoted&#x2014;and the list is comprehensive and nothing has been consciously left out&#x2014;it will be seen that the sums offered by the Council were supported by the Tribunal, or when they were reduced, the difference between the two figures was very small indeed.<br/>
In view of all that, and as the hon. Member has had a run for his money, now that we know that there is nothing whatever in his allegations, on the figures, the number of cases, or on the methods employed, and as he did not tell the House that the London County Council does consult the district valuer about the price, and in view of the far more important fact that the London County Council advises every applicant with whom it negotiates to equip himself

with a qualified valuer, whose fees are paid by the Council, we can dispose of the story of the luckless and defenceless individual fighting this huge L.C.C. machine. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel that he has achieved whatever purpose he has had in mind and will now have the decency to withdraw the Clause.</p>

<p>I do not want to repeat all that I said in the earlier debate on this subject, but I remind the House that the general position is that all local authorities are free to employ anyone they like to negotiate the price of land which they are about to acquire, whether by agreement or compulsorily. There is a minor exception to that in that it is laid down in the New Towns Act that a district valuer is to be employed, but even here it is not for the same sort of consideration which has impelled many local authorities to employ a district valuer. It is because a district valuer's certificate is important for loan sanction to ordinary local authorities and to new towns for the financial support from the Treasury on which the finance of new town corporations is based.<br/>
I agree with the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (Mr. Skeffington) that, whatever the merits or demerits of the new Clause, it would be wrong to legislate in a Bill of this sort not only against one local authority, but in respect of one set of acquisitions, which are very limited compared with the enormous number of negotiations about land which a body of the size of the L.C.C. has to contemplate every year.<br/>
On the other hand, I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman when he says that my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Iremonger) has no right to bring forward this argument on the Bill. If he strongly feels that something is wrong, my hon. Friend has every right to bring up the matter in this way. But this is not the right way to legislate, even if I accepted all his strictures against the London County Council valuers.<br/>
As I tried to explain in the previous debate, the London County Council is not a judge in its own case. This is basically a question of negotiation. No one


would claim that valuation was a sufficiently exact science for anybody to be able to say, "This is the value of plot A". I am sure that these very distinguished and devoted people who serve the district valuers' departments would be the last people to make that claim. There is always an element of negotiation and there are bound to be differences of view and, if the appeal procedure to the Lands Tribunal is to mean anything, there are bound to be occasions when the Tribunal will disagree with the party acting for the acquiring authority.<br/>
My hon. Friend has not added anything to the evidence which he produced before. So far as I recollect, the 18 cases which he quoted then are those which he has quoted today. The hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington has quoted a number of others. I admit that I did not take down the figures and I shall read them with interest in the morning. However, there is no great evidence that the Lands Tribunal consistently finds that the L.C.C. valuers are under-estimating values and forcing people to go to the Tribunal in order to get a fair deal.</p>

<p>The figures are the other way.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1964-07-09a.705.1" hansard_membership_id="2831" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/13641" speakername="Mr. Corfield" colnum="705" time="">
<p>As I said, I did not take down the figures, but I will accept the hon. Gentleman's word for what they prove, in so far as figures prove anything.<br/>
To be frank, it is not right for a big authority which is acquiring land under compulsory powers to regard its own valuers' functions as primarily to do the best they can for the authority. There may be occasions when there are very large deals, which would probably go to the Tribunal anyhow owing to the wide difference between the two parties, when that might be a legitimate attitude. But I have sympathy with my hon. Friend on the score that there are many small people involved and one wants to ensure that they are not forced to the extra expense and anxiety of an appeal to the Lands Tribunal.<br/>
However, it is only fair to underline what the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington said&#x2014;that the L.C.C. pays the fees of independent valuers and goes out of its way to advise people to employ them. It is not right to conclude, as

my hon. Friend has done, that the L.C.C. valuers are particularly hard-hearted as valuers go, or that the London County Council is. There is no evidence that the L.C.C. is taking undue advantage of the opportunities which inevitably arise from compulsory powers.<br/>
I hope that my view that it is not the intention, particularly when dealing with smaller claims, to do the best for the authority, but rather to find a fair price, will be heeded if it should be the case that another attitude is taken. It is certainly the attitude of the district valuers that their function is to find the fair price and not to negotiate the best price. I think that this is the right attitude, and I hope that it will always be the attitude of any valuer employed by a public body, and especially one of the importance of the L.C.C.<br/>
I do not think that the case has been made out for special legislation against the L.C.C. crossing the whole of the general law, which is that local authorities are free to employ their own employees. As long as they adhere to the law as laid down in the Land Compensation Act&#x2014;and if they do not they will soon be put right in the courts&#x2014;this seems to be something with which we should not interfere, bearing in mind that as a matter of pure administration if district valuers were required to take over this task in London, the only alternative would be to employ the same men enrolled in the district valuer's corps, or staff, or whatever it is called.<br/>
I do not think that this would be a practical proposition, but my main reason for advising the House to vote against the new Clause is that I do not think the case has been made out. Even if I did, I do not think that this would be the appropriate way of altering the law which I would have thought should be applied throughout the whole country and with effect to all public bodies concerned.</p>

<p>I was glad to hear the Minister give the advice which he did, and I would not have risen to speak but for what he said about a statement that I made. Perhaps I made it rather quickly and without the clarification which should have attended it. namely, that the valuation department of


the London County Council secures the best price that it can. I should, perhaps, have clarified my statement at the time, and I do so now by saying that it acts in accordance with the requirements of the law which imposes on it the duty to secure a fair market price, and also in accordance with the known wishes of the Council that a fair price should be paid, particularly to the smaller people.<br/>
As the hon. Gentleman said, valuation is not an exact science, as I know to my cost from recent experience in trying to buy a house. It is a matter of negotiation. Recently I wanted to acquire a house for a friend. A certain price was asked, and I had to toss up whether to pay the price or to risk losing the house by offering a lower sum. That is the kind of thing which happens between the parties concerned in matters of valuation.<br/>
I listened with care to the hon. Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Iremonger), and I was a little perturbed to think that there should be such delay, but the considerations which apply to whether a person should refer the case to a lands tribunal applies to the speed with which these negotiations are conducted. As the L.C.C. pays for a fully qualified chartered surveyor to advise the other party, it follows that that adviser, having found at some stage that he is not likely to get any further with the Council, may decide to refer the matter to the Lands Tribunal. If he does not do so, it is obvious that he feels that the Council can be pressed to go further, and obviously he himself has doubts about whether the Lands Tribunal will give a better price to his client.<br/>
I say these things to make it quite clear that the London County Council acts in a fair way, and is anxious to do so. I emphasise this by saying that that is the only known wish of the Council. Officers of the valuation department are professional officers, with their own private codes of which they are very proud, and it is not up to any member of the London County Council to tell them to depart from them.</p>

<p>In the absence of the hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Mr. Swingler) who was addressing us a little earlier, and of the hon. Member for Flint, East (Mrs. White), perhaps I might reply briefly to the points that they made.<br/>
I think that the hon. Lady will find that most of the points which she raised were covered in my opening speech in introducing the Regulations. Both the hon. Lady and the hon. Gentleman asked why we were bringing these Regulations forward now because they had read in the Trade Press that these pay television experiments were not likely to take place as early as had been thought hitherto. I assure the hon. Lady that my right hon. Friend the Postmaster-General will be issuing the first licence shortly, and that under that licence the operator will be free to start as soon as he gets the licence. My right hon. Friend has reason to suppose that the operator concerned is anxious to get started as soon as possible.<br/>
If we had delayed these Regulations until the new Parliament came into being, there would have been a big delay, and we would not have been able to get these experimental trials on pay television going very quickly. This is why we have brought forward these Regulations now.</p>

<p>I beg to move,
<q>That an humble Address be presented to Her Majesty, praying that the Severn River Authority Constitution Order 1964 (S.I., 1964, No. 896), dated 18th June, 1964, a copy of which was laid before this House on 19th June, be annulled.</q>
I can outline the background to this matter very shortly. It is quite simply that under the Water Resources Act, 1963, the Minister is empowered by Order to set up a water authority for relevant areas, and under this Order it is setting up one the Severn River Authority.<br/>
In that Order the Minister proposes that there shall be a board, called an authority, of 37 members of whom 19 shall be local authority representatives. Among those local authority representatives are individual representatives for a variety of counties and county boroughs but&#x2014;and this is the kernel of the matter&#x2014;for my constituency, the County Borough of Gloucester, and the constituency of the hon. Member for Worcester (Mr. Walker), whom I am glad to see in his place, it is proposed that there should be one representative jointly. Speaking on behalf of my own constituency, that is not regarded either as sensible or practicable. That is why I am praying against this Order, and I shall be more than interested to hear what the hon. Member for Worcester has to say about the same point.<br/>
If I may now, having explained the purpose of the Prayer very shortly, turn to the background, I would say that Gloucester is a very ancient city. It was a well-established town at the time of the new invasion by the Romans and has had historical incidents of fame ever since. It is known that the Normans

came there and that the Domesday Book was born there. It is known that Parliament sat there long before it sat in this place. In short, I can say that in historical times there has always been a Gloucester, and, of course, going further back to pre-historical times, there has always been a River Severn, and the two have always been connected.<br/>
Previously, Gloucester's interest in the River Severn was through the controlling authority, which was known in recent times as the Severn River Board. Gloucester City was a member of that Board, and now the Severn River Authority has taken over the functions of that Board. Broadly, it has now two major functions, those that relate to the Severn itself and its major tributary, the Avon, as one of the most important waterways in the country, and those that relate to the catchment areas. Gloucester is interested in both these functions. I mention this because certain of the represented local authorities are interested in only one or the other.<br/>
A large part of Gloucester's trade is channelled through the River Severn. Gloucester is the port health authority with responsibility extending as far as Sharpness Docks. There is a very important factory in Gloucester, Walls Ice Cream Factory, the largest ice-cream factory in Europe and for all I know the largest in the world, which, as everyone knows, produces the most excellent ice cream. It produces the most excellent ice cream because it relies on the most excellent water. Without the water there would not be any ice cream. The purity of the water is absolutely vital and millions of gallons are used by this factory. It is an essential function of Gloucester to control the supply of this water.<br/>
Gloucester is, of course, interested in the amenities of the river within its own boundaries and takes an active interest in the recreational use of the river beyond its own boundaries. I hope that I have made it clear that the interest of Gloucester in this river is vital and must be fully and adequately represented.<br/>
I now turn to the proposed form of representation. Under this new authority there is to be a council, a controlling body, of 37 of whom 19 are to be represented by local authorities, according to the simple basis of the product of a 1d.


rate. That is the formula adopted. Obviously, it does not work out precisely in each case to a precise number of members, and therefore common sense has to be used in deciding the number of members, having regard to the proportional size of the 1d. rate product. Accordingly, we find that common sense applies in a number of cases, but alas, not in all.<br/>
Coventry, for example, which according to this formula should have less than two and a half members, has three members, following the normal principle to which we are well accustomed in commerce, company law, and a whole variety of organisations of taking the next higher unit, where the formula produces less than a unit, because it has been found impossible to divide a man and still have him functioning adequately on a river authority. So Coventry, with less than two and a half on this formula, gets three members. Wolverhampton, with less than one on this formula, sensibly, gets one member. Montgomeryshire, with less than one-half on this formula, gets one member, but Gloucester with more than half and Worcester with more than half are, apparently, to get one member jointly&#x2014;one member between the two authorities&#x2014;which is out of keeping with the previous logic, with common sense, with history and with the functions which they have separately to perform. I cannot understand why on this one case alone&#x2014;and I want to make it clear that the Schedule shows without question that there is no other case of a joint representative&#x2014;the Minister felt compelled to have one joint representative. The Act does not so compel him. The Water Resources Act, 1963, states in Clause 7(2)
<q>The number &#x2026; shall be determined by the Ministers having regard to the appropriate 1d. rate product &#x2026;</q>
It could not be otherwise because we should have part of a man elected. I have already indicated the manner in which this has been interpreted by the Minister. It is not, therefore, necessary or legally compulsory to appoint one member jointly on behalf of these two ancient county boroughs.<br/>
I have already indicated that we have precedents galore for appointing one representative in cases where the

formula works out at something less, and that this has happened in a sufficient number of other cases in this very Order to indicate the kind of logic that is applied elsewhere and should be continued in the case of these two authorities.<br/>
I want to make it clear that this is not a question of a clash of personalities, or anything stupid at that level. These two counties work harmoniously on many occasions. I am reminded that they join together at the Three Choirs Festival&#x2014;the most ancient music festival in this country&#x2014;where they work and, I imagine, sing, harmoniously together. But this is not quite that sort of operation. It must be remembered that these two cities are about 28 miles apart, and their interests do not coincide. They have different interests, different geographical situations, different histories and different councils and committees of those councils which are interested in separate points related to the management of the river and the catchment area. It is essential that they should be each fully represented.<br/>
It is not possible to have adequate representation by one joint member. It is not a practicable method. I presume that the Minister has in mind that we might have one member appointed by Worcester for a three-year period and one appointed by Gloucester for the next three-year period. This would not be a satisfactory arrangement, because all the time we would have these committees meeting, wanting to refer and to give instructions and wanting to have their views represented on this authority&#x2014;committees closely concerned in matters of trade, amenity, culture and the rest. It is not satisfactory that there should be one representative.<br/>
I have already indicated that there is no reason why we should not have one representative each. It would mean that a council consisting of 37 members would become one consisting of 38. Nobody else has joint representation.</p>

<p>I should like to comment on that point in a moment. I cannot see any weight in the argument. Even if the number had to rise from 37 to 41&#x2014;which I do not accept&#x2014;that really should not tip the scales at all.

<p>If the Parliamentary Secretary is saying that he will not be put off by the fact that he will have to add four instead of one, I accept it as a valuable contribution to the debate. If, on the other hand, he is suggesting that this is a major argument against what I am saying I completely dissent from that proposition. I am accepting, for the purpose of the Order, that the Act must be interpreted in this way.<br/>
I would add that the Order does not include the original number of proposed appointments. There was a time when the number was two fewer. Representations were made on the basis that it would be more sensible and more in the interests of the authorities concerned and the working efficiency of the control authority itself&#x2014;the Severn River Authority&#x2014;if the number were increased by two. Accordingly, it was increased by two. There is no magic in the maximum of 37, or any other number.<br/>
We want a satisfactory river authority, and we believe that it can be satisfactory only if it has regard to those authorities which are deeply concerned. I repeat that Gloucester is deeply concerned, and has been for more than 2,000 years, as a city. It is deeply concerned in respect of its trade, amenities, culture and responsibilities. It is deeply concerned, also, in the lower reaches of this river.

According to present plans, local authorities on the upper reaches are well represented, as are those on the middle reaches, but on the lower reaches the representation is over-light.<br/>
It is for these reasons that I hope that the Minister will have second thoughts. It is less than sensible to be tied to a piece of arithmetic in order to keep down the number of representatives on a body to a preconceived figure which does not particularly contribute to its efficiency or anything else. Gloucester always has had separate representation on the authority controlling this river and it asks for that separate representation to be continued.</p>

<p>It is not often that I agree so enthusiastically with the hon. Member for Gloucester (Mr. Diamond) as I do this evening. The Order fails to take into consideration the real interests of the Cities of Gloucester and Worcester. I know some of the interests of Gloucester, having lived there for several years, and I also hope I know something about the City of Worcester, since I live there at present.<br/>
Both cities are closely associated with the River Severn. Gloucester and Worcester frequently co-operate in things like the Three Choirs Festival and the Three Counties Show, and occasionally they fiercely oppose each other, as on the cricket field. To suggest that there is any possible contact or unity in their representation on the river board is wrong.<br/>
Both cities have separate problems. I have never understood on what basis my right hon. Friend decided to suggest this joint representation. As the hon. Member for Gloucester pointed out, if we take the measure of the product of a 1d. rate and consider the representation of Montgomeryshire, it is clear that Gloucester and Worcester should have separate representation. Let us consider the representation of the county boroughs of Coventry and Wolverhampton. Those two counties are on the fringe of the area, with no direct contact with the river. The majority of the populations of those two cities have probably never seen the river. Yet they will each be represented on the river board, while the


two cities which are probably more concerned with the river than any other cities or county boroughs in the area will have to share representation.<br/>
A further surprising fact is that since the original recommendations were passed by the local authorities my right hon. Friend has agreed to increase the representation for local authorities. As I understand it, however, the increase in representation has been given to two authorities which were already represented upon the body&#x2014;and, indeed, already had two representatives each on the authority&#x2014;whereas the Cities of Worcester and Gloucester, both of whom have appealed for representation, have been left with the suggestion that they should have joint representation.<br/>
Many different problems have to be considered. About one-fifth of the area of the City of Worcester is subject to flooding from the river. We have a particular interest that this area of flooding should be reduced, if possible, and certainly not increased. Yet although there is this great problem of flooding, including the flooding of such vital places in the city as the cricket ground and the racecourse, the city at times will have no direct representation on the authority.<br/>
We have particular problems connected with the river basin. Part of our water supply depends on the river. Part of the city drainage is connected with it. We have a diversity of interests in the River Severn. I ask my hon. Friend also to consider the sort of bureaucracy that is involved in the two cities co-operating in this way. Does he suggest that we should now set up a joint committee so that all the diverse points affecting the two cities should be talked over and discussed before each meeting of the authority? This will involve a great deal of travelling on the part of officials and councillors in order that the one representative allowed for the two cities should be properly briefed.<br/>
What happens at meetings of the authority? What priority will the one representative give to what may perhaps be conflicting interests? At times there will be conflicting interests between the Cities of Worcester and Gloucester. If, by chance, the representative comes from Gloucester he may be biased in favour of

that city, and if he comes from Worcester he may be biased in the other direction.<br/>
It is not good enough to reply that in the event of extra representation being given to each of these cities other local authorities will demand representation on the same basis. There are no other local authorities which are as concerned in this river and which are as unrepresented as the Cities of Gloucester and Worcester. In order to avoid the bureaucracy that we shall create by this joint representation, and in order to see that these two historic cities, so closely associated with the river, are properly represented, I ask my hon. Friend to consider withdrawing the Order and revising it so that each city has separate representation.</p>

<p>Perhaps I might start by reminding the House of the provisions in the Act with regard to the situation of the river authorities. Hon. Members will recall that the Act provides that in the absence of special circumstances in the view of the two Ministers concerned, the membership of the river authority shall be a minimum of 21 members and a maximum of 31, with a provision that the local authority members shall always form a bare majority of one. The reason for that&#x2014;I am sure that hon. Members are fully aware of it&#x2014;was that the local authority representation is in recognition of the fact that they are the authorities on which the river authority will precept, and therefore they are finding the money.<br/>
The whole object of the constitution of these river authorities&#x2014;which was stated over and over again in the Second Reading debate and during the Committee stage and which received all-party support&#x2014;was that we should establish authorities&#x2014;not a collection of representatives of particular interests or local authorities but a body of people with the requisite knowledge and experience to form a corporate whole and able to carry out its functions. It was stressed then, and it is to be stressed over and over again, that even the members appointed by my right hon. Friends&#x2014;either the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food or the Minister of Housing and Local Government&#x2014;are not to be


appointed to represent fishing or drainage but to bring knowledge of these problems to the authority.</p>

<p>Is not the hon. Gentleman referring to the special representatives&#x2014;quite properly&#x2014;in contradistinction to the local authority representatives? The local authority representatives represent local authorities.</p>

<p>I am coming to the basis of it.<br/>
There were of course&#x2014;although I do not think we need spend long on this&#x2014;provisions that, in certain areas if there were special circumstances, additional members could be appointed by my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture or by my right hon. Friend the Minister of Transport where there were special navigational or harbour interests. In those cases the additional members were to be disregarded when determining for procedural purposes whether the river authority has more than 31 members. A membership above 31, excluding additional members, would necessitate coming to this House with an Order.<br/>
The principle on which my right hon. Friends have approached this problem is one on which&#x2014;although we appreciate the skill of the hon. Member for Gloucester (Mr. Diamond) with figures&#x2014;I think even the hon. Member would be challenged to find a better. It is to decide initially the number of Ministerial appointments which should be made to cover the interests of a particular river authority; bearing in mind, of course, that different river authorities will differ in their requirements. There may be more industry in some areas than in others; there may be more fishing rights in some than in others; or there may be more or complex agricultural and land drainage factors in some than in others, and so on. In many cases the importance of the water supply industry will vary. The provision of these special members, if I may so call them, is laid down in Section 6 of the Act. It is required that a representative, or rather a member with qualified knowledge, should appear on every river authority; though it is open to the Minister concerned to increase the number above one, in relation to the importance of the particular skill or

knowledge required in a river authority area.<br/>
These interests are listed as land drainage, fisheries and agriculture, appointments for which are the responsibility of the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and public water supply and industry other than agriculture which are the responsibility of my right hon. Friend. On the river authority of the Severn with which we are dealing&#x2014;the hon. Gentleman is quite right in saying that we have had, so to speak, two shots at this&#x2014;land drainage has four representatives&#x2014;I use the word "representatives" for convenience and I stress that the whole object is to build a corporate body with the requisite knowledge rather than a collection of delegates&#x2014;fisheries three; agriculture two; public water supply three; industry other than agriculture three and navigation one, which adds up to 16. This requires 17 local authority representatives to balance the body in the terms laid down in the Act.<br/>
These proposals were circulated to each of the various interests concerned and to the local authorities. I make no apology for the fact that we then endeavoured to meet some of the criticisms&#x2014;or as many as we felt we could&#x2014;as a result of consulting local authorities and various other organisations, including the Association of Drainage Authorities, the N.F.U., the F.B.I., the British Waterworks Association, the fisheries associations and so on. We increased the membership of the authority by one extra member for the public water supply, making four instead of three, and one extra for industry, which also made four instead of three; and thereby created a total of 18, all these Ministerially appointed members requiring 19 local authority members to balance them.<br/>
We therefore reached a situation in which, following the terms of the Act&#x2014;which the hon. Member for Gloucester correctly read out&#x2014;the Ministers, having regard to the product of a 1d. rate, should, so to speak, allocate the representatives of local authorities between the county councils on the one hand and the county boroughs on the other; bearing in mind the balance between the two types of authority, with the proviso in Section 7 clearly stating that in some cases the result may well be that a local


authority could have no representation because it would be well below the "half man", and in others it would be suitable to have a shared representation. It was clearly laid down in the Act that this was something which would be considered not only as an exception but as something to be taken into account.<br/>
Taking the figures from which we derive this apportionment&#x2014;I assure the hon. Member for Gloucester that they are according to my arithmetic and that of my officials which I have checked&#x2014;and taking the total of a 1d. rate product and dividing by the number of local authority representatives, we get the result that Coventry, for instance, has a figure of 2&#x00B7;696, and not something under 2&#x00B7;5. That is the reason why we went to the figure of three members, in the belief&#x2014;with which I hope the hon. Gentleman will agree&#x2014;that three is nearer to 2&#x00B7;696 than two.<br/>
In the case of Wolverhampton the figure is far from going below one. It comes to 1&#x00B7;02 and I think the hon. Gentleman would agree that obviously again we should have one member. The figure for Gloucester is 0&#x00B7;6 and for Worcester 0&#x00B7;5, making a total of 1&#x00B7;1. Therefore, it seemed sensible to suggest that these were two cities within the same type of authority&#x2014;both being county boroughs and both, incidentally, having had comments passed on that status by the Local Government Commission, although that is by the way&#x2014;and both happen to have approximately the same product of a 1d. rate. I fully appreciate that the hon. Member for Gloucester and my hon. Friend desire that these cities should have separate representation. That is a natural reaction, but I ask them to bear in mind that, though it may be true that in this particular river authority they are the only two local authorities required to share a representative, there are local authorities which have areas within the river authority area and are not represented at all.</p>

<p>Of course, one is bound to rely on what the Parliamentary Secretary says, but I have before me the copy of a letter dated 6th May addressed to his Department by the Town Clerk of Gloucester saying that for Coventry the figure is 2&#x00B7;41 and not the figure the Parliamentary Secretary gave and the figure

for Wolverhampton is 2&#x00B7;92 and not the figure he mentioned. I also have the copy of an answer dated 22nd May from his Department which does not controvert these figures in any sense. Although it deals with the question it does not deny the figures nor the argument.</p>

<p>I have seen those figures, but I am sure that the figures I have given are correct. I shall check this, but I think that the earlier figures were based on the proposals before the two extra people were added. The figures I have given have been checked and rechecked.<br/>
As the hon. Member and my hon. Friend have said, Gloucester and Worcester have long associations with the Severn. It would be surprising if they had not for they happen to have been built on its banks. I cannot go so far as to say that as Parliament once sat in Gloucester before it came here that is a reason for making this change. Parliament also sat in Acton Burnell, in Shropshire, but that does not give Shropshire an extra seat.</p>

<p>Not on that particular basis, although if my hon. Friend would like, I would consider adding one more, but perhaps that would be regarded as bias because it is my native county.<br/>
I think the proportion of the river authority's area which falls in Montgomery is 14 per cent. Although Montgomery has a low product of a 1d. rate, I am sure none of us would think it right to rule out the whole of the County of Montgomery. In spite of the fact that it is a watershed for a great deal of the rainfall, it would then have no say at all on any river authority. It is right that we should make an exception despite the fact that the actual 1d. rate product comes out at a little less than that of Gloucester.<br/>
I hope that the House would also agree that it would be quite wrong to cut out Montgomery from an authority of this sort. One has only to look at the map to see how much of the area is in the river authority area. Sticking rigidly to the 1d. rate product principle there we would be taking advantage of the fact that the Welsh Border counties are particularly low in rateable value, which


is not the case in Gloucester and Worcester. I think it is a right decision.<br/>
The hon. Member and my hon. Friend made the point that no two cities of this sort, despite the fact that they are both on the river, and that they take part in singing and go to agricultural shows together, could possibly work together on a river authority without being separately represented. I refer them to a very much older body, the Thames Conservancy, which has had members appointed by two joint groups and representing in one case six local authorities and in another five. That has worked extremely satisfactorily, so much so that the proposal to cut that representation met with particular opposition from the Conservancy.<br/>
Not having been closely associated with Worcester but with Gloucester&#x2014;perhaps longer than the hon. Member for Gloucester&#x2014;I cannot think that they would want to revive the wars of the past and regard the river authority as a sort of second round of the cricket match later in the season. I am sure that they will work perfectly well on this basis. If they do not, they will do a lot less well than the authority for the Thames has done for a great number of years.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Worcester mainly endorsed what the hon. Member for Gloucester said, but he particularised on the reliance of both these cities on the river for water supply and its importance in regard to drainage and so on. I remind both hon. Members that the whole concept of the Act is to ensure that these particular matters of water supply and drainage are represented by the Ministerially-appointed members because of their special knowledge in these matters, but not in relation to any particular local authority. The local authority members collectively represent the providers of the money.<br/>
This is the basis of the Act and I am sure it is the right way to go about it. It is bound to produce a number of cases where we have less than half a man, or less than one-and-a-half or two-and-a-half. The occasion arises where we can meet that difficulty by combining so to speak two half men, and this seems a sensible thing to do.<br/>
If we go further than that in this authority it would increase the number certainly by another local authority

member and therefore by another Ministerially-appointed member and we shall have the same sort of repercussions on a wider scale in river authority areas which happen to contain more and perhaps smaller local authorities. It is thus possible to get very large river authorities and one of the purposes of the Act was to avoid that. If we are to have an efficient executive, size beyond a certain limit is not conducive to efficiency. I am not suggesting that one extra here would do much damage but if we upset the proposed constitution we might well find that we might have to bring in one member for the County Borough of Dudley and even shoot up the Staffordshire representation from one or two.<br/>
There are these ramifications, and I believe we have achieved the right balance. I hope that the House will accept the Order. I can assure the hon. Member for Gloucester that the figures he quoted were those from the original distribution and not from the final distribution.</p>

<p>Never mind the figures which are under disagreement. By the figures under agreement, Montgomery has half or less than half, or in any case less than Worcester or Gloucester. If we accept the principle, which we all endorse, of common sense, how can we deny continuing representation to cities which have had representation on the previous authority which controlled the river?</p>

<p>The figure for Montgomery is &#x00B7;55, which is more than half, and only a fraction different from Gloucester. The hon. Member must accept that in setting up the river authorities many of them will deliberately be smaller in the number of people on them than the existing river boards. That is one of the purposes of the Act. That being so, it is not a valid argument to say that that because a city or county was represented on the previous board, it therefore should be on the authority. Had we accepted that, the Act would have been different. There are many provisions in the Act about constitutions but had we accepted that argument one of its main purposes&#x2014;to keep the number of people within reasonable limits&#x2014;would have been entirely defeated and we might as well have taken over the river boards as they were.</p>

<p>I welcome the opportunity of raising on the Adjournment this evening the practice of the Metropolitan Police in supplying information and fingerprints regarding convicted persons. While I want to raise the general question, I am led to do so by a particular constituency case which was recently brought to my notice, and necessarily I shall have a good deal to say about that case in order to illustrate how unsatisfactorily, as it appears to me, existing arrangements in this matter are. I do not want to mention the name and address of my constituent as, in the circumstances of the case, it will be clear to the House as I develop my argument that it would be unfair to the individual that I should do so. But I have supplied my hon. Friend with all the particulars about the case. He knows the name of the individual to whose case I am referring, and I think that is sufficient for the purpose of this debate.<br/>
The case which I am particularly raising relates to a constituent of mine, or perhaps I should say a former constituent of mine, because about two years ago he removed out of Wimbledon and emigrated to Australia. But prior to his removal he had lived in Wimbledon for about 29 years. I do not think that I can tell his story better than by reading in a slightly abbreviated form a letter which he has written to me from Australia. This is what my constituent writes:
<q>Having been a resident of Wimbledon for the past 29 years, and also run a business there, I feel that I have been the victim of a gross injustice, and should like your comments. About two years ago I migrated with my wife and son to Australia. Having had my capital considerably reduced in various ways, I applied for many jobs, eventually being promised a situation in an estate agent's office, subject to my applying to the New South Wales Police for permission to work there. You can imagine my surprise and disgust when a police officer called at my home last week and produced a photostat copy of my fingerprints and details of an offence I committed in England in 1927. All this had been supplied to him by the Records Depart-

ment of Scotland Yard. He also informed me that I would not be allowed to take the job as an estate agent's salesman. As I have committed no crime in Australia and have run a business in Wimbledon for the past 29 years, I cannot see why the British police should take the trouble to chase me around the world with details of something that I did as a young man over 37 years ago. If it is any satisfaction to Scotland Yard, they have succeeded in preventing a British subject from obtaining employment. As you probably know, there are many thousands of Poles, Dutch and Yugoslavs and other Europeans against whom no records are available. Therefore this is discriminating against a British subject with the co-operation of the British Government.</q>
<q>In conclusion, I was under the impression that, unless I committed a further offence, my previous misdemeanours would not be brought against me for any reason. If you wish to verify the truth of my statement you may check with New Scotland Yard and the New South Wales Police at the Court of Petty Sessions, Paddington, Sydney, New South Wales. I would like to add that, following the police sergeant's call upon me, I wrote to the police, as I was so annoyed, and withdrew my application, although I had already been told I could not take the position.</q>
I am tempted to say, what a tragic and shocking case of man's inhumanity to man.<br/>
It appears that in New South Wales, and it may be in other parts of Australia as well, in order to be employed in an estate agency business a man or woman needs a licence from the police authority, and it was in this connection that this tragic experience of my constituent arose. I hold the view very definitely, and I think that this will be shared by other hon. Members and the public, that when once a man has paid the penalty of his wrong-doing&#x2014;and that penalty may properly be a severe one if the offence is a serious one&#x2014;the slate should be wiped clean and he should not be interfered with in seeking to resume his life and to undertake in future an honest and law-abiding career.<br/>
I anticipate from the correspondence which I have had on this matter that, among possibly others, there are three points which will be made in defence of what Scotland Yard did in this case. As I shall have no further opportunity of speaking, perhaps I may briefly mention those three matters and make my comments upon them. First, I think that it may be said that the outrageous treatment of my constituent is the responsibility and should be laid at the door of


the New South Wales police and that it cannot be properly laid at the door of the Metropolitan Police in London.<br/>
We in this House, of course, have no control over the police in New South Wales, although I am bound to say that on such information as we have about this case I consider that they have behaved in this matter with a singular disregard for the position of my constituent, and in a way which was bound to involve him in the utmost ignominy and embarrassment in the new country in which he has taken up his residence. But it is not sufficient to say that the fault in this case lies at the door of the New South Wales police, because they could not have taken the action that they did had they not been supplied with the information by New Scotland Yard, and it is the fact of that information having been supplied that I complain of so strongly this evening.<br/>
The second point which, I think, may be made is that when my constituent was refused an estate agent's licence for the reason I have mentioned that was not necessarily the end of the matter because, under the law of New South Wales, he had a right of appeal to a magistrate. This right of appeal he did not exercise. It was, of course, a matter for his own judgment and decision, and I have some sympathy with him in not pursuing the matter further. I have no evidence as to whether, if he had appealed, the appeal would have been heard in a public court in which the matter would have been gone into in public, possibly being reported in the newspapers in the town in which he was living. If this were so, one could very well understand his reluctance to appeal and give further publicity to the circumstances of his conviction by the British courts. One can sympathise with him in dropping the matter at that stage.<br/>
The third point which may be made is that this information was, so I understand, supplied by New Scotland Yard to the New South Wales police in pursuance of certain international arrangements which exist between the police in this country and police forces in many other parts of the world and according to which there is an agreement that information of this kind shall be exchanged. If, under such an agreement, New Scotland Yard was under an obligation, legal or moral, to supply the infor-

mation, then, I agree, New Scotland Yard would have been in difficulty in withholding it. But, if this be the case, I submit that the form of the present arrangement among police forces in different parts of the world is unsatisfactory in imposing that kind of obligation about the supply of information and such agreements should be revised and modified.<br/>
I am raising this matter tonight not because anything can be done at this stage to cure the harm which has been done to my constituent in his desire to live at peace and in honour in a new country and to obtain employment there, but because I am most anxious that something should be done by my hon. Friend at the Home Office to ensure that other cases of this kind do not arise in the future and that other citizens of this country elsewhere in the world do not run the risk of receiving similar treatment.<br/>
Let me briefly summarise the position of my constituent in this matter. It is not disputed that, 37 years ago, he was in trouble with the police. I understand that it may be said that he was guilty at that time of several offences, and I am willing to believe that those offences may have been serious. I understand that my constituent does not suggest that he was improperly convicted, and I do not think that he makes any complaint about the sentence imposed upon him. But what he does say&#x2014;and he has my complete sympathy and support in it&#x2014;is that this all happened when he was a young man, 37 years ago, and that, having paid the penalty which the law imposed upon him for his wrongdoing as a young man, he has for 37 years lived an honourable life.<br/>
He has carried on business of his own, a business which, I feel quite certain, was conducted satisfactorily and honestly. It really is too bad that, 37 years later, he should be put in the position of having all this raked up against him, and that another country on the other side of the world should have his fingerprints produced and the particulars of his conviction disclosed to the police who can have no possible interest in what happened so long before It really means that however long a convicted man may live, and however far away from the scene of his crime may go, he can never


escape from the possibility of the facts of his offence being made known.<br/>
It is almost impossible to imagine a case in which the justification for supplying the information would be more inadequate than in this case. In point of time, 37 years have elapsed since the conviction of this unfortunate man. In point of distance, he has gone as far away from this country as he can, and is now resident thousands of miles away, in Australia&#x2014;on the other side of the world. But, he having gone straight for 37 years, the record of a youthful offence is dragged up against him at the instance of the police at New Scotland Yard and he is deprived of the opportunity of obtaining employment, with possibly disastrous consequences to himself and to his family.<br/>
I just cannot believe that the repercussions of this matter were in any way thought out by the person at New Scotland Yard who supplied this information. Anyone with any degree of humanity and fellow feeling at all would have realised how tragically unfair it would be in those circumstances to supply information to the police in Australia.<br/>
As I say, I am not concerned so much about this case, because the harm in this case is now past curing, but I am concerned that this should not happen again in other cases. I have always denied the truth of the charge sometimes brought against the police by persons who have been convicted that the police will never give them a chance of living an honest life after they have once been convicted and sent to prison. I should not like to think that this charge is true, but a case like this certainly lends strength to the feeling on the part of convicted people that they do not get fair treatment when they have paid the penalty of their wrongdoing; but that, however long they may live and however far away they may go, there is always the risk of a youthful offence being dragged out against them to their detriment. I hope that my hon. Friend may be able to give an assurance that he will look into the matter, and that steps will be taken to see that such a case as this will never occur again.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the

Member for Wimbledon (Sir C. Black) has raised a question of general concern, and has focussed his remarks particularly on a case in which it is impossible not to have some degree of sympathy. He has outlined the facts put before him by his former constituent, and I know that he will not think that I am in any way seeking to cast doubt on any of the statements made in good faith by his former constituent if I take the opportunity of outlining the case as we see it in London. From that point of view, the facts are as follows.<br/>
The story begins as far as we are concerned in November, 1963, when a letter was received at the Criminal Record Office at New Scotland Yard from New South Wales police asking for information about a man who had applied for registration there as a real estate salesman and asking whether anything of an adverse nature was known against him. It is not in dispute that this was my hon. Friend's former constituent, but I will follow my hon. Friend's excellent example of mentioning no names.<br/>
We have ascertained that applications for registration as estate agents in Australia are governed by the Auctioneers, Stock and Station Real Estate and Business Agents Acts, 1941 to 1957, which were introduced for the purpose of preventing the exploitation of persons desiring to purchase land.<br/>
The Criminal Record Office search disclosed certain convictions&#x2014;more than one&#x2014;in 1927 resulting, in one case, in nine months' imprisonment. In accordance with the normal procedure, this information was passed to the New South Wales police who, we are told on the authority of my hon. Friend, then told the applicant that his criminal record would result in the failure of his application for a licence. It appears then that the man forthwith withdrew his application without waiting for the decision of the licensing authority, although, as my hon. Friend has fairly recognised, he was under no obligation to do that.<br/>
It may help in considering the circumstances of the case if I begin by outlining the general practice of the Metropolitan Police on the disclosure of information, including fingerprints, to other police forces. At this point, I


should, perhaps, emphasise that all I am about to say applies only to the interchange of information on a police-to-police basis, because that is the context in which my hon. Friend has raised the subject.<br/>
There is, first, the question of the degree of freedom with which information is exchanged. It is a fundamental principle of police procedure that information should be freely available between police forces, provided, of course, that a normal degree of mutual confidence exists between them. It is accepted by everyone concerned that the information so exchanged is required in connection with law enforcement and the prevention and detection of crime and that the freedom of such exchanges is essential to enable each police force to obtain reciprocal benefits from the others. In other words, the essence of the practice is mutual trust, which must exist between police forces if they are to secure one another's co-operation in carrying out their own jobs.<br/>
There is, therefore, no general restriction on the kind of information that may be exchanged between one police force and another, whether it be a home or an overseas force and whether or not it is a member of Interpol. The information exchanged can include criminal records as well as information about the results of criminal inquiries. Nor, when information about a man's ciriminal record is sought, is this provided on a selective basis. At least, that is to say, no distinction is made between major and minor crimes or between recent and old ones. This is an aspect of the existing system which my hon. Friend criticised.<br/>
It has, however, always been considered&#x2014;and I think that this is right&#x2014;that where information is exchanged between police forces on a basis of mutual trust, it is not for the police who provide the information to edit it before passing it on. It is properly a matter for the receiving force to decide what is relevant and what is not and how much weight to attach to any part of the record. I do not mean to suggest that the Commissioner pays no regard to the possible use to which information so provided might be put or that there may not be circumstances in which a

request might be refused or might be met only partially.<br/>
For example, it is one of the aims of Interpol to promote the widest possible mutual assistance between criminal police within the limits of the laws existing in the different countries, but only so long as this does not involve intervention in matters of a political, military, religious or racial character. As, however, my hon. Friend will recognise, these considerations do not arise in the present case, which concerns a matter of law enforcement.<br/>
The only circumstances in which old or trivial past convictions may become expunged from the record is in the weeding process which is carried out periodically within the Metropolitan Police records. I believe that my hon. Friend and the House will bear with me if I refrain from disclosing in detail the circumstances in which that process of weeding is carried out. But I can assure the House that the convictions in the case which my hon. Friend raised this evening did not fall within any of the categories subject to the weeding procedure which, generally speaking, relates only to minor offences.<br/>
My hon. Friend also raised the question whether it is fair that people with criminal records emigrating from this country should be more vulnerable than immigrants who go to Australia from other countries where such records are, for one reason or another, not available. It seems to me that questions of this kind cannot be primarily matters for the country which provides the information. They must be primarily a matter for the country which initiates the inquiry. In our own country the police can only be expected to observe the normal procedures which they have here.<br/>
The essence of the criticism in the case raised tonight is twofold&#x2014;first, that the Metropolitan Police should not have passed on information about convictions which occurred so long ago, and secondly, that the New South Wales police ought not to have regarded those convictions as justifying an objection to the grant of a licence nor ought they to have told the man concerned that such an objection would be lodged.<br/>
The first point concerns the length of time since the convictions occurred. It


is certainly true that the offences were committed a long time ago but, as I have said, it is the generally accepted practice that it is not for the police force which provides the information to decide what is likely to be relevant and what is not. The second point is one which touches on New South Wales legislation and the action of the New South Wales police. I am sure that my hon. Friend recognises that, however strongly he may feel on this matter in his constituent's interest, neither of these is a subject for which I have responsibility or indeed on which it would be proper for me to comment, except to say this: I am informed that the New South Wales police have a statutory duty to inquire into and to report upon the character of an applicant for a licence as a real estate agent in New South Wales.<br/>
Opinions may reasonably differ on the question what weight should be attached to any particular conviction in any particular case. But I must remind the House that the decision whether to grant a licence did not rest with the police and that according to my hon. Friend's constituent's own account, the man in question withdrew his application without waiting for the decision of the licensing authority or exercising his right of appeal.<br/>
My hon. Friend suggested, finally, that safeguards ought to be introduced to prevent such circumstances as arose in this case from occurring again. I hope that I have said enough to show that in providing the information in question the Metropolitan Police were acting properly in response to a legitimate request from an overseas police force. Nor for that matter, since the person concerned withdrew his application, have we any evidence one way or another, as my hon. Friend conceded, whether the disclosure of this information would or would not have resulted in his being prevented from setting up as an estate agent. In those circumstances, I could not accept that there was any abuse of the normal police-to-police procedure such as would justify an attempt to impose restrictions on the free exchange of information between police forces. But I should add that if any police force were found consistently to be using information that came on a police-to-police basis in a

manner or for purposes which the force providing the information considered improper, I have no doubt that the force which had been providing the information would consider very carefully indeed how far in future it ought to continue to meet such requests.<br/>
May I say that I agree that my hon. Friend has undoubtedly raised a problem of public importance, and he has presented it very persuasively from the point of view of the man concerned. I would only wish in conclusion to try to put the same problem from the point of view of the police. It seems unquestionably desirable that police forces should exchange information about criminal records provided that they have mutual confidence in each other. No one will dispute the propriety of such a relation between the Metropolitan Police and the State police of one of our most respected fellow members of the Commonwealth. Nor will anyone, I think, dispute that the Metropolitan Police must maintain adequate records of criminal activities even going back 40 years, since it is perfectly possible that these might be required by the courts of our own country.<br/>
What then has happened in this case? The New South Wales police made a perfectly proper inquiry which they were indeed obliged to make under their own law. It would have been quite wrong for the Metropolitan Police either to deny that they had that record of the man in question, which would have been a lie, or to attempt to conceal the character of the record. To have refused to answer the inquiry in these circumstances or to have answered it in deliberately evasive terms would have provoked suspicions at least as damaging as the truth itself. Under the present system the Metropolitan Police clearly had no alternative but to reply as they did.<br/>
My hon. Friend's criticisms can, therefore, only legitimately be directed either at the system itself or at the use made of the information by the New South Wales police, and he has, in fact, done both these things. So far as the system is concerned, it seems to me as a general proposition, as I have said, that it is indispensable, and I certainly cannot imagine that anyone concerned with law and order would wish to see it abolished


or even to see it selectively applied to the detriment of our colleagues in Australia.<br/>
So far as concerns the use in New South Wales of the information made available, I must repeat that it would be improper for me to comment on the conduct of the police in a country which, without understatement, I can describe as friendly, law-abiding and universally respected. But I should remind my hon. Friend again that it was for the court to decide in the last resort what weight to attach to the applicant's record and that his constituent did not, in fact, apparently wait to hear what the court would decide.<br/>
I hope I have said enough to make it clear that I am conscious that there is a real dilemma here. The particular case naturally commands sympathy, but I cannot accept that any impropriety was committed or that the Metropolitan Police are in any way open to criticism over what occurred.</p>

<p>I am obliged to you, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, for allowing me very briefly to raise another Home Office matter. I do so because, as the House will appreciate, this may be almost the last opportunity we shall have in the present Parliament of doing so, and because the matter is one of some urgency. I apologise to the Joint Under-Secretary for not having been able to give him notice in detail of what I was going to raise, and, naturally, I cannot expect a detailed reply from him; perhaps he will simply be good enough to say that he will look urgently into the matter.<br/>
I am concerned about one of the mail-train robbers whose appeals against sentence and conviction were dismissed in the Court of Criminal Appeal yesterday. One may remark in passing that these thirty-year sentences are an accurate reflection of the values of our society, since, if these men gain the maximum possible remission, they will be serving twice as long for an offence against property&#x2014;admittedly a very grave offence&#x2014;as is normally served by those who take human life.<br/>
The man concerned is Roy John James and the information I have about him comes to me from his fianc&#x00E9;e, who called to see me this afternoon: she is a young lady of obvious respectability and credibility. According to her, James has been undergoing very severe restrictions indeed on the privileges normally allowed to prisoners whose appeals are pending. He is, or was until today, in Brixton. His appeal visits have been restricted. He has been refused permission to communicate with his solicitors&#x2014;in startling contrast with the unique privilege accorded to Kenneth de Courcy, who had seventy-four whole days at his solicitor's office. But then, Mr. Roy John James is not a man of wealth and influence and is not a staunch supporter, like Mr. de Courcy, of the present Administration. However, let that pass.<br/>
James has also been denied the usual monthly visits. His fianc&#x00E9;e, who lives in Berwickshire, came to London yesterday in the expectation of being allowed to see him. She was told that she could not see him, but she did not know that he was in court. She waited at Brixton Prison for 3&#x00BD; hours, from 1.30 p.m. to 5 p.m., without anyone having the courtesy to tell her that he was in court and that she would not be able to see him that day.<br/>
Finally, and perhaps most important constitutionally to hon. Members, he has not been allowed to communicate with his Member of Parliament. I am not his M.P. I have tried to contact his Member this evening but, as will be appreciated, this is not an evening for an exceptionally full House. I felt, however, that I should bring this to the attention of the House and of the Home Office at once, because the last of these points in particular is one about which all hon. Members are particularly sensitive. I hope that the Joint Under-Secretary of State, by leave of the House, will say that he will look into this matter at once.</p>

<p>Ely leave of the House, I will reply briery. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Barking (Mr. Driberg) for making it clear that he was raising this matter without notice and that therefore it was impossible for me, in the circumstances, to give a detailed reply to the


points he has raised. But I will certainly communicate them as a matter of urgency to my right hon. Friend at the Department and I will undertake to ensure that the hon. Member receives an answer at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>

<p>No, Mr. Deputy-Speaker. I have given notice that I wish to raise the matter of the World Health Organisation. I gave due notice according to the Rules laid down some time ago and I understand that the Government Whip has notified the appropriate Minister. I understand that the Joint Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Health will reply.<br/>
Many of us look upon the W.H.O. and the idea of a world health research centre as being very important to the world. Tonight I want to deal with the possibility of establishing in this country the proposed research centre and to urge that it should be in Scotland, although I do not want to be accused of being parochial.<br/>
I appreciate as much as anyone how difficult it is to get all the members of the United Nations to agree not only about the establishment of a world health research centre, but on where it should be established. There are several agencies of the United Nations in Switzerland and there are others in France and the United States, but we do not seem to have any in Britain. I doubt whether the Government are pressing hard enough for the establishment of such a centre in this country.<br/>
There is some conflict among Ministers about the value of this concept. <i>The Lancet</i> reported Sir George Godber as saying that the establishment of a research centre should be based on a national health service and could not be established on a world basis. However, in answer to a Question in the House, the Prime Minister supported the idea of a world health research

centre. There seems to be a conflict of ideas among different members of the Government, from the Prime Minister down to the Secretary of State for Education and Science, and among the various agencies of the Government outside Parliament. The discussion has been going on for some time and no decision has yet been taken. No doubt this is because many governments, like our own, are equivocating about the desirability of the establishment of such a centre. However, in this respect Britain is unique, for we are part of a world-wide oceanic Commonwealth.<br/>
Much of that Commonwealth is poor and backward and much of it spreads across equatorial areas through climatic belts where many tropical diseases are common. In the last 100 years, much has been done by British medical research to fight diseases common to much of the British Commonwealth which runs through Central Africa, India, Malaysia, Australia the Caribbean and Northern South Amercia.<br/>
In London, there is now a meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers at which all sorts of questions are being discussed. A splendid contribution which the House of Commons can make&#x2014;it would be one of the great contributions of this Parliament&#x2014;would be to convince the Prime Ministers' Conference and the United Nations and its special agencies that we in Britain, particularly in Scotland, could establish a world health research centre to serve the British Commonwealth.<br/>
If we cannot get a world-wide decision, why should we not establish a regional health research centre serving the Commonwealth? Under the United Nations Charter, we are all striving for world order, world government and a world peace organisation, but as we cannot get that yet, we have to take the next best thing and have regional pacts and regional organisations. No one quarrels with that. We start with a small unit and build up, starting on the basis of the widest agreement. Why not start in this case with the Commonwealth and have a centre in this country serving the needs of all branches of medicine throughout the British Commonwealth.<br/>
This week Malawi, which was previously known as Nyasaland, celebrated


her independence in Blantyre. Nearly every institution in this country was developed by missionaries from Scotland. This country was discovered by Dr. Livingstone. The majority of its Christian establishments are derivatives of the Church of Scotland. The Scottish influence there is terrific. Malawi was once part of a federation which failed for reasons into which we need not inquire during this debate. The ties between this new nation state in Africa and the Scottish nation are the strongest that exist between a black nation and a white one, and anyone who visits that country soon learns that Scotland means something to the people there.<br/>
I am convinced that the establishment of a world health research centre would have a tremendous psychological effect on the nations of the Commonwealth, especially if that centre were in Scotland, because wherever one goes in the Commonwealth one discovers that the Scots are known as great medical and theological missionaries. Scots have played a tremendous part in the development of the Commonwealth. From New Zealand, right through to Malaysia one finds Scots who have served those countries in the Civil Service, in medicine, and in other ways.<br/>
I believe that this process should be continued by building this research centre in Scotland. The World Health Organisation is doing wonderful work. Its contribution to tropical medicine is well-known and admired by everyone. This research centre would bring together the doctors from India, from Africa, from the Australias and from the Caribbean. They would all congregate at this great centre of learning and research.<br/>
I have here a report which refers to the problems of developing countries, and to the need for research not only into biological medicine, but into diseases for plants, the use of insecticides and pesticides, and their effect on vegetation and the animal life in those countries.<br/>
Our experience in dealing with these developing countries has equipped us to run this research centre. After all, for centuries we have been regarded as the mother country. People in the West Indies still regard Britain as the mother country. It sounds remarkable, but it

is true. Although some of them have never been here, they regard Britain as the mother country, and even those who on visiting this country for the first time have been treated rather harshly regard this country in that light. Such an institution as this, particularly if it were established in Scotland, would make a great contribution.<br/>
Why do I think that it should be established in Scotland? Something must be done to redistribute the Metropolitan aspeet of London. Whenever we get the idea of establishing an organisation in Britain, everyone thinks in terms of establishing it is London. We could create in the North, and in Scotland in particular, a sort of regeneration&#x2014;a movement towards Scotland of all forms of investment&#x2014;if we had there something symbolical of the Metropolitan area, or something besides St. Andrew's House as a sort of centre to which people look.<br/>
We have the Edinburgh Festival. That has done a great deal of good for Scotland. Cultured people all over Britain and Europe now look upon Edinburgh as the Athens of the North. This does good for Scotland. It is a good thing for all those people who come to Scotland to the Festival and see the reproduction not only of their own art but the art of this country, and meet the Scottish people. If a world health centre or research centre were established in Scotland it would again put Scotland into the vision of the peoples of Europe, the developing ountries and the underdeveloped countries, and this would enable Scotland to recover the tremendous position which she held many years ago.<br/>
The potential is there. We are training medical people from the underdeveloped countries in our universities and colleges. They are going into European schools of medicine and then going back to their own countries. It would be highly desirable if we could have a large medical research centre with a capacity sufficient to serve both in basic research and applied research&#x2014;biochemistry and inorganic chemistry. To put this in Scotland would render great service to our Commonwealth, and would give a lead to the United Nations and the other nations of the world to come closer together in research in order


to alleviate some of the sicknesses and diseases in the under-developed countries.<br/>
I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary can give us some hope that through the Commonwealth we can give a lead which the other nations of the world at present do not seem prepared to give.</p>

<p>Normally one would expect that the final subject before the House would be that which was last printed on the Order Paper&#x2014;and that today it would be the one in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Wimbledon (Sir C. Black) concerning
<q>the practice of the Metropolitan Police in supplying information and fingerprints regarding convicted persons.</q>
I am well acquainted with the proceedings of the House and I know that that matter having been disposed of and the House not having been informed that anything would follow thereafter except the normal procedure of adjourning the House and the cry of "Who goes home?" a further subject has been raised.<br/>
There may be complaint about this, but by a peculiar set of circumstances this has been a peculiarly Scottish week. Upstairs in Committee we have dealt with a divorce Bill concerning Scotland, and Scottish business was the main preoccupation of the House today. When I saw the name of the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Bence) on the enunciator I came into the Chamber wondering how he was relating his argument to the last subject that appears on the Order Paper. I now find that he has been relating it to something which is not on the Order Paper. He has referred at some length to his visit to Central Africa and has related his arguments to Nyasaland. He will recall that he and I were together in Nyasaland and in Central Africa.<br/>
The hon. Member has been arguing for the establishment of a World Health Organisation centre either in Scotland or somewhere in Britain. I could not agree with that more. The subject was raised in this House some months ago when there was a reference to a research department. I suggested that it might be

sited in Scotland, but I did not receive any satisfactory answer. I agree with the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East that this would be a desirable thing to do. If the Government are attracted to the idea of a department being established in this country, I wish to support the suggestion of the hon. Member that it should be sited in Scotland.<br/>
I see that on the Opposition Front Bench is seated the hon. Member for Kilmarnock (Mr. Ross), who never seems to sleep, who is always alert and always able to talk on whatever subject is raised in this Chamber or in a Standing Committee. The hon. Gentleman speaks with great knowledge, great intelligence and sometimes with a sense of humour. I see him sitting there, and I see that the hon. Member for Motherwell (Mr. Lawson) is seated next to him.<br/>
I apologise to the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East because I was not in the Chamber at the moment when he started to speak, but I did not anticipate that this subject would be raised tonight. I am sure that few of the 630 hon. Members knew that it would be raised.</p>

<p>The fact is that this subject was not placed on the Order Paper. I am one of those hon. Members representing Scottish constituencies who tries always to be alert.<br/>
I hope that when my hon. Friend replies to this debate we shall be told whether the Government agree that an organisation should be set up in this country, and whether we are to contribute to it financially. I am not certain whether it is the desire of the Government that such an establishment should be set up in this country, but if it is I hope that it will be sited in Scotland because of the difficulties experienced there in relation to unemployment and other things. It could be established in the Borders where depopulation is going on. It might not bring the kind of industry we need, but it would provide housing for a number of people and it would be very pleasant for those so engaged because they would be situated


in an area of beauty contiguous to Edinburgh with all the facilities needed.<br/>
It is only for that reason that I intervene in this debate. I realise that some of us, especially Scottish hon. Members, have spent many hours here throughout this week, but this matter having been raised by the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East, I could not let it pass because I have raised it in a different sense earlier. I hope that my hon. Friend, when he replies to the debate, will say that if this centre is to come to Britain it should come somewhere south-east of Edinburgh, contiguous to Edinburgh, in the constituency I have the honour to represent.</p>

<p>I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Bence) on his ingenuity in raising this very important matter this evening. I remember at the beginning of the year, when the possibility of a world health research organisation being established in Scotland first flashed in the headlines of the Scotish Press, how welcome that was to the people of Scotland, especially those in Edinburgh. The idea was hailed as bold, imaginative, far-seeing and one which could bring great credit and advantages to Scotland.<br/>
It was pursued in this House by my hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline Burghs (Dr. A. Thompson) and others of my hon. Friends. We pursued it both in deputations and by Questions in this House. We were most disconcerted to find that the Government apparently did not look upon the scheme with the same favour as we did and that the United Kingdom representative had spoken against it when the executive of the World Health Organisation first considered the matter. We failed to see why the Government were taking this attitude. Then we were told that the Government had consulted the Advisory Council on Scientific Policy and it was on the basis of a report from that Council that they had taken this decision.<br/>
Not until two or three weeks ago, on 25th June, was the advice tendered by the Advisory Council on Scientific Policy published. We are now able to see the reasons which were proffered

to the Government. They were very powerful reasons, but we felt that the Government ought also to consult the large number of scientists in this country who seem to be in favour of the scheme. Clearly, there was a division of opinion among scientists in this country, a great many of whom thought that the idea to establish a large research centre having three functions was a good one. while the Advisory Council came down against it. We should like to have seen the reasons why other scientists differed from the view of the Advisory Council. We have never been able to find this out.<br/>
Very eminent men have given a lot of thought to this and are in favour of it. Eminent professors in Scotland and in England are in favour of the scheme. I do not wish to mention names because that would be invidious, but the Government know that this is a true statement. In view of the nature of this scheme, the Government ought to have gone to more trouble than they have taken to try to get an accurate assessment of its real value. I am not convinced that they have taken enough trouble. Their reply is, "The Advisory Committee are prepared to accept the idea that an international organisation for the purpose of health communications and for the assembly and processing of information is a good idea. They felt that the world centre for epidemiology was a good idea. But they did not think that a world health centre for biological research was a good idea, and the Government have accepted their view".<br/>
From conversations and discussions which I have had from time to time with my hon. Friends, I believe that they agree with me when I say that this attitude is not good enough. The Government ought to show much more aggression and enthusiasm in tackling this problem. What are the arguments which divide the scientists? Why should not the Government try to find out the other side of the case, which I understand is a good side? If they are to take a useful attitude the next time the matter is raised in the World Health Organisation, the Government must find out the other side of the case. We should like the Government to be in such a position, when the matter comes up again at the World Health Organisation, that they will be able to support


us. It is difficult for us to claim that the centre should be put in this country if we are opposed to it. We must be much more positively in favour of the idea than we have been up to the present, and we ought to be finding arguments in favour of it and inquiring much more into its possibiliites.<br/>
The arguments of the Advisory Council are set out in cc. <i>111</i> and <i>112</i> of HANSARD of 25th June. I respect them and they include some very powerful arguments, but there is also a case to be made against some of them. These are the aspects which the Government ought to be pursuing.<br/>
In Scotland we felt that this was an enormous thing for us. Edinburgh Corporation has made representations to the Secretary of State supporting the proposal and asking that the Development Council of the Scottish Office, the Secretary of State and the Government should pursue the matter. There is a general interest and enthusiasm here, because Edinburgh, in particular, and the surrounding district have a long medical tradition. Edinburgh is one of the world's foremost medical centres, and the men associated with Edinburgh are world-famous. I name Simpson, and I could go through a long list, but I do not wish to do so. Edinburgh is noted for this even today. People come from all over the world to Professor Dott, probably the greatest brain specialist in the world today.<br/>
Medicine has been the life of Edinburgh for generations. Men and women have come there from all over the world to gain their knowledge and skills. This proposal is regarded there as one of the most imaginative that has been put forward for a long time. There is tremendous enthusiasm for it and we should like to see the Government pursuing it with the same enthusiasm and trying to overcome the difficulties so that we can go forward to the World Health Organisation to support the idea which is being brought before its Council at the beginning of next year.<br/>
We should like to have the centre in Scotland, but no matter where it is we think that it would be a good thing for this country that a world-wide organisation, a gathering ground for world scientists, should be established here. There is

a centre at Dounreay to which nuclear scientists come from many parts of the world because we in this country are ahead of other countries in the researches pursued there.<br/>
This proposed international organisation would be a body where ideas would be exchanged and research promoted and developed and which would give benefits to scientists from every country, including our own. Surely this is something well worth having and about which we should be displaying much more enthusiasm and interest than is being displayed at the moment. I know that my colleagues share any feeling on the subject. We do not have a great many things to get excited about under the present Government but this is something about which we could all get excited, and if it brings any germ of consolation to the hon. and gallant Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Commander Donaldson) I would say that I should not mind if it were located in his beautiful constituency.<br/>
It is interesting to note that in spite of what the Government have said and the reasons given by the Secretary of State for Education and Science and by the Minister of Health and various other Government spokesmen, and in spite of what has appeared in HANSARD and the statement since by the Advisory Council, the people most closely concerned with promoting this idea in Scotland are still convinced that it should be supported by the Government. In view of all this, I appeal to the Joint Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Health to convey to his right hon. Friends our feelings on the subject and to rouse enthusiasm for it within himself and convey that to his colleagues.<br/>
Let them get a move on and forget the election for a day or two and think about this. The election will be forgotten within a few months, but this idea will go on. Let them convey this feeling of enthusiasm. Let us try to find out all the answers. The Government must not base their attitude on one side of the case only. This is a project about which eminent men hold different views.<br/>
What are the other views? What have the Government tried to find out? What have they done to canvass the support of scientists as distinct from the Advisory Council? Have they tried to


find out why so many eminent scientists in Scotland and the South are in favour of this idea? To what extent have the Government tried to take the initiative and promote the project?<br/>
If we can have a progress report from the Government tonight on what they have been doing about this tremendously important project, the debate will have been well worth while, and I shall be most grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East.</p>

<p>I also am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Bence) for raising this matter. We Scots get the blame for a lot of things, but I nearly began by asking whether a Scot might intervene in the debate. The first speaker in the debate was a Welshman, the second was a Canadian and the third was an Englishman, all Members representing Scottish seats. This shows the catholic nature of Scotland in these matters. Scots recognise merit wherever it comes. This is probably part of the reason why we are able to see much more clearly and imaginatively the value of a scheme such as this when first it is brought forward.<br/>
This is not an idea thought up overnight. The suggestion for a world health research centre was the result of a deliberate study over a full year by scientists and doctors from all over the world, including Britain. Two of them were Nobel prize winners. It was not something thought up by politicians. As the president of the World Health Organisation said, it was the logical outcome that the World Health Organisation should extend its work in international research. The suggestion is that there should be a world health research centre, with three divisions. It would study epidemiology and the infectious diseases from a world point of view. Everyone will readily appreciate the value of that. I am certain that the Parliamentary Secretary will. I express our thanks to the hon. Gentleman for coming to the House tonight and taking a continued interest in this matter. As he came in, I thought that no one would know more about the value of such work than he. He knows what happens in many parts of the world. He will remember where we first met and the places we travelled over more or less

together. I am not sure whether he returned the book which I lent him in 1944. He will remember Ceylon, Burma, Singapore and places East of Suez. We all know what has recently happened in Scotland&#x2014;an epidemic suddenly descending on the cleanest city in the country. We must not, therefore, for a moment think that all the necessary study on infectious diseases has been done.<br/>
The second object is the collection, dissemination and translation of information on health and research matters, so letting the world know what is happening and what progress has been made. Many people are shut off from this information and are very anxious to get as much of it as possible. I gather that the Government are not against this. These two things are at present being done by the World Health Organisation, but the proposal is to extend the work, and extend it in the way of centralising in one place.<br/>
Then there is the setting up of the complex of laboratories of fundamental research. Bio-medical, cellular, molecular research&#x2014;call it what we will&#x2014;is fundamental and basic to our physical lives and is probably the field in which we could, by mastering the problems of lengthening the life span and, in lengthening it, making it comfortable, make advances. There is the problem of cancer, the degenerative diseases, and all the medical problems arising out of ageing. We have been very worried by the Government's attitude of opposition because of difficulties. They have certainly given us the impression that they have been slow even in giving support in principle. They could have done far more.<br/>
The Government rest their opinion on advice they were given, but it took us a long time to find out what that advice was. This is not the first time we have raised, this subject. An Adjournment debate we had on the matter just before Whitsun was the climax of quite a number of discussions, Questions and debates&#x2014;and deputations. I remember that my hon. Friend took a deputation to see the Minister who is now Secretary of State of&#x2014;all that accumulation of nonsense&#x2014;the bellringer. We were not terribly happy about the result.<br/>
Eventually&#x2014;on, I think, 9th April&#x2014;we had a series of Questions, and once again my Scottish colleagues were trying to wrest information. I remember on that occasion winding up that series of Questions by asking the Government to publish the advice they had been given. We were told that the Government were working on advice given by the Advisory Committee on Scientific Policy and the Medical Research Council, and the Minister of State for Higher Education said that the Government would consider whether or not to publish it. By means of pressure, we eventually got it on 25th June. There is no doubt that the Government got advice, and acted on it.<br/>
The point is that this was again considered at Geneva. Once again there was no support for it from the British Government but, despite that, the project is not dead. It is a tremendously imaginative and extensive scheme, and it deserves continued study. The decision was that there would be study for another year.<br/>
Our concern is whether the Government will rest upon the advice that they have been given or will take into account the mood of many people in the country who know something about the problem and who have been actively concerned with its international aspects. Will they bend to the will of the world about the needs in this matter? In other words, is further study being given particularly to the third division of this suggested project by the Government? I want to know more than that. Who else has been consulted? If the Government have not consulted anyone, if they say that they are satisfied that the advice which they got at that time was right, will they look over the whole history of medicine and of every imaginative project ever put forward? Even governments have said, "No"&#x2014;they must go easy. My hon. Friend mentioned Simpson. I do not blame the Government of that time, but we can blame the Establishment that he conducted the researches in his own room with his own family and friends. That house is still there in Edinburgh and is used, I believe, by the Church of Scotland.</p>

<p>Queen Street, Edinburgh. I did not know the street, but I could

have taken the hon. and gallant Member there. I could take him to other places nearby which are a disgrace to that same City of Edinburgh.<br/>
When contemplating the conditions under which earlier research was conducted, we must pay tribute to the imagination, ability and persistence of those who did it. There is no doubt that Edinburgh has gained greatly in the reflected glory of the doctors, surgeons and medical men who trained and worked there and gave their ability, not only to the people of Edinburgh, but to the people of the world. [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] If Scotland has given to the world more than anything else in the way of professional men, it has been doctors. My hon. Friend spoke about missionaries. Most of the missionaries were doctors. Many of them still are. I remember being at the Church Assembly this year and hearing debates about this and deploring the fact that today, unfortunately&#x2014;I hope that the Joint Parliamentary Secretary is not wearying in this eulogy of our land. We are always being told by hon. Members opposite, when they are here, that we run Scotland down. We do not. We run down the government of Scotland.</p>

<p>This plan is certainly beyond (he means of any one country. The research that requires to be done is beyond any one country's means. It will bring tremendous problems to the country that becomes the home of this research centre. Certain financial commitments would have to be entered into.<br/>
The Joint Parliamentary Secretary will know that although we have been laggard in supporting the scheme, there is considerable support internationally that if the scheme comes forward it should be in Scotland. Indeed, at least one authority&#x2014;Fife&#x2014;has offered free an estate of 63 acres on which it could be built. The site is fairly near the new Forth Road Bridge. I am certain that facilities in Edinburgh would be offered if the decision were taken, as I hope it will be, that it should be there.<br/>
We will not argue about where it should be. I should be happy if it was anywhere in Britain. It so happens that, for historic and other reasons, certain parts have their claim. The first thing on which we must fasten is the need to get the Government even thinking that the possibility is worth while. I wish that they would get their feet out of the sloughy mud of politics. They have become obsessed with votes and forget their obligations, not just to the next General Election, but to the next generation.<br/>
We have always in this field been able to give a lead to the world. We have prided ourselves that, although we have lost part of our great military glory and, it may be, some of the economic power that we once wielded, we still have this knowledge and right to lead in these matters. We ask that the Government shall give that lead. Let us not lag behind.<br/>
I ask the Parliamentary Secretary, first, whether there has been any decisive change of heart by the Government in this respect. If they are still thinking about it, with whom are they thinking? Have they taken any further advice other than that from the Advisory Committee on Scientific Policy and the Medical Research Council? If they have sought advice from other bodies or persons, perhaps from universities, will they tell us from whom they have sought it?<br/>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not give us 25 minutes of waffled

apology. Although Parliament has only a few weeks to go, this matter will be in our minds and our debates until that time and thereafter, and I sincerely hope that the hon. Gentleman will treat it, as I am sure he will, with the seriousness that the subject merits.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Kilmarnock (Mr. Ross) generously recognised at the outset that I heard of the intention of the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire.

<p>What I am trying to make plain at the outset is that in the circumstances I cannot be expected to give as full and detailed a reply to hon. Gentlemen opposite as I know they would wish and as I myself would have liked to give.<br/>
I thank the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East not merely for raising the subject but for the way in which he has done so. I followed his remarks with great interest. I entirely agree with him about the importance of the World Health Organisation and the necessity for any civilised Government to support it as much as it can. Indeed.


I think we can be proud of the contribution that we already make to the World Health Organisation. I have had time to look up the statement setting out the contributions of member States to 1965 of the Organisation's budget, and I think it should be put on record that, after the U.S.A. and the Soviet Union, countries larger in population and resources than our own, we are the third highest contributor. Secondly, it ought to be said, since it is sometimes a charge that we do not devote enough of our resources to medical research at home, that in recent years Government expenditure on civil science has been stepped up considerably. In 1963&#x2013;64 the amount devoted to medical and health research alone was more than three times greater than in 1950&#x2013;51.<br/>
A specific question has been raised about the proposal for setting up a world health research centre, and a specific claim has been made for this to be done in Scotland. I will do my best to answer. The hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East said, as subsequent speakers have also done, that there was a certain amount of confusion and division in the Government on this subject. This is not so. Moreover, we ought to be clear at the beginning about the status of the proposal and the stage which it has reached. The hon. Member for Kilmarnock implied that the idea that there should be such a research centre was mooted a considerable time ago. I think, however, that it was only in January that the Director General presented a paper on the subject to the Executive Board of the World Health Organisation. The Board gave some preliminary consideration to the paper and requested the Director General to secure the views of member States and to continue his study.<br/>
I understand that at the meeting of the Assembly in March, the Board transmitted the paper to the Assembly only for its information and not for definitive action. I believe that at the Assembly there was little support for setting up an autonomous international centre for fundamental and biological research. The Director General himself, in summing up the discussion, said that no final decision could be expected at the

present stage and the matter needed further study.<br/>
The hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East, called the proposal for setting up an international research centre bold and imaginative&#x2014;but it was not the sole proposal that had been put forward. As the hon. Member for Kilmarnock pointed out, there were others. First, there was the proposal for an international laboratory for fundamental research. Secondly, there was a proposal for more extensive development of international epidemiological studies. Thirdly, there was a call for easier dissemination of information about the results of scientific investigations.<br/>
I want to make it plain that the British Government fully support the second and third of these proposals. Indeed, we have done a great deal in both these fields already. The hon. Member for Kilmarnock mentioned that he and I first encountered one another in South-East Asia at the headquarters of the Supreme Allied Commander in the war against Japan. Since then both of us have travelled a great deal. I think that I have been to every Commonwealth country in Asia and Africa. I have been to many other Commonwealth countries as well and to many foreign countries. One cannot go anywhere in the tropics without being reminded in some way of the activities of British medical scientists, whether in an earlier age when Scottish medical missionaries went to what is now Malawi and other parts of Africa&#x2014;and one must never forget David Livingstone, a Scotsman, who was one of the first Europeans to venture into Central Africa&#x2014;or whether in more modern times by British medical teams and advisers at work in the unceasing struggle against ill health and disease. The eradication of malaria, tuberculosis and a host of other diseases which have been killing vast numbers of people and crippling even more owes a great deal to the work of our own people.<br/>
But in considering any proposal to set up a new research organisation in this country, whether in England or Scotland, the House would naturally expect us to look at it very closely and to take the best possible scientific advice. This is what we did. We sought the advice of the Advisory


Council on Scientific Policy. This is an extremely weighty body. Its Chairman, Lord Todd, is a most distinguished chemist. Its members include Sir Harold Himsworth, Secretary of the Medical Research Council, Sir Harry Melville, Secretary of the D.S.I.R., Sir Solly Zuckerman, Chief Scientific Adviser to the Secretary of State for Defence, and other scientists of considerable stature and of world renown.<br/>
The Council had considered the subject of international scientific cooperation two years ago. In the statement which my right hon. Friend the Minister of State for Education and Science made in the House on 25th June, he quoted the Council as having given its views on this subject in its Annual Report for 1961&#x2013;62 and said that it had considered the World Health Organisation's proposals in the light of the general principles which it had laid down at that time. The Council said in a reference to the dissemination of information and to epidemiological studies,
<q>&#x2026; we consider that the World Health Organisation should operate mainly through national organisations, and that there should not be any need to set up centralised laboratory facilities in order to do what is required in these fields.</q>
The Council said that they had carefully considered the main proposal, namely, that a large international laboratory for biological research should be set up and financed internationally, and was unanimously opposed to it for reasons which it set out. Hon. Members will have had the opportunity to study those reasons, which are compelling and cogent. Perhaps I may summarise them.<br/>
In its Report for 1961&#x2013;62 the Council had pointed out the disadvantage of concentrating the best scientific talent in one place, thus isolating it from teaching functions in national universities, and it recorded the view that centralised institutions were valuable only where the research facilities required were of such an extensive character that they could not be provided on a national basis. It now considered&#x2014;and this is the reply to those who say that this is far too big a task for a single country&#x2014;that:
<q>The facilities required in this case need not be exceptionally costly, nor beyond the

means of most countries with a capability for the kind of research which is in question.</q>
it said that our most urgent need at the moment in this country
<q>is to increase the supply of suitably trained research workers. It would be harmful to this country, and to its progress in biological research, if a number of our leading biologists were to withdraw to an international laboratory.</q>
The Council went on:
<q>The belief that the concentration in one very large institution of leading scientists from a number of countries would promote an interchange of knowledge and ideas which does not take place at the present time is, in our view, mistaken. We believe that, on the contrary, concentration of this kind might well have a sterilising effect, and reduce the influence of the people concerned on the development of research.</q>
The Council also said:
<q>We consider that the basic objectives of the World Health Organisation proposals could more readily and more economically be obtained by improved co-ordination and support for decentralised national efforts of member countries.</q>
These were the Council's reasons for unanimously advising the Government not to support this aspect of the proposal.<br/>
I was asked whether the Government had sought advice from any other quarter. I should have liked notice of that question, but I am clear in my own mind that we consulted the Medical Research Council, as the House would expect. The House will know that there is no more powerful body, no better equipped body, in the world than our own Medical Research Council to supervise the conduct of medical research. I think that I am right in saying that the members of the Medical Research Council fully support the view of the Advisory Council on Scientific Policy.</p>

<p>We asked the Council to do this on 9th April. The hon. Gentleman will find Questions in columns 1201 and 1202 of that date by my hon. Friends the Member for Motherwell (Mr. Lawson), the Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millan) and myself, asking the Government to seek further advice. The Minister was not able to answer us then, but we had thought that by this time the hon. Gentleman would be able to give us some information. We do not necessarily ask for


names, but if he can tell us that further study is being undertaken, it would be helpful.</p>

<p>Not having had experience of the Government machine, perhaps the hon. Gentleman can be forgiven for not knowing how the system works. The Government have at their disposal, at any time, advice from experts. There are serving my Minister, a whole host of standing advisory committees which are composed of the very best brains in the medical and scientific world. At any given time a Department of the Government can obtain advice of this quality.<br/>
The party opposite constantly harps on the need to take into account the scientific and technological revolution which is taking place. That is good advice, but I come back to the advice given to us by the Advisory Council which said:
<q>We have had occasion, in our Annual Reports, to comment on the condition of the biological sciences in British universities. Something approaching a revolution is in progress, and a new biology&#x2014;which is more closely associated with the physical sciences&#x2014;is now developing. But there is still an insufficient supply of first-class scientists to lead research and teaching in this field at our universities&#x2026;</q>
The Report went on to say that our most urgent need was to increase the supply of suitably trained research workers.<br/>
It is all very well to suggest, as the hon. Member for Edinburgh, East did, that this is a wonderful idea, that it is bold, imaginative and far-seeing. The question that we have to ask ourselves is whether it would serve a useful purpose.</p>

<p>I cannot be drawn further in this regard. The hon. Gentleman must be aware that, having obtained this advice, we would not treat it lightly. In the light of the best advice available, it is the Government's view that this project would not serve a useful purpose at this stage.<br/>
If I had all the information available, and had a week in which to prepare for this debate, I would not attempt to

explain the differences which may emerge between scientists. No evidence has been advanced to show that the Advisory Council was talking nonsense. Not a single argument has been advanced to show that the Medical Research Council was talking nonsense.</p>

<p>I did not suggest that they were. I said that the reasons they advanced were powerful ones. I do not dispute that, though I do not necessarily agree with them all. What is important to us at this stage is to ask the hon. Gentleman whether this now represents the Government's fixed view so that we can expect no change before January of next year, or whether the Government are keeping an open mind on this matter and are prepared to accept arguments and representations which might tend to influence them the other way.</p>

<p>I noted that both the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East and the hon. Member for Kilmarnock asked me a specific question on that subject. They asked whether there is to be a further study&#x2014;whether our minds are open on the subject. We must realise that this proposal has to be considered by many other countries. It must convince not merely the Government of the United Kingdom but those of many other countries. It would be quite unreasonable of the hon. Member to expect me to give some specific assurance on this tonight.<br/>
I could, as the hon. Member for Kilmarnock recognises, have sat here and listened carefully to the whole debate, and I could not have been criticised, according to the precedents and customs of the House, if I had sat back and said nothing. I know that the hon. Member is an experienced Parliamentarian, and at times a very generous opponent, and that he recognises the truth of what I am saying.<br/>
But I did listen carefully to what was said. I congratulate the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East upon his special pleading. If there were to be a proposal of this kind it is not a bad thing to stake a claim for one's own constituency or ones own part of the Kingdom, but I can do no more tonight than to say that I will convey to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Educa-


tion and Science, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland, and my right hon. Friend the Minister of Health, what has been said. This I will gladly undertake to do, but beyond that, in all reason and fairness, I am sure that

hon. Members would not wish to press me.</p>
