<p>Hon. Members can understand exactly what I said, namely, that if their medical condition justifies it, they will be discharged, and that most of them will be. Those who are fit will be retained for such service as the Geneva Convention permits.</p>

<p>It was decided by the military authorities that it was more convenient, and in the case of sick and wounded better from a medical point of view, for the beer prepared for the ex-prisoners of war landing at Leith to be sent to the reception stations and medical centres, and served with the evening meal rather than handed out on the quay or in the train.</p>

<p>I am not aware of any such feeling, but if it exists in some quarters, it is probably balanced by an equal volume of opinion that some other course is desirable.

<p>I am not sure. I would like to have notice of the question. It certainly applies to the British Army serving in India.

<p>A.T.S. personnel at Palace Camp, Douglas, are accommodated in various requisitioned hotels and boarding houses, some of which it is difficult to keep entirely clear of rats and mice. Arrangements have, however, been made for a professional rat-catcher to visit the camp. The reports received hitherto indicate that the messing at this camp is good. In fact, only one complaint has been received in four months prior to the hon. Member's Question, and that was that the meat was too fatty. The specific complaints which the hon.

<p>A few members of this unit complained about the fish on one occasion recently. The complaint was investigated by the messing officer, who found the fish quite palatable.

<p>This paper is issued for the Eighth Army and is run by an editorial staff responsible to the General Officer Commanding. It owes its popularity with the troops to the freedom with which it expresses the Army's views, and I am naturally anxious to interfere with this as little as possible. A new branch has, however, been formed in the War Office to give advice to editors of these Army newspapers and to help them in supplying material for them.

of production, with a total employment value estimated at more than 50,000 workers, have been authorised in Scotland, and that in the past 12 months the additional work authorised in Scotland represented nearly 20 per cent. of the total new employment provided in Great Britain. Moreover, the percentage of floor space in existing premises in Scotland now being allocated for production, as compared with the space allocated for storage, is now three times as great as in 1941.

<p>Further to the point of Order. May I submit


that, in view of the controversy and the abuse to which I have been submitted from quarters with which the hon. Member is associated, is it not due to me and to the House of Commons that this statement should be made at the earliest practicable moment? There is a Question on the Order Paper by the hon. Member for North Islington (Dr. Haden Guest), and I am answering that Question and certain other considerations as well.<br/>
In view of the importance of this matter, I would ask permission to make a somewhat full statement. As the House will be aware, Sir Oswald Mosley was detained some 3&#x00BD; years ago, in May, 1940, because my predecessor was satisfied that his British Union activities were prejudicial to national security, and that it was necessary to exercise control over him. The decision to release him does not imply that the Government take a different view of the potentialities for mischief of any revival of this organisation. The Order applying Defence Regulation 18AA to this organisation remains in force and prohibits any renewal of its activities.<br/>
The case of each of the individuals detained under Regulation 18B has to be determined in the light both of the facts of the particular case and of general conditions. In view of the improvement in our national fortunes, it has been possible without endangering national security to release a large number of former members of the British Union on the ground that their detention is not necessary in present circumstances. The improvement in our national fortunes would not by itself, however, have justified the immediate release of Sir Oswald Mosley: as the leader and most influential person in the movement, he would have been the last to be released.<br/>
From time to time representations have been made to me as to the state of his health, and it accordingly became the duty of the prison medical authorities to advise me as to the nature and degree of the risk to his health which his continued detention would involve. For this purpose it was arranged that there should be consultation between the prison medical authorities and Lord Dawson of Penn and Dr. Geoffrey Evans. A consultation accordingly took place between the Medical Commissioner of Prisons, two prison doctors and these two medical practitioners. The opinion of these five doctors was unanimous: it was that if

the patient remained under the conditions which are inseparable from detention, there would be substantial risk of the thrombo-phlebitis from which he is suffering extending, and thus producing permanent damage to health and even danger to life. This complaint is of long standing, and the question was not whether the appropriate medical treatment could be given in a prison establishment, but whether there was a reasonable chance of checking serious deterioration of his health unless the patient were allowed a greater measure of freedom for outdoor exercise and varied occupations than is possible in a place of detention. The opinion of all these medical men was that, if the matter were considered purely on medical grounds, release from detention was essential for the purpose of checking the extension of his complaint and providing any reasonable prospect of recovery.<br/>
On receipt of this authoritative medical advice, there were only two courses open to me. First, I had to consider whether I ought to take the responsibility of detaining this suspect to the permanent damage of his health and possibly to the danger of his life. On this point I can only say that, while considerations of national security must come first, I am not prepared, subject to this overriding consideration, to let anyone die in detention unnecessarily. This policy is based not on the inexpediency of making martyrs of persons who do not deserve the honour, but on the general principle that those extraordinary powers of detention without trial must not be used except in so far as they are essential for national security.<br/>
The alternative course was to consider whether there should be substituted for detention some system of control approximating to house arrest. Under the provisions of Regulation 18B the Secretary of State is empowered to suspend an Order of Detention subject to conditions imposing various restrictions. Failure to comply with any conditions so imposed renders the person concerned liable not only to prosecution for an offence but also to be brought back to detention. Knowing that severe restrictions could be imposed and enforced and that the Detention Order itself could be re-imposed at need, I came to the conclusion that my right course was to substitute for detention a stringent system of


control and that release subject to the restrictions I had in mind would not entail any undue risk to national security in the circumstances of the present day.<br/>
In reaching this conclusion, I kept two considerations prominently in mind. First, conditions imposed on a person released from detention, however stringent those conditions may be, cannot provide as effective a method of control as confinement. The release under such conditions of a person who would otherwise be detained can, therefore, be justified only if there is some exceptional reason, such as the medical considerations arising in the present case. Secondly, while it is right that account should be taken of medical considerations, especially when, as in the present case, there is a risk of permanent injury to health or danger to life, such considerations cannot be paramount. They must be subordinate to considerations of national security. My justification for taking on medical grounds a course which would not otherwise have been taken, even at this stage of the war, is that I was satisfied that no undue risk to national security would be incurred by the release of this man, subject to stringent conditions, in the circumstances obtaining at the present day. Had a similar question arisen at an earlier date, when the dangers to be apprehended from any attempt at interference with our war effort were much greater than they are to-day, the position would have been different.<br/>
I have authorised the release of Sir Oswald Mosley in the belief that in present circumstances adequate control can be maintained over him by the restrictions which I have imposed. But let there be no misunderstanding. If for any reason, whether because of evasion of any restrictions imposed on him or because of any change in the situation, it became necessary, on grounds of public security, to bring him back to detention, medical considerations would not be an obstacle to the course dictated by the national interests.<br/>
The restrictions which I decided to impose as a condition of his release are as follow: He is to reside at a specified house in the country and is prohibited from travelling more than seven miles from that house; he is to report in person to the police monthly; he is not to associate

or directly or indirectly communicate with any person who has been a member of the British Union, other than members of his family or his wife's family; he is not to associate or directly or indirectly communicate with any other person for the purpose of promoting or assisting in the promotion of political activities; he is not to publish or cause or permit to be published any book, article, newspaper, news-letter, periodical, pamphlet, leaflet, poster or circular; he is not to make any public speech; he is not to give any interview to a journalist or other person for the purpose of publication. In short, as regards public activities, he is still subject to the same kind of restrictions as are imposed on persons in detention. These restrictions were communicated to him at the time of his release.<br/>
In the case of Lady Mosley, medical considerations were not in question. But one of the main reasons for the detention of Lady Mosley was the risk that she might act as an agent for her husband if, while he was detained, she were left at liberty. With the release of her husband this ground for detention ceased to operate, and, having regard to this consideration together with the consideration affecting his health, I thought it right that both should be released from detention subject to the same restrictions.<br/>
I mention&#x2014;merely to dismiss it as an absurdity&#x2014;the suggestion made in certain quarters that the decision to release at this date on medical grounds a man who stands for a doctrine almost universally detested in this country and whose influence is greatly diminished, indicated that there is a weakening on the part of the Government or myself in our determination to root out the evil cancer of Fascism. If I were to allow myself, in the exercise of the drastic power of detention without trial entrusted to me by Parliament as an exceptional war-time measure, to depart from the judicial frame of mind and to be influenced&#x2014;not by considerations of the public safety&#x2014;but by personal dislike or political opposition, I should no doubt be able to give entire satisfaction to many of my present critics, but I should be abusing the powers afforded by Regulation 18B and betraying the trust reposed in to me by Parliament that those powers would be exercised in a judicial spirit and solely


for the purpose of national security. Any departure from these principles of administration would involve grave danger to the maintenance of constitutional democratic government and might set a precedent which in other circumstances no one would regret more than many of my critics of to-day.</p>

<p>Is it not clear that if a statement on those lines had been issued at the same time as the release of Sir Oswald Mosley the public would have got a very different impression of the whole matter; and is it not the case that the news was released to the public in the manner most prejudicial to the interests of the right hon.

<p>I caused to be issued at the time a statement in which there were two points. One concerned the health grounds, and the other was that proper security restrictions would have to be put on him.

<p>In view of my right hon.

<p>I have often been attacked on this side of the House for being unwilling, in effect, to transfer my responsibility, either to a Committee of this House or to a committee outside. This responsibility is placed upon me, and just as I could not transfer my responsibility to Parliament for my action, if I keep people in, so I cannot do so if I let people out. Parliament has its remedy if it is dissatisfied. It can always get rid of a Minister. That is open to Parliament, but as long as I am discharging this function, I shall discharge it judicially, on my responsibility, and answer for my actions in the House.</p>

<p>I am not a doctor, but I understood that it requires both things&#x2014;rest, and also vigorous exercise. I can only say that it is not for me to pronounce a medical opinion.

<p>The limits within which the police are justified in giving opportunities to a person to commit an offence in order to obtain evidence against him are set out in the Report of the Royal Commission on Police Powers and Duties, which recognised that there are certain types of case in which it would be impossible for the police to carry out their duty of enforcing the law without the adoption of such methods. The police are, however, well


aware that the Courts will always scrutinise most narrowly the evidence of any witness who can be represented as having encouraged or procured an offence which would not otherwise have been committed, and no action on the part of my right hon. Friend is required to remind the police of the great care which must be taken in cases of this kind. I may, perhaps, add that I am not aware of anything in the case to which my hon.

<p>Turkeys are available for the public this year from three sources of supplies, Great Britain, Eire, and Northern Ireland. Turkeys produced in Great Britain and


shipped from Eire, which together represent four-fifths of the total supplies, will not be limited in the area of their distribution. The distribution of turkeys produced in Great Britain, which constitute about one-half of the total supply, will remain as at present uncontrolled, except in regard to price, and should be available for purchase through the ordinary channels provided producers, traders and the public co-operate to assist in a fair distribution.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1943-11-23a.1439.0" colnum="1439" time="">
<p>As regards turkeys from Eire, these are being sent, as was the case last year, to wholesalers in 11 large distributing centres, who will supply their retail and caterer customers wherever situated with their fair proportion based on pre-war purchases. The arrangements for the distribution of turkeys and other poultry shipped from Northern Ireland came into operation on 22nd November. It is understood that the turkeys expected to be received from Northern Ireland will amount to no more than one-fifth of the total supplies available in Great Britain. The Northern Ireland supplies will be directed to five Poultry Retailers' Buying Groups in Great Britain, which have been set up under the guidance of my Department by the trade organisations concerned. These groups will arrange for the allocation of supplies amongst poultry retailers in the Birmingham, Glasgow, Liverpool, and Manchester and Salford Food Office areas, and the London Metropolitan Police District. These areas, before the war, bought a large proportion of the Northern Ireland supplies.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1943-11-23a.1439.1" colnum="1439" time="">
<p>All traders licensed to sell poultry by retail in the selected areas are eligible to receive supplies, provided they handled more than reasonable minimum quantities in either 1938 or 1939 and undertake to comply with the rules of the group. One of these rules is that traders shall sell all goods received to householder customers and to caterers in the same relative proportions as in the datum year and, as far as practicable, share supplies amongst the purchasers as were supplied in the datum year. The control of the supplies from Northern Ireland has been introduced to ensures that a much larger proportion should reach the domestic consumer than in previous war years. It has not been practicable at the outset to make arrangements for the reception of supplies in a

larger number of areas than those selected, or for the allocation of supplies to traders in districts adjacent to those areas.</p>

<p>His Majesty's Government have been gravely concerned at the development of the recent dispute between the French Committee of National Liberation and the Lebanese Government, in the course of which the French Delegate General in Beirut ordered the arrest and imprisonment of the newly elected President and member:, of the Lebanese Government. Great public excitement was aroused both in Lebanon itself and in other Middle East countries, where the arrests were regarded as unjustified by the circumstances.<br/>
The interest of His Majesty's Government in this dispute is two-fold. First of all, we have endorsed the promises of independence given to the Lebanese people by General Catroux in 1941. His Majesty's Government have followed with sympathy and interest the subsequent development of constitutional government in the Lebanon. Secondly, the Lebanon is of vital importance to the war effort both as as operational base and from the point of view of communications. Any threat of a breakdown of law and order is therefore of direct concern to His Majesty's Government.<br/>
Our overriding desire, which we have made clear to both parties, has been to secure a solution of the dispute which would enable calm to be restored and constitutional development to be resumed in an orderly and agreed manner as soon as possible. General Catroux, who has gone specially to Beirut and has taken the situation in hand on behalf of French Committee, is in close touch with Mr. Casey, the Minister of State Resident in Cairo, and with His Majesty's Minister in Beirut who have explained our views to him. We have also explained our views direct to the French Committee in Algiers.<br/>
I am glad to say that the Lebanese President and Ministers have been released, that the President has been


reinstated and that the French Delegate General has been recalled. His Majesty's Government welcome these developments. At the same time they hope that they will lead to further progress and to the re-establishment of constitutional government. The American and Soviet Governments have been kept fully informed throughout.</p>

Legislation has been passed to introduce a new system of taxation of wages and salaries, which will be of substantial convenience to all employees, particularly those whose earnings are liable to fluctuation. An Act has been passed to facilitate electoral registration under war conditions. Provision has been made for the development of the catering trades and for regulating the conditions of employment in those trades, for improving the administration of pensions, and for further temporary increases in the rates of workmen's compensation.</i></p>
