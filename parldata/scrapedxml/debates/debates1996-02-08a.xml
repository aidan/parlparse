<p>The UK's general government financial deficit for 1995&#x2013;96 is forecast at 4&#x00BE; per cent. of GDP. In 1995, six European Union countries had lower budget deficits as a proportion of GDP than the UK, and eight had higher.</p>

<p>I am grateful to my right hon. and learned Friend for that reply. Does that not show that Britain has

achieved a position at the top of the tree in relation to the budget deficit as a percentage of GDP?

<p>My hon. Friend is right. We are reducing our fiscal deficit faster than any other major European country and today Germany has unfortunately announced that its unemployment has gone above 4 billion&#x2014;I mean 4 million. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Let the Opposition take it as a warning. One of the main reasons why unemployment has risen in Germany is that it is suffering from a social chapter and all the additional on-costs on employment that this country has avoided.</p>

<p>We know that the Chancellor of the Exchequer is hellbent on reaching the 3 per cent. of GDP borrowing requirement&#x2014;one of the essential criteria&#x2014;at the earliest possible moment, but what does he now say to his colleagues in the European Union, especially Germany, which has just reported a 4.1 million unemployment level? In those circumstances, will he urge it to cut its public expenditure further and to raise taxation so that it can conform next year to the 3 per cent. of GDP borrowing requirement criterion?</p>

<p>I am a strong advocate of getting down towards a balanced budget and of low inflation. They happen to be the Maastricht criteria as well, but as we move towards achieving them it is doing no harm to this country's economy. Sound Conservative policies are giving us the fastest growth of any major European country and falling unemployment. The problems in Germany and France are that they have not made the structural changes in their economies that a Conservative Government have been making in our economy for the past 16 years. Those two countries need more privatisation, less Government intervention, no social chapter, no minimum wage, a flexible labour market and the conditions for enterprise that we have put in place.</p>

<p>Will my right hon. and learned Friend confirm that convergence of budget deficits is not the key factor determining whether a single currency would work, but that much more important is a convergence of business cycles, for instance?</p>

<p>Yes, I do. The criteria are important. I am one of the people who argue that, if economic and monetary union is to go ahead, it is important to have strict adherence to the criteria on budget deficit, inflation, GDP-debt ratio, and so on. I have also frequently said, however, that the countries should go into economic and monetary union only if they are genuinely compatible with each other in other ways and would benefit from doing so. That includes being in the same stage of the business cycles, as my hon. Friend said.</p>

<p>If the reports that the Government are to announce today&#x2014;that public sector pay awards are to be about 4 per cent.&#x2014;are correct, will the Chancellor explain how that will be funded, welcome as it may be to public sector employees whose pay has


been squeezed? Following, for example, the local authorities settlement, does such an award not inevitably mean that other services will have to be cut or that teachers will be made redundant? Does that not add to the crisis facing many national health service trusts, which are unable to meet their current demands, never mind such a pay award?</p>

<p>With respect, the hon. Gentleman knows that I cannot anticipate my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister's reporting to the House on the review body's report, which he will do this afternoon, but we have had a straightforward, successful approach to pay for several years. We take the view that, in the public sector as in the private sector, pay settlements should be affordable and fair and should reflect the low inflation culture that we have created, but the hon. Gentleman must wait for the proper announcement from my right hon. Friend.</p>

<p>Will my right hon. and learned Friend confirm that the United Kingdom's position relative to other European countries is much better than the statistics that he has announced might suggest, because many other countries in Europe do not take unfunded pension liabilities into account when they calculate their budget deficits? If a common accounting basis were used throughout Europe, would not our budget deficit position be shown to be infinitely better than those of other countries?</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="1107670" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1996-02-08a.453.2" hansard_membership_id="2393" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2544" speakername="Mr. Clarke" colnum="453" time="">
<p>Actually, for the purposes of European comparisons we endeavour to compare fiscal deficits on the same basis. Where other countries' accounting methods differ&#x2014;they do not differ too much&#x2014;there are moves to bring them on to the same basis. But my hon. Friend is right about funded pensions. When one looks forward and tries to judge the economic potential of a country, it is important to know to what extent it faces what is known as a demographic time bomb, especially if that will turn into unfunded pension demands that future working populations will have to pay. We have anticipated that possibility, with all the changes that we have made to pensions policy through the 1980s and into the 1990s. Our occupational pensions funds exceed the pension funds available to the whole of the rest of Europe, and we shall continue to ensure that we leave our successors a pensions liability that can be afforded and is properly funded.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister has said that public spending should fall to 35 per cent. of national income; the Chief Secretary to the Treasury has said the same. Does the Chancellor agree with the Prime Minister that that should happen&#x2014;yes or no?</p>

<p>If the hon. Gentleman would do the Prime Minister the courtesy of reading the quotations from him in <i>The Sunday Telegraph,</i> and also read the full text of what I said to the journalists from the <i>Financial Times,</i> he would find that the two are indistinguishable. The Prime Minister's remarks and mine could be swapped with each other. We have a clearly stated policy, which we have both enunciated, of a 40 per cent. target, and beyond that to go as far as we can. The 40 per cent. will be hit in 1997&#x2013;98. If we continue to restrain growth in public expenditure below the growth in the economy, a steadily

declining share of GDP will be taken by the state. The Government are achieving that, and the high-tax, high-spending policies of the Labour party would take us in the opposite direction, as they always have in the past.</p>

<p>Does my right hon. and learned Friend agree that, although the current budget deficit figures are good in terms of international league tables, the cumulative figures are even better? If we consider the total weight of debt in accumulated budget deficits as a percentage of GDP, on which interest will have to be paid by future generations, is not this country almost the best in the developed world?</p>

<p>I can give a short answer. My hon. Friend is exactly right and puts his point clearly. The fact that we are steadily reducing our fiscal deficit means that we shall be on target to reduce debt as a proportion of GDP, and therefore to continue to reduce the burden of debt interest, as we have done in our period in office, which leaves room for economic growth and for other public expenditure, too.</p>

<p>I understand the concerns that the hon. Gentleman articulates, on behalf of those who may not understand the basis on which the mechanism is used. He will realise that, put simply, any dividend, whether special or not, is paid out of already taxed profits. So there cannot be the tax loophole that he identifies.

<p>Local authorities will see a reduction in their national insurance contributions. As many of their services are labour-intensive, they will benefit in that way. Obviously, it is the instinct of Liverpool council to pass everything on to the ratepayer. That is not the instinct of Conservative councils.

<p>Is it not the case that, after tax and inflation, someone on average earnings will see his or her real income fall by the sharpest rate in 1995 since 1981, or is it that the only real disposable income in which the Government are interested is that of the likes of Cedric Brown?</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman is partly right and partly wrong. It is true that people's take-home pay fell last year. That is because earnings were restrained. That was responsible behaviour by trade unions and employers, which helped to cause unemployment to fall fast. None the less, real personal disposable income rose sharply last year.

<p>I think that the hon. Gentleman got the decimal point in the wrong place when he was talking about &#x00A3;800 a week. He is on very weak ground. Take-home pay increased by 1 per cent. during the whole period of the last Labour Government. It has increased by not far short of 50 per cent. under the Conservative Government since 1979.

<p>Does my right hon.

<p>My hon. Friend is perfectly right. In a recession, it was right to protect public services. If we had not taken the tough steps that my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer took to correct the budget deficit afterwards, we would be facing a serious situation. The implication of the Labour party's questions is that Labour would not have put taxes up, in which case the debts would have been completely unsupportable.

<p>Opposition policy on interest rates is an enigma wrapped in a mystery; they never tell us whether rates should move higher, lower or sideways. They have no views on the matter whatsoever.

<p>Is it not the truth that the very assumptions behind the Government's claim that people are an extra &#x00A3;9 a week better off in terms of living standards have been shot to pieces, on the one hand by the Government's driving up taxes and charges&#x2014;putting up rail fares, driving up the council tax by at least


8 per cent., as the Chief Secretary admitted, and with prescription charges going up as well, as we will see today&#x2014;and, on the other hand, by the fact that millions of public sector workers will not now receive a full 4 per cent. increase in 1996?

<p>I can answer that very shortly. The answer is no, because the forecast took into account the matters to which the hon. Gentleman refers.

<p>The reason our exports are not doing so well is that other countries are not doing as well we are.

Nevertheless, we expect&#x2014;as does everybody&#x2014;an increase in disposable consumer income this year. Everyone accepts that conditions for investment are very good. Manufacturing investment went up by 12 per cent. last year alone. It could achieve at least that this year. It is not true that we have a declining

manufacturing base; manufacturing is continuing to do extremely well in this country and will do better when other countries begin to match our performance and provide the markets for our goods and services again.</p>

<p>Does my right hon. Friend agree that the level of growth in this country will help the continued fall in unemployment? Is he aware that, in January, unemployment in France hit the 3 million mark and that it is forecast to hit 4 million this month in Germany?

<p>I strongly agree with the implication of my hon. Friend's question. I do not think that there has been a time since records began when the relationship between British and German unemployment was so favourable to us. It is no benefit to us that the German economy is slowing down, but it cannot be denied&#x2014; German leaders are now saying this&#x2014;that the over-taxing and over-regulation of that economy is largely the cause of its slowing down.</p>

<p>The Minister would not want me to nit-pick about the fact that the reunification of Germany has had a significant effect on the figures.<br/>

<p>It would be unwise of the hon. Gentleman to nit-pick in the way that he suggests, because unemployment in the former West Germany is increasing too, I am sorry to say, so his argument would be invalid.<br/>
Growth in the United Kingdom in the coming year will outpace that in Germany and in most of our competitor countries. That is happening because the liberal economics that the Government have been following are right, and the type of mid-1960s so-called stakeholder economy favoured by the Labour party is producing exactly the wrong results.</p>

<p>We plan to follow the precedents for a weighty report of this nature, and to permit Opposition spokesmen to see the report several hours before the statement is made. Of course, the House will also wish to study and comment on the report. That is why we propose to find time in Government time for an early debate on the report a few days after the statement has been made, once the whole House has had the opportunity to study the report and comment on it on the basis of detail, not of innuendo and smear, which has been the nature of the comments thus far from a number of Opposition Members.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister will be aware of the call for an international boycott of Campbell Soups and Fray Bentos products, arising out of the appalling decision by the company to close down the highly profitable Homepride plant in my constituency&#x2014; having purchased it for &#x00A3;58.6 million only 11 weeks earlier. Are not the real stakeholders in Homepride not the greedy shareholders in America who do not give a damn about the people of Maryport, but the work force who have invested their lives in making that company a success and who are now being put on the scrap heap?

<p>I realise the extent of the disappointment that must be felt at Maryport over the decision.

I also understand the depth of the hon. Gentleman's concern for his constituents, but I hope that he and everyone else will bear in mind the fact that Campbell's has been in the United Kingdom for over 30 years. It employs more than 2,000 people here and has shown its commitment to the United Kingdom by investing more than &#x00A3;100 million here in the past 12 months.

<p>I thank the Leader of the House for that information. I am sure that the House will welcome the final piece of information and the advance warning. I thank the right hon. Gentleman also for moving the debate on local government regulations from late on Tuesday evening to Wednesday. I think that that will be for the convenience of the House.<br/>
What further information can the Leader of the House give us in response to Madam Speaker's statement yesterday about access to the Scott report? Will he confirm that the Government are proposing that Her Majesty's Official Opposition should have only six hours' prior sight of the report next Thursday morning? What are the Government's intentions about providing access to the

report to Back-Bench Members, about which I could make some suggestions? Does the right hon. Gentleman think that it is in the spirit of Madam Speaker's statement yesterday that Ministers should have eight days to consider the report while the Opposition have only six hours?<br/>
Will the Leader of the House confirm that the debate that he has announced for a week on Monday will be a one-day debate or the start of a two-day debate? There has been some speculation about that.<br/>
The Leader of the House has announced that on Monday the House will debate EU matters covered by section 5 of the European Communities (Amendment) Act 1986. May I suggest to the right hon. Gentleman that that debate does not negate the need for a debate on the items recommended for consideration on the Floor of the House by a unanimous decision of the European scrutiny committees? That is a matter that I have raised with the right hon. Gentleman for the past three weeks. When does he expect that we shall be able to debate them? When can we expect the White Paper on the intergovernmental conference?<br/>
Perhaps the Leader of the House will tell us also when there will be further meetings of the European Standing Committees. They were meeting twice a week before Christmas and they still has outstanding business to consider, but it seems that since one of them passed a unanimous decision on the IGC documents, which was embarrassing to the Government, they have been closed down completely. What are the Government's plans for that Committee?<br/>
Does the Leader of the House recall the request that I made to him a fortnight ago for a debate on the waste of money due to the mismatch between social security payments and entitlements? Does the right hon. Gentleman think it appropriate to debate the Government's proposals to cut by 25 per cent. the administrative budget of the Department of Social Security? Surely the need for such a debate has become more urgent so that we can ascertain whether what the Secretary of State for Social Security described today as "process re-engineering" will undermine the Government's anti-fraud strategy. We need to debate that issue.<br/>
Finally, will the Leader of the House confirm or deny the suggestion that the Government have decided to press ahead with the privatisation of Her Majesty's Stationery Office without any further reference to the House? The right hon. Gentleman will be aware of the strength of feeling on the issue and will recall that when a debate took place&#x2014;the House did not divide&#x2014;right hon. and hon. Members on both sides of the House said explicitly that the privatisation process should not be finalised without the House being able to make a decision. Will the right hon. Gentleman ensure that a final decision is taken by the House itself and not by Ministers behind closed doors?</p>

<p>That was rather a long list. Perhaps I might start by expressing my gratitude to the hon. Lady for her words about the recess announcement and about her response to the usual channels' representations about the local government order, which is now to be taken on Wednesday.<br/>
My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister indicated a few minutes ago that the intention would be, in line with comparable reports in the past, that Opposition spokesmen


would be able to see the Scott Report some hours before publication. [HON. MEMBERS: "Disgraceful."] Hon. Members say "disgraceful", but if they take account of numerous precedents, they will find that what is proposed is properly in line with precedent. For Members of the House generally, I anticipate that&#x2014;again in accordance with comparably weighty reports&#x2014;the report will be made available when my right hon. Friend the President of the Board of Trade makes his statement, which I expect will be at 3.30.<br/>
On the debate for Monday 26 February, about which I gave the House early notice, I intended my announcement to be in respect of a one-day debate.<br/>
On European Community matters, which the hon. Lady raised, of course I acknowledge that the debate intended for Monday 12 February should not be a substitute for what is being pressed for by the European Standing Committees. We are still considering their recommendations and I hope to be able to respond shortly to the proposals.<br/>
On the IGC White Paper, about which the hon. Lady asked me last week, I cannot add to what I said then.<br/>
On scrutiny committees, I have written today to the hon. Member for North-East Derbyshire (Mr. Barnes) and indicated that I hope to make further progress shortly.<br/>
On social security, again the hon. Lady will have heard what my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister said. I can assume only that she, like the Liberal Democrats, who have consistently demanded that the Government reduce administrative costs, now wants a debate to press the Government to increase administrative costs, or at the very least to end the effort to keep those costs down. I see no reason to suppose that what my right hon. Friend proposes will in any way diminish or damage the drive against fraud.<br/>
On HMSO, as the House knows, there is no need for further parliamentary proceedings before a decision is made, and therefore I do not anticipate such proceedings.</p>

<p>That question verges on the irresponsible. The hon. Gentleman must know that there is nothing new about the way in which the war pensions system operates, going back over many decades.

<p>Is the Leader of the House aware of all the significant developments that are, or could be, taking place in football?

Those decisions are being taken by unelected people&#x2014;general supporters have no input. There is no Parliament for football supporters. The people who are taking the decisions are self-appointed. Should we not have that debate here? We are the Parliament for football supporters and we should debate those developments.

<p>At Prime Minister's Question Time, the Prime Minister talked about precedents. The Leader of the House has also talked about comparable precedents. What precedents does he have in mind? If it is the Franks report, I gave evidence for an hour and 25 minutes to Lord Franks and his colleagues and I assure the Leader of the House that there is no precedent there. First, what precedents does he have in mind?<br/>
In reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Ms Jackson), did we hear the right hon. Gentleman wrong when he said that Ministers and civil servants would be treated in exactly the same way? Therefore, is a civil servant like Sir Stephen Egerton, who gave evidence to Scott, to get a copy of the report eight days before it appears, like the Chief Secretary to the Treasury? The relevant question that my hon. Friend asked was whether civil servants who may be criticised, like Sir Stephen Egerton, were going to be treated like Ministers. What is the answer? Will Sir Stephen Egerton,

whom I use as one example, get his report eight days beforehand? If he does not, the Minister's reply is misleading to the House, although doubtless he did not mean it to be.</p>

We should have a debate because there is a Government circular on policy which will be of concern to Labour and Conservative Members. Policy is not being properly and equally applied.

<p>On a point of order, Madam Speaker. Last year you were helpful and made a ruling that, when a parliamentary question affected an individual constituency, hon. Members should be given notice of it. As far as I know, Ministers have complied with that ruling. Today, during business questions, the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) asked a similar question, on which I do not think you have ever been asked to reflect. She asked whether, when a written question is answered which directly affects a large number of hon. Members, the same sort of protection could be given so that we are aware of the answers before the rest of the world and do not face the difficulty that you dealt with last year.<br/>
That issue relates to the subject of reports, which was raised with the Leader of the House. I heard your ruling yesterday, Madam Speaker, and I know that reports to Ministers are clearly different, although, as Ministers are accountable to Parliament, those reports are made, indirectly, to Parliament. The Leader of the House gave an assurance that the report would be available to us at the same time as to the press. Perhaps you, Madam Speaker, could reflect on whether reports to Ministers could be encompassed in the same ruling as that on parliamentary answers that are of general interest.</p>

<speech hansard_id="1107876" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1996-02-08a.485.1" hansard_membership_id="5276" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2769" speakername="The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. William Hague)" colnum="485" time="16:16:00">
<p>I beg to move,
<q>That the Local Government Finance Report (Wales) 1996&#x2013;97 (House of Commons Paper No. 141), which was laid before this House on 1st February, be approved.</q>
I understand that with this it will be convenient to discuss also the following motion:
<q>That the Limitation of Council Tax and Precepts (Notional Amounts) Report (Wales) 1996&#x2013;97 (House of Commons Paper No. 142), which was laid before this House on 1st February, be approved.</q>
The finance report sets out my decisions on the local government revenue settlement for 1996&#x2013;97. The standard spending assessments specified in the report have been calculated in accordance with a formula agreed with the local authority associations. The notional amounts report sets out the amounts in lieu of budget requirements for 1995&#x2013;96, which I propose to use to measure the coming year's budget increases for the purposes of capping. Those notional amounts reflect historic spending patterns in unitary authority areas and preserve the spending power of the new authorities.<br/>
As the House will recall from my statement in December, I propose to allow total standard spending, or TSS, of &#x00A3;2.867 billion for local government in Wales in 1996&#x2013;97. That is an increase of &#x00A3;85 million, or 3.1 per cent., on the previous year. It includes &#x00A3;331 million for the four Welsh police authorities&#x2014; &#x00A3;2.463 billion in standard spending assessments for the 22 new unitary authorities, and &#x00A3;72 million in specific grants such as probation service grant and national park grant. Under my provisional capping criteria, each local authority in Wales can, if it sees fit, increase its expenditure in comparison with its notional amount by at least 3.4 per cent.<br/>
The settlement allows police spending to increase by 5.1 per cent., and follows an increase of more than 11 per cent. in police budgets last year. It corrects the historic underfunding of police services by county councils prior to 1995&#x2013;96, and it enables Welsh police forces to build on their success in combating crime, and to make communities safer places in which to live and work. The chief constables of all four Welsh forces have welcomed the settlement.<br/>
I propose to provide &#x00A3;2.517 billion in central Government support, known as aggregate external finance or AEF, in support of total standard spending&#x2014;an increase of &#x00A3;52 million, or 2.2 per cent., on the previous year. That amounts to &#x00A3;860 per person in Wales&#x2014;about &#x00A3;130, or 18 per cent., more than the level planned for England. It is 87.8 per cent. of total standard spending, compared with 79 per cent. of total standard spending in England. AEF comprises &#x00A3;1.792 million in revenue support grant, &#x00A3;459 million in distributable non-domestic rates, &#x00A3;237.8 million in specific grants&#x2014;which includes the police grant to be made by the Home Secretary&#x2014;and &#x00A3;29 million for council tax damping to cover the impact of council tax increases arising from the disaggregation of budgets last year.</p>

<p>Will the Secretary of State confirm that, if local authorities increase their

expenditure in line with the likely 4 per cent. settlement for public sector pay, do not spend more than the expenditure limits recognised by the Welsh Office, and do not raise their council tax by more than the rate of inflation, they will still have a shortfall of several million pounds&#x2014;as in the case of the new Caernarfonshire-Merionethshire authority? That would inevitably lead to the closure of rural schools, the retraction of care in the community services, and even the closure of leisure centres for two or three days a week. Is that not inevitable with this settlement?</p>

<p>The pay awards announcement will be made separately. I must tell the hon. Member that the settlement level for each authority is the product of the standard spending assessment formula, which is agreed with the local authority associations, the actual level of total standard spending and aggregate external finance, which I am setting out here.<br/>
If the hon. Gentleman or other hon. Members say that the amount of support that is given to an individual local authority should be different, they must argue that either the SSA formula should be changed or the total amount of support should be different. The hon. Member for Caernarfon may well be able to do that, but no one has yet told me what is the right amount for local government if the amount that I propose is wrong. I must pose that question to Opposition Members.</p>

<p>Is it not rather disingenuous to say that the pay settlements are separate? They substantially impact on local authorities and on the amount of money available to them. For example, the Welsh Office has information about the effect of the previous teachers' pay settlement on teacher numbers. We know that the teacher settlement for the coming year is 3.8 per cent, which is bound to have an effect on the number of teachers in our schools. What estimate has the Welsh Office made of the likely reduction of teachers as a direct result of the settlement?</p>

<p>The total effect will not be 3.8 per cent., because of the way in which the Government propose to stage the increases. We are making a 3.1 per cent. increase in total standard spending and a 2.7 per cent. increase in the amount of money that the Government give to local authorities. That is more than the likely increase in the outturn of expenditure by the Welsh Office, which in turn is more than the increase in expenditure for the Government as a whole.<br/>
Local authorities are therefore receiving at least their full share of the increase in Government expenditure for the coming year. We are entitled to expect local authorities to make improvements and administrative savings that are similar to those made by central Government during the coming year, so that they can minimise the consequences for the council tax payer.</p>

<p>The sophisticated presentation of the figures will not wash in Neath and Port Talbot, because the new authorities will have to make cuts of &#x00A3;7 million which have nothing to do with their own efficiency or attempts to reorganise services. This punitive, paltry and pathetic settlement will discriminate against the Neath and Port Talbot side of West Glamorgan, and will mean that some council tax payers&#x2014;


in Trebanos village, for example&#x2014;will pay &#x00A3;50 more than their neighbours across the road. The settlement has nothing to do with local decisions, and everything to do with the Secretary of State's failure to deal with the councils' complaints about this matter.</p>

<p>As the hon. Gentleman knows, Neath and Port Talbot is one of the authorities that benefit from the damping schemes that I have announced. The hon. Gentleman is an Opposition Front-Bench spokesman, although in this debate he speaks from the Back Benches. Opposition Front-Bench Members have not been able to say&#x2014;we wait with interest to discover whether they are able to tell us in this debate&#x2014;what the settlement level should be. The hon. Gentleman thinks that the level I have announced is paltry. We look forward to hearing what the right amount would be, and we look forward to hearing the Labour party committing itself to it.<br/>
In addition to the revenue package that I have announced, I am providing local authorities with &#x00A3;508 million for capital programmes next year, and with &#x00A3;42 million towards the transitional costs of local government reorganisation. In all, local authorities will receive &#x00A3;83 million towards their transitional costs over the two years, from 1995 to 1997.<br/>
The responsibility for setting budgets and determining council tax levels lies with local authorities. Capping exists to enable me to restrain public expenditure, and capping rules acknowledge that, historically, the majority of Welsh local authorities&#x2014;not all&#x2014;have chosen to budget above the standard spending assessment.<br/>
However, provisional capping limits are not spending targets that I lay down. Local authorities have the discretion to set their budgets below capping limits, although many authorities seem to want to set their council tax as high as capping limits permit. That is one factor that the Opposition must consider when they advocate scrapping capping limits altogether. There would undoubtedly be an impact on council tax levels.</p>

<p>Surely the Secretary of State recognises that many local authorities have no alternative but to set their budgets at the capping level. If Anglesey county council, for example, had a standstill budget&#x2014;the same budget as that allocated to Gwynedd and Ynys Mon last year&#x2014;it would have a budget of &#x00A3;63 million. Under the capping arrangement, the council is not allowed to spend more than &#x00A3;61 million. What alternative does that give the county council? Is it not inevitable that services will suffer?</p>

<p>It is not good enough for people responsible for spending public money to say that they have no alternative to courses of action, such as the maximum level of taxation available to them. All of us who are responsible for spending public money have to use that money as efficiently and effectively as we can. I have announced the measures that we are taking in the Welsh Office, and I will refer to them again in a moment. Local authorities vary greatly in how good they are at spending their money efficiently and effectively. I will refer to the record of one or two authorities in a moment.<br/>
It was because I was concerned by reports that a majority of local authorities planned to budget up to the limit implied by my provisional capping principles that

I announced last week an additional targeted damping scheme. It will ensure that, excluding any increases in community council precepts, no council tax increase can exceed 25 per cent., and I expect the great majority of increases to be well below that level.<br/>
The sum involved in the scheme is additional to aggregate external finance. I want to direct the resources to where they are most needed. When taken with aggregate external finance, including the &#x00A3;29.1 million available for disaggregation damping, the total level of Government support for local government revenue spending is brought to &#x00A3;2.533 billion in Wales, which is an increase of 2.7 per cent. The figure is virtually identical to that in other parts of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>Let us be honest. The Secretary of State knows by now that local government finance is not a science, and that it is a very inexact art. In this year above all years, with all the problems related to disaggregation, and with only notional sums being taken into account, should not the Secretary of State be far more flexible in relation to the capping limits? We may well find that mistakes have been made in the calculation, and that local authorities will have no alternative but to cut significantly services that, in the past, they would have been able to protect.</p>

<p>The capping limits this year are more flexible than they were in previous years. That is partly in recognition of the particular circumstances, although we are spending a great deal of money to fund the transitional costs for local government. The hon. Gentleman must remember that, when I make capping limits more flexible, the immediate response of local authorities is to say, "Right, we will spend all the way up to our capping limits, whatever that means for the council tax." I introduced an additional damping scheme in the light of that.</p>

<p>Will the Secretary of State tell us something about the methodology used in the distribution of the extra moneys provided at the end of January, and tell us whether there was any consultative process to enable unitary authorities to make representations to him? Is it not unreasonable that no additional moneys remain available to the new Ceredigion county council, so that the band D council tax will be &#x00A3;508&#x2014;&#x00A3;80 more than in Cardiff, which obtained an additional &#x00A3;3.6 million, even though the Ceredigion average income is far less?

<p>The decisions that I announced at the end of January 1996 were the result of a process of consultation on my original proposals. That consultation ended on 5 January 1996, so I announced the additional proposals when I had reviewed all responses to the consultation.<br/>
I understand the hon. Gentleman's argument. Historically, council tax levels are higher in the area of his constituency, but I have targeted the additional help to places where council tax increases threaten to be the largest, because the anxieties that were expressed to me were overwhelmingly about the level of change that might take place, not the level that existed for historic reasons


and because of previous spending decisions, which we cannot go back and unravel now. I allocated the additional money on that basis.</p>

<p>As my right hon. Friend knows, I was a West Glamorgan county councillor for six years. During that time, I spoke to many people in West Glamorgan who were supremely grateful for the fact that the Government had capping in place, because the Labour county councillors were sweating with hope that, at some time, capping would be lifted, so that they could push spending through the roof. Yes, the people of Wales want their services to be protected, but we must do all we can to protect the people of Wales from high-spending Labour councillors.</p>

<p>I must make progress if we are to have time for hon. Members to take part in the debate.<br/>
I have been worried about reports of the possible closure of Theatr Clwyd, and I have carefully considered the case made to me and my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Cardiff, North (Mr. Jones), by the new Flintshire authority for additional help from central Government. I share its opinion that Theatr Clwyd should continue to provide the high-quality productions for which it is famous. I have decided to provide, via the Arts Council of Wales, a one-off grant of &#x00A3;1.3 million to pay off completely Theatr Clwyd's outstanding capital debt.<br/>
My offer is subject to satisfactory assurances from Flintshire and other successor authorities to Clwyd county council that they will give the theatre the support it needs to continue to operate on its present basis for the foreseeable future, and I need such assurances by 8 March 1996. That is a major contribution to securing the future viability of the theatre, and I hope that it will be welcomed by hon. Members.</p>

<p>As the Member of Parliament representing Mold, where Theatr Clwyd is situated, I welcome the Secretary of State's announcement. Flintshire county council, my hon. Friend the Member for Alyn and Deeside (Mr. Jones) and I made strong representations to the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Cardiff, North (Mr. Jones), about the future of Theatr Clwyd. I am sure that today's announcement will give a kick start to the local authorities adjacent to Flintshire to help with those contributions.<br/>
It is a first step. There remains a major shortfall of perhaps &#x00A3;300,000 to &#x00A3;400,000, and I hope that the door will not be closed. We also need to consider the ability of the Secretary of State to kick-start the Arts Council of Wales as a "next steps" agency.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his welcome. As he says, he and the hon. Member

for Alyn and Deeside made representations, as did my hon. Friend the Member for City of Chester (Mr. Brandreth) in the Whips Office, so there was concern on both sides of the House. The sum of &#x00A3;1.3 million in taxpayers' money to write off the theatre's debt completely is a major contribution.

<p>I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North (Mr. Jones) and the right hon. Gentleman and his Parliamentary Under-Secretary for receiving the deputations and considering the strong case that we made.

Does he agree that Theatr Clwyd is the jewel in the crown of Welsh theatre production?</p>

<p>I agree with the hon. Gentleman's last point. Local authorities in Wales and in England must make their own decisions about the support they give. However, I hope that the people responsible for the management and finances of the theatre will take every opportunity to market it effectively in the future, in terms of obtaining both support and custom. The Government have given the theatre an opportunity for the future, which we want to see it take up.<br/>
My settlement proposals give local government the resources it needs to maintain services in the first year of the new unitary arrangements. Inflation is low, and it is forecast to remain so. I acknowledge that difficult choices must often be made&#x2014;that is true for all who are responsible for spending taxpayers' money. All councils must make every effort to use their resources as wisely as possible. Many councillors try to do that, but not all achieve it.<br/>
If we can believe what we read in the newspapers, one local authority&#x2014;Rhondda Cynon Taff county borough council&#x2014;proposes to spend more than &#x00A3;20,000 on a new mayoral chain. That is a large sum to spend when the mayor could make use of the regalia of one or more of his predecessors. When things such as that happen&#x2014;albeit involving a relatively small amount of money&#x2014;people are bound to question council priorities.<br/>
The same authority has ambitious plans for a new headquarters which will cost in excess of &#x00A3;20 million. Of course, the council needs a place to meet and the staff need a place to work, and the Government have assisted the council with accommodation for the time being. I recently announced support for six authorities which plan to build new accommodation or to upgrade existing buildings. However, those six authorities will spend less between them than that one authority plans to spend. Council tax payers have a right to ask for a more modest approach.<br/>
I do not want, or need, to single out that one authority: in some areas, leading councillors will be paid allowances as great as &#x00A3;23,000. The Blaenau Gwent county borough council is the 17th largest authority in Wales in population terms, but it has the fifth most expensive chief officers' structure. It has more chief officer posts than any authority, apart from Swansea county council, which serves three times the population.<br/>
Councillors in Blaenau Gwent have voted themselves allowances which are six times greater than those paid to the elected members of the old Blaenau Gwent authority. We are told that travel and subsistence will be paid in addition, but there is no requirement for councillors to turn up to meetings. That raises questions about the priorities of local government.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State will recall my suggestion that he follow the example set by his counterpart for Scotland and introduce a mandatory scheme to stop any existing abuses. I urge him to introduce such a mandatory scheme. If he is so minded, he will have the full support of the Opposition. If he is not, upon their election, a Labour Government will take action to stop any such abuses.</p>

<p>That is an interesting position. The hon. Gentleman has said that there should be mandatory schemes because councillors are not fit to decide their allowance arrangements, but he believes that capping should be abolished so that councillors can freely decide on the impositions to be placed on everyone else.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman's approach is inconsistent. The Government should not have to instruct local authorities about such matters: they should have the discretion to make those choices. Council tax payers who hear their local councils ask the Government for more money should question whether the councils are spending money wisely, and whether the expenditure is necessary.</p>

<p>No, I must get on with my speech.<br/>
In the restraint of public expenditure, I am asking no more of local government than of other public sector borrowers. I informed the House in December of my plan to reduce my Department's running costs by 8 per cent. in cash terms over the next three years. Organisations that are responsible for large sums of public money have a duty rigorously to assess their spending priorities and their running costs.<br/>
Reorganisation has given Welsh local government a chance to improve management structures and strategies. Some new authorities have worked on establishing cost-effective management teams to provide taxpayers with better value for money, but others still have work to do. Preparing for reorganisation is a complex process. Much has been accomplished, but much remains to be done. In recognition of that, I am making more than &#x00A3;80 million available to fund transitional costs, but

for reorganisation of local government to work, we need management discipline as well as financial resources from central Government.<br/>
It is clear that we are providing increased resources to local government, that we are making special allowances for reorganisation, and that local authorities are responsible for council tax levels. Only one thing remains unclear&#x2014;the alternative to the size and shape of the proposed settlement.<br/>
Some people have suggested alternatives. To be fair to them, the local authority associations suggested that I should reduce the budgets of the Cardiff Bay development corporation and the housing associations to provide more money for local government. That could in no way have paid for the 19 per cent. increase in revenue funding they sought, but at least they suggested some alternatives, and I respect them for that.<br/>
Plaid Cymru Members, some of whom have intervened, will probably suggest the alternative that there should be more money for the Welsh block overall. They would not be able to make that proposition were Wales not part of the United Kingdom, but they will probably advance it anyway, and it is one point of view. However, not everyone seems willing or able to suggest alternative numbers to those in the reports. Opposition Front-Bench Members are conspicuous among those unable to do so, although they are free with their opinions about other matters.</p>

It is 10 weeks since we published the proposals. It is hard to believe that the Opposition have not thought about what the settlement should be.

<p>I shall not be distracted from asking Members who are against the settlement whether they think it should be higher or lower. We do not necessarily need exact numbers. They could tell us whether it should be a bit higher or much higher.<br/>
Where would they find resources in the Welsh block? Would they come from the health budget that I have increased, the training budget, to which I have directed money, the Countryside Council for Wales, whose budget


I have increased, the Welsh Development Agency, which has received an increase in its grant in aid, or, as the local authorities have suggested, the Cardiff Bay development corporation, although that would stop the barrage halfway through its completion?<br/>

<p>In fairness to all Members, I must continue my speech.<br/>
The settlement that I have announced gives local government a high priority within the Welsh block.

<p>The Secretary of State has been getting in some much-needed practice for his next job in opposition. He is far more concerned to talk about Opposition policies than about his own financial settlement. It is instructive that, although we are discussing a financial settlement dealing with the distribution of some &#x00A3;3 billion of public money, according to the Secretary of State the most important point is the cost of civic regalia in Rhondda Cynon Taff. That reveals his priorities.<br/>
The Secretary of State has tried to convey the message that the settlement is reasonable, that it will not lead to service cuts and that any unreasonable council tax increases will be the fault of local councils, not central Government. On all those counts, the truth is the exact opposite.<br/>
In reality, it is an unreasonable settlement at a time of economic slump. Despite their new responsibilities and a major reorganisation, councils in Wales will face a reduction in Government support. The settlement increases aggregate external finance by 2.2 per cent.

Inflation for the year to December was 3.2 per cent. In real terms, therefore, authorities in Wales face a 1 per cent. cut in their level of support.<br/>
Resources for the police increased last year and the Secretary of State took credit for it. Perhaps he will also take responsibility for the fact that the number of serving police officers has fallen by nearly 200 since 1992 and fell by nearly 100 last year, when he took direct responsibility for funding police authorities in Wales. Yet again, the reality falls far short of Tory manifesto commitments and it is clear that we cannot trust the Government on law and order.</p>

<p>No.<br/>
I would have liked to welcome the extra money for community care, but that increase, for which the Secretary of State claims credit, comes entirely from the budget of the Department of Social Security. When the number of elderly people is dramatically increasing&#x2014;there was a 17 per cent. increase in the number of people aged 65 and over between 1979 and 1994 and it is forecast to increase further&#x2014;not a penny more is being spent on one of the most vulnerable sectors in our society. That is not the whole picture. Excluding the ring-fenced money for police and community care, Wales faces a 2.6 per cent. cut in real-terms provision for such basic services as education, housing and social services.</p>

Education may be a matter of jest for the Secretary of State, because neither he nor his family nor his constituents have to live with the consequences of the cuts that he is imposing. Will he confirm that, as a result of the Government's decision today to increase teachers' salaries by 3.8 per cent., but not to make any more funding available for authorities in Wales, they will have to face additional burdens of the following order? The counties of Dyfed, Gwent and South Glamorgan, or their successor authorities, will have to find a further &#x00A3;4 million. The counties of Clwyd and West Glamorgan will have to find a further &#x00A3;3 million. The county of Mid Glamorgan will have to find a further &#x00A3;5 million. If the people whom the Secretary of State represents, or his family, were being condemned to the squalor


and declining conditions that our children face in their education, I put it to him that he would not be as complacent about this further imposition on Welsh local authorities.<br/>
There will be service cuts in these vital areas, and hardly an authority in Wales will be able to fulfil its plans for investment in the social and economic infrastructure which are needed to face the challenge of the new millennium. The capital settlement this year includes a cash cut of 5 per cent.&#x2014;more than &#x00A3;34 million&#x2014;and a real terms cut of 8 per cent.; that is &#x00A3;50 million less than what is needed just to compensate for inflation.<br/>
I acknowledge that the damping down grant has been introduced, but all that does is put a temporary bandage over the structural and financial crisis facing the poorer Welsh authorities as a result of the per capita redistribution of the former counties' disaggregated budgets. Overall, the Welsh block grant has not been increased, so the &#x00A3;45 million allocated to damping down will have to come from other cuts in Welsh Office expenditure: from the health service and from economic development, for example. Local authorities which this year are benefiting from the damping down grant&#x2014;especially the poorer counties of Rhondda Cynon Taff, Merthyr and Blaenau Gwent&#x2014;will face enormous difficulties next year, because no provision has been made for the continuation of the assistance.<br/>
It is what I would call typical Tory economics&#x2014;sacrificing long-term strategic interests for a short-term political fix. That it is a short-term fix, the Secretary of State made absolutely clear in his press release of 30 January:
<q>I envisage this additional assistance as a one-off, giving authorities time to adjust service expenditure and bring it more in line with their standard spending assessments".</q>
In other words, he intends to sack teachers, spend less on social workers and invest less in the future of our communities. As with so many other areas of Government activity, the problems of today's Tory Government will be left to tomorrow's Labour Government to sort out.<br/>
My hon. Friends will be interested to contrast the Secretary of State's press release entitled
<q>William Hague limits council tax increases</q>
with the facts. The facts are that average council tax increases across Wales will be 17.5 per cent. Twelve local authorities in Wales face increases of more than 20 per cent., and half of all Welsh council tax payers&#x2014;more than 550,000 households&#x2014;face increases of nearly 25 per cent.<br/>
The reason for this state of affairs is quite clear: following years of taking power away from local councils and concentrating it in the hands of central Government, the council tax is now a council tax in name only. Nearly 90 per cent. of local authority expenditure is set and met by central Government, so when the Government cut funds, the burden falls on local government&#x2014;precisely what has happened this year.</p>

<p>On behalf of my constituents I should like to draw to the attention of my hon. Friend the fact

<p>That is precisely my point. My hon. Friend understands very well that 12 local authorities face increases of more than 20 per cent. The cuts mean that a total of &#x00A3;26 million in real terms&#x2014;33 per cent. of what is necessary to keep in line with inflation alone&#x2014;will be lost; and we need look no further than the Secretary of State to attribute responsibility for the crisis facing Welsh local government.<br/>
What I really do not understand is why the right hon. Gentleman is so reluctant to take responsibility. After all, this is a right-wing agenda and the Secretary of State is a self-confessed right-wing Minister. So why is he so coy? Why does he not boast of his achievements? It is part of a right-wing policy to cut public expenditure to fund a pre-election bribe. No matter that tax bribes are taken back at a stroke by council tax increases.<br/>
It is also part of the right hon. Gentleman's right-wing policy to force more public services into the private sector. No matter that the policy itself, like the ill-thought-out nursery voucher scheme, will undermine existing provision. It is part of his right-wing policy to reduce in absolute terms the level and quality of public services&#x2014;in his own words, to roll back the frontiers of the state. No matter that the price for that is paid by communities whose collective future is made insecure, and by individuals whose private lives are blighted by misery.<br/>
I shall offer the Secretary of State just one example of how the life of an individual can be made a misery. On Saturday, the parents of a 15-year-old terminally ill girl came to see me. Her name is Jade Smith, and she lives in Bedwas in my constituency. The girl is mentally and physically handicapped and has been tube-fed for the past five years. At the moment, Mid Glamorgan county council enables her to attend a special school at Ysgol Ty Coch, which is in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells).<br/>
As from April, however, the new Caerphilly authority, which I have the privilege of representing, because of the cash cuts imposed by the Government, will be unable to buy a place in Ysgol Ty Coch, so the authority has had to reclassify one of the homes in which it provides respite care for adults. As a result, my constituent has to go to Ty Gwilym adult respite care centre and share the facility with 30 to 40-year-old adults.<br/>
The first time Jade Smith went there, she had to share the reception area with middle-aged men, over 40, who were mentally disturbed and abusive. The next time she went there, the care assistants were committed to taking out the 30-year-old women who were there for respite care, so there was no one there to look after her except a sitter.<br/>
I offer that as a clear example of the impact that the Government's cuts are having on the quality of public services in Wales. The Secretary of State appears anxious to intervene. I would ask him to take the smile off his face just for a moment and, in his intervention, to tell me whether he thinks that the girl I have described is getting the sort of care that he would want if he were responsible for a 15-year-old terminally ill child.</p>

<p>I gave way to the Secretary of State because I had a particular point to put to him. I am sorry that he does not think that the care of a 15-year-old terminally ill child is sufficiently serious to deserve a serious and responsible answer. It is because of such cases that there is so much anger at the Government. They are quick enough to preach to others about personal responsibility; it is a pity that they do not recognise their responsibilities with the same alacrity.<br/>
The current settlement has two essential flaws. First, the 2.2 per cent. increase in aggregate external finance from &#x00A3;2.4 billion in 1995&#x2013;96 to &#x00A3;2.5 billion in 1996&#x2013;96 falls &#x00A3;26 million short of what is required to keep pace with the 3 per cent. increase in inflation.</p>

<p>In practice, that is the transfer of responsibility from central to local government that was slipped out in an answer to my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Aberavon (Mr. Morris). In a letter to him last year, the Secretary of State said:
<q>I believe that over time local authorities in Wales should raise a higher proportion of their income from Council Tax. The 11 per cent increase is the result of this approach.</q>
There are many local authorities in Wales that would relish the prospect of reducing their increase to 11 per cent., but far from protecting Welsh interests in the Cabinet the Secretary of State, like his predecessor, has set in train a deliberate policy of disadvantaging Wales vis-a-vis the rest of the United Kingdom.<br/>

<p>Now that the hon. Member for South Dorset (Mr. Bruce) has left, I am sure that the quality of the debate will improve.<br/>
This year, that unacceptable gap is widening still further. The Welsh average increase of 17.5 per cent. is much higher than the Scottish increase and more than double the figure that the Chief Secretary to the Treasury

mentioned. We know, therefore, that it is now official Conservative policy to force council tax increases, and to force higher increases in Wales than elsewhere.<br/>
This year's average increase of 17.5 per cent. has more than wiped out the cut of 1p in the standard rate of income tax in the Budget. The council tax rises will cost Welsh taxpayers about &#x00A3;69 million extra this year. The Conservative party and Conservative party policies have failed Wales.<br/>
The dependency culture that has arisen under the Conservatives has placed increasing burdens on local authorities. Reliance on income support has increased by 81 per cent. That is the dependency culture, courtesy of the Conservatives. Reliance on housing benefit has increased by 54 per cent.&#x2014;the dependency culture, courtesy of the Conservatives. Reliance on council tax benefit has increased by 107 per cent.&#x2014;the dependency culture, courtesy of the Conservatives. Reliance on family credit has increased by 580 per cent.&#x2014;the dependency culture, courtesy of the Conservatives.<br/>
Since 1979, Welsh local authorities have struggled valiantly to serve their communities. It is predictable that the settlement reflects the failure of Conservative policies, rather than Labour's aspirations for building for the future. Opposition Members hope that it will be a very long time before Wales is ever again served by such an incompetent and uncaring Government.</p>

<p>The speech by the hon. Member for Caerphilly (Mr. Davies) was more remarkable for what he did not say than for what he said. He was on the horns of a dilemma, because much of the speech was devoted to more spending and his approval of that, but at the same time he was not quite sure how that spending was to be paid for. The hon. Gentleman seemed to react with horror to the idea of council tax increases, and so one can conclude that the only remedy in his mind to meet the high spending that he proposed was an increase in the aggregate external finance. That, of course, is composed of grant from the Exchequer&#x2014;in other words, taxpayers' money&#x2014;and money that comes from businesses in Wales. Therefore, the only conclusion that we can draw from the hon. Gentleman's remarks, which we did not hear, is that commercial rates would go up in Wales.<br/>
We should appreciate the full extent of the support given by central Government and businesses to local authority spending in Wales. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State referred to the fact that 87 per cent. of the total standard spending is provided by the Exchequer and business rate payers. That amounts to some &#x00A3;864 a person in Wales, compared with 79 per cent. or &#x00A3;732 a person in England. Council tax payers in Wales have a head start of &#x00A3;132, which should not be disdained. Of course, that advantage recognises the different circumstances and needs that prevail in Wales. That advantage will be maintained, if local authorities keep their total spending down to the levels set by the Government.<br/>
As well as that advantage, we have the capping regime, which is designed to protect the domestic rate payer against excessive demands. We in Wales are very favourably treated, and long may that continue. I wonder how long it will continue, because there is clearly a


change in the wind. During a debate on local government finance in England, the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) said:
<q>The Labour party &#x2026; would return the business rate &#x2026; to local control."&#x2014; [<i>Official Report,</i> 31 January 1996; Vol. 270, c. 1029.]</q>
Some of us remember the days when that was the case. Business people complained bitterly about the rate burden imposed upon them by Labour local authorities. Of course, the business rate was increased, as it was so much easier to sting businesses than domestic rate payers, because business people had fewer votes to cast at local government elections.<br/>
We did not hear a commitment to the return of the business rate to local control in Wales, but it was implicit in the speech by the hon. Member for Caerphilly. I have to warn him that there would be dire consequences for businesses. We remember only too well how local control of the business rate had an adverse effect on employment in the past, and there is every prospect that that would happen again in the future. Every commercial rate payer should sit up and take note of what might be in store for them.<br/>
If the business rate were returned to local control, there would be enormous disparities throughout Wales. The industrialised areas would be enriched, and the rural areas impoverished, unless there was a very substantial change in the grant system or agricultural land was rated. That is an idea that has never been far from the minds of right hon. and hon. Members of the Opposition, so the farmers had better sit up and take notice too.<br/>
The return of the business rate to local control is not the only change proposed by the Opposition. Again, I refer to the speech by the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, in which he proposed the abolition of compulsory competitive tendering. That can only mean, as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State suggested, increased staff for local authorities and increased costs for council tax payers. That is what will happen. It is all spelt out in the document entitled "Renewing democracy, rebuilding communities", which was issued by the Labour party.<br/>
It is not surprising that Opposition Members are minded to change current council tax bands and to abolish the restraint on local authorities that is provided by the capping procedure. The Welsh electorate can contemplate council tax rates soaring under a possible future Labour Government to whatever heights our local masters think appropriate, subject only to the Secretary of State's reserve capping powers, which are to be used only when all else has failed.<br/>
I was interested when the hon. Member for Caerphilly made an offer to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to put a lid on some of the abuses by local authorities that my right hon. Friend reeled off. The hon. Gentleman offered to assist. What power does he think he has as an Opposition spokesman for Wales? He has no power, and local authorities in Wales can tell him to go to kingdom come.</p>

<p>I am glad to hear that.<br/>
There should not, of course, be the abuses that we have heard about. Local authorities are directly elected and they should behave responsibly. The hon. Gentleman and the Labour party clearly have in mind a considerable increase in local authority spending. They are doffing their caps to higher spending. I hope that council tax payers in Wales will take account of that.<br/>
We are discussing an important statement for local government in Wales, it being the first for the new unitary authorities. There should be a saving as a result of reducing two tiers of local government to one. I am sure that there will be a reduction in due course. I am glad that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has been able to increase the permissible spend by about &#x00A3;85.6 million, or 3.1 per cent., for next year. I am grateful for the transitional funding that he has provided. My guess is that the new authorities will do well and make a good fist of their responsibilities in time.<br/>
Unfortunately, the new authorities have a cloud on their horizon in the shape of the Welsh Assembly that has been proposed by the Opposition and confirmed last night by the right hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair), the leader of the Opposition. If the unitary authorities are to have their financial allocations decided by the assembly, I can foresee endless troubles ahead. It will be devil take the hindmost&#x2014;in other words, devil take the worst represented, sparsely populated rural areas.<br/>
The equality of treatment secured in Wales by the complicated formulae that are before us will disappear before the massed ranks of the assemblymen from the heavily populated areas. Couple that with the disparity caused by local control of commercial rates, and we have a scene set for civil strife such as we have not seen since the middle ages. If we in the north suffer too much in the proposed scenario, I am sure that we shall produce our Owain Glyndwr, who will take over Caerphilly castle and throw out the robber baron.<br/>
The mind boggles at the prospect of the proposed assembly dealing with local government expenditure throughout Wales. Unfortunately, however, the prospect is real enough, as is the unfairness that may result. My right hon. Friend and his officials at the Welsh Office


hold the balance between authorities. They are there to ensure fairness in the distribution of resources throughout Wales.<br/>
I ask a key question, which I hope the hon. Member for Caerphilly will answer: who will perform the function that I have described if we have an assembly to rule us? If the hon. Gentleman cannot answer the question now, I hope that he will at least give it some consideration. The assembly will be an extra tier of government, and extra tiers do not come cheap. It will have to be paid for in some way, probably with money that might otherwise be spent on local Government services, or perhaps on the health service. Both areas are major consumers of Welsh Office money.<br/>
If we are to have an all-Wales dimension to local government, there is much to be said for developing the role of the unitary authorities. We have already established by statute the consultative council that has responsibility for local government finance, with which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State discusses resource issues in advance of a settlement. Possibly these discussions need to be amplified. In that context, perhaps there should be greater scope to deal in more detail with specific responsibilities such as education or social services. That is one possibility. It would not be impossible to devise a similar forum for the health service.<br/>
We carry responsibility. Whatever happens in local government must be reconciled with our parliamentary system, which must always have ultimate responsibility to the electorate. We would be foolish to try to escape that responsibility by foisting it on others.<br/>
We shall hear a great deal about particular needs that should be met, and needs that will have to be paid for. I was delighted to hear the announcement by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State about Theatr Clwyd. We must remember that those who demand more spending object to council tax increases in the same speech, and almost in the same breath. More expenditure seems to be fine providing that someone else is paying for it. I hope that that is not our approach in our private lives. Unfortunately, it is one that some of us seem to regard as acceptable in our role as public advocates.<br/>
The settlement is fair and as sound as we could wish it to be. It represents a challenge to the new authorities to secure good value for the money that the Government, through the taxpayer, have given them.</p>

<p>I am glad to follow the right hon. Member for Conwy (Sir W. Roberts), but I disagree with his master classes. My speech will be briefer than his.<br/>
There are many large aging council estates in my constituency and they need urgent regrading, upgrading, modernisation and repair. Built before and after world war two, they are in real need of investment. In the townships of Buckley, Saltney, Shotton, Garden city and elsewhere, windows, doors and roofs are rotting away. My constituents increasingly despair of the situation. Alyn and Deeside district council has a good housing record, but its problems, as I have seen when visiting the localities, are very real indeed, and the new Flintshire county council will inherit them.<br/>
The terrible cold and ensuing damp, and the mountainous snow and a chilling cold wind have turned my constituents' homes into iceboxes. The cold is literally making some of my constituents who are trapped in their houses ill. I know of distraught mothers who feel that they cannot let their youngsters sleep in bedrooms that are without central heating. The wind and frost penetrate their rooms. Mould grows on the walls of the bedrooms and ice forms on the windows.<br/>
Any youngster prone to asthma or any bronchitic disorder does not need those conditions, and neither do elderly tenants who are prone to arthritis. Hundreds of my most respectable constituents dread winter's advance, particularly after the terrible weather that we have had. They are in severe difficulties. In less serious conditions, I have received petitions from constituents in the townships.<br/>
Will the Secretary of State give serious consideration to the release of council house sales receipts that have accrued in my local authorities, as the authorities wish to invest them only to bring relief to the beleaguered families that I have described? It would be a powerful intervention if the right hon. Gentleman did that. If he does not do that now, will he do so in the near future?<br/>
In terms of the schools service, will the Secretary of State undertake to fund the teachers' pay settlement in full? If he were to say that he will do that, the new unitary authorities would be more confident that they could tackle the real problems that they know that they will inherit. I do not wish to see emergency meetings of school governors and parent-teacher associations desperate to bail out their local schools from the financial problems that they envisage. Nor do I want pupils with special needs to lose. I note the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly (Mr. Davies) made. All of us could give examples of these problems.<br/>
I do not want any youngster with special needs to lose as a consequence of the defects of this settlement. I do not want even more pressure to be put on class teachers, who are groaning under the incessant demands of Ministers issuing their latest and ever more demanding curriculum fiats. It is time for Ministers to stop putting the pressure on class teachers. They do a good job. They are doing their best, and the Government have gone too far. Stability is needed and it is time for the Government to rest their case for further change. The morale of class teachers is very low, so the chance of our children getting the best start in life is diminished.<br/>
It is the fate of the new unitary councils to start their uncertain lives desperately short of money. It is a very cynical scene that they inherit.</p>

<p>No, I hope to conclude shortly.<br/>
It is a cynical scene. Grants will be cut. The council tax is certain to go up, and will do so in a big way. Services to our constituents&#x2014;the taxpayers&#x2014;will be cut. Labour Members know that Ministers on the Treasury Bench have not delivered a top-class financial settlement. We believe that they must take responsibility for these serious shortcomings, and at the very least, to help our new councils, undertake to pay the teachers' salary increase in full.<br/>
In an election year&#x2014;that is what we are looking at in the new financial year&#x2014;the Government expect the councils to carry the blame for the large increases in council tax. In my view, the new Flintshire county council deserves better from the Government, and the large-scale increases in the council tax will surely be seen at home in our constituencies as the consequence of inadequate ministerial allocations.</p>

<p>First, in reply to a point made by the hon. Member for Alyn and Deeside (Mr. Jones), who seemed to be following the precedent set by the hon. Member for Caerphilly (Mr. Davies) in not taking interventions, I should point out that there is a clear trade-off between the level of teachers' pay and the number of teachers who can be employed. That is the economic reality of the education budget, and we ignore it at our peril and to the detriment of our education system.<br/>
The hon. Member for Caerphilly clearly believes that interventions can be accepted only from hon. Members who represent Welsh constituencies; yet he refused an intervention from me and subsequently took one from my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, so there was a certain illogicality there. He then used my right hon. Friend's intervention to argue with something that my right hon. Friend had not said. By that stage I was becoming a little confused by the hon. Gentleman, and not for the first time.<br/>
The hon. Member for Caerphilly did not like my right hon. Friend's reference to a Labour authority wasting money on a new mayoral chain when the outgoing authority had a perfectly good chain that could have been used. Perhaps that performance by a new Labour authority&#x2014;I suppose that they are all new Labour authorities these days&#x2014;can be contrasted with the new Labour authority in Vale of Glamorgan, which is abolishing the mayoralty entirely. Meanwhile, the Leader of the Opposition appears to be espousing the concept of super-mayors. I am not quite sure whether it is new Labour to abolish mayors, buy them new chains or create super-mayors, but no doubt things will become apparent when Labour policy develops in due course.<br/>
With regard to rate support, I believe that the settlement is a very good one, against the background of the Government's determination to limit Government spending to a level that the taxpayer can afford. In Wales, we seem to be doing particularly well out of this: total standard spending is up by 3.1 per cent. in 1996&#x2013;97.<br/>
As I am particularly concerned about the level of police funding, I am pleased to learn that the Dyfed police grant has risen by 4.9 per cent. since 1995&#x2013;96, to &#x00A3;24.2 million. The Gwent figure of &#x00A3;31.3 million represents an increase of 4.5 per cent., and the North Wales figure of &#x00A3;34.7 million an increase of 5.1 per cent. I have saved the best till last: South Wales has been given &#x00A3;75.2 million, an increase of 5.4 per cent. The increases were even larger last year. The South Wales police benefited from a 15 per cent. increase, and the further increase of 5.4 per cent. is clearly good news, notwithstanding what was claimed from the Opposition side earlier.</p>

<p>As the hon. Gentleman is talking about the police, will he give

us his opinion of Government policies which have led to a reduction of 1,333 in the number of police officers nationwide since 1992, when an increase of 1,000 that year had been promised?</p>

<p>In my area, the reduction in real-terms spending on the police is attributable to the three Labour-controlled county councils which provide the membership of the South Wales police authority. Significantly, since the Government hypothecated spending on the police in Wales the police have received a substantial increase in funding. If those Labour authorities had complied with Home Office recommendations on police funding levels, police funding in Wales would not have fallen behind in that deplorable way.<br/>
As a general principle, I think it right for local authorities to decide their own spending priorities. However, because of the Labour party's woeful neglect of spending on the police in Wales&#x2014;which was against the interests of all Welsh people and a good illustration of Labour's being tough on crime in its rhetoric but soft on crime in reality&#x2014;the Government had no alternative but to hypothecate spending on the police to develop the improved police force that Conservative Members are determined to achieve.<br/>
Total standard spending in Wales this year is &#x00A3;984; in England, it is &#x00A3;922. The aggregate external finance is &#x00A3;864 in Wales, and &#x00A3;832 in England. That shows that the Conservative Government see spending in Wales as a priority if services are to continue to improve. It is unfortunate that so many of the local authorities are Labour controlled as the public are not receiving the full benefit of the money because the Labour party is more interested in mayoral chains and increasing councillors' allowances than in improving efficiency and the quality of services.<br/>
Although the council tax is likely to rise substantially in Wales, it will still be much lower than it is in England. That will be worth remembering when people receive their council tax demands.</p>

<p>Does the hon. Gentleman share the apparent triumph with which the Secretary of State announced this afternoon that he would place a 25 per cent. ceiling on increases? Without the extra help that the Secretary of State has now offered, council tax in my part of the Caerphilly county area would have risen by 68 per cent. What sort of settlement is that?</p>

<p>No, I have already given way three times&#x2014;unlike some Opposition Members.<br/>
Let me make a political point about capping. In the interests of all the people of Wales who pay council tax, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has maintained a capping system. As a Conservative, I wonder whether


it might have been a better political move for our Government to do away with capping for this year only in the run-up to the election, thus demonstrating to all the electors in Wales how much Welsh local government spends when it is run by the Labour party. They would then have a good idea of what they could expect under a Labour Government.<br/>
My right hon. Friend, however, is too responsible to act in that way. He is intent on protecting the Welsh people against the profligacy of Welsh councillors. Having made my political point, I accept my right hon. Friend's judgment; but I hope that the Welsh electorate will give careful consideration to the implications of Labour demands for the relaxation or abolition of capping. If such action were taken, our council taxes would go through the roof.<br/>
The total level of standard spending is tough but realistic. When the poll tax was introduced, Labour local authorities used it as an excuse to raise spending, knowing that they could then falsely blame the Government for the increase in poll tax bills. That is why capping should continue. I would not like the Conservative Government's reorganisation of local government&#x2014;with widespread cross-party support&#x2014;to be used as something with which to bash the Government over the head. As it is, local authorities will be under pressure to be careful about how they spend and which services they support.<br/>
The hon. Member for Alyn and Deeside rightly stressed the importance of education. I welcome local authorities' continued freedom to give priority to education spending. Returning to the subject of the police, I warmly welcome what my right hon. Friend said&#x2014;</p>

<p>It is worth repeating, because I have another point to make about the police. The funding formula for police pensions has been changed: the Government have increased the allocation to 12 per cent. of available funding. That will help to allay police fears about their pensions. The new sparsity element in the funding formula will help the police to cater for the special needs of isolated, thinly populated rural areas.<br/>
More support for local government expenditure, which Opposition Members presumably ask for&#x2014;although they have not been prepared to specify how much additional expenditure they advocate&#x2014;would have meant cuts in other Welsh Office projects such as those on health. Presumably, Opposition Members would not have wanted any such cuts yet that is the logic of their request.<br/>
Changes in the draft notional amounts may have adversely affected the Vale of Glamorgan compared with Cardiff. I should be grateful for an assurance from my hon. Friend the Minister that nothing that has been done in amending those amounts will unfairly prejudice my constituents in the Vale of Glamorgan.<br/>
I congratulate the Government on today's statement by my right hon. Friend. He has produced an excellent deal for Wales.</p>

<p>I offer you, Madam Deputy Speaker, what I hope you will agree is a sincerely felt apology for a kindly but inappropriate gesture as a Conservative Member was departing from the Chamber&#x2014;a Member representing a non-Welsh constituency. There is, however, a good deal of frustration among Opposition Members at the efforts of Members who represent English constituencies to intervene in debates concerning Wales alone. Even the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans), who has impeccable personal Welsh credentials, attempts to intervene as a Welsh Member of Parliament manque in such debates. If he wishes to be not a manque, but a real Welsh Member of Parliament, he should attempt once again to be elected to represent a Welsh constituency, although I doubt whether he would succeed.</p>

<p>Of course I will not pursue the matter, Madam Deputy Speaker, save to say that it is extremely important that Welsh Members should have the first opportunity to speak in these debates. Those of us who catch your eye, Madam Deputy Speaker, are those who are called.
I should like to discuss the position in the Powys unitary authority in the next 12 months. I hope that the Secretary of State for Wales and the Minister replying to the debate will agree that that authority is not smitten by political prejudices of one sort or another. It is politically independent and is attempting to do an honest job and to provide as good a level of service to its inhabitants as possible.<br/>
Powys unitary authority is a victim of the use of what appears to be an outmoded formula in the complex circumstances of the reorganisation of local government in rural mid-Wales. In real terms, the real loss to the


authority for the forthcoming year is &#x00A3;4 million. That money must be cut from somewhere. It will be from services that affect people. Will the Minister tell the House and the people of Powys why the Government are not only forcing a substantial increase in council tax&#x2014;although, in Powys, that will be limited to about 20 per cent.&#x2014;but accompanying that with a cut in services? What services will be cut?<br/>
The first thing that Powys county council has sought to cut is administration. It has succeeded in removing &#x00A3;2.5 million from its administrative budget. One's first reaction to that might be to say, "That is very good. We can do without a layer of administration. That is a real saving and it will not affect the services to people." But that is not true. A &#x00A3;2.5 million cut in administration costs in a rural county such as Powys means a significant reduction not only in jobs in local government, but, almost certainly, in the efficiency and response of services provided to local people.<br/>
It is one of the facts of political life that Welsh local authorities have little discretion. I do not applaud a position in which central Government give Welsh local government so high a proportion of its expenditure that they have local councils by the throat. I would much prefer a different local government financing mechanism.<br/>
We are faced, however, with the current mechanism. That means a reduction not just in jobs as a result of those administrative cuts, but in other services. In my constituency, there is a bridge that is used by school buses, agricultural vehicles and other traffic. Without notice, it was closed and, overnight, its weight limit was reduced. Now, neither lorries nor school buses can go over it. As a result, buses taking children to school must make a 21-mile detour twice a day. That has led to well publicised and not in the least surprising protests by parents of children who travel on those buses. Meanwhile, the highway authority says that it had to reduce the bridge weight limit to make it safe, but that it cannot give any idea of when the bridge will be repaired.<br/>
In the vicinity of Garthmyl, near Montgomery in my constituency, a metal Bailey-type bridge has stood for the whole of the 16 years that I have lived in Montgomeryshire and, I believe, for about 20 years before that. There is no answer as to when that will be repaired. The highways budget, which is extremely important for people's mobility in a rural area such as mine, should not face such privation.<br/>
I will give two further examples of services that are bound to be cut. The trading standards authority, which is extremely important in rural Wales because of the animal health provisions that it has to enforce, faces severe financial restrictions. Obviously, animal welfare and health take priority for that authority. As a result, virtually no money will be left for the other trading standards functions.<br/>
In education, it is inevitable that, as elsewhere in Wales, the increase in teachers' salaries, which teachers merit&#x2014;many of them do not have the professional status that they deserve compared with other professions and occupations&#x2014;will mean that class sizes will increase. As a result, schools will not be as good. We are lucky: we have good schools in rural Wales, but why&#x2014;because the Government do not give them funding&#x2014;should there be a reduction in education standards and an increase in professional dissatisfaction among teachers?<br/>
I do not want to take up any more time. I have merely given some examples of the sort of cuts that will have to be made even in a county about which no Minister can make accusations of political prejudice, or have preconceptions on political lines.<br/>
That is what is happening in Wales, as objective judgments show. That is what is happening in rural areas where politics plays no major part in the making of spending decisions. That simply is not good enough&#x2014;for rural Wales, at least. Ministers must try to find a new and fairer formula which takes sparsity and rurality properly into account.</p>

<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to take part in this important debate, and also for what the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Carlile) said about my Welsh credentials. I do indeed feel fully qualified to make what I hope may be a useful contribution to the debate.<br/>
The most significant aspect of the speeches by Opposition Members was especially true of the speech by the hon. Member for Caerphilly (Mr. Davies). It was, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Conwy (Sir W. Roberts) pointed out, the fact that the hon. Gentleman signally failed to answer the simple question that the Secretary of State asked him&#x2014;if the Labour party is unhappy with the settlement, how much more money would a future Labour Government provide?<br/>
That was a simple question, and although the hon. Gentleman did not allow me to intervene on him, I should be more than happy to allow him to intervene on me now, if he is prepared or able to tell a listening nation how much extra money Labour would give. Am I speaking slowly enough? Is the question simple enough? No.<br/>
The time that I spent listening to the hon. Gentleman's speech was one of the longest 18 minutes of my life, because in all that time he said so little. He carped a lot, but failed to answer the questions. I do not know whether he has ever been on "Question Time" on BBC television, but if he did appear on that programme it would be a dull affair, because members of the audience would ask the questions, but he would fail to answer them. He is not even prepared to come to the Dispatch Box now.<br/>
I was a county councillor in Wales for six years, and I also have a retail business in Swansea. I have lived 34 years of my life in Wales. When I was on the county council, we had consultation periods for business men to come to the local authority and plead with us to keep the business rates as low as we could. When business rates shot through the roof, those businesses, many of them operating at the margins, found it difficult to find the money from their profits.<br/>
What a farce that consultation exercise was for many of the business men. After they had made their plea and explained to the leaders of the local authority the problems their businesses faced, and the difficulty that they would have in finding extra money to meet the bills, the local authority put the business rates up through the roof. That was a tremendous slap in the face for local businesses in difficult circumstances.<br/>
I am delighted that control has now been taken away from local authorities, to prevent those businesses, which were making such great efforts and providing jobs in


Wales&#x2014;and throughout the rest of the country&#x2014;from being penalised. They are, of course, the lifeblood of many small villages.<br/>
A lot is said about levels of council tax, and we have heard much carping from Opposition Members. However, council tax rates are much lower in Wales than in England; they are certainly lower in Wales than in my constituency. It is also fair to say that, if areas were represented by Conservative-controlled local authorities, their council tax would be that much lower than if they were run by Labour authorities, as many now are. My advice to people in Wales is to reconsider what local authorities spend on their behalf, and at the local elections to choose Conservative councillors, who will spend their money efficiently.<br/>
I saw much wasteful expenditure when I was on West Glamorgan county council&#x2014;</p>

<p>I am grateful to you, Madam Deputy Speaker&#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I tried to intervene several times during the debate. The right hon. Member for Swansea, West (Mr. Williams) came into the Chamber only recently. He has not been here for the entire debate, although I am sure that he has good reasons for not having been here. I am not prepared to give way to him now.<br/>
We have heard some horror stories about local authority expenditure, and of course I saw what happened when I served on the local authority in West Glamorgan. Expenditure on chains of office, new buildings and councillors' allowances was appalling. Last year, I condemned the members of Mid Glamorgan council for trying to put their expenses up through the roof in a disproportionate manner. Their snouts were firmly in the trough.<br/>
The Labour party may talk about fat cats, but I can talk about the fat cats of Wales&#x2014;and they are not in business but in Labour-run authorities. The Labour party should do all in its power to condemn local authority members for trying to increase their expenses.</p>

<p>Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I hope that that was not the intervention that the right hon. Gentleman attempted to make before. If it was, I am delighted that I did not give way to him.<br/>
As for education expenditure, I hope that local education authorities will pass the money to the schools to spend, and not keep any of it back for central administration. It was instructive to hear Opposition Members talking about cutting services. They talk about front-line services, and about the customers who will suffer if they lose those services, yet not one of them talked about cutting administration and central bureaucracy.<br/>
My advice to Labour-run local authorities is to re-examine their internal running costs, as everybody has had to do, and to find ways of improving efficiency as much as they can. They should not make local service customers suffer simply to make a political point. There was a 45 per cent. increase in expenditure on nursery education between 1979 and 1994, and a 54 per cent. increase in expenditure on secondary education in Wales over the same period.<br/>
However, the increase in expenditure is not the only important factor. Also vital is the testing that goes alongside the education that young people receive. The Labour party opposed that policy, and also the introduction of the national curriculum, which is improving standards all the time.<br/>
I was pleased to learn of the extra expenditure on law and order. On top of the extra 11 per cent. last year, that is excellent news, especially considering the fact that, when the Labour party was in power, spending on the police was one of the categories that suffered greatly.<br/>
I hope that the extra expenditure will result in more police on the beat, particularly in rural areas, and the utilisation of new technology, such as closed circuit cameras, which are extremely useful in reducing crime. I hope also that there will be a continuation of the civilianisation of office posts, which will release policemen and policewomen and enable them to go back on the beat.<br/>
Compulsory competitive tendering in local authorities has made authorities far more efficient, and has resulted in those authorities being able to save money to spend on


services for local people. The Labour party is totally opposed to that policy, and would chuck out a policy that has saved many millions of pounds while providing excellent services to local people. Labour would replace the system with expensive in-house bids, from which the public would not benefit. That is a spiteful and dogmatic move by Labour that is not in the best interests of Welsh people.<br/>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Conwy posed an important question about Labour's pledge to introduce an assembly. We know that there are no current plans to provide a Welsh assembly with tax-raising powers, such as are envisaged for the Scottish assembly. Labour Members who believe in the principle of an assembly ought to ask why a Scottish assembly will be allowed to raise tax, while the Welsh will not be trusted to do so. Having seen the way in which Labour local authorities operate in Wales, I can fully understand why the Labour party is scared of allowing a Labour-run assembly&#x2014;as Opposition Members would probably see it&#x2014;to raise taxes.<br/>
In conclusion&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] I am glad that Opposition Members are enjoying my speech. The speaker who follows me from the Opposition will have an opportunity to tell the House how much extra money he wants to see being spent in Wales, and where he would get that money from.</p>

<p>In reply to the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans), there are one or two things that my party would do to save money and put it into local government. We would not be paying for nuclear arms for one thing, and we would not be stuffing money into the pockets of people on quangos for another. We would review the operation of the standard spending assessment, which works to the detriment of many councils in Wales. I have no doubt that we would look at other matters over time.<br/>
The Secretary of State announced on 18 December:
<q>the revenue settlement for local authorities for 1996&#x2013;7 is a fair one in the current climate".</q>
In his press release&#x2014;in the Welsh Office, government is by press release now&#x2014;he said that it was based on his view of what the real needs of local government were at the appropriate level. I believe that either he or every single council in Wales is absolutely wrong.<br/>
In his apologia for the settlement, he prayed in aid&#x2014; again by press release&#x2014;the notion that there would be more use of the private finance initiative, with &#x00A3;360 million of capital investment being produced in the next three years. Where on earth did he get that figure from? If it was conjured up by his merry band at the Welsh Office, he should be circumspect about quoting it.<br/>
For example, the Welsh Office recently astounded the new Denbighshire authority by using an inaccurate measurement of the length of roads in the authority. That affected the authority's SSA, and the Denbighshire authority is currently &#x00A3;600,000 out of pocket. So much for a careful evaluation of the spending needs of Welsh local government.<br/>
The overall situation in Welsh local government is that authorities feel that they cannot make any further cuts. The latest settlement is again a substantial cut in real

terms. It comes after four years of cuts, and authorities now have virtually nothing left to cut. Let us examine the evidence. I referred to Denbighshire, and that authority is very concerned that precepts from the new fire authority&#x2014;imposed on Denbighshire by the Government&#x2014;will be very heavy.<br/>
The authority is concerned about the spiralling cost of reorganisation. Those of us who served on Committee on the Local Government (Wales) Act 1994 warned the Government that their figures for the cost of reorganisation were pie in the sky. Here we are again&#x2014;1974 revisited. The new authorities are being burdened by crippling debts.<br/>
In a parliamentary answer, the Minister of State said that &#x00A3;41 million-plus was being allocated for 1996&#x2013;1997 to cover
<q>a proportion of councils' expenditure on compensation, accommodation and information technology."&#x2014;<i>[Official Report,</i> 5 February 1996; Vol. 271, c. <i>55.]</i></q>
I do not know where the figure of &#x00A3;41 million comes from, but I hope it is not from the same person who worked on Denbighshire's SSA. The Welsh Office is now graciously saying that councils can spend &#x00A3;41 million of their own chargepayers' money to offset part of the cost of reorganisation. In fact, the Welsh Office does not have a clue about the total cost. It is in the dark&#x2014;as is everybody else, unfortunately.<br/>
This is another abject display of the failure of the Welsh Office adequately to provide for the needs of Wales. The huge rise in the cost of community care has clearly not been adequately addressed by the Government. The increase in the 1996&#x2013;1997 settlement on last year's is only 1.8 per cent., while the Government's own figures forecast that prices will rise by 2.5 per cent, resulting in a further squeeze on local authorities.<br/>
My authority, Caernarfonshire and Meirionnydd&#x2014;soon to become Gwynedd&#x2014;has been allocated &#x00A3;365,000 extra cash, leading the council to the inescapable conclusion that it must cut services substantially and impose large increases in council tax for 1996&#x2013;1997. The current settlement is, in fact, a 1.3 per cent. reduction compared with the 1995&#x2013;1996 budget. By applying the standstill budget&#x2014;which comes into effect after four years of cuts&#x2014;the budget exceeds the capping limits by &#x00A3;2.66 million.<br/>
Therefore, my local council has basically three operational choices. First, it can cut services. That will mean closing rural schools and leisure centres, and making teachers and those in social services redundant&#x2014;workers in both those sectors, I might add, do splendid work, and are already at full stretch. Secondly, it could capitalise its revenue expenditure, and that could obviously entail the deferment of much-needed capital projects. Thirdly, it could use some of the balances. The amount available in Gwynedd will not be known until September, but in any event it will only defer the need to cut, and may give a skewed budget figure to work on next year. Incidentally, such a move would produce an artificially low level of council tax, and would defer the need for a more substantial increase.<br/>
There is no doubt that this council's dilemma is typical in Wales. Basic services are under threat, and no one should be under any illusion about who is at fault. In their craven urge to hold on to power, the Tory Administration are happy to cut services for the young and the elderly&#x2014;


and leisure, education, community care and social services, and public transport&#x2014;while voting for a tax-cutting Budget.<br/>
Let no one forget also that the Labour party acceded to the cuts. By allowing the Tories to cut income tax, Labour concurred with the Government's local government cuts. Any fool can realise that these must be paid for, and it is a shame that Labour did not adopt a principled approach, like my party. When Labour councillors blame it all on the Government, they should think again about what Labour should have done&#x2014;and perhaps, in days gone by, would have done.</p>

<p>I beg to differ. The Labour party abstained on that vote&#x2014;a few of the more principled Labour Members went through the same Lobby as I did. But I will leave it there for the time being.<br/>
Anglesey county council has had its planned spending capped at &#x00A3;61 million&#x2014;a cut of &#x00A3;2 million on last year's budget. Again, there will be cuts. Carmarthenshire county council is facing a difficult future. The options being discussed include cutting the repair and maintenance of schools, increasing the cost of school meals, and shutting training centres. In addition, there is a real threat to teaching jobs. A 3.5 per cent. reduction, which is what they are facing, could mean cutting 68 teaching jobs. In Rhondda Cynon Taf, there is talk of increasing the cost of transport to schools and school meals, closing nursery schools, cutting the maintenance programme, closing small schools and reducing clothing and other grants.<br/>
So how can the Secretary of State honestly and sincerely state that his main priority has been to increase investment in schools? He says that Wales benefits from the success of our economic policy along with the rest of the UK, but how can that be, when the overall capital package for Welsh local government has been cut by &#x00A3;17.5 million, with cuts in housing, roads and transport, in strategic development schemes, and in personal, social and all other services? How can those cuts honestly relate to a so-called booming economy?<br/>
The paltry increase in the education budget will have no effect on the strangulation of local authority education. That disgraceful emaciation is made even worse by the fact that some &#x00A3;6.6 million is being allocated for the ideologically driven, elitist, popular schools initiative&#x2014;in fact, &#x00A3;2 million more for that initiative, rather than an overall increase for the whole of the education budget.<br/>
That is where the Government's priorities lie. No doubt they will blame education standards on whichever political hue they target at the time. That the Government have set their face against local government is accepted by all. Surely the settlement is excellent evidence for that. I regret saying it, but I have no doubt that class sizes will

increase, teacher numbers will decrease, public transport will be cut, and social services will undoubtedly suffer a hefty cut. Libraries will close, leisure centres close or be run part-time, and even residential homes will close. Those evils, and many more, will follow this settlement, as night follows day.<br/>
In Aberconwy Colwyn, for example, the story is much the same. I received a plea from the Aberconwy and Colwyn women's aid group last week. Despite the amount of work it is doing, and the huge and regrettable increase in demand for its work, that work is in peril, and its very existence brought into question.<br/>
The imposed cuts by the Welsh Office will risk the lives of some people. What is even more sure, they will affect the quality of life for tens of thousands of people throughout the length and breadth of Wales. The Secretary of State says that he has thought carefully about the settlement. I say to him, "Think again," and the people of Wales say, "Think again."<br/>
The settlement is unworthy, and an insult to Wales. It is small wonder that the Conservatives fared abysmally in the recent local government elections. They probably feel that they have nothing to lose by starving local government in Wales, but the people of Wales will not allow the wool to be pulled over their eyes any longer. The Government will pay heavily for their cynical approach to the delivery of vital local services. Of late, there has been talk of a Tory-free Wales. Surely that speculation must become a reality within the next 12 months.</p>

<p>I cannot follow the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) and allow him to get away with that. I served on the all-party Select Committee on the Environment, and when we considered standard spending assessments, we found a degree of objectivity in them and that they were not slanted towards the political control of any authority. The hon. Gentleman knows as well as I do that, in the past 20 years, local government has no longer been seen as being government locally, but as a method and vehicle for bashing central Government and, in many cases, as a device for entering this House. A look through the antecedents of many hon. Members will show that there has been a considerable rise in the past 20 years in the number who were councillors, including myself. Sadly, instead of serving their local communities as they used to do&#x2014;they had a great and proud history&#x2014;councils have become highly politicised branches of their local parties and are more interested in carping against central Government than in delivering high-quality services to their local council tax payers.<br/>
I am taking part in this debate because Welsh Members often argue that there should be so much lower council tax charges in Wales because of pay levels and the general gross domestic product in that area. I refer my hon. Friend the Minister to a written reply in column 118 in today's <i>Hansard.</i> The reply sets out&#x2014;I do not know whether similar comparisons are available for Wales&#x2014;the number of normal, basic rate and higher rate taxpayers in every county in England. He will not be surprised to learn that the Isle of Wight is at the bottom of that league.<br/>
Having had a lot to do with Wales, particularly when the Isle of Wight unfortunately lost a company which relocated there, I guess that the hon. Gentleman will find


that Wales is much higher up the list of averages than many areas in England. Indeed, we learn from the settlement tonight that there is almost a &#x00A3;200 difference for a band D property in Wales, compared with England. That is the subsidy that English taxpayers are putting into Wales. I do not think that that can be justified. Welsh Members regularly tell us that that reflects the lower price of property, to which I say again, make the comparison with the Isle of Wight. I do not think that that argument holds water either.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Minister who will reply to the debate may not know&#x2014;it is probably a well-kept secret&#x2014; that, until the advent of unitary authorities, the Isle of Wight used one of the Welsh authorities as a comparison, as a typical authority of a similar size for statistical purposes. In every case, we found that, by and large, the Welsh Office was doing better for Welsh authorities than we expected with our English settlement.<br/>
We have heard much from Opposition Members about capping, but Welsh Office expenditure on local government amounts to 45 per cent. of its total expenditure. That tells me that the Secretary of State for Wales is certainly not ignoring local government as the Opposition have suggested throughout the debate, but giving it a fair deal out of his total budget for Wales.<br/>
I hear the argument about capping propounded by hon. Members on both sides of the House these days, but hon. Members should remember that about a quarter of total expenditure in the United Kingdom goes on local government. There is no way that one could let that rip if one is serious about inflation and wants to keep it under control as this Government do.<br/>
With his experience of Wales, my hon. Friend the Minister made a very good case on the uniform business rate. Will my Front-Bench colleagues tell me why, when it was enshrined in the uniform business rate legislation that it was designed to help manufacturing industry and is required to do so, we do not continually stuff that fact down the throats of the Opposition? For years, all that we heard from the Opposition was, "What are the Government doing for manufacturing industry?" The uniform business rate has been one of our greatest successes, especially where, as around the borders of Wales, businesses in high-rate areas were often siphoned off into nearby lower-rate areas. That compounded unemployment. I know that from my experiences on the Isle of Wight.<br/>
One helpful thing about the uniform business rate is that it has created uniformity for businesses. More than that, it allows Welsh business men to plan ahead when they draw up their budgets. The sad fact is that rates are the one form of taxation that have to be paid whether the business is making a profit or a loss. That has always been the case. The other problem was that businesses always had to second guess what local councillors would do and could not properly plan their budgets. My right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer has announced the business rate in his Budget. That is helpful, especially for small businesses that work on such tight margins these days because competition is so strong. They know precisely what their business rates will be and allow for them in their budgets.<br/>
The hon. Member for Caerphilly (Mr. Davies) has left the Chamber, but he touched on a point about roads that rang a chord with me. I say to the Government that, as

one gets to extremities of the kingdom, especially with local authorities that have no trunk roads and so do not get assistance from the Department of Transport, road surfaces tend not be as good as they are in other areas.<br/>
I bet any Welsh Member a tin of leek soup that he would find much poorer road surfaces on the Isle of Wight because of the way in which our transport supplementary grant has gone recently than he would find in probably any part of the kingdom. That is to some extent true as one goes from England to Wales. I hope that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will put forward in Cabinet the fact that we need to consider those authorities that find it difficult to maintain good road surfaces in sparsely populated areas.<br/>
Finally, I want to touch on allowances for councillors, a point which has been much vaunted in this debate. Can my hon. Friend the Minister tell the House&#x2014;or place information in the Library about it&#x2014;what precisely the allowances are for the new unitary authorities and what the councillors who have been elected to shadow bodies have fixed for themselves in allowances?<br/>
My understanding is that a number of councillors in Wales who have been elected to unitary authorities are already councillors on existing authorities. I hear from my friends in the valleys that they are drawing allowances on the old authorities and the new shadow authorities. They are getting a double dose of the taxpayers' money, which should be spent on the local community and not on them. If my hon. Friend the Minister cannot give me the figures when he replies, perhaps he could pop them in the Library or encourage me to table a parliamentary question so that we can discover how many hon. Members represent constituencies where councillors have their trotters in the trough of taxpayers' money.<br/>
Unfortunately, the hon. Member for Caerphilly is no longer here, but I have to tell my Welsh colleagues that he is known as Dai for diagnosis. He is all diagnosis and no delivery of the answers. Colleague after colleague has said to him, "Don't tell us how little, tell us how much you would give and how you would fund it." No answer came.</p>

<p>I shall not follow the line of the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Field). This may be a Great Britain Parliament, but there are Welsh Members who wish to speak about their constituency interests. If the Conservative party is so popular, why is their local council performance in Wales so abysmal? In my local council, three Conservatives were elected with 43 Labour members. We have had the acid test. The hon. Gentleman's philosophy has been tested in many parts of Wales and found to be dramatically lacking. I am sure that many Conservative Members with Welsh seats will find that that will come true at the general election.<br/>
I know that my hon. Friends also want to speak, so I shall make only a couple of points. I genuinely welcome the Secretary of State's movement on Theatr Clwyd. It was the least that he could do, given that the abolition of Clwyd county council caused the problem in the first place. The announcement will give a certain kick-start to the local authorities that neighbour Flintshire to enable them to contribute to the maintenance of this excellent facility in north Wales.<br/>
I pay tribute to Flintshire county council, which has immediately put &#x00A3;600,000 of local taxpayers' money up front to help support the retention of the theatre and to


the members of Clwyd county council, the governors and Patrick Gilchrist, the theatre general manager, and his staff. They have had a difficult time over the past few weeks but played a strong role with me in presenting the case to Ministers for assistance.<br/>
My local newspapers, the <i>Daily Post</i> and <i>The Chronicle,</i> have also played a magnificent role in generating public interest. I have been overwhelmed with letters of support for the theatre. A sackful of <i>Daily Post</i> clippings awaits the Secretary of State. They will arrive on his doorstep even though he has made his announcement, and show community support for the theatre.<br/>
As I said in my earlier intervention, there is still a shortfall of between &#x00A3;300,000 to &#x00A3;400,000 in Theatr Clwyd's funding compared with what was given by Clwyd county council. While I know that Flintshire will make great efforts to make efficiency savings and ensure that more people come through the doors of the theatre and welcome the movement on Theatr Clwyd's debt charges, there is still a major shortfall. I hope that the Secretary of State's initiative will support the local council to find the funding from other sources. I hope that there will be opportunities to raise the matter again because, although I feel fairly confident about the theatre's future, I would still like to ensure that the present funding continues.<br/>
The Secretary of State's statement does what Conservative party statements on local government normally do. The Government cut the grant to local authorities, force local authorities such as Flintshire to face massive council tax rises and shift the balance of spending from central to local government and then maintain, despite all that, the charade of the capping system, which mitigates against local democracy. My local authority was elected with certain mandates. It does not behove the Secretary of State to impose a capping limit on my local authority, which may mean real-terms cuts in local authority services.<br/>
The Government's grant statement has reduced Government spending still further. In 1993&#x2013;94, 64 per cent. of local government spending was met by central government. In 1994&#x2013;95, it was 62 per cent.; and in 1995&#x2013;96 it is 58 per cent. The reduction continues. Central Government support is being cut and local government's contribution is having to rise. When the council tax bills go through people's doors in April, the increases that have been made to maintain services will be, in large part, because of reductions of central Government grant.<br/>
In a written answer to the right hon. Member for Conwy (Sir W. Roberts) on 30 January, the Secretary of State stated:
<q>inflation remains low and the Government have made it clear that pay increases should be met from efficiency savings and other economies."&#x2014;<i>[Official Report,</i> 30 January 1996; Vol. 270, c. <i>682.]</i>`</q></p>

<p>I see the Minister nodding in agreement. That is all very well, but if teachers are offered a 4 per cent. pay rise it will be a further burden on local taxpayers and will mean that rates are increased or services cut to pay for things outside local authority control.<br/>
The disaggregated budget in Flintshire is &#x00A3;113,729,000. Its SSA is &#x00A3;1.2 million less than that at &#x00A3;112 million. That is a dilemma for local authorities such as Flintshire. The current budgets of Alyn and Deeside district council, Delyn district council and Clwyd county council, which cover the new Flintshire authority, are more than what the Secretary of State has already said they should spend this year. What does he expect Flintshire not to spend money on that it is currently being spent on? Where will it reduce spending next year to meet the SSA target that the Secretary of State has proposed?<br/>
The SSA of our near neighbour, Denbighshire, is lower than its notional expenditure&#x2014;&#x00A3;78 million as compared with &#x00A3;80 million. The SSA of another neighbour, Wrexham, is &#x00A3;98 million while its notional expenditure is &#x00A3;97 million. At current levels, in its constituent parts, my local authority is already spending more than the Secretary of State says that it should spend in the next financial year. That will present my local authority with difficult choices about whether to increase council tax, cut local public services or find alternative means. The problems will be the result of a poor settlement, which I shall be pleased to vote against this evening.<br/>
Those difficulties are fairly clear and straightforward. The county council at Flintshire will undoubtedly experience difficulties with its schools budget and its education funding for next year. I have already received representations from the North-East Wales Education Forum which has expressed grave concern over the potential for future funding of education next year in Flintshire. Local schools in my constituency have already expressed their concerns about education funding next year in Flintshire.<br/>
Flintshire county councillors are saying that, while they have the choice to determine their priorities and to spend as they will&#x2014;as the Secretary of State and junior Ministers will no doubt say&#x2014;they must deal with their notional expenditure level, which is &#x00A3;1.2 million more than the Government say they should spend. That shortfall will fall heavily on a number of services&#x2014;of which education will be the most important.<br/>
Only this week I received a letter from a school pupil in my constituency who said that he had written to the Prime Minister to tell him that his school class is without paper on which to write letters or school material. That case was originally brought to my attention by a supply teacher in the school in Mold. If school pupils have no paper to write on, that is not just a problem for the local authority as it struggles with funding, but for the Secretary of State. It presents a genuine problem of the underfunding of local government services.<br/>
I disagree with the Secretary of State on the notion of capping. The idea of local democracy, of having local government reforms and of holding an election last year&#x2014; where people from all political parties put forward their policies and programmes before local people&#x2014;is negated by the idea that the Secretary of State, representing Richmond, Yorks, can protect my local ratepayers from the council that they have chosen to elect. That is a fundamental negation of democracy. Whatever the financial arguments about whether the council should or should not spend, the Secretary of State should do what the Conservative party preaches: trust the people. The people of Flintshire and the people of Wales have chosen certain authorities to fulfil certain election promises.<br/>
It is a negation of democracy for the Secretary of State to say that he knows best and that he will put a limit on the council services to which my constituents and councillors can aspire. In his statement, the Secretary of State mentioned a notional amount of &#x00A3;113 million for my local authority and an SSA of &#x00A3;112 million. He should cease the capping regime. I shall vote against the settlement tonight because I disagree with the underfunding of my local authority and the principle of capping.</p>

<p>We have just had a major reorganisation of local government and the wholesale creation of unitary authorities. Many of the areas that are now designated as unitary authorities do not have the resources to carry out such far-reaching functions. It seems farcical that there are now five directors of education in Gwent, where there was previously one.<br/>
The local government reorganisation is expensive, but the Government have willed the ends and we are now entitled to say that they must provide the means. Instead, as my hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly (Mr. Davies) said, many councils now face increases of 25 per cent. in council tax despite the recent additional &#x00A3;16 million that the Welsh Office has provided. The local government finance system has not withstood the test of local government reorganisation.<br/>
The Secretary of State is allowing new councils to spend, and Government support for that spending is being distributed among the new councils in a way that does not match the expenditure on services inherited from the old councils. That mismatch is causing significant variations in council tax increases and will be difficult to explain to council taxpayers throughout Wales.<br/>
If Newport spends at the level at which the Secretary of State is minded to cap the authority, Newport's council tax will be among the lowest in Wales. In the borough, the council tax rate is estimated to be about &#x00A3;392 for a band D property. The Secretary of State is minded to cap the authority at its standard spending assessment, which is &#x00A3;117.5 million. But out of the 22 new authorities, 19 are now being allowed to spend in excess of their SSA before reaching their capping level. I am entitled to ask the Secretary of State why Newport has been discriminated against. The Welsh Office is well aware that the SSAs for the new councils are not an accurate reflection of their need to spend. I understand that the Secretary of State has admitted that the SSAs need to be thoroughly reviewed. On the evidence, Newport seems to be being badly treated.<br/>
I am sure that none of us would wish to underestimate the complexities of local government finance. One reason for Newport's low capping limit is that Gwent county council drew heavily on reserves in its last year to sustain expenditure on services that could not be sustained within its annual income. The Secretary of State must appreciate that if Newport is to keep its expenditure within the capping limit that he has set, services will have to be drastically cut, particularly education and social services. Surely those two vital services should not be cut&#x2014;they represent more than three quarters of Newport's total budget expenditure. Will the Secretary of State consider Newport's peculiar and anomalous position?<br/>
We know that Wales is now the most deprived region in western Europe. The time has obviously come for change: we need the return of a Labour Government and the election of a Welsh Assembly.</p>

<p>Labour Members have given an accurate account of the parlous state in which the underfunding of local government has left Wales&#x2014;thanks to the Welsh Office. One thing that we know for sure is that everyone in Wales recognises that, despite the fact that total standard spending is to be higher this year than it was last year, once account is taken of inflation and the fact that last year's total made no allowance for factors such as the teachers' pay award, local authorities have already spent as much as the total standard spending that is allocated for the coming financial year that is to start in April. So, at best, there is a standstill.<br/>
Last year, local authorities dipped into their reserves to the tune of slightly more than &#x00A3;100 million. My hon. Friends the Members for Alyn and Deeside (Mr. Jones), for Delyn (Mr. Hanson) and for Newport, East (Mr. Hughes) have made a powerful plea for the Government to re-examine the settlement's impact on the services provided by local government in Wales. The one chink of light that we have seen&#x2014;my hon. Friend the Member for Delyn paid tribute to it&#x2014;was the action that the Secretary of State has taken in relation to Theatr Clywd in Mold, for which we are thankful. We only wish that he viewed all local government spending in Wales in the same positive and progressive manner.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Alyn and Deeside pleaded with the Secretary of State to reverse the settlement's effect on teachers' pay. The Under-Secretary of State for Wales, the hon. Member for Clwyd, North-West (Mr. Richards), said, in a written answer to me, that he expected
<q>pay awards in the public sector, including those subject to the recommendations of the School Teachers' Review Body, to be met through increased efficiency and other economies."&#x2014;<i>[Official Report,</i> 18 January 1996; Vol. 269, c. <i>755.]</i></q>
The Secretary of State ought to say where he believes those economies might be made. He knows that, during the past few years, local education authorities in Wales have cut their administrative expenditure by millions of pounds. The hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans), who comes from Wales, should be better apprised of that fact. The Secretary of State also knows that every county council in Wales is currently giving more than 90 per cent. of its education budget to its schools. Councils are doing even better in that respect than the Welsh Office has asked them to do.</p>

<p>I shall return to that point at the end of my remarks. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that I shall examine the issue seriously. After 17 years of disastrous Tory government in Wales, we have serious problems funding the work of local government and other public services. In the past few years, under the Tories, class sizes and pupil-teacher ratios have increased, following


a long period in which they decreased. The situation in relation to pupil-teacher ratios is deteriorating, according to answers from the Welsh Office.</p>

<p>It is no use the Under-Secretary shaking his head. His own written answers have proved that that is the situation; he needs only to check <i>Hansard</i> to confirm it. The figures are marginal in both cases: an increase of 0.2 per cent. in primary schools and of 0.8 per cent. in secondary schools. If, however, we examine the impact of those figures on primary schools in terms of class size, we find that, between 1993&#x2013;94 and 1994&#x2013;95, there were more than 7,000 children in classes of more than 30, thanks to the cuts.<br/>
The truth about Tory rule in Wales during the past few years is a story of cuts all the way. Ministers' parliamentary answers also provide that information. In 1993&#x2013;94, revenue support grant was 64 per cent. of local government spending. In 1995&#x2013;96, it has decreased to 58 per cent. The truth was revealed in a letter to my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Aberavon (Mr. Morris)&#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i> It has been said before, but it is worth repeating because it is the truth, and the truth needs to be rammed home.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Conwy (Sir W. Roberts) talked about a wind of change. The wind of change has come from the dales of Yorkshire. It is blowing hard into Wales, bringing easterly winds with the ice and the snow that people in the south Wales valleys are currently suffering. Metaphorically speaking, the world of finance&#x2014;as my hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly (Mr. Davies) graphically demonstrated&#x2014;is having an icy effect on the lives of people in Wales. The Secretary of State wrote to my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Aberavon:
<q>I believe that over time local authorities in Wales should raise a higher proportion of their income from council tax. The 11 per cent. increase is the result of this approach.</q>
He said that; there was no doubt about it. He wanted and planned for a minimum increase of 11 per cent. He planned for local authorities either to cut their services or to raise disproportionately their council tax.</p>

<p>I am very happy to answer that question: yes, I do believe that more money should be spent on education in Wales. However, Labour Members are not the people who are examining the books in the Welsh Office, although it will not be too long before we do&#x2014;and then there will be new priorities. If the Minister is inviting me to come along to the Welsh Office to have a preview of the books, I shall happily take up the offer.<br/>
If we are talking about publicly available information about how the Welsh Office is cutting the money it makes available to local government, let us consider revenue support grant which, in constant value terms during the past couple of years, has decreased by more than &#x00A3;37 million. Local government renovation grants have, in

the past year, decreased in real terms by almost &#x00A3;4 million. Housing capital provision has decreased by almost &#x00A3;16 million.<br/>
It is no wonder that my hon. Friend the Member for Alyn and Deeside made an impassioned plea for the Welsh Office to release capital receipts so that councils with housing responsibilities&#x2014;which they will all, of course, have from April&#x2014;can modernise their housing stock and install central heating so that when the icy winds blow down from the Yorkshire dales, people will be warm. It is cuts all the way.<br/>
A Welsh Office press release of 13 December states that, this year, total capital provision in Wales will decrease by more than &#x00A3;17 million. The Secretary of State has tried to present himself as a latter-day Father Christmas by offering &#x00A3;29.1 million and another &#x00A3;15.9 million to dampen the effects of the redistribution of grant to the new local authorities, and by relaxing the capping criteria to enable authorities to raise more money locally.<br/>
The Secretary of State knows that if councils in Wales took full advantage of the generous offer and did not cut the services that they provide, but instead sought to fund everything as though there had been no change, seven councils in Wales would have to raise council taxes by more than 30 per cent. Another four councils would have to increase their council tax by more than 20 per cent.; seven councils would require increases of 10 per cent.; and only four councils would require increases of less than 7 per cent. My local authority, Bridgend, is caught in that trap. It will have either to make a huge increase&#x2014; of more than 36 per cent.&#x2014;in council tax or to make really serious cuts in services. There is no room for substantial administrative cuts.<br/>
I hope that the Secretary of State will look seriously at changing the formula. He asked where more money could be found. I remind him that it was only a couple of years ago that his predecessor returned money to the Treasury. I notice that, in one year, a &#x00A3;59 million underspend was shown in the accounts presented to the Welsh Office. Does the Secretary of State know whether, this year, he is on course for an underspend or an overspend? If there is an underspend, will he give the money to local authorities?</p>

<p>This afternoon, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales set out in detail our settlement decisions for 1996&#x2013;97 and explained the considerations that have informed those decisions. Notwithstanding the fact that the settlement gives local government a real-terms increase in revenue spending, backed up by an aggregate external support package that covers about 87 per cent. of spending, and notwithstanding the fact that, on a per capita basis, the support is 8 per cent. higher than that proposed for England, we have had a predictable barrage of complaints and criticism from the Opposition.<br/>
The hon. Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) was brave enough to give way when he was asked whether he would increase the local government settlement, yes or no. I shall have to read his speech carefully to try to find the answer. He then criticised my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for enabling local government to raise


more of its money locally. That is a peculiar criticism when my right hon. Friend is responding to local government requests to be able to do exactly that.<br/>
What I noticed particularly in this year's debate, which is being held a year to the day after the previous one, is the change in the Opposition. What has happened to the laughable, bumbling, clueless Ron we remember from last year? Today, he was still clueless&#x2014;that does not change&#x2014;but last year he was at least able to include two welcomes in his speech. He welcomed the increase in total standard spending and he welcomed the increase in spending for the police. This time, he gave a tired, jaded, sour performance.<br/>
There may be a clue to the decline of the hon. Member for Caerphilly (Mr. Davies) in his speech last year. He had barely got a paragraph into it when he was pressed by one of his hon. Friends to increase the shadow budget for Wales. Amazingly, he claimed<q>There are no restrictions on our shadow budget".&#x2014;<i>[Official Report,</i> 8 February 1995; Vol. 254, c. 361.]</q>
Throughout his speech, then as now, he told us nothing about the shadow budget. Doing one thing and saying another has become the hallmark of the Labour party; in the hon. Member for Caerphilly we have someone who will take it to the nth degree. He is capable of saying one thing, and then another thing, but no one understands what on earth he means. I shall let everyone into the secret. He does not understand either.<br/>
The greatest problem arises when the hon. Member for Caerphilly says something positive. Few have failed to notice that his friends in the BBC have been running a campaign to promote a Welsh Assembly. Only this week, a whole programme was devoted to the subject. It tried to claim that a Welsh Assembly would cost less than &#x00A3;15 million.<br/>
How much the hon. Gentleman's friends in the BBC must regret it when his loose cannon goes out. Last week, he admitted that a Welsh Assembly would mean about another 500 civil servants. Such bureaucracy creation would take place before a Welsh Assembly did anything. Taking an average salary with the on-costs, I can easily calculate that, with &#x00A3;40,000 per civil servant, &#x00A3;20 million would be spent before the Welsh Assembly did anything.</p>

<p>So that the record is accurate, my statement was that it was my estimate that the establishment of the Assembly in Cardiff would create an additional 500 jobs outwith the civil service.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman has confirmed the warning as given. He has blown what his friends at the BBC were trying to do out of the water.<br/>
I appreciate how difficult it is for the hon. Gentleman when he comes to the Dispatch Box. It is an occasion when he is on the record; such occasions are embarrassing for him. I must, however, try to deal with the points of substance that he raised. He claimed that the inclusion for community care was nothing but a transfer from the Department of Social Security. That is not correct; the money being provided is new money. The additional &#x00A3;25.2 million this year takes the figure to &#x00A3;149.6 million additional money for community care. Next year, the figure will be &#x00A3;190.3 million.<br/>
The hon. Member for Caerphilly claimed that the damping provision would mean cuts in the national health service. Again, he was not right. The extra money that

has been provided for damping is from unallocated resources. In view of his point about cutting the national health service, the hon. Gentleman will not and cannot come clean. "How much more?" is the question that the Opposition constantly face. Where will it come from? They cannot say. However, if they are to be credible when they go into a general election, Labour Members must buy a large sign for the hon. Gentleman. They should hang it in his office where he cannot miss it. The sign should read, "It's the money, stupid." That is the only way in which the point can be brought home to the hon. Gentleman.<br/>
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has been able to announce &#x00A3;1.3 million for Theatr Clwyd, subject to certain provisions. I am grateful for the welcome that the hon. Members for Delyn (Mr. Hanson) and for Alyn and Deeside (Mr. Jones) have given that announcement. My right hon. Friend and I had very great regard for Theatr Clwyd, and we were much reinforced in that by the lobbying by my hon. Friend the Member for City of Chester (Mr. Brandreth) and especially by my hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, North-West (Mr. Richards). I am sad that the situation of Theatr Clwyd was precipitated by local government. My right hon. Friend has given the theatre the way forward and it is now for local government to respond properly.<br/>
I thank my right hon. Friend the Member for Conwy (Sir W. Roberts) for his contribution. I cannot do better than use the words of the hon. Member for Alyn and Deeside, who described it as a master class. My right hon. Friend's concerns were well expressed. He explained the threats Labour represents in terms of the effect on the business community and the rates that business would have to pay if local government took over business rates. That point was rightly emphasised by my hon. Friends the Members for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) and for Isle of Wight (Mr. Field).<br/>
Equally, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Conwy asked, would farm land be made rateable? What would the farmers have to fear? What would be the price of ending capping? It is impossible to put a price on all the threats in the unspecific policies of the Labour party. My right hon. Friend did not exaggerate when he talked about the possibility of civil strife in Wales as the consequence of Labour's policies.</p>

<p>No, because there is too little time left. The hon. Gentleman has not been here for the whole debate anyway.<br/>
The hon. Member for Alyn and Deeside referred to housing. I am sure that he welcomes the substantial provision we have made for housing spending&#x2014;&#x00A3;1.2 billion for private sector renovation since the current grant regime was introduced and an 84 per cent. higher real-terms spend on capital and revenue for repairs on council housing.<br/>
My hon. Friends the Members for Vale of Glamorgan (Mr. Sweeney) and for Ribble Valley welcomed our increase in police spending. I know that that was dismissed by the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Carlile) in his usual elitist way. It is, however, the case, as my hon. Friends said, that the police in south Wales have had to have an approximately


22 per cent. increase in just over a year because of the appalling underfunding when the figure was decided by the Labour-controlled councils in south Wales.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Glamorgan asked about the changes made in the notional amount figures for the Vale of Glamorgan and Cardiff unitary authorities. The changes arose from the provision of more accurate data by South Glamorgan council for the disaggregation of its spending on education to the new authorities. The Vale of Glamorgan authority knows the reasons for the change and accepts the greater accuracy of the new data. The council is understandably disappointed by the reduction in its base position, but it can increase its budget by 3.9 per cent. in the coming year.<br/>
The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) mentioned road mileage lengths being taken into account in calculating Denbighshire's standard spending assessment. The non-financial data that we use in calculating SSAs are carefully validated and verified with all local authorities. They provide the information. We have not received representations from Denbighshire or any other local authority on road lengths. I am surprised that the hon. Member for Newport, East (Mr. Hughes) feels that the settlement disadvantages Newport county borough council. It enables the council to increase its spending by 5.6 per cent.&#x2014;the second highest percentage increase of any authority in Wales.<br/>
The most noticeable aspect of the debate was the absence of any positive policies from the Opposition. I say to the House and to Wales that we should always remember that council taxes are decided by councillors. It is as that rueful expression says&#x2014;"We get the councillors we deserve." My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State rightly mentioned some of the crazier spending decisions that have been made, and I warn Opposition Members that they treat the public with contempt at their peril.<br/>
Last Saturday's <i>South Wales Echo</i> showed the fat cheques that have been paid out to Labour councillors in back pay for the amounts that they have awarded themselves. That has gone down very badly in Cardiff. The mood is changing in Cardiff which, regrettably, is a one-party state, and it is changing elsewhere in Wales.</p>

<p>We have reached Report stage of the Audit (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. We had a series of interesting debates in Committee and we have brought these amendments to the House in an attempt to make the Government see sense.<br/>
The amendments address the issue of how and where local authorities will publish their performance indicators. Last year was the first year in which performance indicators were published and we learned many lessons from that experience. It is one of the reasons why the Bill is before the House this evening. However, I believe that we have learnt more lessons than are addressed in the Bill, so we are seeking to amend it.<br/>
Amendment No. 5 seeks to approach the issue in a different way. Local authorities are obliged to publish their performance indicators properly so that the majority of local people can read and understand them. They should not be complicated and they should be easily accessible. I am sure that every hon. Member shares that objective. The information must reach as many people as possible and be easily understood. Tonight we are debating the mechanism which will achieve those ends. I do not believe that the Bill has got it right, and that is another reason why we have tabled the amendments.<br/>
Amendment No. 5 seeks to give the Secretary of State power to issue a code of practice to prescribe the way in which local authorities must publish performance indicators. In other words, the Secretary of State will have the power to issue a code of practice so that he can be absolutely sure that local authorities are not using oblique methods in an attempt to avoid meeting the objective. We have taken methods of practice from other pieces of legislation, which we believe will better achieve our aims, and applied them in this case.<br/>
Under section 3 of the Local Government, Planning and Land Act 1980, the Secretary of State may make regulations to enforce the provisions of such a code of practice. There is an existing code which ensures that the objective is met. I am sure that the Minister knows all about it so I shall not take up the time of the House tonight by going through it. However, I believe that the current provisions in the Bill will not meet the objective.<br/>
The provisions of the 1980 Act were introduced by the right hon. Member for Henley (Mr. Heseltine), when he was Secretary of State for the Environment, to ensure that local authorities published the information that the Government thought necessary at that time. That included information to accompany local tax demands, annual reports, staffing levels, information on planning applications, information on land holdings and so on. The amendment would bring performance indicators under a similar regime.<br/>
I appreciate that performance indicators must be published separately and that specific attention must be drawn to them. However, as I understand the code of practice, that would not be a problem under existing legislation. The provisions of the 1980 Act specifically permit
<q>any such Code to be prepared by some other person on behalf of the Secretary of State.</q>
<q>any such Code to specify the steps which authorities are to take to inform the public of the availability of the information".</q>
In Committee, the Minister interpreted the wording of the Opposition amendment as requiring authorities to distribute the information to every household and business. He thought that it would put authorities at risk of legal challenge and
<q>would be too hard on local authorities".</q>
He was anxious that authorities did not abuse the publication of performance indicators to produce partisan material in a local authority publication.<br/>
We pointed out in Committee that if local authorities did that, they would be breaking the law as set out in the Local Government Act 1986. Notwithstanding that, the Minister sought to make it one of his concerns.<br/>
The Minister objected to our amendment asking authorities to distribute the information to every household and business as he thought that would be too difficult. The Bill requires authorities to "take all reasonable steps" to ensure that a free newspaper is distributed to each dwelling and business. That could be equally onerous and create other difficulties.<br/>
We discussed the problems involved in the distribution of free newspapers in great detail in Committee, so I shall not do so today. However, the wording of the Bill may lead to demands that some local authorities are unable to meet.<br/>
The amendment would permit a wide range of practice in publishing performance indicators. We are asking the Government to reconsider the matter. If the amendment were agreed, the Government would retain every possible means of preventing abuse. I know that the Minister is concerned to stop abuse and to ensure that local authorities are not tempted down that road. The amendment would give him the necessary powers, so he and his right hon. and hon. Friends should be reassured that it is not an attempt to make sure that people do not find out about performance indicators, but to give more people access to them.<br/>
Clearly, a code should be used to encourage best practice and to give authorities maximum flexibility in the publication of performance indicators. It could also incorporate such safeguards as requiring a statutory notice in a paid-for or free newspaper publicising the authority's arrangements for distribution of the material and telling the public where additional copies were available.<br/>
Taken with the Bill as presently drafted, the amendment would present authorities with a menu of options for publishing performance indicators in accordance with a code of practice that would permit own newspapers, leaflets, the use of a paid-for or free newspaper or a combination of those options. It is our responsibility to give local authorities the opportunity to develop means that are appropriate to their areas and meet the objectives set out in the Bill.<br/>
It is also important to provide for diversity. In Committee we discussed the diverse nature of local authorities. Although one newspaper may be distributed throughout an entire city area, that is not always so. In order to uphold the proper relationship between central and local government, there should be a balance between diversity and the adherence to a minimum national standard. The amendments give the Government the opportunity to achieve that balance.<br/>
The other amendments in the group would put amendment No. 5 to into effect. Amendments Nos. 6 and 7 aim to delete the distribution conditions for free newspapers so that they are treated in the same way as paid-for newspapers when placing a statutory performance indicator advertisement.<br/>
In Committee, there were two main concerns with the Bill's provisions permitting the use of a free newspaper for the statutory publication of performance indicators. First, clause 5(4) places the burden on authorities to ensure that a free newspaper is distributed to dwellings and businesses. The Bill sets a test of reasonableness, but that is not much help to authorities that might need to test the circulation claims made by the publishers of a free sheet. The Minister acknowledged:
<q>The local authority, in deciding which free newspaper or other newspaper to select, must be reasonably satisfied that the paper is delivered throughout that area."&#x2014;<i>[Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 23 January 1996; c. 48&#x2013;9.]</q>
As I have already said, that cannot be assured throughout the country as the distribution and availability of free newspapers is variable. The Bill is likely to deter authorities from using a free newspaper for the statutory advertisement and could effectively vitiate the purpose of clause 4.<br/>
Secondly, the Bill puts paid-for newspapers at a market advantage. Contrary to the Minister's words, no distribution condition applies to paid-for newspapers. A paid-for newspaper with a very small circulation would suffice for the statutory performance indicator advertisement, but a free paper has to meet a very stiff test of being delivered throughout the authority's area.<br/>
The Bill leaves whole issue confused and does not meet our objectives. As it incorporates a minor barrier to free trade, the Bill does not seem consistent with the philosophy and the policy that the right hon. Member for Henley purports to support. The Government seek to make the performance indicators more accessible to the electorate and the council tax payer, but they have drafted the Bill in such a way as to make that objective much


more difficult to attain. The amendments give the Government a way through and I hope that, even at this late stage, they will consider rethinking the wording of the Bill.</p>

<p>I shall not detain the House for long, but I want to express my complete support for what the hon. Member for North-West Durham (Ms Armstrong) has just said. In particular, I agree with her request that the Minister look at this whole matter again. I also agree with her that the Government have not got it right at this stage. Fortunately, however, there will be discussions in another place which will give the Government time to ponder their previous decisions and what has been said tonight. They will also be able to reflect on what is said in another place before the Bill finally reaches the statute book.<br/>
7.30 pm<br/>
I am speaking on my own behalf this evening, but I also want to echo the concerns expressed to me by Portsmouth city council. Just to show that mine is not a party political point, I might add that, over the past few years, the council has been controlled by all the main parties in succession. So I am describing the view of the city.<br/>
Portsmouth city is disturbed by what was intended to be an extension of freedom and widening of opportunity. Whereas in the past it was specified where notices had to be published&#x2014;in paid-for newspapers&#x2014;the widening of choice to include free advertising, give-away newspapers was meant to give local councils greater say in how they distribute information. In Portsmouth, however, this idea does not produce more competition or choice. There is only one paid-for newspaper, and that paper also owns the free, give-away newspaper. So the city has no choice but to use the services of that newspaper&#x2014;and it does not take kindly to that.<br/>
I hope that I will not embarrass the hon. Member for North-West Durham if I say how strongly I agree with what she said about local authorities being able to publish their own broadsheets. Portsmouth has an excellently printed and published broadsheet which gives information about all the council's activities in an entirely proper, non-political way. It has done that under the control of successive parties. Certainly, it would be illegal if the city council presented the information in such a way as to advance the interests of one political party. That is against the law; it would have serious repercussions, including&#x2014; rightly&#x2014;the surcharging of those responsible.<br/>
The information can be published by the city of Portsmouth and be attractively presented, on art paper, for instance. It can be illustrated with charts and diagrams. It is of course possible to pay for such services in newspapers, but the cost has to be borne by the city's funds. I am quite sure that Portsmouth is not the only place capable of producing a satisfactory statement that includes performance indicators and tables, and of guaranteeing distribution to every door. After all, the council already distributes information about elections; it distributes the registration forms necessary for voting. It puts them through front, side and back doors&#x2014;when that is necessary, such as in houses in multiple occupation. This is probably the most efficient distributive system imaginable.<br/>
Portsmouth is also capable of varying the size and type in which the information is presented. Statutory notices in Portsmouth's evening newspaper&#x2014;from the Queen's harbour master to mariners, for instance&#x2014;are typed in small print because they need to be read by only a handful of master mariners. But the whole idea of publishing performance tables for the public is that they should be read by the man and woman in the street, not the expert on local government. They are for people who want to know what is going on and who welcome a format that is clear and easily understood.<br/>
It is possible to do all this by paying a newspaper, but that is very expensive. I therefore suggest that the ideal wording for the clause would be along the lines that local councils should be "responsible" for the distribution of the information. The Bill should not specify how they do it; they should simply be responsible for getting the information to every door, in the manner of their choosing. If, in so doing, they break the law: so be it&#x2014; they must take the consequences.<br/>
The problem remains that, in the absence of competition, the cost of advertising and printing performance tables of this size and on this scale runs into thousands of pounds. That is a heavy burden; hence, I hope that the Government will consider allowing efficient local authorities to produce their own broadsheets in their own way. That will allow them to present information to the very people who will, in time, express their views on the performance of their councils. That is the most democratic way to go about the job.<br/>
I have a great deal of sympathy with amendments Nos. 1 and 2, which the hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Rendel) may discuss later. Given that there is an all-party consensus on the matter, perhaps the Government will now treat it with care and consideration.</p>

<speech hansard_id="1108029" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1996-02-08a.534.0" hansard_membership_id="171" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/3213" speakername="Mr. David Rendel" colnum="534" time="19:13:00">
<p>I am delighted to follow that speech, which seems to show that there is concern in all parties about the wording of the Bill and the Government's way of trying to ensure that performance indicators are given wider publication than hitherto.<br/>
The Bill is somewhat lopsided as between the way it treats paid-for newspapers and those which are free. I want to speak, not so much along the lines of the previous two speeches, which have dealt generally with the widening of the ways in which these performance indicators are made known to the public, but more specifically about what I believe are faults in the wording of the Bill which mean that, in practice, the Government will not achieve their aims.<br/>
It is clear that any publication in any paid-for newspaper, however small its circulation, meets the requirements of this Bill. On the other hand, if publication is done in free newspapers, then, as the Minister said in Committee, that will meet the requirements of the Bill only if the free newspapers are available to be distributed throughout an entire area. That may happen in some inner-city or inner-town areas, but it will certainly not happen across large parts of the country. That is why the clause is inadequate as it stands.<br/>
In my area, the <i>Newbury Weekly News</i> is the main paid-for newspaper. It covers a large part of the district, but certainly not all of it. It makes no attempt to cover a significant part of the eastern end of the area. So if publication is to be, as it has been hitherto, in the


<i>Newbury Weekly News,</i> it will be positively difficult to get hold of the performance indicator information in large parts of the district.<br/>
There are also free newspapers in the area covering large parts of it. Between them they may have a larger total circulation than the <i>Newbury Weekly News.</i> Still, they do not attempt to cover the entire area.<br/>
Equally, the <i>Newbury Weekly News</i> has a small circulation inside north Hampshire, so technically it would be possible for Basingstoke and Deane council to publish its performance indicators in the <i>Newbury Weekly News</i>&#x2014;and only there. That would mean that the indicators were published to a large number of people with little interest in them and a small number of people with a considerable interest in them, and leaving out a large number of people with an interest in them but not living in the circulation area of the paper. That is the kind of difficulty that the current wording would produce. The two amendments that I have tabled would, to a large extent, overcome that difficulty.<br/>
The Bill should maximise the circulation of performance indicators. In practice, in many areas including my own, the wording of the Bill would make no change to the present situation. In other words, district councils would have to publish their performance indicators in the local paid-for newspapers, because there are not sufficient free newspapers to ensure coverage of the whole area. The Minister made it plain in Committee that many areas would see no change. That might mean that circulation was smaller than it could be, and people who live in those areas might get worse value for money in the information they get about their district councils. We might gain better value for money by ensuring publication in free newspapers that perhaps cover only part of the area, rather than publishing in a paid-for paper which could cover a smaller area.<br/>
The Minister made the point that, if councils are forced to publish in paid-for newspapers, the information is at least available to everyone in the area. That is partly true, although in some districts paid-for newspapers may be quite difficult to obtain. People sometimes have to travel some way into the circulation area of a newspaper. However, free newspapers are also, in almost all cases, available in the local town, if someone is determined to get hold of a copy. So the Minister's point falls, because the free newspapers are as available to those determined to get hold of them as paid-for newspapers.<br/>
Amendment No. 2 makes the point that, as far as possible, the papers containing the relevant information should be distributed to businesses. The Bill, as it stands, suggests that, unless all the business areas are covered by the free newspapers, the publication will still have to be in paid-for newspapers. The amendment would increase the chance that district councils had the opportunity to publish in free newspapers, even if those free newspapers did not cover every business in the area.<br/>
The point of the Bill must be to widen councils' opportunity to publish information in free newspapers as well as in the paid-for newspapers. The Bill does not do that at present. If the Government accepted my amendments, the Bill would do what they want it to do.</p>

<p>There is clearly a huge cross-party consensus on this subject. The overwhelming majority of hon. Members believe that

local residents have a right to have delivered, through their letter boxes, a proper analysis of what services their councils provide and how well they do so in comparison with others. That is what the performance indicators are all about. The Audit Commission's various publications are clear and simple to understand. They usually have bar charts so that people can see how their local authority is performing against a comparable local authority serving a similar area.<br/>
I wish to speak especially in favour of the amendments which would introduce a real code of practice. Whereas the vast majority of the 450 local authorities operate reasonably honourably and straightforwardly, a small handful of completely corrupt, dogmatic and arrogant local authorities will abuse any system that is placed in their hands. For that small minority, a real code of conduct is necessary. It will come as no surprise to the House to know that my personal experience of what happens in Brent prompts me to speak forcefully about the need for a code of conduct. The Opposition are offering the Government more powers: that must surely indicate the depth of concern that we feel.<br/>
I shall give a couple of examples of the way in which Brent council manages, in effect, to avoid the commitment to reporting their performance indicators to their local electors. Like many local authorities, Brent is not well served by local papers any more. The local papers that we have do their best, but the money is not there, compared with 25 years ago when I was first elected to a local authority. They no longer have long-standing members of staff or a substantial staff who are able to report what is going on in detail. Those papers have had to make so many economies and they are far too reliant on handouts from local authorities.<br/>
7.45 pm<br/>
In my own local authority area, the council has chosen to report performance indicators by giving the local free sheet a special deal. The paper appears with a wrap-around bit, like the wrapping around fish and chips, which one immediately discards and moves on to the real fish in the middle. The long-standing local paper, which has been published for more than 100 years, does not get the benefit of that deal because it is often slightly critical of the local authority.<br/>
If the council buys the service, it is able to dictate the format of what is provided. When, once a year, I get my copy of the <i>Brent Recorder</i>&#x2014;which Brent council has paid to report the performance indicators to every household in Brent&#x2014;it thuds through the letter box. I pick it up and instead of the usual colourful cover there is what looks like half a dozen pages of <i>Hansard</i>&#x2014;dull, dead type that nobody would bother to read unless they had a severe case of insomnia. I can hear what happens all over Brent. The paper thuds through the letter box, and that is followed by a scrunching-up noise which works its way through the borough as everyone tears up the so-called performance indicator report and dumps it in the bin so that they can read the contents of the real newspaper. Other than people such as myself, who pore over the report to see where the corruption and fraud have been hidden, nobody else in Brent has any interest in it whatever.<br/>
The council is prepared to discharge its duty to report in that most minimal way, but it can find thousands of pounds to produce a nice glossy magazine with colour


photographs and endless pictures of the leader of the council. Given what he looks like, that is not necessarily a good idea. The magazine contains wonderful stories about the joys of living in Brent, which imply that everyone in Brent is living on some wonderful tropical island where nobody ever has to work and everyone has a life style like the old Greek gods.<br/>
People in Brent pick up that rubbish every few months and they cannot believe the descriptions of the town that they see around them, with garbage in the streets, and so on: we never see a street-sweeper because, as the performance indicators show, that is not Brent's strong suit. The magazine is an attempt to bypass any real duty to report the performance indicators that Parliament has required, with agreement, to be made available so that local residents can monitor their council's performance.<br/>
Brent has two local papers&#x2014;the <i>Kilburn Times</i> and the <i>Willesden and Brent Chronicle,</i> which are part of the same group. Because they report things such as the ombudsman's reports, they are under constant pressure from the local authority. The system cannot operate if the council puts completely unacceptable pressure on well established local newspapers not to report anything that the council does not want reported. I have found it especially offensive that the chief executive of the council has written to each local department head to tell them not to advertise in those papers because they write critical stories about the council.<br/>
There are bound to be critical stories about the council. If out of 32 London boroughs, a council spends less on education and social services than every other borough, it will occasionally get a tad of criticism. If, out of the whole of south-east England, including Greater London, Kent, Surrey, and East and West Sussex, a third of all complaints to the local government ombudsman are about one council, that will occasionally get into the local press. I should like to see the code of conduct that we are putting into the Government's hands improved to stop intimidation of the press.<br/>
Many local newspapers are always struggling. The threat is issued that advertising will be withdrawn if they print unfavourable stories. That makes a mockery of any suggestion that there can be fair and honest reporting for local people about the performance indicators that the Audit Commission has produced, which no one questions are good guides to relative performance.<br/>
The process can be taken one stage further. The current chief executive at Brent, a guy called George Benham, circulated a memorandum&#x2014;this is no wild, manic rumour of the sort that might be read in <i>Socialist Campaign Group News</i>&#x2014;to all departmental heads in the borough. I should explain that they are called business units now. There are about 140 such units. I write to what used to be the director of education asking, "Can you get little Johnny into a school?" The reply refers to "the customer". We are dealing with little Johnny, not a customer, and little Johnny wants to go to a school.<br/>
We have business units with advertising budgets. George Benham writes to the units telling them, "Mr. Livingstone keeps attacking the council." The atmosphere is fetid. He, George Benham, suggests, "It would be useful if Mr. Livingstone were not invited to any function at which councillors might be present.

Mr. Livingstone's presence is embarrassing to them." That is the climate in the borough. It is one that puts pressure on local newspapers not to report issues such as performance indicators.<br/>
What happens if an authority gets away with what I have described year after year? I reflect on the past five years. There was a Conservative minority administration, which still hangs on by a casting vote. It has managed to hang on to power. It is helped if it can manipulate information. If an authority gets away with that for five years, it becomes extremely arrogant.<br/>
The ombudsman is undertaking an investigation. Indeed, 17 investigations are being undertaken by the fraud squad, the ombudsman and the council's internal audit. That is going some when there is a Tory group of only 33. Some of the investigations are multiple. Some councillors are being investigated by the fraud squad, the ombudsman and the internal auditors. Everything is being examined from &#x00A3;75,000 grants being handed out in exchange for support in a local government election down to the small stuff such as local builders being employed to clean a councillor's windows. All this stuff builds up.<br/>
At the same time, arrogance increases. There is the example of the AdShop. The issue was discussed in Committee and I was grateful when I was not criticised for raising it. There was no word of support for Brent council from anyone on the Government side. When I reported activities taking place in Brent, no Conservative Member was prepared to stick his neck out by saying, for example, "I am sure that's not true," or to say one word in defence of Brent council. I congratulate the Minister and Conservative Back-Bench Members on their perspicacity and good sense.<br/>
I return to the AdShop. A business unit showed a loss of &#x00A3;400,000. Amazing things were going on. The staff decided that they wanted a meeting. It was thought that it would take an hour. It was decided that everyone should fly to Schiphol international airport at Amsterdam. The VIP lounge had been booked for the staff meeting. Of course, after the staff meetings, the rest of the day was available. These happenings are not reported too well when there is the level of intimidation that I have described. We are offering the Government a code of conduct to enable them to clamp down on abuse. If the code were implemented, local reporting would not be stifled.<br/>
When these matters were raised in council, the committee chair concerned was approached by a reporter from the <i>Willesden and Brent Chronicle,</i> Miss Kamala Hayman. His response was, "If you publish any of this, I shall take you out of the back of the town hall and break your legs." What chance is there of honest reporting of performance indicators when a leading member of the Conservative administration, in front of witnesses at a full council meeting, turns on a young woman reporter and says, "I am going to take you out of the town hall and break your legs"? I rest my case.</p>

<p>The nicest thing about listening to the hon. Member for Brent, East (Mr. Livingstone) was to note that the tables had been turned on him. I remember reading the <i>Londoner</i> and gnashing my teeth&#x2014;that is probably an appropriate description&#x2014;at the gobbledegook and biased propaganda.


When I reflect on the propaganda, as the hon. Gentleman describes it, that emanates from Brent council, it is almost always eminently fair, straight and above board. If the hon. Gentleman feels that he is living in the Bahamas, perhaps we should get a psychiatrist to help him.<br/>
I understand the thinking behind the amendments. At one stage I was tempted by amendment No. 5. We share a common objective to ensure that local authorities publish information about performance that is unbiased and informative. The Bill achieves that by providing that publication must be subject to independent editorial control. I understand that the approach of Opposition Members might be used to the same ends. However, my memory does not have to go back too far to when I was in local government.<br/>
That leads me to baulk at what they propose, which would land local government and the Government with more regulation. There would be more intervention. We would need yet another code of practice. That would have to specify what information would be included and what might or should not be included. How could we deal with editorial bias? Would we need a stand-alone document, which would mean more expense for local authorities? I do not think that anyone in this place wants that level of interference.<br/>
The Government's approach is preferable. Local authorities and Parliament will be in no doubt about the publication requirements and will not face the possibility of changes to those requirements from year to year.</p>

<p>The amendments offer a range of options. If an authority were using the most expensive option, it would fall foul of value-for-money and other regulations that are already in place. We are offering a menu of options to enable each local authority to choose the most effective and appropriate approach in its area. That gives force to the amendments. I urge the Minister to think again. If the amendments are agreed to, the options set out in the Bill could still be implemented by a local authority if that were appropriate.</p>

<p>The hon. Lady has outlined why there was temptation at an earlier stage, which I am now resisting.<br/>
I suspect that amendments Nos. 6 and 7 are tied closely to amendment No. 5. At the same time, they are surprising. The removal of the distribution requirement flies in the face of arguments previously advanced by Opposition Members and would worsen the various situations highlighted in Committee by the hon. Lady, especially that regarding her father. Local authorities would be given complete discretion on distribution and they could satisfy the requirement simply by using a free newspaper that had only a limited distribution. That would undermine opportunity for those who wish to seek a newspaper and to seek the information within it.<br/>
Amendments Nos. 1 and 2, tabled by the hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Rendel), adopt a different approach to distribution. I understand the hon. Gentleman's reasons for tabling amendment No. 1, but it strikes me as being impractical. How do we assess the number of people who will be reached by a paid-for newspaper? Amendment No. 2 is more onerous than the existing clause in respect of business premises. The amendment would force local authorities to reach 80 per cent. of the business community, whereas the current wording leaves such matters to the judgment of the authority.<br/>
All the amendments illustrate a misunderstanding of the meaning behind clause 5. That leads me to stress two points from the outset. First, the publication provisions are no more than minimum requirements. That answers my hon. Friend the Member for Portsmouth, North (Mr. Griffiths). It may be that, given its local circumstances, an authority believes that some additional publication over and above the minimum requirements would represent value for money in terms of effective accountability and communicating with its citizens. That was touched on by my hon. Friend the Member for Portsmouth, North.<br/>
If my hon. Friend reflects on the words of the hon. Member for Brent, East and those of some of the authorities that he and I would care to name for having the expertise to get round legislation and codes of practice, for example, he will understand the Government's thinking. In such cases, it is open to an authority to provide such additional publication&#x2014;for example, including performance information in its own in-house journal delivered to its citizens&#x2014;and we believe that it would be right for it to do so, particularly in Brent.<br/>
Secondly, there is a simple principle underlying these minimum requirements: whatever forms of publication are chosen by an authority, information about its performance, as measured against the Audit Commission's indicators, is at least available throughout its area in a publication that is wholly independent of the authority. We attach the utmost importance to that information being readily available to all who wish to obtain it, and in a context where an authority cannot seek to put its own gloss on the objective measures of its performance. The hon. Member for Brent, East made that point.<br/>
8 pm<br/>
The Local Government Act 1992 requires publication of an authority's performance information in a newspaper circulating in its area. Such a newspaper is available in shops in the area; it is thus available to anyone who chooses to purchase it, even if they have to travel some distance to do so, as is the case in some rural areas. Such a newspaper is also edited independently of the authority, and the requirement to publish in a newspaper circulating in an authority's area therefore satisfies our underlying principle.<br/>
We now believe that, in the light of the representations that we have received from the Audit Commission and local government, this underlying principle can equally be satisfied in certain cases by publication in free newspapers delivered to dwellings. These cases are where the free newspapers are wholly independent of the authority concerned, and where the free newspapers are distributed throughout the authority's area.<br/>
Where a free newspaper is wholly independent of the authority, it is edited independently of that authority just like a paid-for newspaper. Equally, where free newspapers are distributed to dwellings throughout the authority's area&#x2014;the situation that the distribution requirement in clause 5 seeks to describe&#x2014;these newspapers can be seen to be generally available, even though they might not be available in the shops. I have deliberately referred to free newspapers in the plural; if an authority chooses to go down the free newspaper route, it is immaterial whether availability throughout its area is achieved through one or


several such newspapers. We therefore seek in clause 5 to extend the ways in which an authority can fulfil the minimum publication requirement.<br/>
There remains the established way of using paid-for newspapers. We are now seeking to introduce a new option, as requested by local authorities, of using free newspapers in the circumstances that I have just described, where the use of such newspapers would be consistent with our underlying publication principle. The modest increase in flexibility as to how the minimum publication requirement can be fulfilled is all we seek to achieve.<br/>
I trust that Opposition Members will feel that they can now accept the assurances that I have given and withdraw the amendments.</p>

<p>One could probably talk about Brent until 10 o'clock without a note, but as I raised most of my points on Second Reading, there remain only a couple to which I wish to draw the attention of the House.<br/>
The Bill is a missed opportunity. We all welcome the steps forward in social services and the chance to have joint investigations and so on. I make a plea only that the Minister makes it clear to the Audit Commission that we would like it to start with Brent, because out of 32 London boroughs, Brent spends the least on social services, although there is massive need in my constituency and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng) that is as bad as anything in the east end. I hope that the Bill will allow us to examine that. In any investigation about Brent, what we see is major neglect. An independent assessment was made of social services&#x2014;</p>

<p>I hope that the Minister will ensure that we have a rapid investigation of the social services department of Brent and the studies and joint studies that have been mentioned, and that the Bill will give the Audit Commission the power to get involved. The closest that we have come to any comparative investigation was last year. An independent expert in social services was brought in, and discovered on examining the case files in the register of children at risk that 10 per cent. of all the files were illegible. How can Brent social services department be functioning adequately? I hope that we shall hear from the Minister that he shares that concern.

Nobody can be proud of that record. How can one defend children at risk when in 10 per cent. of cases one cannot even read the files?</p>

<p>I made that point because the powers already exist, and I want them used in Brent, which, of all social services departments in Britain, has the most urgent need. I do not believe that any hon. Member would be other than horrified to discover that the constituents whom they represent had to suffer in such circumstances. How does one create such a complete air of neglect? The comparative studies that are now possible and the strengthening of the Audit Commission in social services must give it the ability to step in. Even if it cannot take control, it can at least draw attention through the new powers to areas were one borough council is performing dramatically worse than others.<br/>
As I mentioned in Committee, the question of reporting should have been in the Bill. I shall not repeat on Third Reading everything that I said about it in Committee, but this is a tremendous missed opportunity. I hope that the Bill will be strategically amended in the other place to strengthen the powers that will be given to the Minister. If it is, I hope that the Government will the accept the proposals, because what we have is not adequate.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for North-West Durham (Ms Armstrong) made it clear that we are not happy with what we heard from the Minister. If the Bill is amended in the other place, he will have the support of the House to use tougher powers to stop the abuse of the system of reporting on performance indicators. If cannot be right if those indicators are reported in such a way that nobody is interested in looking at them.<br/>
Who would produce an election address of just solid, turgid type? No one would read it. We have nice pictures of ourselves. We have pictures to illustrate local topics. We have graphics. If a council refuses to use those options and just produces dense acres of type, people will not plough through it.<br/>
I hope that, when the Bill goes to the other place, Government amendments will be tabled to strengthen it along the lines suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Durham. If he did that, he would have the support of the Opposition and, I suspect, the Liberal Democrats as well.</p>

<p>I do not wish to detain the House for much longer, but hon. Members should be reminded that the Government were given an opportunity to clarify their wish to use the Audit Commission more effectively to secure probity and the delivery of high-quality services in local government.<br/>
The Bill deals with two fairly minor matters. It proposes that the social services inspectorate should be able to work with the Audit Commission to inspect whole social services departments, an important new power which I welcome. I have always considered it nonsense that no power to ensure both effectiveness and value for money is enshrined in legislation. I also welcome the


Government's recognition that the current regime for the publication of performance indicators does not meet its objectives. However, I still do not think that the Bill has got it right.<br/>
The Government have not faced up to the problems that local government has asked them to tackle. My hon. Friend the Member for Brent, East (Mr. Livingstone) talked about Brent and, on Second Reading, my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) spoke of the delay in solving Lambeth's problems, which was due partly to the fact that the auditor had not the necessary powers and partly to a lack of consistency. In Committee, we had a short debate about the importance of consistency among district auditors, and ways of ensuring that were suggested. I am sorry that the Government did not take the opportunity provided by some of our amendments.<br/>
On Second Reading, my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras also mentioned Brent and Westminster. He pointed out that in those boroughs, as well as in Lambeth, the public could not feel confident about the way in which matters had been handled, and that the district auditor had continually been thwarted. It is our responsibility to ensure that government at every level is as open, honest and responsive to local people as the House can make it. I am sorry that the Government did not tackle that issue in the Bill.</p>

<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this topic. As I raised it in April last year, it may seem strange that I have raised it again tonight, but significant developments have taken place in the intervening time. I make no apology for bringing up the subject again, as there is still great public concern about the future of Edgware general hospital.<br/>
The issue must be examined again very meticulously: although it is a local issue, it impinges on all the services provided by the NHS in the neighbouring areas of north and north-west London, and, indeed&#x2014;as some patients are referred from parts of greater London that are a long way away&#x2014;on services north of the river generally.<br/>
I thank my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Health for his attendance. I hope that he will be able to reassure me. This has been a long campaign: it began when the last Secretary of State for Health made what we regarded locally as a tragic, unnecessary and unjustified decision to allow local agencies to proceed with the closure of the hospital's accident and emergency unit, and it continues in full force.<br/>
It is interesting to reflect on the panoply of local campaigns, which seek numerous objectives. I suppose that nothing is more important than the provision of health services&#x2014;the services of hospitals, GPs and clinicians, and all the other facilities that are provided by a national health service in which we still take enormous pride. Health is one of the most crucial issues, especially for older people.<br/>
Experience suggests, however, that&#x2014;logically and understandably&#x2014;once a decision has been made, even local people who disagree passionately with that decision may drift away from their previous strong position. Although their arguments retain their validity, they may say, "There is nothing that we can do. The authorities are determined to go ahead, and we must accept their decision even if we still disagree with it."<br/>
In this case, however, that has not happened: if anything, feelings are stronger than they were before. That is a remarkable phenomenon, which I cannot recall observing before in many years of becoming involved in local issues. The passions aroused by this unwise decision are still extremely powerful, and the mass campaign continues&#x2014;supported by most local politicians, both councillors and Members of Parliament. That must be borne in mind; but it is even more important to bear in mind the tangible underlying reasons why the proposed closure is a mistake.<br/>
It was in that spirit that, along with other hon. Members from all parties, I tabled an early-day motion on 22 January. The composition of those who signed the motion reflected approximately the percentage of referrals from constituencies in the area surrounding the hospital. The motion asked the Department of Health and the Ministers concerned to ask Barnet district health authority and the other bodies involved, including the Wellhouse trust itself, to look at the matter again.<br/>
In early November, in the House of Lords, my noble Friend Baroness Cumberlege&#x2014;speaking on behalf of the Secretary of State&#x2014;repeated emphatically that, in a


process of extensive and thorough consultation, Barnet health authority and the Wellhouse trust had consistently sought to involve the public in their deliberations through a series of public meetings and the distribution of leaflets and articles in the local press. My noble Friend went on to say that the Secretary of State would not be reversing decisions made by his predecessor.<br/>
I can understand that. That is the normal basis on which a new Secretary of State takes over a portfolio, which will include all the adjustments that have been made in hospital policy. Conservative Members need no lectures from the Labour party, which many years ago, when it was in government, either closed or savagely cut some 60 hospital units per annum.<br/>
It is normal, and natural, for Secretaries of State to say, "I cannot go back on the decisions of my predecessor." Officials present the position in those terms when the new Secretary of State takes over. Dossiers are examined, but there is no suggestion of reconsidering closure proposals. That is understandable, but I nevertheless feel that a fundamental mistake has been made in this instance. Given the importance of the issue to local people, I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will listen to the details sympathetically.<br/>
I was grateful for the opportunity to raise the matter in the lengthy Adjournment debate that took place on 5 April. Once again, tonight's debate has begun before the time when public business normally ends in the Chamber. Let me reassure you, Mr. Deputy Speaker: that does not mean that I shall speak at excessive length. I believe that my hon. Friend the Minister has an engagement, and I shall be speaking at a dinner if I manage to arrive on time.<br/>
In the previous debate on the Audit (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, the hon. Member for Brent, East (Mr. Livingstone) was, for various reasons, obsessed with the state of Brent council. With even more justification, I am obsessed with the future of Edgware general hospital, although, I hasten to add, it is on the other side of the road shared equally between myself and my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, North (Sir J. Gorst).<br/>
I remind my hon. Friend the Minister of a number of important considerations that, once again, point powerfully to an unusual and demanding position that can irritate any Government, Ministers and officials who, once they have reached a decision, believe that they cannot go back on it. In this case, there are reasons for reconsidering the matter carefully.<br/>
I reiterate what I said on 5 April during the previous Adjournment debate. When the accident and emergency facilities at the Royal National orthopaedic hospital in Stanmore were closed about 12 years ago, it was reiterated repeatedly by the local agencies&#x2014;the Minister will recall that there was a different structure then&#x2014;and by Government spokesmen&#x2014;and I can give chapter and verse on this any time the Minister cares to ask for it&#x2014; that the local public did not need to be concerned about that, because the A and E facilities at Edgware general, which was just down the road, would take care of any substitution.<br/>
That important factor persuaded a number of local people reluctantly but gradually to accept the closure of the Royal National orthopaedic hospital's A and E unit&#x2014;

a successful unit, and one close to the Ml motorway. That closure was also a mistake, but it happened a long time ago, and we cannot go back on it.<br/>
In that Adjournment debate, if I may quote without taxing the House's patience, I said:
<q>I am worried about all aspects of the closure proposal. That is why others and I will be fighting hard and relentlessly to persuade the Government to change their mind. I am especially concerned about traffic congestion. It is an extremely congested area. If people are obliged to go to Barnet, Northwick Park"&#x2014;</q>
the main district general hospital in the middle of my constituency, and located alongside the town centre&#x2014;
<q>or the Royal Free Hospitals, their journeys will take a great deal of time."&#x2014;<i>[Official Report,</i> 5 April 1995; Vol. 257, c. 1792.]</q>
There has been no significant reassurance by anyone that I care to recall&#x2014;unless the Minister can disabuse me tonight&#x2014;that that would not be so. The local public are extremely worried about that.<br/>
The hospital's A and E services are needed as much as the Barnet hospital must be expanded. Because it is in another region, I shall deliberately refrain from commenting too much in detail on Barnet hospital and its build-up, which I also welcome. No doubt there will be some referrals from my constituency to that hospital, although obviously not many. That would be welcomed by the local public, but it does not negate or reduce the primary requirement for Edgware general to remain a major multi-department medical facility in its own right, and not to be truncated drastically and tragically by closing its most important section&#x2014;the accident and emergency facilities.<br/>
There is no reassurance so far on that point. It remains to be seen what the Government and others responsible for the decision will say in detail about these matters. Traffic congestion is one of the main issues that will arise again and again when these matters are considered.<br/>
There is no diminution in the force of the local campaign&#x2014;I emphasise that. I am not at all reassured by any statements so far from the Wellhouse trust, London ambulance service representatives, other people involved and Department spokesmen. There has been no significant tangible reassurance about the provision of the necessary ambulance services that would take care of additional journeys to the other units instead of Edgware general. That is a glaring gap in the range of information that is needed to reassure the local public as the campaign forges ahead, trying to persuade the Government to change their mind on this important issue.<br/>
I referred to that matter last June, when there was a further development in the local campaign. There was an enormous expansion in public anger and resentment that the authorities would in no way reconsider the decision. As I mentioned in that Adjournment debate and elsewhere, the local public consultations, including those of the regional health authority, were extremely inadequate and people did not feel that their points were listened to with care and responded to in any way. They were brushed aside&#x2014;that is the glaring truth of this sad saga.<br/>
After a further stage in the campaign, when a number of meetings took place, I suggested In my June statement:
<q>we have to stick together to try and persuade the Department of Health to change its mind. This is a gigantic task. We should be firmly united, not seeking narrow Party advantage.</q>


The campaign is of the whole of the people, and has nothing to do with political parties in that direct detail.<br/>
The statement continues:
<q>It needs to be a sober campaign not an historical and emotional one.</q>
In that campaign, local politicians should aim to achieve the central objective of persuading the Government to change their mind on the A and E facility, not seek to score points off each other or indulge in gesture politics, which will not save the accident and emergency facilities.<br/>
In that spirit, there were various questions from me and hon. Members in the summer months, seeking to get the Government to persuade Barnet health authority to change its recommendation and to reconsider these matters, as it could within its own powers, but we did not succeed, as is well known.<br/>
Autumn came. After continued campaigning, there was still no significant response from the Department to, for example, my question in a letter to the Secretary of State for Health on 21 July about traffic congestion and the excessive time needed for ambulance journeys Northwick Park hospital even with the blue light operating. Some informal tests have been done of those journey times, which were disturbingly long.<br/>
I again show to the Minister the local map produced by the Canons Park residents association campaign in its newsletter, an effective document. It produced a series of articles about the issue, continuously, up to the latest editions, showing again how congested the area around the Edgware general hospital is, how relatively uncongested the area around Barnet general hospital is, and the difficulty of those various journey times.<br/>
In July last year, the Prime Minister was kind enough to reply to my letter to him. I thought it was right to make some of these points to No. 10 Downing street. At the end of his letter, he confirmed that it was necessary to retain "significant" hospital services at Edgware. He did not go into detail&#x2014;rightly, he left that to the Department and to his colleagues&#x2014;but it is what "significant" means that is of major concern.<br/>
All the medical experts that I have talked to say in some detail say that, if we excise anything other than just the marginal A and E services in a modern A and E unit such as that at Edgware hospital, we inevitably undermine the provision of services in that hospital and its ultimate rationale. We could turn it into a sort of bucket hospital&#x2014; if that is the right phrase, without alarming people excessively&#x2014;that just starts running down.<br/>
I am sad to say that there are a few examples of the running down of facilities already as people psychologically start preparing for the ominous moment in May 1997, the scheduled date for the closure of this significant facility. They are starting to think of it as a much truncated unit offering a limited range of services.<br/>
There is still time, however, for all this to be reconsidered, without anyone being humiliated into a drastic climbdown or a change that is beyond all reasonable expectations. It would be absurd for anyone to expect the Government to say that they are completely reversing a decision that was taken after, I presume they would suggest, considerable thought, but it is the way in which the issue is reconsidered to try and achieve the right solution for the modern A and E facility that we still want at Edgware hospital in 1997 and beyond that is important.<br/>
That is the key to what the Government can suggest to Barnet health authority and the Wellhouse Trust on how they should handle the matter and reconsider. None the less, I am aware of the absolute need to support the new managers of Wellhouse trust and not to humiliate or embarrass them, or to make them think that their role is being betrayed by a change that goes beyond their expectations for the detailed range of services that the modern hospital will offer.<br/>
I acknowledge that Barnet, with its expanded, modern, high-technology facilities, is vital, especially for people in the northern part of that borough. Again, I shall deliberately refrain from annoying my colleagues, if they read my words in <i>Hansard,</i> by commenting too much on what is happening outside my borough of Harrow. <br/>
Of course, Northwick Park hospital is central to our requirements in Harrow town centre. It also serves Brent, and takes patient referrals from as far as away as Ealing and beyond. However, Edgware general is in the middle of all those areas, and it should still be a significant major hospital for them, rather than being reduced, as it might be, to a low-facility unit.<br/>
The campaign continues. I pay tribute to the enormous power and effect of the Hands Off Our Hospitals campaign, and to all the people who have organised it. They have not given up; they have not reduced their activity and efforts. I shall bring to the Minister's attention information that we received recently through the campaign supporters' newsletter. There will be a campaign consultative meeting on 22 February, and another major rally, to engage the attention of all of the public in that area again, on 19 March, right in the heart of the Edgware general hospital area.<br/>
I understand the temptations for Ministers, bureaucrats and officials. If I were in their position, I should probably feel the same, and hope that attrition would account for the campaign, and that there would be a diminution in the intensity of feeling. But that is not happening. I must emphasise that to the Minister as strongly as I can. People want those significant facilities to remain. They want much more than the suggested replacement&#x2014;that is, the minor accident treatment service now officially proposed by Wellhouse.<br/>
The consultations that the trust management said would be undertaken do not seem to have added up to much yet, although my colleagues and I have been offered several meetings. I do not decry that in any way, but I am not sure the trust is doing what it should for the local public.<br/>
There was an arresting headline in the local press recently. I hope that I am not showing too many exhibits tonight, Mr. Deputy Speaker, as if we were in a court of law, but we are dealing with a vital issue for the local population, and I am grateful for your indulgence. I should be happy to let the Minister have a copy of the 1 February edition of the <i>Edgware and Mill Hill Times,</i> whose headline is "Closure plans may be illegal".<br/>
I have been dealing with many other matters this week, so I have not had the chance to find out whether that charge has been refuted, from whatever quarter, so I quote it subject to those inevitable reservations. Underneath that startling headline is another: "CHC threatens legal action over lack of consultation on Edgware General". The article says:
<q>Barnet's patient watchdog has accused health chiefs of acting illegally over plans to close Casualty"&#x2014;</q>


that is, the accident and emergency facility&#x2014;
<q>and has warned it could take the matter to the courts.</q>
<q>Barnet Community Health Council&#x2026; believes that Barnet Health Authority &#x2026; is breaking the law by obstructing it in its duty to be consulted over health care changes.</q>
Much more follows, and what the newspaper says must be of significant concern to the Department of Health when it considers what would be the only drastic reduction or elimination of a major facility in a significant NHS hospital on the outer London fringes. That, among other reasons, is why we feel so steamed up about it.<br/>
One reason why I have deliberately raised the subject now is that there are now rumours of possible second thoughts from the Department of Health, and of a possible reconsideration of some aspects. The Wellhouse trust management may be trying to engage the attention and sympathy of local GPs, by holding various consultations to try to find possible ways through the problems.<br/>
Provided that the present A and E facilities are to be retained in their basic and major form, any suggestion would be considered fairly and fully by the patient representatives, by the representatives and spokesmen of the Hands Off Our Hospitals campaign, by the local parliamentary representatives, by local councillors and by the many thousands of other local people involved.<br/>
It is now for the Government to take on board the serious fact that the campaign will not go away. The campaign has no narrow political axe to grind; it represents literal common-sense reality, and what the local public feel, aided by their medical advisors and by a range of powerful voices from GPs, surgeons and consultants, all of which say that the decision must be reconsidered.<br/>
A basic mistake was made. The profound consultation necessary was lacking. There was an unwillingness&#x2014; possibly inadvertent but, unfortunately, probably deliberate&#x2014;on the part of the regional health authority and the district health authority to consider the many and voluminous representations of local protestors.<br/>
Those people were not simply indulging in the normal knee-jerk reaction, without any consideration of the details, when medical facilities are threatened. The very location of the hospital provides the main reason for the continuing concern. There is an overriding need for the Government to think again and to work out how they can accommodate the demands from Members of Parliament and from the local public.<br/>
The campaign will not go away. It will continue. If the Secretary of State and his ministerial colleagues can give us comfort and say that the services will be maintained, the public will be reassured, even if there are to be some changes. I am speaking theoretically, because I do not want to raise the subject of change deliberately.<br/>
For obvious reasons, I refrain from making any specific suggestions tonight. But even if the main high-technology equipment is to be located at Barnet&#x2014;one can understand the investment priorities of its new programme&#x2014;none the less, despite that small reduction at the margin, the whole range of existing A and E facilities could be maintained.<br/>
There must be a way forward, a way in which the Government can meet the demands of the local public. If not, the campaign, the agitation&#x2014;I use that word in a

respectful sense&#x2014;and the massive force of the combined voice of the people will continue, and I shall give it my full support all the way, as is my duty as a Member of Parliament.<br/>
I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister can say something that will help, because the local press will be waiting for the <i>Hansard</i> report of the debate. I did not suggest that, but that is what I was told. This is a most important occasion. There is still more than a year before the fateful decision is to be made, and before there will be any further damaging rundown of the hospital. Alarming stories are already coming out. I hear messages about them every week, with examples of services that are just beginning to be reduced at the margins, because of the low morale of everybody involved and the plight of the staff, for whom I have much sympathy.<br/>
The Government now have a marvellous opportunity to seek to reassure us and to put a new dynamic into the future of the Edgware general hospital, by saying that the important A and E facilities will be kept&#x2014;because, as I have explained, they make sense. So I look forward with great anticipation to my hon. Friend's words.</p>

<p>I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, East (Mr. Dykes) on his success in the ballot, and I am pleased to have the opportunity to debate what is undoubtedly an important matter. As always, my hon. Friend spoke forcefully and with eloquence in advocating the best possible health care for his constituents. He has, if I may say so, conducted a long and skilful campaign on the matter.<br/>
I should mention in passing that my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, South (Mr. Marshall), who has also been assiduous in this matter, unfortunately cannot be here this evening. I know that he has also played a part in the long-running campaign.<br/>
I acknowledge the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, East made forcibly about the strength of local feeling on the matter, which is probably running as high as it has been at any stage during the whole lengthy business. I can assure him that the Government are concerned about the matter. Ministerial colleagues and I have devoted a great deal of time and attention to the subject in recent months, and we want to ensure the best possible balance for the future provision in the area. I hope that my hon. Friend will take those commitments and assurances in the spirit in which they are given.<br/>
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has recently met deputations about the future of Edgware hospital&#x2014; including one led by my hon. Friend&#x2014;and the matter has been the subject of debate in this House and in another place on a number of occasions. I also assure my hon. Friend that the Government's first priority, and that of the Secretary of State, is to put the interests of the patient first. As decisions are implemented and new decisions are taken, our guiding principle will be that the quality of service should be at the very least maintained, and wherever possible improved.<br/>
The changes already agreed at Edgware are designed to provide the people of Barnet and Edgware with a high-quality, improved clinical service for patients. The present split-site arrangements at the Wellhouse


NHS trust, with the inevitable duplication of facilities between the Barnet and Edgware sites, are not only inefficient, but significantly detrimental to good patient care. That is despite the dedication and hard work of the excellent medical and nursing staff at the Wellhouse trust. To ensure that the best health services possible are provided, patients need modern facilities in hospitals large enough to ensure appropriate levels of staffing and expertise. That is precisely what the development at Barnet general hospital is about.<br/>
The changes due to take place at Edgware and Barnet hospitals are part of a long-term programme of improvements to health services provided at the Wellhouse trust. They have been finalised only after an extensive and thorough process of consultation. Barnet health authority has been exemplary in involving the public in its deliberations through a series of public meetings, the distribution of leaflets and articles in the local press. It has gone to great lengths to explain how patients will benefit from the planned changes, and why change is necessary.<br/>
Inevitably, when change comes to much-loved local hospitals such as Edgware, there is great public concern. It is also unavoidable that, when changes to any local health services are determined, there will be some who find the new arrangements less convenient. I fully understand that. I say again, however, that we believe that the changes at Edgware and Barnet will lead to an improvement in patient care.<br/>
I now wish to refer to the implications for Edgware hospital, which are of such concern to my hon. Friend. Despite any change to its status that may ensue, Edgware hospital will continue to be a significant provider of health care in the area. I note the point that my hon. Friend made about a letter from my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, which stated that the hospital would be a significant provider of health care. He rightly asked what exactly was meant by the word "significant" in that context.<br/>
The Government mean that there will be an extensive provision of out-patient clinics, day-care services, a breast-screening centre and mental health services. These will ensure that the hospital continues to provide an extremely wide range of services. In addition, an accident service will continue at Edgware. My hon. Friend knows that the MATS centre&#x2014;to use the jargon&#x2014;was opened by the chief nursing officer in November 1995, and the majority of patients who currently look to Edgware for their health care needs will continue to find them there.<br/>
Decisions remain to be taken on the final pattern of services at Edgware. Consultation is under way on various proposals, including the treatment of the elderly and children on the Edgware site. The decisions that have already been taken&#x2014;never mind those that may be taken following consultation&#x2014;mean that around four out of every five patients currently attending Edgware will continue to be treated there.<br/>
I must also emphasise&#x2014;quite apart from what I have said about existing and potential services&#x2014;that the changes at Edgware hospital will not happen immediately. They will only take place once any redevelopment of Barnet general hospital and the expansion of services at Northwick Park and the Royal Free hospital have been completed, and improvements in the ambulance service have started to be delivered. All this is part of a coherent

plan, and we must ensure that nothing happens until we are perfectly certain that all the other elements are in place.<br/>
The House will be aware that the redeveloped Barnet general hospital will provide the full range of acute services. I can assure the House that the facilities being developed there will be of the highest quality. The &#x00A3;29 million first phase of redevelopment work started in November last year. The second and final phase, costing &#x00A3;33 million, can now go ahead. Once this work has been completed, we will in effect have built an entirely new hospital, which will allow local people access to the highest quality specialist acute facilities. The new accident and emergency department at Barnet will be one of the most up-to-date in the country, capable of treating 70,000 patients a year to the highest clinical standards.<br/>
As Edgware hospital changes its role and becomes more of a local hospital, so local primary services will need to adapt to the different circumstances. It is an essential element of the plans that primary care services will be developed. Local GPs will need time to develop human and financial resources to manage the shift from secondary to primary care, and will need to be closely involved in the development of services on the Edgware site.<br/>
My hon. Friend did not mention the fact that, in order to facilitate these changes, the local primary health care development fund plans to invest &#x00A3;17 million over a five-year period to improve local primary care services. My hon. Friend knows that the Government believe that the health service should be primary care-led, so we attach great importance to bringing together hospital and primary care.<br/>
Projects at present under way include the extension of nursing in the home for the terminally ill, improvements in GP surgeries and an outreach ophthalmology clinic. Projects planned for the future include increases in community nursing staff, further training of GPs to carry out minor surgery, and the introduction of community physiotherapy to improve the care of diabetics. I believe that these developments provide an excellent framework in which to ensure the success of the new Edgware hospital.<br/>
My hon. Friend also referred to the problems of transport in the area. I am aware that specific concerns have been expressed about the problem. I do, of course, acknowledge that some patients from the Edgware area will have great difficulty in travelling to Barnet. For this reason, a free NHS bus service will operate between the sites for those patients who require services that are being concentrated at the Barnet site. Special arrangements will be made for elderly and infirm patients who are less mobile. It must be recognised, however, that the majority of the services currently provided at Edgware will remain.<br/>
Particular concern has been expressed about the problems of transport in relation to accident and emergency provision. To address these concerns, the health authority intends to provide additional investment over and above the significant increase already agreed this year. Two additional ambulances and crews will be funded at an extra cost of &#x00A3;320,000.<br/>
As a former Transport Minister, I have considerable sympathy for my hon. Friend's point about traffic congestion in the area. He said that that was a serious matter that had not been fully addressed. We take that


point seriously, and understand local concern that problems could be caused at the congested bottom end of the Ml. I will look at that point.</p>

<p>We are concerned about the specific length of the journey from Edgware general to Northwick Park. The actual time would be a minimum of 45 to 50 minutes in normal traffic conditions, and that is far too long.</p>

<p>I hear what my hon. Friend says, and that adds to my concerns about traffic congestion. I will look at that point.<br/>
We believe that the proposals approved for the development of hospital services for Edgware and Barnet will lead to improved health care for the local community.<br/>
They are being brought forward after lengthy consideration and consultation&#x2014;which has not yet been completed&#x2014;and will allow Barnet health authority to meet its statutory duty to ensure that residents of the area are provided with a comprehensive health service meeting the full range of their needs.<br/>
Some of the current facilities are below the standards that we believe patients should be able to expect. We are engaged in an effort to improve conditions for the people of the Harrow and Barnet area. We believe, therefore, that, if the plans are properly and fully implemented, taking into account the additional consultation, which is in train, that part of London will have facilities that will match the very best in the national health service.</p>
