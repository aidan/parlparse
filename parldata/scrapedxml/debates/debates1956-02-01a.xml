<p>Does the right hon. Gentleman think it right that Regular Royal Air Force personnel should be engaged upon cleaning and polishing thoroughly on Monday the lounge and hall; and dusting and mopping the dining room and morning room? This is an extract from a document for which a constituent of mine was put on five days' confinement to barracks for sending to me? Does the right hon. Gentleman think it right that the time of these men should be wasted in this way? Should not these jobs be performed by the officers' wives?</p>

<p>As soon as he applies in the proper way&#x2014;and sometimes aircraftmen do have some difficulty in knowing what are the proper channels&#x2014;will the Secretary of State give sympathetic consideration to his application, in view of the fact that his wife, who is an invalid and suffering from a very serious disability, has just had a child, and because I am quite certain that if the right hon.

<p>Obviously no decision can be given until the actual application is made, but my experience of the Air Ministry over a good many years&#x2014;and I think that all hon. Members would agree&#x2014;is that it gives careful attention to these cases.</p>

<p>asked the Secretary of State for Air whether he is now satisfied with the performance of the Hunter aircraft; whether restrictions upon firing its guns can now be lifted; how far it is still intended to proceed with the production of this aircraft in the numbers originally contemplated; and if he will make a statement.</p>

<p>The Hunter has proved its flying qualities in the Service. There are still certain restrictions on the firing of the Hunter's guns, and a programme of modifications is in progress.

<p>Is not the legislation with regard to street lighting chaotic at the moment? Is not the difference between grants for street lighting and grants for

road improvement deterring local authorities from carrying out lighting improvements which are very necessary from the point of view of road safety? Is there not something which my right hon. Friend can do not only to improve but to create uniformity in street lighting?</p>

<p>I am aware of the accidents which have occurred. The slippery surface which developed at the end of July, 1955, was promptly dealt with by the highway authority in August.

<p>Will the Minister look at this matter again, because there is a considerable difference between the bridge and the tunnel?

<p>Is the hon. Gentleman aware that the traffic lights controlling east-west and west-east traffic do not synchronise, which causes confusion in the minds of pedestrians wanting to cross the road? Is he also aware that although the pedestrian crossing lights show green, pedestrians very frequently cannot cross because of the heavy traffic filtering from other directions?

<p>I am aware that there have been a number of accidents here recently and that it is because the two streams of traffic are not stopped at the same time.

In five out of the seven recent accidents the pedestrians did not cross at the lights but some distance from them.</p>

<p>Is the Joint Parliamentary Secretary aware that in Coventry over a period of twenty months there have been seven accidents which could be attributed directly to this lack of side windows, that the Coventry Water Undertaking desires to fit them, and that if it did so the Purchase Tax on each vehicle would be increased by &#x00A3;100, which is quite impossible?

<p>I am not concerned with the question of Purchase Tax&#x2014;that is a matter for the Treasury. From the point of view of road safety, we are not of the opinion that the provision of side windows would have any appreciable effect. Under Regulation 16 of the Construction and Use Regulations, 1955,
<q>Every motor vehicle shall be equipped either internally or externally with a mirror so constructed and fitted to the motor vehicle as to assist the driver if he so desires to become aware of traffic to the rear of the vehicle.</q>
We believe that the fitting of mirrors of that kind is a great deal more conducive to safety than having side windows, in which case it would be necessary for the driver to turn his head when, as a matter of fact, it would be better if he looked in front of him.</p>

<p>Nobody is better aware than I, as Chairman of the Road Safety Committee, of the gravity of the accidents which at present occur. We see no reason whatever to suppose that the provision of windows behind the driver's seat is

shortly No. 4. The crew took emergency action and it appeared that a ditching operation would have to be made.

<p>The effective capacity of a port depends upon a number of factors, and I could not attempt to particularise the individual ports which may have spare capacity for different classes of traffic.

<p>On the general question of railway safety, I would refer my hon. Friend to what I said on 25th January in answer to my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Knutsford (Lieut-Colonel Bromley Davenport) and the hon. and learned Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Hector Hughes) about discussions I have had with the British Transport Commission and the steps being taken by the Commission and the trade unions. I would also remind him of the significant statement issued by the British Railways Productivity Council last Friday about planned productivity through work study for increasing efficiency in British Railways. All this shows an improving situation of promise for the future.<br/>
As regards automatic train control, the most important thing is to have a system which is safe, efficient and reliable and which will command the unquestioning confidence of the railwaymen. This can only be developed by thorough practical trials, and development during 1955 reached an advanced stage. Three thousand and thirty track miles and 3,462 locomotives are fitted with automatic train control equipment, but these figures include the 2,953 track miles and 3,408 locomotives of the former Great Western Railway and the Tilbury Line. The number of locomotives so fitted is almost the same as at the beginning of 1955, but 27 additional track miles were fitted between London and Grantham towards the new trial length of 210 track miles which should be completed by the middle of this year.</p>

<p>Yes, Sir.

<p>I have been asked to reply.<br/>
I can best explain the position as follows. In those sectors of industry where productivity is increasing&#x2014;and it was those to which my right hon.

<p>To ask the Secretary of State for the Colonies, whether, in view of the forthcoming referendum in Malta, he will give an assurance that Her Majesty's Government accepts and supports the assurances given to the Archbishop of Malta by representatives of the Malta Round Table Conference as set out in paragraph 79 of the Report, Command Paper No. 9657.</p>

<p>With permission I will now answer Question No. 80.<br/>
My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister told the House on 24th January that Her Majesty's Government were considering the Report of the Malta Round Table Conference and that no action would be taken until there has been an opportunity of debate. The House will not expect or wish me to prejudge the decision which will be taken here and in Malta on the question of Integration.<br/>
I have read the Pastoral Letter of His Grace the Metropolitan Archbishop of Malta with the attention and respect that any pronouncement from him is bound to command. It would be unworthy of the importance of the issues we have to decide if His Grace's words were misinterpreted by protagonists of either side in the controversy over Integration.<br/>
I would remind the House of what my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister said on 10th November to my hon. Friend the Member for Brighton, Pavilion:
<q>My hon. Friend can be assured that Her Majesty's Government will take no action to prejudice the position of the Roman Catholic Church in Malta.</q>
I feel sure that the House when it comes to debate the Report will pay very great attention to the views on this matter of the members of the Conference, which of course was representative of all parties in this House.<br/>
I can moreover assure the House that Her Majesty's Government will not commend to Parliament any proposals which run counter to the assurances given to the Archbishop of Malta by representatives of the Round Table Conference as set out in paragraph 79 of its Report.</p>

<p>We welcome the fact that the Colonial Secretary has made this statement. I am sure that, in view of the Archbishop's Pastoral Letter, and despite the fact that we have not yet debated the Conference Report, it was wise for the Government to make their position plain, as they have done in the Minister's statement. Speaking for my right hon. and hon. Friends, we fully endorse the assurances given by the representatives of the Conference to the Archbishop as stated in paragraph 79 of the Report.</p>

<p>As I have seen the Archbishop since this took place, may I ask my right hon. Friend whether he is aware that the Archbishop was not completely satisfied with these definite statements made to him and that in his Pastoral Letter that fact is clearly set out? In view of the fact that Lord Perth, the only Roman Catholic member of the Round Table Conference, has added a rider to all this by stating that this is:
<q>&#x2026; on the assumption that appropriate and satisfactory assurances are provided in connection with any new constitutional arrangements</q>
can my right hon. Friend say whether, as the referendum is taking place within ten days' time, such assurances will be a possibility in the future?</p>

<p>Clearly, steps will have to be taken, if the decision of the House goes in favour of integration, to put into concrete fashion the assurance that I have just given, but I hope that what I have now said will be regarded as adequate assurance.

<p>It will be in the recollection of the Committee that when we reported Progress last night I was making a few remarks about this Amendment, a circumstance which, I thought, brought rather more pleasure to me than it did to hon. Members in the Committee. I have had an opportunity of reading in the OFFICIAL REPORT what I said last night and I am impressed by the pungency with which I developed the arguments I was about to make. In those circumstances, I do not think it necessary for me to trouble the Committee by repeating them.<br/>
I should like to summarise my two main criticisms of the Clause. The first was that it leaves far too much power in the hands of the Minister. It leaves some very vital decisions about the deployment of industry at the arbitrary discretion of the Minister. The second point is that the conditions are so obscure that it is quite impossible for anyone trying to plan a housing programme to know in advance whether the authority is to receive a subsidy or not without considerably protracted negotiations with a Government Department.<br/>
Considering the way in which the right hon. Gentleman and his Parliamentary Secretary have played up the idea that they are giving more independence and

more discretion to local authorities, this is a curious example of where they are trying very much to tighten central Government control.</p>

<p>I wish to support my right hon. Friend the Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Bevan) in the Amendment he has moved and to address myself in particular to the Amendment in my name, which, in short, provides for certification by the Minister of Labour should there be a shortage of manpower, in his opinion, in any given industry.<br/>
I think the Minister will not accuse me of any discourtesy to him personally if I say that what most of us on this side of the Committee are afraid of is a judgment of a Tory Minister in given circumstances of unemployment. It is this discretion of power rather than an obligation on his part that we are challenging. In the speech of the Minister on an earlier Amendment he said that the sort of case he had in mind which would fall within the power or powers given by this Clause was.
<q>&#x2026; where the need for more houses arises from a major new development which is essential in the national interest and which must be carried out in an area where the local authority has only a small pool of existing houses &#x2026;"&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 31st January, 1956; Vol. 548, c. 874.]</q>
If we are faced with the imposition of industry on localities such as happened in my constituency at Rugeley, what assurance is there that there will automatically be more houses provided without further additional cost? If, for instance, a new and very large generating plant is located in the province of a local authority, is not the local authority entitled to suppose that financial provision will be made by the central Government? The Minister will say that, of course, that is within his discretion. We say that it is a responsibility of the Minister of Labour where an additional labour force is to be imposed to inform or advise the Minister of Housing and Local Government that as a result more houses will be necessary.<br/>
Yesterday, my right hon. Friend the Member for Ebbw Vale made use of the picturesque phrase that the Minister was giving himself powers for "capricious decision." Would that I were able to emulate that sort of phrase. My right hon. Friend said in a different way what we on this side of the Committee all feel, that the Minister has to be tied down in some way. It is to me interesting to find that since the Committee stage of this Bill began the local authority of Rugeley, which I mentioned as an illustration when discussing an earlier Amendment, has received a letter from the Department of the Minister requesting the local authority to build 100 new houses for miners which will attract the higher subsidy rate.<br/>
I am not at all clear as to the authority the Minister was using in making such a request to the local authority in anticipation of this Bill. I presume that he was justified in so doing, but it is this sort of request to a local authority which we want to remove from the area of caprice or area of decision entirely on the responsibility of the Minister. Therefore, I speak to this Amendment with a view to making the Minister of Labour provide a certification upon which the Minister of Housing and Local Government must act.<br/>
3.45 p.m.<br/>
It is, apparently, necessary to provide for the provision of houses not only where there is an existing shortage for a specific industry, but where, as a result of industrial economic planning, a shortage will exist. Many of us feel that we cannot leave that matter entirely to the judgment of the Minister. There is the added complication of regional allocations which, we feel, is not flexible enough. The local regional offices of the Ministry should be able to submit a request to the Minister for allocations based on the certification of the Minister of Labour.</p>

<p>I think it might perhaps be helpful to the Committee if, at this stage, I draw attention to the exact purpose of the manner in which paragraph (<i>d</i>) is drawn and the assumptions on which that form of the paragraph rest. It will be seen that it provides the higher

rate of subsidy&#x2014;not without qualification &#x2014;for persons coming from outside the area of the authority building the houses. If there were no qualifications at all the absurd result would follow that every housing authority would be building houses for its neighbours and <i>vice versa.</i></p>

<p>Our attention is, therefore, directed to the four qualifications in line 16 and following. The first is that the subsidy applies only where the persons come from outside in order to meet the urgent needs of industry. The second is that the arrangements for providing the houses must have been approved by the Minister, and the third, which is bound up with it, is that they must have been so approved
<q>as being desirable by reason of special circumstances.</q>
If those last words were not there the Minister's approval would relate merely to the arrangements in accordance with which the dwelling was provided, but in giving his approval he has to consider whether there are special circumstances necessitating the provision. He may only give his approval if he is satisfied that such circumstances exist and that the urgent needs of industry are of a kind which the Minister is satisfied require the provision of houses for persons coming from outside that authority's area and, also, that they so require the housing by reason of special circumstances.<br/>
The conditions are very tightly drawn and the degree of urgency and national character of that need have to be very clearly established in order to comply with the wording of the paragraph. The fourth condition, which is a very natural and reasonable one, is that the Minister lays down conditions of giving his approval which must be complied with to attract the higher rate of subsidy.<br/>
There are two main considerations which the Committee should bear in mind. The first is that every house provided under paragraph (<i>d</i>) will make possible the housing of a family which may be in much less acute housing need than families on the waiting list of the local authority concerned. It might be a little strong to say that this provides for jumping the queue, but at any rate it imports a factor other than housing need according


to which local authorities generally allocate the houses available to them.<br/>
We should, therefore, be very jealous and draw very narrowly the conditions which would justify a situation in which persons coming from outside the area of a local authority are rehoused, although inside that local authority's area there may be many families on the waiting list who are in severe housing need.</p>

<p>This raises a very important point. I understand that not only will there be the additional number of houses required by the influx of population in the area due to special circumstances, but also that there will be a selection of tenants for those houses. Will it be by the Minister? That is what the hon. Member means by his last statement.<br/>
Perhaps I may make it quite clear. There have been occasions when, for example, the Minister of Health found it necessary to influence a local authority to provide houses for key workers in certain areas. I remember having many deputations on the point. It was always an extremely difficult matter, because it meant the jumping of the queue in respect of key workers. Do we now understand that the additional number of houses which will attract the higher rate of subsidy will also be in a different category in respect of the fact that the Minister will influence the actual placing of tenants in them?</p>

<p>These houses are provided for the accommodation of persons coming from outside; that is implicit in the whole provision. How those persons are to be selected, who those individuals are who will go into the houses provided under that formula, are matters which will be part of the arrangements which the Minister approves and may be, if necessary, specified in the conditions which he lays down. At any rate, the Committee can be satisfied that this higher subsidy would not be payable unless those houses were, in fact, providing accommodation for persons coming from outside the area to meet the urgent needs of industry and that the arrangements and conditions were such as to ensure that those qualications were complied with.</p>

<p>This is the first time that we have heard this interpretation. Up to now, we have understood that additional houses would be needed in the area to meet the influx of population&#x2014;that we understand&#x2014;and that schemes have to be made. We are now told that the Minister can, in his view, so interpret these words as to put particular tenants in the houses. That is a very serious matter indeed.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman is harking back to the old days when he was Minister of Health, and there were housing allocations to each individual housing authority. If it was established to his satisfaction that there was an industrial need for more houses in total in a given area, the right hon. Gentleman increased the allocation accordingly and then it remained for the local authority to deal with that higher total of houses which it was allowed to construct.<br/>
Now we are in a different framework. The local authority is building houses to a number determined by itself to meet its general housing needs. Circumstances may arise that the local authority may be also required to provide houses&#x2014;this, of course, is a voluntary arrangement; nobody can compel the local housing authority to do that; there is no power to do so&#x2014;for persons coming from outside the area. In these circumstances so far as the local authority does so provide dwellings for that purpose, and subject to the conditions which are part of the scheme, those houses will attract the higher subsidy.</p>

<p>How does the Minister reconcile that with the illustration I gave in my speech of the local authority which has been requested by his Department to provide 100 more houses for miners, with no specification of incoming miners?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-02-01a.932.4" hansard_membership_id="5594" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30191" speakername="Mr. Powell" colnum="932" time="">
<p>As the hon. Member has only just mentioned the point, naturally I have no information upon it. The point I am making to the Committee is that such an arrangement as this&#x2014;many hon. Members opposite are seeking to extend it&#x2014;inevitably means that the workers coming from outside the area, just because in the national interest they are needed in a new area, will have an


advantage over many families already resident there. It is, therefore, incumbent upon the Committee to see that this facility is not given except where it is really required in the national interest and that the definition and appreciation of the national interest is as narrowly drawn as possible.<br/>
There is, of course, a constant movement of industry between one area and another and a constant movement of labour. If, wherever it were established that labour was moving to meet the needs of industry from one area to another, these preferential subsidy conditions came into effect the result would be that a coach and horses would be driven through the general housing duties of many local housing authorities. Therefore, it is the very essence of an arrangement like this that the national interest shall be conceived for this purpose in the very narrowest and highest terms.<br/>
The other underlying principle is that these cases will normally be those where the local authority, either by reason of its size or by reason of special circumstances, has no large pool of existing houses, so that an influx of this kind and the building of additional houses in its area would represent a very big proportional increase. That would be another factor which must be taken into account in establishing that the necessary special circumstances exist.<br/>
Obviously, there will be many large local authorities with tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of established prewar and post-war houses who will be able to provide, and will, naturally, provide, for the industrial labour flowing into their areas without any special burden resulting. I ask the Committee to observe how narrowly paragraph (<i>d</i>) is drawn and the logical reasons which demand that it should be so narrowly drawn; and, in the interests of the duties of housing authorities generally, not seek to widen it.<br/>
I am now able to reply to the hon. Member for Lichfield and Tamworth (Mr. Snow). The request made to his local authority was to provide additional houses for incoming miners to meet the urgent needs of the mining industry in that area. It is, of course, still a request, but it relates, as the hon. Member will observe, to incoming miners from outside the area.</p>

<p>It is obvious that since last night the Department has been scratching its head about this matter, because now the umbrella is very much smaller than it was stated to be last night when the Minister made a speech on this subject. Indeed, it is not only smaller, but also full of holes today. I propose to make some further inquiries. It is always a delight to listen to the Parliamentary Secretary. He is always so lucid that the weaknesses of his own case become apparent as he proceeds.<br/>
There are several categories of arrangements for meeting the circumstances that can be met by the Clause. There is overspill, there are expanded towns, and new towns. This is a fourth category. We are not yet quite clear how the fourth category arises, but, nevertheless, there is a fourth category. In the other three categories, an additional subsidy and even an increased subsidy can be paid. There is the fourth category, a special incursion of additional labour in circumstances of national need.<br/>
We discussed that definition last night, and we arrived at a number of very interesting conclusions. The first conclusion, which has been at least in part italicised by the Parliamentary Secretary today, is that, of course, that category can be only where a nationalised concern is involved. Otherwise, there is discrimination as between one private interest and another. We have gleaned that much at last from the Government, because that is what the hon. Member has now said. He said this definition must be narrowly conceived. What he meant by narrowly conceived was, obviously, that it must be applied to a matter of overriding national interest; and that, obviously, must be where there is no competing interest elsewhere.</p>

<p>What the hon. Member says is this. The local authority is assumed&#x2014;I want the Committee to consider this assumption for a moment&#x2014;to be building houses to meet general needs, and building up to its capacity. Why is it so assumed? That is what the hon. Member said. It is assumed, having regard to its normal circumstances, to be building to its capacity. I can hear what


the hon. Member is saying to his right hon. Friend. I can hear because of these miserable instruments, the loudspeakers. If he will scan his words in the OFFICIAL REPORT he will see that he said exactly that&#x2014;that the local authority was building up to its capacity, and that its capacity was exceeded because of an additional incursion of labour.<br/>
How does he decide whether the local authority is already building as many houses as it should for its normal general needs? Will he give us the criterion? It is nowhere in the Bill. Obviously, that local authority, in the case we are considering, could be building fewer houses to meet its general need than it should build, and so doing in order to get additional subsidies for the additional houses. The right hon. Gentleman shakes his head. I will try to explain it to him in words of one syllable. Perhaps he can follow it then.<br/>
We have not yet had from the right hon. Gentleman his definition of the obligations of local authorities. He confused himself the other day by saying that the local authority has the duty to build houses. There is not a single Statute in which that is laid down. It has an obligation to review. It has no obligation to build. If the right hon. Gentleman says that it has an obligation to build, then he has an obligation to see that it does build. He really must be a little bit more on the mark than this. Does the right hon. Gentleman state to the Committee that he conceives it his duty, as Minister of Housing and Local Government, to compel a local authority to build for the general needs of the population of its area to an amount he himself considers to be desirable?</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman again questions this duty of local authorities to provide houses. I think that he is merely quibbling. Section 71 of the Housing Act, 1936, says:
<q>It shall be the duty of every local authority to consider the housing conditions in their district and the needs of the district &#x2026;and &#x2026;to prepare and submit to the Minister proposals for the provision of new houses for the working classes &#x2026;</q>
It is really inconceivable that Parliament would have passed an Act laying upon the local authorities the duty to review the needs of their areas and to submit

proposals for the provision of houses if that did not imply that there was a duty upon local authorities to provide those houses.</p>

<p>I hope hon. Members opposite will not cheer too soon, because they are preparing a Procrustean bed for themselves.<br/>
Let us see what those words mean. They do not say the local authority shall "adequately" build. They merely say that it shall review and shall prepare and shall submit proposals to the Minister. They do not, however, impose upon the Minister the obligation to see that the local authorities will meet adequately the needs of their populations. That is the point, for a local authority could put up one house only, and then stop building. Indeed, before the war may local authorities put up none&#x2014;none. Yet these powers were in existence then. Will the Minister tell the Committee that in his view every Conservative Minister of Health before the war neglected his duty?<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman wants to have it both ways. He wants to say that the local authorities have a duty to build. If it is their duty to build then the Minister has the duty to see they perform their duty. Many local authorities, before the war, built no houses for general need. Does he, therefore, say that his predecessors before the war neglected their duty to make the local authorities do their duty? I ask him.</p>

<p>The 1936 Act, amended by the 1946 Act, clearly laid upon the local authorities the duty to provide


houses for those who require council houses in their areas and to submit proposals to the Minister for the provision of those houses. The duty of the Minister is to examine those proposals and either to approve them or not to approve them. It is not, however, the business of the Minister to decide exactly how many houses are needed in each local authority's area, or to build them himself if the local authority do not do so.</p>

<p>Some duties are imposed on local authorities which it is the duty of the Minister to see carried out. There are certain provisions for the public health which have to be made, sanitation, for example, in which case the Minister can set aside the local authority unless the local authority does its duty. Then there is education. There are different duties, of different importance. There are statutory duties imposed upon local authorities which it is the duty of the Minister to see they carry out. There are other duties the local authorities should carry out, but which they can neglect; and the Minister can do nothing about it. So there is a difference between the duties, and two conceptions of them.<br/>
However, the right hon. Gentleman used the word "duty" the other day in the former sense, as though there were an obligation on the local authorities to build houses for general needs; but there is no such obligation. We are, therefore, perfectly clear now that a local authority, in the light of Clause 3 (3,<i>d,</i>) can, in fact, not build any houses at all for general need. But there may be an influx of population into its area. I am asking the right hon. Gentleman to clear up the mind of the Committee on this. If it is building no houses for general needs, will he lay down the number of houses it should build before the additional houses can count for additional subsidy?<br/>
Suppose, to take a theoretical case, an analogous local authority in the same area, with the same kind of population, and the same sort of industry is building 250 houses a year for general needs, but the local authority where the influx takes place is building none. Does the Minister say that it must, first, build up to 250 houses to meet its own general needs before the additional houses will rank for the higher subsidy rate?</p>

<p>It is very difficult to follow the meanderings of the right hon. Gentleman. [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."] We have discussed almost everything except the right hon. Gentleman's Amendment. If the right hon. Gentleman would read the Clause before making his speech, it would be helpful. It is absurd to suggest, as the right hon. Gentleman in his very tortuous argument has suggested, that this provision would enable a local authority to provide for itself the houses it needs at the higher subsidy rate by neglecting to build houses for its own people at the general needs subsidy level, and then to get round the whole provision by drawing a subsidy of &#x00A3;24 for additional houses. That is what the right hon. Gentleman is suggesting.<br/>
If it did that, the additional houses would be exclusively for incoming people from outside. [HON. MEMBERS:"NO."] Of course they would be. The right hon. Gentleman has referred to it and the purpose of his Amendment is related to it. Perhaps he would read his Amendment before making a speech about it. It is wasting the time of the Committee to have to go round and round matters which have no relevance to the Clause or to the Amendment which the right hon. Gentleman has moved.<br/>
It is perfectly clear that the &#x00A3;24 subsidy under subsection (3,<i>d</i> relates only to persons coming from outside the area. It says:
<q>&#x2026; provided by a local authority for the accommodation of persons coming from outside the area of that authority&#x2026;</q>
It is quite ridiculous to suggest that in this roundabout way it would be possible for a local authority to obtain the &#x00A3;24 subsidy for housing its own people by means of neglecting to do so in the first place.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman has used a large number of adjectives. I am quite good at them myself. If he wants a competition in the use of adjectives, I am quite prepared to enter into it. It would be much better if he dealt with the argument. How does he assess


the fact that the local authority has in fact met its own general needs? He says &#x2014;and it is a perfectly proper argument&#x2014;that what we are to do is merely to give the higher subsidy in respect of additional people coming in, the actual bodies themselves, and that the local authority is assumed to be ready to co-operate in an enterprise of that sort&#x2014;it is assumed to be ready for the Minister to put the bodies in the houses on the ground that it would get the additional subsidy.<br/>
The authority itself would, of course, provide no rate subsidy at all, so all that will happen under this proposal is that the Minister thinks that he will be able to meat the additional industrial needs of that population by persuading the local authority&#x2014;he admits that he has no power to make it&#x2014;to put up houses in its area only with the additional national subsidy. Let him try it; he will fail.<br/>
Those houses will be either higher rented or, if the rents have to be kept down, will have to carry a rate subsidy, and no local authority will provide an additional rate subsidy in order to keep down the rent for incomers. In fact the whole provision is eyewash.</p>

<p>I do not want to take up the time of the Committee, but the right

hon. Gentleman is being very misleading in his remarks. At present, the local authorities are undertaking schemes for the building of additional houses in order to accommodate incoming miners and others in their area. They are doing that voluntarily, which means that they are voluntarily making a rate contribution. Is there any reason to suppose that when they are given a subsidy of &#x00A3;24 instead of &#x00A3;22 1s. they will cease to be willing to make the same rate of contribution as they are voluntarily making now?</p>

<p>There is every reason to suppose that they will not. In fact, we are having protests from all over the country. Not only will they not make an additional rate subsidy, but the higher rates of interest now being charged are inhibiting local authorities from providing houses. We have resolutions from local authority associations. There is one from the Association of Municipal Corporations, dated 31st January, referring to what happened in October. It says:
<q>Since that time the Association has received many letters from borough councils of all shades of political opinion expressing anxiety regarding the Government's new housing policy. At their last meeting the housing committee of the Association reviewed the provisions of the Housing Subsidies Bill now before Parliament and placed on record their serious concern at the possible adverse effect which the rising rates of interest on loans raised by local authorities and the intention of the Government to withdraw within a year or two all housing subsidies for general housing, may have upon the ability of housing authorities to carry out their statutory obligations to provide for the housing needs of the people.</q>
In the face of decisions of that kind from all over the country the right hon. Gentleman calmly gets up and says, "There is no reason to suppose that local authorities will not continue to do in the future what they have done in the past." He says that I am guilty of tortuous reasoning, but the right hon. Gentleman is being specifically told that the provisions of his Measure, in addition to the high interest rates, are inhibiting local authorities from meeting the sort of conditions that are set out in Clause 3.<br/>
It is no use the right hon. Gentleman losing his temper with me because he has got himself into trouble, and it is no use his trying to shelter the paucity of his policy behind high falutin' adjectives. If the Committee stage is to proceed as peacefully as it has proceeded up to now,


the right hon. Gentleman will have to restrain his desire to use these adjectives. We have not done badly so far, but I warn him. We made a very unusual arrangement about the Committee stage of the Bill, an arrangement which I have never seen made before. It is that the Opposition has limited itself to a certain time-table. We have kept to it rigidly and honourably, but I am bound to tell the right hon. Gentleman that there are three ways in which the Committee stage of a Measure can be conducted.<br/>
One is by the Government curtailing discussion and imposing a time-table, with all the bitterness and sense of frustration which that creates. One is not to have a time-table, but to rely on the Closure and all-night sittings, which we have striven to avoid. The third is by having a reasonable debate on the Measure in Committee without all the bad temper which arises from all-night sittings. But that implies a readiness on the part of the Government to listen to the argument and to make reasonable concessions. We have not had one yet.</p>

<p>right hon. Gentleman has adopted. Here we are on this side of the Committee representing the point of view of the overwhelming majority of local authorities. We represent, I am quite certain, the overwhelming majority of the people of the country. We are faced with a Bill for which the country was never prepared in the recent Election. The Minister represents a very small minority of the population in this Measure, yet we on this side of the Committee are having no concession of any kind at all. We strove a few days ago to obtain a concession for old people, but we got none.</p>

<p>We shall keep our bargain as far as we can, but the bargain always implied serious consideration of the Bill and the readiness of the right hon. Gentleman to listen to the argument. It always implied, also, that if we could make our case we should have something from him. We have had nothing. Unless the right hon. Gentleman mends his ways, the Bill will not have as smooth a passage from now on as it has had up to now.</p>

<p>I think it will be for the convenience of the Committee if the Amendment to Clause 3, in page 4, line 23, in the name of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Bevan) is discussed with the next six Amendments on the Order Paper.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 4, line 23, to leave out "some other area" and to insert:
<q>outside that area or by some other local authority for the purpose of accommodating persons coming from that area and in either case for the relief of congestion or overpopulation within that area or.</q>
This Amendment relates to subsection (3, <i>e</i>.) So far, we have been discussing the previous paragraphs in that subsection and the one most closely connected with it is paragraph (c). This Amendment proposes that when relieving congestion or over-population in an area by building outside that area, it should be immaterial whether the building is done by the exporting or by the importing authority, because in paragraph (<i>e</i>) the building has to be done by the exporting authority.<br/>
My Amendment is a little wider, but broadly similar to the two following Amendments both in the name of the hon. Gentleman the Member for Dulwich (Mr. Robert Jenkins) and some hon. Friends of mine and some hon. Friends of his. The only difference between this

Amendment and those two Amendments is that the hon. Gentleman would insist that the additional category to be included by these Amendments should be a group of houses, and that there should be an interval of not less than five miles between the place where they are put up and the boundary of the exporting authority. I feel sure that we can rely on the support of the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends because the difference is much too trifling to matter.<br/>
The second and the third of this series of Amendments are somewhat similar. They relate to the same type of point, but they are cases where there is a definite relation of agency between the exporting and the importing authority; that is to say, cases which would be covered by the Amendment which I have moved but, within those cases, only circumstances where the importing authority is doing the work on behalf of the exporting authority. The two other Amendments deal with a rather different type of point, to which I will refer later.<br/>
Apart altogether from any general consideration, it appears that the Government are willing to provide the higher subsidy in any case where a local authority of a congested or over-populated area builds in another area. Then follow a number of qualifying words. If the qualifying words are in either case complied with, and the building goes on not in


the congested or over-populated area but in some other area, always in relief of the congestion or over-population, it makes no difference in principle which is the actual building authority. It may be the exporting authority, it may be the importing authority.<br/>
It has to be done as part of a scheme, it has to be done in relief of congestion or over-population, but it is immaterial which of the two authorities does the building and to carry the matter a stage further, exactly what are the arrangements between the two authorities concerned. In some parts of the country, particularly in Lancashire, we get this kind of case: on the one hand, the congested and over-populated area authority sends its population out and provides houses for it in the receiving area and, on the other hand, the local authority of the receiving area provides houses for exactly the same type of person in exactly the same circumstances. The only difference between the two groups of cases is which authority does the actual building, and in that connection there may be, there probably will be, financial arrangements between the two authorities concerned.<br/>
I suggest to the Minister that he ought to make the task of local authorities in these circumstances as easy as possible. If the right hon. Gentleman refuses this Amendment the houses in this type of case will have to be provided by the exporting authority, with whom the importing authority will probably come to some arrangement. It is bound to, because the houses, as buildings, will remain in the area of the importing authority.<br/>
I fancy that I shall be told that this is the case of the exporting authority, and that if we look at paragraph (c) we shall find the case of the importing authority. Unfortunately, when one comes to a comparison of the two paragraphs, they do not by any means cover the same sort of case. Paragraph (c) is the one that we are not discussing at the moment, and I will only say enough to indicate that it contemplates large-scale development, for the Town Development Act, 1952, is not really concerned with anything else, and the Minister's approval is required. One presumes that that Act, and what is being done under it, is a clear indication of the

Minister's intention about the paragraph. I am merely referring to what is contemplated under it.<br/>
When we come to paragraph (e) we find that something rather different and uncertain and not what is really required is provided by the paragraph as it stands. Apart from the point as to which is the building authority and which of the two in what circumstances should receive the subsidy, there is another point. What we are really trying to deal with in the paragraph is the mischief of congestion or over-population in one of those towns which have not got any room at all on which to build. Anyone who has been through our industrial districts can find examples without any difficulty.<br/>
I will give one instance. I remember going to Salford many years ago. I travelled from Manchester through an area with the picturesque name of Irlam-o'-th'-Heights. I found there no heights but only slums. Salford was grossly congested and over-populated. Even in those days the long-standing difficulty of Salford was that it could not possibly cope with its housing problems within its own area. It had not even enough room to turn round like a little dog which is beginning to lie down. It had no decanting area available within its boundary, and thus it had somehow or other to deal with its problems by building outside.<br/>
Salford is not the only such place. The difficulty which was acute in Salford then has now become the difficulty of the London County Council, which has practically no room in which to turn round and it has to ooze over its borders into all sorts of places. Congested areas of that kind have, in those circumstances, to be dealt with by exporting population, but surely it ought to be left to the local authorities themselves, subject to a degree of Ministerial control, to decide what to do about this kind of thing. An authority may be able to make a number of comparatively small arrangements which would go a long way to meet its difficulties. Unfortunately, such small arrangements do not seem to be covered in the Bill.<br/>
4.45 p.m.<br/>
Again, an authority might wish to make a large-scale arrangement. I agree that if the authority of the congested area is making a large-scale exportation, it may


be that in some cases it will be similar to development for the purposes of a new town. However, the new towns are social experiments on a very considerable scale. The new town of Corby, in my constituency, is to have a population of 40,000. That is one of the smaller new towns. I believe that in some cases the populations reach about 80,000. The new towns always have the character, which was not provided for in the legislation, that some industrial development goes with them, and this is very much larger in some cases than in others. Glenrothes, Cwmbran, Peterlee and Corby are obvious cases of industry closely linked with population. Some new towns are rather more residential, but even in those cases considerable industry is growing up.<br/>
What I have in mind, and the thing for which we ought to provide the highest subsidy, is something on a smaller scale than that, something which is definitely for the relief of congestion or overpopulation, often just over the border of the exporting authority and quite close to it. That is the sort of thing that is happening in Lancashire. I hope the right hon. Gentleman will look at this rather broadly. If we take a large authority like the London County Council&#x2014;I sometimes think that it cannot count less than 10,000 at a time, at any rate when it is dealing with population&#x2014;it will probably bring itself within this sort of Clause, although I am not certain because of the industrial point, but smaller authorities, of which Salford is an example, may have exactly the same sort of difficulties and may even be worse off, but will never be brought within these provisions. When Salford pushes some of its population perhaps just over its borders or ten or twenty miles away, who will say whether Salford is causing development of a new town character? It is much too narrow to limit it in that way.<br/>
I may be met with the answer that one has to be very careful about this or one will be postponing the general needs of the receiving district in the interests of the needs of the incoming population. I do not believe that is a really serious difficulty. I should have thought that the point was who had to pay for it in the long run, and one can reasonably expect the exporting authority to have some contribution

to make in return for the relief of its difficulties.<br/>
Be that as it may, I would remind the Committee that, in substance, the Bill is not giving large additional subsidies. I am well aware that there is a small increase in some cases. Broadly speaking, the main object and effect of the Bill is to cut the general need subsidies, and what the Opposition are doing is trying to salve something from the wreck. From that point of view, I should have thought that there was every case for giving special facilities for this kind of thing, because a large town may be able to make these arrangements but a small town will not be able to do so. The suburban growth of outer London, as distinct from inner London, has no doubt been carried too far. We are wise to have new towns and a Green Belt.<br/>
Altogether to deny development of that character to some of the congested and over-populated areas in the industrial districts of the North and in other parts of the country seems to be the sort of injustice that one commits by giving way to the powerful and making hay of the weak. Even if that is a slightly exaggerated form of putting it, I am sure that I am right in saying that they ought to have encouragement in these matters.<br/>
I will refer very briefly to the two Amendments which I did not mention. They are, in page 4, line 23, to leave out from the second "area" to "or" in line 27; and in line 24, to leave out from "development" to "or" in line 27. The object of the first is to leave out these qualifications at the end of the paragraph. The other makes a smaller alteration. They are really ways of giving effect to the sort of point which I have just been putting to the Minister. I need not say more about them except that the language of the Clause seems to be an instance where the Minister is giving himself rather wide discretion; or else he will find that his intentions are, in fact, more cramped than he supposes from the language of the Bill.<br/>
I urge him to reconsider the whole of the paragraphs, I hope to accept the first, or, failing that, the two parallel Amendments on the first point, and also carefully to consider whether the general words at the end are required and whether the matter could not be more simply expressed.</p>

<p>I desire to speak about my two Amendments which are being considered with the one which has been moved by the hon. and learned Member for Kettering (Mr. Mitchison). They are closely interdependent and one is consequential upon the other. To some extent I want to follow and support the arguments of the hon. and learned Member for Kettering. The whole of subsection (3, e) deals with overspill. The Minister in effect has said that he is prepared to pay an additional subsidy for a dwelling if it is
<q>provided by the local authority of a congested or over-populated area in some other area as part of a scheme of comprehensive development the general character of which is in the opinion of the Minister similar to development for the purposes of a new town under the New Towns Act, 1946. &#x2026;</q>
In other words, if a local authority exports a large number of its people to a new town or creates a new town, an additional subsidy is possible.<br/>
However, it is not clear how the Minister will judge whether an exporting authority building a certain number of houses, building up a certain community outside its own boundaries, is doing so for the purposes of a new town under the New Towns Act, 1946. We wish to see added to that paragraph the Amendment, in page 4, line 27, after"1946"to insert:
<q>or</q>
<q>(ii) as one of a group of houses erected by the said local authority at a distance of not less than five miles from the boundary of their area for the relief of congestion or over-population within their area.</q>
It is not suggested that the Minister should make a contribution to a local authority which merely just spills over its own boundaries into a neighbouring local authority. It is not the idea that the Minister should give an extra subsidy if houses are built exactly on the perimeter of the local authority, but only if

there is a distance of five miles between the new estate and the perimeter of the local authority which is exporting its population.<br/>
I shall be brief, but I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister will have regard to this point. These two Amendments are completely non-party. They have been suggested by the Association of Municipal Corporations, which has given a considerable amount of thought to the effect of the Bill. Notwithstanding what the right hon. Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Bevan) said this afternoon about the Association passing resolutions condemning the Bill, it is doing its very best, with the advice it can give, to make the Bill more workable and, incidentally, more fair.<br/>
The paragraph deals with only part of the problem. For instance, one of the preceding paragraphs deals with the question of industry. Some district estates are associated with industry, but a large number of local housing authorities, as has been said by the hon. and learned Member for Kettering, have to overspill because of their lack of building land. Some are too small and their financial resources are too small for them to set up some large development which would come within the New Towns Act, 1946. They will want to build, say, between 200 and 2,000 houses.<br/>
I cannot believe that, as the paragraph stands and unless there were some close association between what was built, say 2,000 houses, and a real development corporation&#x2014;and unless that local authority in addition to building houses built schools, halls and the other things that go to make up a new town&#x2014;the Minister could possibly bring himself to say that such houses would qualify for a subsidy. It is for that reason that the Amendment is put forward.<br/>
If a small local authority has to overspill, but not to the extent of a new town, it cannot get the additional subsidy, although in proportion to its financial resources it may be doing just as much as a large town like London to deal with overspill.</p>

<p>I agree with so much of what the hon. Member for Dulwich (Mr. Robert Jenkins) says that I should like to get this point clear. The two Amendments with which he is particularly dealing would not quite cover that


point, but it would be covered by the Amendment in page 4, line 23, to leave out from the second "area" to "or" in line 27, and the Amendment in line 24, to leave out from "development" to "or" in line 27, which leave out the restrictive words relating to new towns. I see the hon. Member nodding agreement, and I take it that he is supporting those two Amendments.</p>

<p>There is just one other point I wish to make. If we visualise a situation on which an exporting authority buys land five miles from its own borders and puts up, say, 300 houses, it does not, under the Bill as at present drafted get the subsidy. The importing authority not only gets the value of having an increased population but it also takes the rateable value and any subsidy that would be payable to the exporting authority. In other words, the exporting authority loses the subsidy and its population.<br/>
In many cases there is every reason to suppose&#x2014;I am advised that it is so&#x2014;that if that took place on a reasonably large scale, the authority would in fact lose the Exchequer equalisation grant because of the number of persons going out of its area into the adjoining area. That is the position, I am advised.<br/>
The better a local authority does its job from the point of view of housing, the more it is likely to be penalised, and I would urge my right hon. Friend to do something about this matter. I know that he is keen on getting the maximum number of houses built and upon getting slums cleared but this provision is not effecting that. I am trying to make the point that the more keen a small local authority is on getting rid of over-population and overspill, the more restrictive is the effect of this Clause; and a local authority would hesitate to act in that way because it would receive no subsidy if it did. I ask the Minister to give the same consideration in this matter to the small local authorities as to the large authorities who are in fact setting up new towns. I ask him to consider the wording of the Amendments in the name of my hon. Friends and myself.</p>

<p>There has been so much agreement that I sincerely hope that the Minister will continue it, and that for the first time we

shall receive a concession from him. I wish to put the case for the borough which I represent, and I do not apologise for doing so, because I think the argument is applicable in a number of other cases. In my borough we have no building sites left at all. It is a case of overspill or nothing.<br/>
We have 6,000 applicants on our live register and 600 people living in prefabs on land which must be given up, on Wanstead Flats, etc. We estimate that, arising from the change so far as requisitioned property is concerned, there will be another 300 families. What we find ourselves up against time and again is that other authorities do not want to make arrangements with us: they resist us by every legal means possible. Therefore the chances of boroughs such as mine making arrangements with importing authorities are very remote. It comes down to the fact that our people may go out&#x2014;and we find this in the case of the new towns&#x2014;but because of the pressure of rents, which is wrapped up in this problem, they begin to come back again in no small numbers.<br/>
The argument has been advanced by the Minister, particularly during the debate on Second Reading, that there is a reservoir of pre-war houses at low rents which will equate and bring down the new rents which must be charged if there is no subsidy at all. But that does not always apply. There are a number of boroughs and districts in the same position as my own authority, but let me take the case of my own authority. We find that our pre-war housing comprises only 7&#x00B7;8 per thousand as against the figure for the county boroughs of 356. It is perfectly obvious that even with the existing increase in charges and the interest rates and so on, we shall, if we go on building, have to charge very heavy rents indeed.<br/>
When the people of East London, particularly in my borough, have moved out to some existing housing scheme perhaps fifteen to twenty miles away, inevitably they come back to work, and the position of those people will be quite unthinkable. They are bound to face a very heavy bill each week for fares. I do not want to be unduly controversial but I noticed that the hon. Member for Dulwich (Mr. Robert Jenkins) said that it was the intention of the Minister to build more houses&#x2014;that is the only point


on which I differ with the hon. Gentleman&#x2014;but I appeal to the Minister to realise that here is a big chance, if he proposes to behave in a reasonable way and to give a concession, for him to make a concession on this issue, which affects the lives of so many people in my constituency.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-02-01a.955.0" hansard_membership_id="6988" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29303" speakername="Mr. Eric Johnson" colnum="955" time="">
<p>I wish to invite my right hon. Friend to look at the very special case of Manchester and to see how we are affected. Under the terms of this paragraph Manchester would be entitled to the higher rate of subsidy for dwellings built outside its area as part of a development of new town proportions. Manchester has been prevented by Ministerial decision from undertaking the development of new towns on particular sites at Mobberley and Lymm and has been compelled to look round to find all sorts of odd sites all over the place in order to house the people whom we would much rather have in a new town. The city is already building 4,777 houses in different places outside its borders and is negotiating for the building of another 14,000. It appears to me that Manchester will be severely handicapped by the terms of this paragraph because Ministerial decisions have prevented the building of new towns.<br/>
It is true that Manchester receives a subsidy of &#x00A3;22 10s. for houses built outside its area to replace slum houses, but only &#x00A3;10 for the other houses. On the other hand, local authorities in receiving areas get &#x00A3;24 irrespective of the houses they build. That seems rather unfair. I am sure my right hon. Friend will appreciate that it is impossible to allocate every house built outside the city for people who have been living in slums. We have to meet the needs of many other people. For example, in Manchester there are 13,000 families living in lodgings who have been put on the housing lists. As the Bill stands at present, local authorities outside will get &#x00A3;24 whereas Manchester will get only &#x00A3;10 for housing of a similar kind.<br/>
I ask my right hon. Friend to recognise the very special position of Manchester which seems to me to be rather more difficult than that of most local authorities. I hope that he will be able to produce a new paragraph, or include some

form of words giving him power in suitable cases to approve the granting of the higher subsidy where a local authority has to build outside its area and the operation does not come within the scope of new town development. Alternatively, my right hon. Friend would help Manchester by giving approval for some sites for new towns.</p>

<p>For many days the Minister and his hon. Friends on the Government Front Bench have been resisting the arguments put forward from this side of the Committee, but it may be that, as a result of the interventions of two of his hon. Friends in the persons of the hon. Member for Dulwich (Mr. Robert Jenkins) and the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley (Mr. E. Johnson), we might make a little more progress than we have been making during the past few days. At all events, we say to those two hon. Gentlemen that we hope to give them the opportunity to carry their arguments to their logical conclusion. We hope that, if necessary, when the time comes they will accompany us for once in a while to the Division Lobby where they will be in really good company.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Widnes (Mr. MacColl) opened the door for me in the debate on this group of Amendments. I was delighted to find that my constituency of Salford had been graced in the past by his presence. I am quite sure that Salford must have benefited by that in days gone by. He talked of Salford in the past, and perhaps I might be permitted to say something else about my own constituency, as has been done so often by other hon. Members in the course of these debates.<br/>
We in Salford pride ourselves, justifiably I think, that in our scheme for overspill with a neighbouring body at Worsley in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Farnworth (Mr. Thornton) we were the inspiration of the 1952 Town Development Act. As a result of that experiment between Salford and Worsley we really set something going, and by that Act many other authorities have been enabled to get down to the question of overspill. I would say in passing that when we entered into that scheme with a neighbouring authority we were not thinking only in terms of slum clearance, but of blitz sufferers, overcrowding, new


families, prefabricated houses which were decaying and, ultimately, of derequisitioned houses. In fact, we were thinking of the whole gamut of housing needs, and that is why we entered into that plan with our neighbouring authorities.<br/>
I suggest to the Minister that if he allows the Clause to remain as at present drafted he will wreck these magnificent schemes. We are greatly indebted to the smaller neighbouring authority of Worsley for all it has done. So far, 1,200 houses have been built in that area for Salford people, and the ultimate scheme was to have been for 4,500 houses.<br/>
Will the Minister tell us where he draws the line between that kind of development and a new town? The provision of 4,500 houses could mean the housing of 15,000 or 16,000 people. Many of the new towns are working on a basis of about 30,000 or 40,000 people. Is the Minister definitely saying that he is prepared to draw a line between 16,000 and perhaps 30,000, and that the smaller population does not come within the meaning of a new town whereas the larger of the two populations does?<br/>
I suggest to the right hon. Gentleman that that is not the conurbation of Greater London or of South-East Lancashire. He knows those districts well, and we all know that one cannot move from one authority to another unless one knows it very well. Why should the Minister fix the line in the way that he is doing, thus preventing people from obtaining houses which they would otherwise get?<br/>
Although I refer to the scheme which is now in operation, the first of these two Amendments would also bring in other ideas which we have. We in Salford are at the moment in negotiation with the Tyldesley Urban District Council. In that case, it would not be a question of the importing authority building houses for the exporting authority. Salford would be purchasing land in Tyldesley on which to build houses for Salford residents.<br/>
5.15 p.m.<br/>
The aim of this Amendment is to cover both systems, and, by so doing, to provide houses for the people. I wish to hold out to the Minister a qute new incentive and one that might even tempt him. The more overspill cases in my constituency of Salford, West, the more

the votes cast for me at a General Election diminish. The vast majority of the people who have the advantage of overspill are the people who vote for me at elections. They are going to places where there is either an overwhelming Labour or Tory majority and where their presence will not make the slightest difference. But it will make an awful difference to me. I have been in the House of Commons for nearly 11 years, but it is much more important that the people living in miserable conditions in Salford should be properly housed than that I should continue to be a Member of the House.</p>

<p>I rise to preserve the theme of harmony that we have had at least for the last half hour or so. I hope that my right hon. Friend the Minister will be impressed by the fact that there is obviously a quite genuine depth of feeling on both sides of the Committee that a little more needs to be done in this connection than is being done in the Bill as at present drafted.<br/>
I am not certain that I would follow the hon. Member for Salford, West (Mr. Royle) all the way to the end of his remarks, because I think that it would be a great pity if it were to be thought that populations could be moved about in relation to voting strength. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman's suggestion was a frivolous one, but it is one which outside the House is sometimes more seriously thought about than it ought to be. People sometimes think that things are done in that sort of way.<br/>
I want to speak particularly about the borough which I represent and of which by accident at this moment in time I happen to be the only representative in this Committee. The Borough of Walthamstow is, of course, very seriously concerned with this problem, and, not being able to tackle it alone, it has made arrangements with eight or, it may be, nine other boroughs in its part of the world in an endeavour to overcome these difficulties.<br/>
After negotiation, the boroughs managed to acquire certain land in rural Essex. They were encouraged by the Minister to acquire that land. It was not acquired without a great deal of opposition, but the boroughs banded together and after many vicissitudes they seemed to be within sight of a large overspill


scheme which would help them all. Unless something is done to save it that scheme cannot continue, and the very valuable co-operation which has been built up between these nine boroughs in tackling their housing problem will prove fruitless. There will be no point in continuing it.<br/>
I appreciate that the Minister would naturally prefer to see new town schemes, as such, but these things are not always possible; indeed, they take a long time to prepare&#x2014;and in this part of London, at the moment, the need is much more urgent. This is the only reasonably quick way in which the housing needs of these nine boroughs of which I have first-hand experience&#x2014;and there are presumably many others in a similar situation in other parts of the country&#x2014;can be met. If the Minister can make some additional concession here in the light of what is quite clearly the feeling of both sides of the Committee, he will be doing a great deal for his own reputation and, which is much more important, he will be doing a great deal for the many thousands who, despite all the progress that has been made in housing, are still in need of homes of their own.</p>

<p>My name is associated with two of the Amendments which we are now discussing. It appears under the name of the hon. Member for Dulwich (Mr. Robert Jenkins) in relation to the Amendment which proposes that the higher subsidy shall be paid in the case of houses which are built within five miles of a congested area, in order to relieve it, and also in the list of names supporting the Amendment of my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr. Mitchison), which is of a broader character. In view of the unusual harmony which has existed in the Committee this afternoon I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will accept the broader Amendment, but, even if he is unable to do that, I hope that he will have no hesitation at all in accepting the less demanding Amendment in the name of the hon. Member for Dulwich.<br/>
Like previous speakers, I propose to illustrate the case for the Amendment by speaking of my own constituency. Experiences have been recited to us in connection with towns like Manchester and Salford&#x2014;with which I am familiar&#x2014;and

smaller towns in the Lancashire area. I want to deal not only with the problem of Slough but of the neighbouring area of Eton. The two areas are complementary. I speak of them with some confidence because the Minister has a knowledge and experience of them. When I speak of Slough I am thinking not only of that town; I know that it is typical of many towns which have developed rapidly in recent years. Luton is another example.<br/>
Until recently these towns have been what are termed "importing areas." I very much dislike terms such as "importing" and "exporting." They make it seem as though we are dealing with raw materials and goods rather than human beings. We must always remember that we are dealing here with a problem which may mean human happiness or human suffering. Slough has been an importing town because to it have come populations from all over the British Islands, attracted by its trading estate. They have come especially from the depressed areas of South Wales, Lancashire, Scotland, the north-east coast and Belfast. In thirty years the town's population has grown from a mere 17,000 to nearly 70,000. Not satisfied with that, it is now taking in an overspill population of 70,000 from London.<br/>
Until now it has been described as an importing area, but a change is taking place. The whole area is becoming built-up, owing to the rapid increase of the town, but because we had no drainage we could not build for a long time, and 40 per cent. of the public housing in the town is now under construction or under contract. That has been done so thoroughly that there is now no land upon which houses can be built. In consequence, Slough has changed from an importing to an exporting authority. The effect of this has been serious for many of those people who are employed in Slough. We did have a rule that, even if someone did not live in our borough, if he had worked in it for four years he could be placed on our housing waiting list&#x2014;but because we have no land upon which we can build we have had to exclude most of those who would have had the benefit of that qualification in the past. Workers are travelling long distances to Slough. Only last week I received a letter from a worker who travels each day from East Ham to Slough


and back. Many people travel twenty or thirty miles, although the majority live in the neighbouring authorities of the Eton Rural District Council and the Eton Urban District Council.<br/>
I emphasise the fact that it is not only a matter of there being a need to provide houses for these people; there is a new, growing, industrial centre, essential to the export industry, in which workers can be employed but where they cannot have houses. This is an enormously important matter from the point of view of industry as well as of mere housing accommodation. In that situation the need is to be able to build estates near Slough&#x2014;or, in the case of Luton, near Luton&#x2014;which would not be new towns but comparatively small estates.<br/>
I am pleading that the higher subsidy under the Bill should be made available for those estates. I have proposed, locally, that a conference should be held between representatives of the Slough Borough Council, the Eton Rural District Council, and the Eton Urban District Council, and that they should together work out this problem&#x2014;because it affects Eton as well as Slough. Many of the workers employed in Slough are living in one or other of the Eton local authority areas.<br/>
5.30 p.m.<br/>
Such a conference would be able to consider three alternative schemes for a solution of this problem. It could consider building by the congested town in the area of another local authority. We have already had one instance of that in the estate which has been built at Wexham, which is in the Eton rural area, and for which the Slough Borough Council is responsible. Secondly, the estate could be built by another authority taking full responsibility for it. Thirdly, it could be built by another authority on behalf of the congested area.<br/>
As the right hon. Gentleman is piloting a Bill to deal not only with slum areas but specifically with overspill, the terms of it should be sufficiently wide to cover all three alternatives which I have just put before him. The Clause might permit a higher subsidy in the case of a congested town which built in another area. It might, though not necessarily always, cover the estate built by another authority taking the full responsibility. It would

not necessarily cover an estate built by another authority on behalf of a congested area.<br/>
I ask the Minister to accept the Amendments, which will enable the Bill really to fulfil one or two limited purposes in dealing with the overspill problem. I hope that the fact, which is very unusual, that speaker after speaker from both sides has made the same plea to the Minister, will induce him to make a concession in regard to the Amendments.</p>

<p>We have had a most encouraging display of unanimity from both sides of the Committee about the inadequate provisions in the Bill to meet the problem of overcrowded areas which want to get rid of their slums but have nowhere to put the occupants of them.<br/>
I share the distaste expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Eton and Slough (Mr. Fenner Brockway) at the way in which jargon has descended upon these matters. Words and phrases like "overspill," and "exporting and importing authorities" create an atmosphere of expert detachment, whereas we should really be concerned with the hideous conditions of living of ordinary families which the representations from this side of the Committee, and I am bound to say from the Government side too, are designed to ameliorate.<br/>
I hope that the Minister will reconsider the provisions of the Bill for the payment of subsidy to exporting authorities. As the Bill stands, subsidies are provided quite inadequately in the limited class of case under subsection (3, (<i>e</i>). Too little consideration has been given to this basic difficulty of new town development. Many councils have been unable to persuade any other authority to participate, and that has been the experience in West Ham. A number of approaches for marriage have been made by the borough to various authorities, but I am sorry to say that all the advances were rejected. Now, like the last rose of summer, West Ham has been left "blooming alone."</p>

<p>West Ham has tried to deal with the problem itself and has been forced to embark upon a programme


of acquiring land at Stanford-le-Hope for the purpose of erecting there an out-borough estate. It is proposed to build 1,500 houses within the terms of paragraph (e) as
<q>the local authority of a congested or over-populated area.</q>
There is a substantial case for saying that this is "part of a scheme of comprehensive development" within the meaning of the paragraph.<br/>
I would ask the Minister whether it is the view of his Ministry that because this scheme is limited in size and nature to a housing estate it is not eligible for subsidy within paragraph (e)? I fear that his answer may be that it is not eligible but I should be most grateful to be told. This is a matter of considerable importance, and I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will answer this specific question during the debate.<br/>
If the answer is that the plan for the erection of these 1,500 houses is to rank only for the &#x00A3;10 subsidy, the cost to the West Ham Council, over and above that which was contemplated when the scheme was first considered, and indeed approved by the Ministry, will be as much as &#x00A3;51,000. The increase of rents to compensate for the loss of subsidies will be about 4s. 7d. a week. The effect would be to put this new and vital housing development out of the reach of a great many people in my constituency who desperately need housing accommodation.<br/>
An additional trouble, certainly in the initial stages, would be that this development would not be connected with industrial development in the immediate neighbourhood. There would be the additional burden for the tenants of fares for travelling, at a time when fares are notoriously on the increase. The hard facts of pounds, shillings and pence would put this housing out of the reach of families who most desperately need to be rehoused.<br/>
The history of this matter is a little astonishing and justifies the authorities in complaining about Departmental vicissitudes and apparently unreasonable changes of policy by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government. The Minister confirmed the compulsory purchase order for the land at Stanford-le-Hope, and approved the application by West Ham Council for this development

in preference to applications by the London County Council and by Thurrock Council. By that act of approval the present Minister's predecessor recognised that the development at Stanford-le-Hope was a proper contribution to a solution of West Ham's housing needs and of London's overspill.<br/>
I emphasise the position in my constituency because it makes such a clear case. The provision of estates like that which is proposed by West Ham is linked directly with the task of slum clearance. If West Ham's slum clearance programme is to be carried out it is essential that means should be made available to the council for out-borough development of this kind. Without such development our slum clearance programme cannot go further.<br/>
I submit, therefore, that if the present Minister is sincere about this alleged campaign&#x2014;"crusade"is, I think, the honourable word used in connection with slum clearance&#x2014;and unless he is quite cynical about it, better provision for proper and adequate subsidies for these out-borough estates is quite essential.<br/>
The Minister has conceded the point that I now seek to make in relation to West Ham in the terms of a letter from his predecessor to the London County Council rejecting the county council's application for planning permission for this scheme, but accepting and approving West Ham's application. I submit that what was said in that letter is quite contrary to the present provisions of the Bill. The Minister said:
<q>West Ham had a large waiting list and the possibilities of rehousing in their once densely-developed borough were limited to vacant war-damaged sites which are rapidly being used up. The council must deal with their considerable problem of slum clearance in the near future but could not do so unless they had land outside the borough on which to house the people displaced. They would need this land within the next two or three years&#x2014;</q>
This was the Minister writing, not a representative of the constituency in this House. The Minister went on to say:
<q>While he does not underestimate the size of the London County Council's housing problems he is impressed by the immediacy of need of the West Ham County Borough Council for housing land which will enable them to make an effective attack on their problem of slum clearance. In the light of this and the considerations set out above the Minister thinks it right to permit the &#x2026; development proposed by the West Ham Council.</q></p>

<p>I am much obliged to my right hon. Friend the Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Bevan) for his intervention. What I am saying is that this out-borough development is essentially linked with the provision of accommodation for those living in blitzed areas which are being cleared and also in areas of

slum clearance. Unfortunately, in my constituency, they are all mingled together. The flying bomb was no discriminator in these matters. I do ask for a quite clear ruling on this point before the debate goes very much further. I gather that the Parliamentary Secretary is encouraging me to think that all is well&#x2014;that the Stanford-le-Hope estate of 1,500 houses will carry the full subsidy. Is that so or is it not?

<p>The hon. and learned Member was talking a lot about West Ham's difficulty in getting on with its programme of slum clearance, and quoted a letter from my right hon. Friend's predecessor.

<p>The hon. Gentleman really cannot ride off on that. He has put the theoretical position to the Committee.<br/>
May I repeat my question? Will that apply in the specific case of Stanford-le-Hope, where authority has been given by the Minister for the building of 1,500 houses? He has drawn my attention to certain provisions of the Bill, but will that estate carry a full subsidy? I am sorry that the Parliamentary Secretary has not answered that question. The Committee will have taken note of his undertaking, but I ask the question for the third time. The hon. Gentleman can, through the usual channels, get in touch with those who may be informed of the particular matter, his Parliamentary Private Secretary being apparently a little more alert at the moment than appeared to be the case at certain stages of yesterday's debate. Before the debate has long continued may we have a specific answer to my question, because it is not a question relating only to my limited constituency interest but is of widespread significance, and I think that the Committee is entitled to a reply.</p>

<p>I refer the hon. and learned Gentleman to the provisions of Clause 3 (3,<i>a</i>), together with the interpretation Clause, Clause 11. It will depend on whether or not the houses in this or any other scheme fall within the limits of that definition. The hon. and learned


Member was talking as though the absence of the higher subsidy would impede the progress of slum clearance, and I was pointing out that where slum clearance is concerned the higher rate of subsidy is payable.</p>

<p>I do not think that we can leave it at that. We had a very protracted discussion about this matter yesterday. What we want to know is this. If houses which are not slum houses are removed in connection with a slum clearance scheme do the houses that are substituted for the houses which are not slum houses carry the higher rate of subsidy? Clause 3 (3, a) says:
<q>provided by a local authority for the purposes of slum clearance or re-development.</q>
Our point yesterday was this. There may be a number of houses which may not be slums but are taken down by a local authority in the course of redevelopment, and we wanted those houses also to qualify for the higher rate of subsidy. We were told quite clearly that the only houses which would rank for the higher rates would be those that were substituted for slums. It does not matter where they are put provided they are in substitution of slum dwellings pulled down. That is how I understand it.</p>

whether, in that kind of provision in connection with a slum clearance programme, a borough development of the kind to which I have referred will attract the higher subsidy. It is quite a clear question, and we are entitled to an answer.</p>

<p>There is obviously a real difficulty here both in the matter of interpretation and of the Minister's intention. I have already, at an earlier stage in the consideration of the Bill, made my point concerning borough council of the constituency which I represent. It finds itself in great difficulty, and I should like to associate myself with the remarks of the hon. and learned Member for West Ham, South (Mr. Elwyn Jones) and my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow, East (Mr. J. Harvey). We are all associated, in these boroughs, in this joint venture whereby our local authorities have acquired property outside our boroughs in Essex, and a great deal of thought and imagination has been put into it.<br/>
One cannot represent a constituency in that part of outer London for very long without becoming aware that the need for houses is still the greatest social need in this country. [An HON. MEMBER: "Tell that to the Minister."] I think that my right hon. Friend and his predecessor have shown by their actions that they are more than well aware of that fact. Hundreds of thousands of people who have been rehoused by the efforts of my right hon. Friend and his predecessor have every reason to know that that is so.<br/>
However, there is still a considerable amount to be done and I find myself in a difficulty. People come to see me about their housing problems, and, although it is not my responsibility, I arrange for them to be interviewed by the chairman of the housing committee.</p>

<p>In that case, Sir Rhys, I shall quickly remove myself from that ground.<br/>
I am pointing to the difficulties of boroughs in relation to the Amendment now under consideration, because they are


trying to provide houses for people on their housing lists which they can never provide in their boroughs because they have not got the ground on which to build. To get over that difficulty some boroughs in Essex, of which my constituency is a part of one, have bought land outside the borough boundaries. They are now in a position of having undertaken to build houses which they would not have undertaken to build if they had thought that they would not attract the full subsidy, and now they find that they are not. As a result, they will have to charge higher rents than they intended in the first place. Their tenants will find that not only will they have to pay higher rents, but they will be faced with a higher cost of living because they will have to travel further to their work.<br/>
It would be very helpful if the Minister could clarify this position about his intentions in regard to redevelopment as opposed to slum clearance. In addition, I should like to know whether the Minister will now say that houses built in new development areas as part of any redevelopment plan will attract higher subsidies, even though he did not in the first place intend that to be so. In my constituency, at any rate, it will cause great embarrassment and confusion in the plans which have been made by the local authority if the higher subsidy is not paid.</p>

<p>The argument is now becoming rather wide, and we on these benches wanted an answer from the right hon. Gentleman on the question of overspill. I think we should meet the other point later.

<p>There is a point which has not yet been put and to which my Amendment is addressed. I should like to associate myself with all the other Members for Metropolitan Essex who are pressing the Government on this matter, but there is a distinction between some of the Metropolitan Essex constituencies and others. West Ham and East Ham are long developed areas, and there are many slum areas there which need clearing. But there are other areas, like my own constituency of Dagenham, which resemble the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Eton and Slough

(Mr. Brockway), where there are practically no slums but where, between the wars and since, the area has been built up. A large number of people have entered and we are nearly full now, with the result that the local authority has to try to find estates outside its boundaries in order to house people on its housing list.<br/>
We have 4,000 people on our housing list; there is no room to build for more than a very small number, and those houses are, in fact, being built. When they have been built, the area will be full. That is true of a large number of boroughs in Metropolitan Essex. It is true of Ilford, Barking, Walthamstow, Leyton and Romford, and it will soon be true of Hornchurch and Thurrock. Very few of those areas have slums to be cleared, but all of them have this problem of housing their surplus population.<br/>
I fully agree with the point made by the hon. Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Iremonger). If we have to put an estate a long way outside the boundaries and that estate has no special subsidy, there will be heavy expenses for people travelling to and from their work, in addition to the high rents, which will make it impossible for people who want those houses to take them.<br/>
Let me take the case of Dagenham. We have bought, with the authority of the Minister, a small estate in Canvey Island. There is no industry in Canvey Island. The people who will be rehoused there will have to travel to the new town of Basildon or to Dagenham to their jobs. They will have to pay heavy fares on top of high rents.<br/>
Also, we have gone into association with other boroughs, including Walthamstow, to build one big estate and take a certain number of houses each, in order to have some comprehensive development. No doubt, many comprehensive development schemes of that kind can be arranged. But will they rank for a special grant under the Bill? Can the Minister make that clear?<br/>
Under this Bill, the Government discriminates against the small local authority which wants to develop an estate somewhere else, which wants to start not a slum clearance scheme but a scheme to provide for an overflow of its surplus population. No doubt, a large town can go ahead and


have such a scheme; it would, no doubt, be possible for the Minister to approve of Manchester doing this sort of thing, but I do not see how a small town will be able to undertake a development scheme outside its boundaries.<br/>
I therefore hope that the Minister will deal not only with the question of slum clearance, but also with the important problem of the great many boroughs which need to have overspill for which there appears to be no arrangement in the Bill.</p>

<p>The group of Amendments which the Committee is considering together covers two points. One is a minor point with which I want to deal briefly at the outset and the other is the major issue on which the greater part of the debate has centred.<br/>
The minor point is that some of these Amendments would enable paragraph (<i>e</i>) to cover comprehensive development similar to development for the purposes of a new town, if it were undertaken not only by the exporting authority but by the importing authority or by some third authority. It is very difficult to conceive a case in which the importing authority, which is normally a rural district but at any rate anything but a great town or city, would be in a position to undertake development of a kind which could be on a par with the development of a new town by a development corporation. Nor is it likely, and it is very doubtful whether it is desirable, that such a service should be performed on a brokerage basis by yet a third authority which would build in an area not its own to meet the needs of an area not its own.<br/>
This sort of development will occur where a great town, with great resources and great housing and development experience, undertakes the enterprise of establishing what is comparable to a new town, and it is not readily to be conceived that that could occur otherwise than where the developing authority was the exporting authority.<br/>
The main effect which most of these Amendments have, and the main concern of hon. Members who have spoken in the debate has been to widen the application of paragraph (<i>e</i>) to include any out-boundary development.</p>

<p>The effect would be to widen it to include all development, all provision of houses, undertaken by a housing authority outside its own boundaries; or, in the case of the Amendment in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Dulwich (Mr. Robert Jenkins) and others, provided it were at a distance of five miles.<br/>
It is important that the Committee should clearly recognise what is the essential difference between new town development and development which can be regarded as comparable to it, on the one hand, and the building of estates outside a borough or town development, on the other hand. The definition of town development which, where it is carried out by the receiving authority, as the Committee will remember, attracts the higher subsidy under paragraph (<i>c</i>), is in Section 1 of the 1952 Act; and it is development
<q>undertaken primarily for the purpose of providing accommodation for residential purposes";</q>
and then follow the descriptive words,
<q>(with or without accommodation for the carrying on of industrial or other activities, and with all appropriate public services, facilities for public worship, recreation and amenity, and other requirements).</q>
One therefore has four grades of out-county development. There is the simple estate, with a minimum of non-housing development included in it; there is town development with the appropriate public services, etc., in the words which I quoted, but without industrial concomitant; there is town development in the fuller sense, where there is an industrial factor; and, finally, there is the true new town which is conceived literally as a new town and laid out on the full scale, planned to the full development envisaged, with the whole range of facilities for employment and for leisure which are found in a normal fully developed town.<br/>
What is being asked here is that we should apply the higher rate of subsidy payable to an exporting authority not to the last category only but to all cases of housing provision outside the authority's boundary. But the Committee has already decided&#x2014;and we had a full discussion on this aspect of the matter yesterday&#x2014;that where the building falls


under the heading of town development, the higher subsidy should be payable only where it is undertaken by the receiving authority; and, therefore, all the more that where it is mere estate development it should attract the higher subsidy only where the housing is provided by the receiving authority.<br/>
May I remind the Committee of the underlying reason for which that is so, and within the scope and principle of the Bill must be so. At the risk of wearying the Committee, I would again repeat that the underlying presumption of the Bill is that the great majority of local housing authorities will be able to continue to build as far as necessary to meet their general housing needs without undue rate burden or unduly high rates, on the assumption that they pool the subsidies which they receive on their whole existing and future stock of houses.<br/>
On that assumption there is no difference between the position of a housing authority which goes on building to meet its general needs within its boundaries and one which, for various reasons, goes outside its boundaries. It is still building for its general housing needs and it is still in a position, like any other authority, to pool the subsidies which it receives. Indeed, if we were to extend this paragraph we should be making an unfair discrimination in favour of authorities which happened to have no development land remaining within their boundaries. There would be two authorities, one with building land within its boundaries and one without, and the former would be unable to receive the higher subsidy whereas the latter would receive it; but both would be building for the same needs and under the same financial conditions.</p>

<p>There is another fundamental point which the Parliamentary Secretary seems to have forgotten. In out-county building one big difference arises. The big difference between

a scheme inside a county and a scheme outside is that the local authority building outside loses the rateable value of the land outside the area, but it may be called upon to make some contribution towards the local services in the area it is helping to build.</p>

<p>I think that my answer to the hon. Member for Islington, Southwest (Mr. A. Evans) is most in point. It is admitted that there will be a minority of local authorities&#x2014;we believe it will be a very small minority&#x2014;which, for various reasons, even after pooling their rents, cannot be expected to meet their general housing needs with the &#x00A3;10 subsidy or without subsidy at all. But there is no reason to think that that minority in any way coincides with local authorities which happen to have to build outside their boundaries in order to meet their housing needs. At another point in Committee we discuss the provisions of the Bill for dealing with cases in which local authorities cannot meet their general housing needs without undue burden or unreasonable rents.<br/>
Perhaps I may come to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Dulwich and repeated by the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Lindgren)&#x2014; the loss of rateable value. It is alleged that there is this difference between a housing authority which develops inside and one which develops outside its boundaries: that the latter loses the rateable value or, rather, does not gain the extra rateable value which accrues from the construction of houses. But, of course, it does not have to provide the associated services either. It does not have to provide any of the services for the inhabitants of those houses. Although it does not acquire the rateable value it does not acquire the burdens either. If it had built those houses inside its boundaries it would have had to provide the whole range of local government services for those who live there.</p>

<p>I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, but he will recollect that the rate burden is imposed for housing purposes as well as services purposes.


It has hitherto included a compulsory rate contribution and, very often, a supplementary one. It will now include, we hope, some contribution from the rates.</p>

<p>Yes, it is true that a small fraction of the total rate burden which goes on local authority services is attributable to the rate subsidy in respect of housing, but in general the local authority which builds outside its area is rid of the obligation to provide services for the persons who are accommodated outside its area. Broadly, that is the case.<br/>
What, then, is the justification for giving this special subsidy to the exporting authority in the case in which the development is equivalent to the creation of a new town? The answer is that when a new town or anything analogous to it is developed, at the outset there must be an immense amount of unremunerative expenditure, which is not directly connected with the provision for housing need. There is the lay-out on a much wider scale than would be necessary in estate development. There is provision for industry, not as an adjunct, but sufficient as the new town develops to provide employment for all those who will live in it.<br/>
The developing authority in this case has to meet burdens which do not fall upon the exporting authority in any of the other types of development outside its boundaries. There is the further fact that usually building costs will be higher by reason of the grass roots nature of the development in a new town area than normally they would be in the case of an ordinary estate development, or town development.<br/>
I was asked a question about the application of the higher rate of subsidy in respect of slum clearance.</p>

<p>Before the hon. Gentleman goes on to that, let us be quite clear about this. We have had a very long discussion, in which hon. Members on all sides of the Committee have taken part. Are we to gather from the extremely ingenious argument to which we have listened that an exporting authority which has no additional building land inside its area but has to build houses outside its area is now a rather luckier authority than an authority which has additional land within its area? It is apparently

an advantage not to have sites within the authority's area.</p>

<p>No, that exporting authority only attracts the higher rate of subsidy for the houses it builds if it builds them in circumstances analogous to new town development in which it is obliged to incur a very heavy initial cost not shared by any other type of development. So it is far from an advantage to be undertaking that particular kind of decentralisation.<br/>
I was asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Iremonger) whether the higher slum clearance rate of subsidy did not also apply to comprehensive development. I think the same question was asked by the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Parker). This matter was debated at length by the Committee yesterday and the Committee decided that comprehensive development, as defined in the ambit of the planning Acts, was not within the scope of redevelopment for the purposes of paragraph (<i>a</i>) of this subsection.<br/>
On the narrower point of the position in West Ham, that authority has 2,854 slum houses and its plan is to deal with about 1,200 of those in the next five years. If it displaces 1,500 families from those slum houses it will get 1,500 subsidies of &#x00A3;22 1s. wherever the houses are built to house those people. That subsidy will also be paid on any houses which have to be demolished in order to give an appropriate clearance area in the sense of Part III of the Housing Act, 1936. The demand which will be created by the work of slum clearance in that constituency will be met by higher rates of subsidy wherever the houses in replacement are built.</p>

<p>That is correct.<br/>
I would advise the Committee that to widen the scope of this paragraph beyond that of development analogous to new towns would be both inconsistent with the underlying principle and assumption of the Bill and also unfair to other local authorities with an equal housing need which are able to meet it within their


boundaries. I would, therefore, advise the Committee to reject this series of Amendments.</p>

<p>I should like to raise a small problem with which the Parliamentary Secretary has not dealt. I admit that my Amendment does not cover it entirely, but that Amendment was put down merely as a peg on which to base a case. It would require to be supported by the last Amendment proposed to line 23.<br/>
During the past few years in my constituency and some other towns in northeast Cheshire, a small number of houses have been provided by local authorities for overspill from Salford. Those houses have been attracting the usual subsidy and there has been a contribution towards the rate fund from Cheshire County Council. This has been a sort of good neighbour scheme under which each year a few houses have been erected for the people of Salford. So far as I see there is no provision in this Bill by which such a scheme could continue to attract any subsidy and I should like to hear what the Parliamentary Secretary has to say about that.<br/>
In addition, my constituency is likely to be a reception area for a fairly large overspill scheme from Manchester. I take it that a scheme for about 4,000 houses would be entirely covered by paragraph (e) as it stands. The houses would be built by the exporting authority and I take it that the scheme would be a development considered as similar to that under the New Towns Act. If I am correct in my assumption that this matter would be covered by paragraph (e), the fears of my hon. Friend the Member for Salford, West (Mr. Royle) about the scheme in Worsley would be alleviated.</p>

<p>It depends upon the nature of the scheme. The mere size of a scheme does not, as such, either exclude it or bring within the scope of paragraph (e). It must be a scheme which can be fairly regarded as comparable with a new town. Of course, size would be a factor because it would be difficult for a small number of houses to be comparable to a new town, but the hon. Member should not assume that unless the nature of the scheme itself&#x2014;in its detail and whole structure&#x2014;can be fairly regarded as

analogous to a new town it will fall within paragraph (e).</p>

<p>The scheme would include all the qualifications which the Parliamentary Secretary read as being necessary under the New Towns Act. Therefore, am I correct in my assumption that it would rank for subsidy?</p>

<p>In his closing sentences, the Parliamentary Secretary sought to argue that if the Amendment to which I have appended my name were conceded, it would place the authority which has to build houses in the area of another local authority at an advantage as against the local authority which builds the same type of house within its own area.<br/>
Will the hon. Gentleman address himself to this point? The authority which has to build its houses in another authority's area, while having to meet the cost of building the houses, would not get for itself the additional rateable value, which would be obtained by the authority which builds the houses within its area. Indeed, the export of a number of its population to a neighbouring area might conceivably affect its Exchequer equalisation grant because of a reduction in population.<br/>
It seems quite unreasonable, therefore, to argue that the local authority which builds its houses outside its own area would have an advantage over the authority which builds within its own area. The disadvantage of not securing the additional rateable value of the new houses and the distinct possibility of a loss of Exchequer equalisation grant seem to me to be perfectly sound reasons why the Amendment which carries my name should be accepted.</p>

<p>I listened very carefully to the Parliamentary Secretary, but it seems that he quite fails to appreciate the reason why the small local authorities seek land outside their borders other than through the Town Development Act and the new towns and expanded towns arrangements. When the hon. Gentleman suggests that the new estates that these local authorities want to build are in exactly the same category as houses built within the areas of other borough authorities, he fails to realise the extent of this problem of land.<br/>
These small, congested boroughs are trying to relieve over-population, which is supposed to be one of the purposes of the Bill&#x2014;there is no question about it. They have been forced to buy land outside their boroughs because under the Town Development Act and the provisions for the new and expanded towns, although they have taken some of the surplus populations from the industrial areas, they have not in the main taken people from the housing waiting lists of the local authorities concerned. The only way in which the small, congested authorities, such as those in Middlesex and the others to which reference has been made, can have a sizeable building estate is by purchasing the land and building the houses themselves.<br/>
To do that demands considerable effort and a great deal of negotiation. As has been pointed out, there is in other areas great opposition to local authorities obtaining land. All this adds up to the fact that if only the reduced subsidy is given, many of these authorities will say that it simply is not worth their while to proceed with their schemes. That is the point with which the Amendments are concerned.<br/>
If the Minister wants to relieve overpopulation, here is one of the most effective ways of doing it. Unless he gives the higher subsidy these authorities, after all their efforts and struggles, who feel that they have achieved something in acquiring the land, will say, "We are just not going on. It is &#x00A3;10 today, it will be nothing tomorrow, and fresh difficulties will be put in our way. We will abandon the whole thing." That is the essential difference between local authorities which build outside their areas and those which build within their areas, where these particular difficulties of acquiring land and of finance do not obtain.<br/>
I ask the Minister to consider our proposals from that viewpoint. In view of all that has been said today, can he not consider the Amendments again and do something to help the relief of overpopulation, which it is the declared intention of the Bill to achieve?</p>

<p>We have had a good discussion on this group of Amendments, and I would draw the Parliamentary Secretary's attention to an unusual feature of our discussion. Hitherto during the Committee

stage we have been looking at empty benches opposite. There were times yesterday when not a single Member of the party opposite was present. Today, we have had a reasonable attendance by hon. Members opposite. Many of them have made speeches, speeches which have been exactly in line with those made by my hon. Friends on this side, and yet the Parliamentary Secretary has failed to make any concession whatever.<br/>
I have called attention to this afternoon's unity because the previous stages of the Bill have been a rather one-sided battle; we have been hitting fairly hard at the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary. Time and time again, when we have made points, we have been told, particularly by the Parliamentary Secretary, "I would call the attention of the Committee to the fact that the basic principles of the Bill are slum clearance and dealing with overspill." This afternoon, however, the Parliamentary Secretary has "blown the gaff," because he has shown that that is not at all the purpose of the Bill.<br/>
All the cases which have been dealt with by hon. Members on the Parliamentary Secretary's own side of the Committee and those dealt with by my hon. Friends on this side have been cases of overspill, in which a local authority has no land within its confines on which to build and its population has to be decanted. The Parliamentary Secretary said, in effect, "All we are going to deal with is overspill in large-scale development, where it is on a basis of dealing with 40,000, 50,000 or 60,000 people." The normal overspill of an ordinary municipal borough or even of a small county borough is not being dealt with.<br/>
It may be that Manchester or London, for example, would come within the field of action, but we must look further. Not only are the Government cutting out subsidies for housing purposes; they are breaking up existing legislation. Under the arrangements for the expanded towns to deal with overspill, hardly anything is being done outside the Borough of Swindon and the urban district of Bletchley. When the London County Council was prepared to accept schemes with local authorities under the Town Development Act, the Ministry killed them in two ways. First, the Ministry refused to give sufficient grants to assist with the extension


of facilities for water, sewerage, lighting, playing fields and the rest, which are necessary in the areas.<br/>
The Bletchley scheme was started under a Labour Government and commitments were entered into by the Labour Government, which the present Government could not evade, with the Bletchley Urban District Council. Although certain concessions have been given, the Government are now making it almost impossible for schemes to proceed because the interest rates so increase the charges to be borne by the existing ratepayers in the area that the schemes are being given up. Accordingly, we can now rule out the Town Development Act. In the first place the Government refused to give adequate grants for essential services; and, secondly, the rates of interest cause added difficulty, even to local authorities who are prepared to consider schemes.<br/>
6.30 p.m.<br/>
When the arrangements for the new towns were being worked out it was intended that there should be a new town development corporation to undertake the estate development in any area the local authority of which had not sufficient resources, not enough officials or too little money, to be responsible for it. The New Towns Act was not intended to apply to boroughs which could competently undertake their own expansion. Those towns are the expanding towns, and the Borough of Swindon is one of them.<br/>
What has happened since the present Government have been in office? In the four and a half years they have been in office no new towns have been designated. It was the Labour Government who introduced and passed the necessary legislation. Until it was on the Statute Book, no new town building could be done, and the Labour Government started the work of the new towns from scratch. The Act was passed in 1946, and between 1946 and 1951 the Labour Government made all the arrangements for 14 new towns. The present Government have not designated one. They have, however, interfered with the machinery devised for the development of the new towns.<br/>
The hon. Member for Blackley (Mr. E. Johnson) was talking today about the problems of Manchester. The Labour Government made an arrangement for the

designation of a new town&#x2014;Congleton&#x2014; to deal with overspill from Manchester. What have the present Government done? After their first action of putting up the interest rates to satisfy the bankers, they adopted a policy by which there will be in future no new towns except for the relief of such crowded places as Manchester, London and Birmingham, because they are considered the best able to undertake new town development.<br/>
This involves what we in local government circles have always tried to avoid. We have never liked out-county building, and avoided it if we could. There are always difficulties when a local authority's policy involves another local authority, or the usurpation, as it were, of another local authority's duties and powers. Local authorities do not like usurping one another's powers, even in building. The Government's policy means that London County Council, Birmingham City Council, Manchester City Council, in dealing with their overspill problems, will have, each of them, perhaps, to take over a couple of rural districts and an urban district and usurp the powers of the local authorities in those areas.<br/>
The intention under the New Towns Act was to avoid interference with local authority powers, and that was why the device of the development corporation was adopted. It was the intention that there should be a development corporation for a new town, a corporation of business men to deal with the estate development, while the normal local government functions were to be left to the local government units in the area.<br/>
We now know that, whatever the Government may say about it, this Bill is not to deal with slums, because in so far as it relates to the expansion of towns, it will permit those expansions only on a large scale. There can be only "substantial" expansions, as the Minister put it, and that means that it will assist only such cities as London, Birmingham and Manchester. The ordinary boroughs will get nothing out of the Bill.<br/>
My hon. and learned Friend the Member for West Ham, South (Mr. Elwyn Jones) has a case which illustrates the fact that the Bill will not help in these respects. A previous Minister of Housing and Local Government had authorised a compulsory purchase order in favour of West Ham


and against the London County Council, because it was desirable to have some slum clearance in West Ham. Now, families displaced by a slum clearance scheme must go to houses in new housing schemes, even outside the borough in which the slum clearance is being done.<br/>
We have heard some talk about how people will be better off in new areas. It is true, of course, that if, for instance, London County Council houses some of its people in Essex, or Kent, or Surrey, or Hertfordshire, it will be saved some costs on education, but the local authority receiving the overspill will have additional educational costs. There are other factors, too. The people who are thus moved away from their former homes have to pay more in fares to go to their work, and that is in reality an addition to their rent.</p>

<p>Yes. I was speaking of people who retained their jobs which they had when they lived in their former homes. They may, perhaps, give up those jobs and get new jobs nearer their new homes. Men who do that often have to take a lower rate of pay.<br/>
What the Government are saying to the ratepayers is, "You must pay increased rates to build houses 30 or 40 or 50 miles away for other people." Tenants of council houses in the London area may have to pay as much as 5s. a week more rent to finance the building of houses far away for other people and so that they can be let at reasonable rents.<br/>
The Government are saying that the local authorities, whether they want to or not, must pool rents and subsidies, but this is spreading the pool rather wide. Where will the pool end? Will it so spread that at last all the resources of all the local authorities in England and Wales</p>

<p>Motion made, and Question proposed, That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-02-01a.987.2" hansard_membership_id="12148" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20651" speakername="Mr. Julius Silverman" colnum="987" time="">
<p>I hope that the Minister will still reconsider the Clause. It imposes very serious obligations upon local authorities. My own local authority, Birmingham, has a tremendous overspill problem. Within the next very few years no more new building land in the city will be available. Consequently, some provision will have to be made for Birmingham applicants for houses to go outside the city.<br/>
It is estimated that we should have to provide for 50,000 families outside the city boundary. That is an overspill problem of not merely a large town but what amounts to another city. The question is: where are we going to put the people? So far, the Minister has not been very helpful in that respect. The right hon. Gentleman said that the Bill is intended to provide primarily for slum clearance. He should bear in mind that slum clearance of itself creates an overspill problem.<br/>
We are finding in Birmingham that, even when we rebuild as densely as we


can, we can only rehouse three out of every five tenants displaced by slum clearance. It means that if one clears an area where 5,000 families are living one has to find fresh building land for 2,000 of those families even after providing for a dense redevelopment in the area. Even if it is correct to say that the Bill is intended to deal with slum clearance, it creates an overspill problem which must be dealt with and people like those whom I have mentioned have to be rehoused outside the local authority's area.<br/>
No single method of tackling overspill can deal with the problem. Even if the Government provide for a new town for the Midlands conurbation, that of itself will not solve the problem. I cannot think of a place in the Midlands where one can build a new town for 50,000 or even 30,000 families.<br/>
There are three methods of tackling the problem. One is to build a new town, the other is to provide for other local authorities to take the new tenants, and the third is to enable cities like Birmingham to build outside their area. In Birmingham, we have been in contact with certain local authorities who are prepared to accept our tenants, provided that Birmingham takes the responsibility of building for and housing the tenants. In view of the hight rate of interest and other obligations it is quite understandable that some of the small local authorities are not prepared to accept this burden. Unfortunately, these negotiations are now bedevilled by the financial terms and provisions of this Bill. I hope that the Minister will look at the Clause again and consider what can be done to assist areas like Birmingham to provide for their overspill.</p>

<p>I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to yet one other point which is of special interest to many of us, namely, the question of temporary bungalows, to which reference is made in subsection (3,<i>b</i>) of this Clause. On Second Reading, my right hon. Friend said that he could not agree to take power to designate as unsatisfactory those temporary bungalows usually known as "prefabs" which have been erected in various parts of the country. He said that they were good houses and were suitable for small families.<br/>
I would agree entirely that these "prefabs" are still very much better houses than many of the slum houses. However, they were meant to last only ten years. They are rapidly becoming unsatisfactory temporary housing accommodation. Many more will be extremely unsatisfactory by 1965, which is the year in which those on public open spaces have to be pulled down under the provisions of the Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954.<br/>
I understand that subsection (3, <i>b</i>) covers those houses and that the Clause need not have anything added to it to enable my right hon. Friend to designate these "prefabs" as being in a category which covers houses built for rehousing and attracting a subsidy of &#x00A3;22 1s. I hope that that is correct and that my right hon. Friend will be able to confirm it.<br/>
Another point which I should like to clear up concerns prefabricated houses built upon public open spaces. There are 1,530 of these in Manchester, 738 of them in my constituency. Indeed, I have 12&#x00BD; per cent. of all the "prefabs" on public open spaces in the county and, therefore, I am interested to know what will happen. They have to be removed by 1965 under the Housing Repairs and Rents Act. I should like to know from my right hon. Friend whether, when that happens, the houses which have to be built to accommodate the people who are living in these "prefabs" will attract a subsidy of &#x00A3;22 1s. If my right hon. Friend can reassure me on that matter it will give great satisfaction to the people of Manchester.</p>

<p>I should like to say a few words about slum clearance and the rate of subsidy. Slum clearance should be much more a national problem than a local problem and should be dealt with on a national basis. I agree that there is a subsidy of &#x00A3;22 1s., compared with &#x00A3;10 for ordinary housing provision, but the problem of slum clearance arises chiefly in the urban districts, in those districts which have in the main contributed to the industrial wealth of the country in the past. The problem of slum clearance has not arisen because of some crime which the present inhabitants of these towns have committed.<br/>
Now, these people have placed upon them the heavy burden of clearing the slums. I can best illustrate the matter by


giving an example from my own constituency. According to returns in a Ministry publication, the proportion of sub-standard houses to the total hereditaments in the three non-county boroughs in my constituency are 25 per cent., 21 per cent., and 15 per cent. Those percentages give some idea of the problem created by slum dwellings.<br/>
7.0 p.m.<br/>
I took the figures for two municipal boroughs in the same county which are chiefly residential. The figures there were 1&#x00B7;7 per cent. and 1&#x00B7;05 per cent. I have compared those figures with some seaside resorts, taking four examples, two county boroughs and two non-county boroughs. For the county boroughs the percentage was 0&#x00B7;15 per cent. and 0&#x00B7;6 per cent. and for the non-county boroughs it was 0&#x00B7;28 per cent. and 0&#x00B7;044 per cent. Therefore, the burden of dealing with this problem is being spread most unevenly throughout the country, and in my opinion it should be dealt with much more on a national scale than considered as a small problem for each local authority.<br/>
On the Amendments to paragraph (<i>e</i>) I asked a specific question about the good neighbour policy which has been pursued by an authority in my own constituency and by other neighbouring authorities. I asked whether it was the intention of the Government that this should be brought to an end and I think I am entitled to have a reply.<br/>
Finally, I appeal to the Minister to reconsider the problem of overspill between now and the Report stage to ensure that there are sufficient provisions in the Bill to deal with the many facets of the problem that will arise in that connection.</p>

<p>Paragraph (<i>b</i>) of subsection (3) enables the Minister to designate for the purposes of the higher subsidy certain classes of unsatisfactory temporary housing accommodation. It is general in its terms and except for camps, which are specifically mentioned, neither Parliament nor the local authorities which will have to operate the proposed law, know what it is intended to cover. The war and the post-war period have produced a variety of temporary accommodation such as camps, temporary hutments, a wide variety of prefabricated bungalows and requisitioned dwellings.<br/>
I seek to particularise two classes of this accommodation where the local authority is bound to rehouse the occupants within a known period. The first consists of requisitioned houses where the owner is unwilling to accept the licensee as his tenant, and the local authority is unable to acquire the property either by purchase or lease on reasonable terms. In these circumstances, the local authority is required by the Requisitioned Houses and Housing (Amendment) Act, 1955, to relinquish requisition of the property by 1960. As the licensee cannot remain in the property as a statutory tenant at that time, and the local authority has been unable to acquire the ownership of the property, it has no alternative in the majority of cases but to rehouse the licensee.<br/>
The second class consists of temporary housing accommodation erected on open spaces. Here again the local authority is unable to rehouse the people resident in those temporary buildings. The Minister has said as regards both these classes that the local authority needs no stimulus by way of increased subsidy to encourage it to remove the dwellings in question, and that there is already stimulus in the existing law which will require the local authority to do something about rehousing the tenants before 1960 or 1965 as the case may be.<br/>
The Association of Municipal Corporations takes the view that housing subsidies ought not to depend solely on stimulus. Post-war housing has up to now been in the nature of a partnership between the Government and the local authority, and since by reason of recent Acts of Parliament local authorities have a special and urgent problem of rehousing which cannot be postponed, they should be given special financial assistance.<br/>
These two classes are likely to be particularly onerous for the local authorities concerned, and I share the hope of my hon. Friend the Member for Stalybridge and Hyde (Mr. Blackburn) that the Minister will reconsider this point between now and the conclusion of the proceedings on this Bill in order to make it possible for local authorities to meet their obligations under recent legislation without undue strain.</p>

<p>I want to address a few remarks on the subject of the success or otherwise of the policies


of decongestion by the Government in relation to London. We know that by means of new towns and expanded towns, as well as various other analogous means which have been under discussion in this Committee, some decongestion is going on.<br/>
Just before Christmas, my right hon. Friend gave an Answer to the House indicating that about 19,000 houses had been let to people who were on London's housing waiting lists. If we multiply that figure by four, as being about the average number of inhabitants in a house in a new town, we find that 76,000 people have been absorbed from London by the new towns. But, of course, the new towns have built a larger number of houses than that, and it is nearer to 5,000 which have been occupied by inhabitants who have not come from the London area, so that we get about 20,000 people who have not been absorbed from that area.<br/>
When we look at the population figures for London we realise that London, which shrank in the war, started to expand immediately afterwards and went on expanding steadily between 1946 and 1950. In 1951, for the first time, it started to contract again, when the population went down by 67,000 to 8,350,380 from the figure of 8,417,380 at which it stood in 1950. Thereafter, in 1952, it went up again, and in 1953 and in 1954 it contracted slightly, so that from the peak figure of 8,417,380 in 1950 it is now in 1954, the last figure available, 8,319,220, which is about 100,000 less than it was at the peak.<br/>
If we take into account the arrangements which have been made by the new towns and by the expanded schemes under the Town Development Act of 1952 in a town such as Bletchley, to which the hon. Gentleman the Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Lindgren) referred, we wonder to what extent this process is being effective. I have certain figures which indicate the growth of industry since the war. In 1945, the licences which were granted to factories in Development Areas by the Board of Trade amounted to 62 per cent. whereas the London region received only 2 per cent. In 1954 the trend was reversed. The Development Areas were getting only 18 per cent. and the London region was getting 29 per cent. So there is a process which has to be watched carefully if the policies of the

Minister are to command success and if our great conglomeration of Metropolitan London is to be eased of its strain. Therefore, I ask my right hon. Friend what is being done in this connection.<br/>
For example, the London County Council can get special Exchequer grants in respect of sterilising land where there are factory sites, and so on. What coordination is there of licensing as between the Department of my right hon. Friend and the Board of Trade? Is the planning permission which is required before a business can set up inside the Greater London area granted, and is that a sufficiently effective barrier to control the process? If it is not, London will become an unmanageable Frankenstein. I should like to hear something about the general success of the broad strategy of my right hon. Friend in this matter.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Epping (Mr. Finlay) raised some rather wide issues in his short and very concise speech and I do not think I should be in order in pursuing them, although I think that his remarks were as relevant to the matters under discussion as some of the earlier speeches in the debate.<br/>
Perhaps I may be allowed, in reply to him, to say that the most energetic efforts are being made by the local authorities concerned and by myself to see that new industry does not come into the Greater London area at the same time as we are trying to export population to the new towns and the expanded towns outside. In approving the County of London Plan, I specifically cut out many acres of land which the L.C.C. proposed to allocate to industry and I tightened in every sort of way the possibilities of converting residential property into commercial or industrial use. The L.C.C. are also taking steps to devote an increasing amount of money to buying and sterilising industrial property which is wrongly located.<br/>
All this will not be done in a day and the magnitude of the problem is bound to appal anybody who has to deal with it, but none the less I have no doubt that strenuous and conscientious efforts are being made in the right direction and in the direction which my hon. Friend desires.</p>

<p>I do not think I ought to go far into the point, because that would be an abuse of the time of the Committee.<br/>
The hon. Member for The Hartlepools (Mr. D. Jones) and the hon. Member for Stalybridge and Hyde (Mr. Blackburn) emphasised the importance of dealing with this question on a national scale. The hon. Member for The Hartlepools referred to the difficulty which might arise under recent legislation, in particular the Requisitioned Houses and Housing (Amendment) Act. I dealt with that earlier, and I sincerely believe that the changes which will be brought about by the Bill should make it no more difficult for local authorities to carry out their obligations under that Act.</p>

<p>I argued the point earlier. I cannot see how the Bill can affect their position, for the simple reason that the policy underlying the Requisitioned Houses and Housing (Amendment) Act rests not upon the assumption that the great majority of the people now living in requisitioned houses will be rehoused elsewhere, but on the assumption that a substantial proportion of those requisitioned houses will continue to be occupied by the present licensees as a result either of agreements to rent the houses from the owners or, alternatively, of arrangements to buy the houses from the owners. It is only in such a way that a problem of that magnitude can be dealt with, and I made that abundantly clear during the passage of that Act. I also referred to it the other day.<br/>
The hon. Member for Stalybridge and Hyde said that the problem of slum clearance should be dealt with on a national scale. It is very easy to use those broad phrases, but what exactly he means I do not know. I cannot conceive that the manner in which we are dealing with it is other than dealing with it on a national scale.</p>

<p>Much more should be provided by public funds rather than the burden being placed on those local authorities which have the greatest problems. The subsidy should be higher.</p>

<p>Building a house to replace slum clearance does not cost more, by and large, than building a house for general needs. There is no financial difficulty about building a house to replace a slum. The reason that we are giving the larger subsidy is not because of any increased cost involved. Sometimes it costs a little more, sometimes a little less, when one has allowed for realising the value of the materials of the house which is demolished. It costs roughly the same to build a new house on a bare site as to pull down a house, sell the materials and rebuild on that site. The reasons for which we are providing a larger subsidy for slum clearance is not any extra cost involved to the local authority but a desire to encourage local authorities to concentrate to a greater extent than has been the case hitherto on the problem of clearing the slums.<br/>
The hon. Member asked whether we wished what he described as "a good neighbour policy" among local authorities in his area to come to an end. Of course we do not. Naturally, we wish any satisfactory arrangements for co-operation between local authorities to continue, and the Bill in no way precludes this.</p>

<p>These houses are not placed in a different category from other houses because they are built by some arrangement for co-operation between local authorities, but we should naturally like any of these arrangements which are working satisfactorily to continue.<br/>
The hon. Member for Aston (Mr. J. Silverman) said that some local authorities around Birmingham are willing to accept overspill population from the City of Birmingham provided that Birmingham Corporation undertakes the building of the houses needed. He asked what would be the subsidy position for those houses. If they are to be owned by the receiving authority&#x2014;that is, the authority in the area in which they are to be built&#x2014;they will attract the &#x00A3;24 subsidy. If, on the other hand, they are to be owned by the City of Birmingham, they will form part of Birmingham's total housing pool and Birmingham will be able to allocate tenants to those houses in exactly the same way as they allocate tenants to their own houses within the city. There would, therefore, be no justification for treating those houses differently from homes built within the city and perhaps only a mile or so away.</p>

<p>The hon. and learned Gentleman has not told me exactly which scheme he has in mind, but provided it is a scheme of that kind the houses would qualify for the higher subsidy if they were owned by the receiving authority. If, as I believe is the practice in most cases, they will be owned by the City of Birmingham, who will build them, own them and dispose of them for the purpose of allocating tenants to them, they will not be treated differently from any other houses which Birmingham builds for its population.</p>

<p>Will the Minister say what is the logical distinction between a

house where Birmingham does the building and a house where the local authority does the building? Both provide for the same class of tenant. Why should one attract a subsidy and not the other, simply because Birmingham is not able to make satisfactory arrangements with the local authority and has to do the building itself?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-02-01a.998.0" hansard_membership_id="6684" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29186" speakername="Mr. Sandys" colnum="998" time="">
<p>It should attract subsidy if it is built and owned by the receiving authority, because it is unreasonable to expect the receiving authority, which may be a small rural district with comparatively few houses of its own&#x2014;and this may be a substantial scheme which may altogether alter the plans of the authority's housing pool&#x2014;to average out the rents and possibly have to increase rents for its comparatively few local inhabitants in order to make it possible to build houses for Birmingham and to charge the incoming population reasonable rents.<br/>
That might be the case if the authority had to carry out this large expansion out of all proportion to its normal building programme with the &#x00A3;10 subsidy. That is why in these cases we have thought it right to pay the highest rate of subsidy of &#x00A3;24. Where Birmingham itself is building a comparatively small number of additional houses just over its border, which, for all practical purposes, are houses built by Birmingham for Birmingham people, there seems to be no justification for paying an increased subsidy.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Blackley (Mr. E. Johnson) raised the question of prefabricated temporary houses. I said on an earlier occasion that I would have a further look at the position. If these are to be dealt with in the Bill, they fall to be dealt with in Clause 3 (3, <i>b</i>). That refers to houses
<q>provided by a local authority for the purposes of rehousing persons coming from such camps or other unsatisfactory temporary housing accommodation as the Minister may designate for the purposes of this paragraph.</q>
They come into the category of temporary housing accommodation. If they are so unsatisfactory&#x2014;and by that I mean really unsatisfactory for some reason; I do not regard the general run of temporary prefabricated houses as being unsatisfactory&#x2014;that they are not capable of being repaired at a reasonable cost, the houses built to rehouse people from


those temporary prefabricated houses will qualify for the &#x00A3;22 subsidy.<br/>
The other class into which I undertook to look was those prefabricated temporary houses which are now built on open spaces and which local authorities from time to time may wish to pull down. There are statutory time limits within which these houses have to be pulled down. We all recognise, as I said earlier, that we would like to see the removal of these houses from the cities' open spaces &#x2014;which, in most cases, are none too numerous&#x2014;as soon as practical, having regard, at the same time, to the housing position in that area. In other words, I do not wish to take action which in any way will compel local authorities, in areas where there is acute housing shortage, to pull down satisfactory houses, even though on open spaces, before the authorities themselves think that is desirable within the limits of what the law provides.<br/>
What I am prepared to do&#x2014;and this is a matter which requires no amendment of the Bill&#x2014;is to say to the Committee that, in practice, under this Clause I intend to designate temporary prefabricated houses which local authorities decide to remove from open spaces. That does go some way towards meeting the point put by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee, but I could not, of course, for the reasons I have already explained, consider designating for higher subsidy temporary prefabricated houses which are away from open spaces and which are still satisfactory, because the only effect of that would be to stimulate local authorities to pull down houses which for small families are really satisfactory accommodation.</p>

<p>I should like to make one observation on the Minister's last point, which is of some importance. If the local authority itself thinks that the temporary "prefabs" are in an unsatisfactory condition, is that enough to qualify for the subsidy? The right hon. Gentleman will bear in mind that it is the local authorities who, by statute, are judges of what is an insanitary house, or unfit accommodation, for a number of other purposes. I hope he will not say that he would require to interfere with a discretion in the matter which, I am sure he will agree, would be honestly exercised.</p>

<p>I always hesitate to answer a rather detailed point "off the cuff," but I think that it would be right that local authorities should have the same degree of discretion in deciding whether a prefabricated temporary house is unsatisfactory as they have in deciding whether it is unfit. In all cases they are subject to confirmation by the Minister, whose inspector goes into these matters. I see no reason why they should not be treated in the same kind of way.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman said that he was prepared to consider a subsidy on the removal of temporary dwellings from parks and open spaces, but not in other cases. Is he aware that in London and many other big cities and towns prefabricated houses have been put on the sites of dwellings which were two to seven-storey flats? Many local authorities had to use such vacant sites, because there was nowhere else to put such houses. Most of those authorities have very heavy housing lists and a severe housing problem. They intended to demolish those prefabricated houses and restore the two to seven-storey flats so that six families could be housed in the place of the one in the "prefab." Will the right hon. Gentleman seriously reconsider that point, which is very important?</p>

<p>The hon. Member overrates the relief which the local authority would get if his suggestion were adopted. There may be six or seven storeys to this building that he would like to put where one "prefab" is standing so that it would house six or seven families. I am not saying that we accept his suggestion, but the local authority would get an additional subsidy only in respect of the rehousing of one family out of an unsatisfactory house.</p>

<p>I do not propose to take the time of the Committee for more than a minute or two. We have had a very full discussion on a number of


points in the Clause, and particularly on subsection (3). What strikes me about it is that not one hon. Member has made a speech in support of members of the Government except the members of the Government themselves, who have cordially and loyally supported one another. From their own back benches they have had nothing but criticism, and the bitterness of the criticism has varied with the personality of the hon. Member and with the depth of the grievances to which he felt bound to give vent. That is not a good beginning for what, on any showing, will be a difficult Clause to administer.<br/>
I keep on watching right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite slipping back into the grievous fallacy that they are giving a substantial increase of subsidy in some of these cases. All that they are doing is cutting housing subsidies in general and refraining from cutting in some cases. It is true that, on a rather complicated hypothesis which could not possibly affect more than a small number of dwellings, one or two may come out a &#x00A3; or two better, but, by and large, the object of the Bill is to cut the housing subsidies, with a view to removing the general subsidy completely in a year or two. These are the exceptions to it.<br/>
It is clear that these exceptions do not go nearly far enough. They will allow some of the business of exporting surplus population for various purposes to preserve its existing subsidy in some cases, but will not cover the efforts that have been made by the very local authorities who are in the greatest difficulties in this matter. It is the comparatively small local authorities, pressed and crushed within their narrow boundaries with a surplus population that they have no room to house or to decant, who find difficulties at present. They will be uncommonly hard hit by the removal in a year or so of the subsidy and its present reduction.<br/>
They will not be helped by the Clause. There are some concessions, illogical and one-sided, which may help in certain circumstances some of the larger authorities, but only if, and in so far as, they comply with what the Minister thinks is the right way to do it. The effect of the Clause is, once more, to take away the initiative and discretion which local

authorities have always had in the past, and to put one more rope around them, tied by the Minister.<br/>
I cannot refrain from a word about the "urgent needs of industry." This is a most perilous phrase. It will allow the Minister of Housing and Local Government, who is no doubt a member of the Government in consultation with his colleagues, to decide what the urgent needs of industry are. Quite frankly, we know too much of the associations of the Tory Party in the past with big business and we are told too little about the sources of Tory Party funds to be happy about any provision in a Bill which leaves the decision on a phrase of that sort to the discretion of a Tory Minister.<br/>
For that reason alone we cordially dislike the wording of the Clause. We have done our best to make the Clause more reasonable by Amendment, to remove some of its inconsistencies and to give back to local authorities a little of the discretion which the Minister of Housing and Local Government ought to preserve instead of reduce. We have failed at every point. The only concession we have had from the Minister&#x2014;and he was driven to rely on it as an instance of his reasonableness&#x2014;was a mere matter of postponing the operation of the reductions for a period so short that he could not possibly have made any in that period. Otherwise, he has not made a single concession, not only to us, but, in the case of this Clause, to his hon. Friends, who represented the views not only of their constituencies but, in one important matter, of the Association of Municipal Corporations.<br/>
If that is not perverse obstinacy in a Government what is it? At the end, what have we to say? We are offered something, the preservation of some subsidies in certain circumstances. We think it is a niggling gift, ill worded, ill-conceived and insufficiently thought out; but, still, it is a gift. We are not going to refuse it and we are not going to divide against the Clause, insufficient though we think it is.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 5, line 22, to leave out from "accommodation" to "that" in line 24 and to insert "in the district of."<br/>
This Clause gives the Minister power to increase subsidies in certain circumstances, and he can exercise it if he forms an opinion upon two matters set out in the Clause. The purpose of the Amendment is to suggest that in the first case it ought to be quite sufficient if he is of opinion, on application, that there is an urgent need for more housing accommodation, and that he need not, in terms of statutory obligation, have regard to whether or not that need can only be met by housing provided by the local authority.<br/>
There is an additional danger in the Clause that it may well come to be the practice that a burden will be placed upon a local authority when it makes its application. It is not clearly indicated in the Clause who will have the onus of proving and of satisfying the Minister that the housing need can only be met by the accommodation provided by the local authority. While those words remain in the Clause there is a distinct peril that, in practice, local authorities making application to the Minister will find it necessary not only to have to prove the existence of an urgent need for more housing accommodation but to satisfy the Minister that they and nobody else can supply it.<br/>
That may be a very difficult onus to discharge. It may not be within the local authority's competence. In my submission it would be entirely wrong that any burden of that kind should be imposed on the authority. A local authority might find it necessary to bring forward evidence of an absence of private applications for development, of private tenders and the rest, and I suggest that, under the first head, it should be necessary only for the authority to satisfy the Minister of the existence, in the district of that authority, of an urgent housing need.</p>

<p>I regard this Amendment as going beyond a mere matter of drafting. I would read the Clause as leaving the burden&#x2014;if one can use such

a word in relation to what is really an administrative matter&#x2014;on the local authorities, but it seems to me that the Amendment also raises a real question of principle, and if the Parliamentary Secretary is to reply I should like to put this to him.<br/>
Suppose the requirement that it should be shown that the urgent need can only be met
<q>&#x2026;if that accommodation is provided by that authority</q>
is left out&#x2014;which is what the Amendment seeks&#x2014;the local authority will still have to show that there is the urgent need; it will still have to show, by the provisions of the next paragraph, an "unreasonably heavy rate burden" or "unreasonably high rents" in the case of the accommodation provided by them. The substantial question is this. If the local authority shows that there is urgent need, that those other matters do actually exist, but is unable to show&#x2014;and does not believe&#x2014;that the accommodation can only be met by them, is the Minister in that case to have power to direct an increased subsidy?<br/>
I wish to give two instances, the first being non-controversial and the second not. This is the first. Suppose that under authorised arrangements urgent need can be met by a housing association. From the language of the Bill it is quite clear that then the needs are not provided by the authority but by the housing association under authorised arrangements with that authority. It will be realised that, as the Bill is at present worded, though the local authority may make the arrangements, and though all the other requisites may be there, it may be unable to apply for the discretionary grant which the Minister is enabled to give. I do not think that is intended. If it is intended, then I should very much like to know the reason for this curious distinction between what the local authority does itself and what is done under authorised arrangements between it and a housing association. It is certainly not a distinction that is made in other parts of the Bill.<br/>
7.45 p.m.<br/>
I now come to what I suspect&#x2014;from the Parliamentary Secretary's political history and, if I may use the phrase, the look in his eye&#x2014;will be a bit more controversial. Suppose on making its plea


for an additional subsidy the local authority gets this answer from the Ministry: "We fully recognise that in your area there is urgent need, and that you could not carry out the work without imposing a much heavier rate burden&#x2014; even an unreasonable one. We fully recognise that it would mean unreasonably high rents. In fact, if you are to build council houses at all we recognise that you have qualified under this subsection in every respect but one. We happen to know that there is a housing company round the corner"&#x2014;or a private landlord&#x2014;"who would be perfectly willing to put up accommodation on the spot, so you do not qualify, because although this is urgently needed housing accommodation it could be provided by private enterprise."<br/>
I wonder what the answer to that will be. There is not the least doubt that under the Clause as it stands, the Minister&#x2014;if that is the true position&#x2014;is precluded from giving the additional subsidy, and the hon. Gentleman will perhaps allow me to observe that we shall have one more instance of the Tory doctrine of, "Never do by public enterprise what you can possibly do by private enterprise." We shall have another instance of another Tory doctrine&#x2014;that housing is a matter of profit in the main and only to be left to local authorities when nobody else can do it.<br/>
We say that housing is a service, and that the relationship between a council and a council house tenant is, in the nature of the case, a better relationship and one preferable to that between a private landlord and a tenant. For that reason we say the opposite to what the Parliamentary Secretary will say if he gives me the answer that&#x2014;in language chosen by himself and therefore more apt to his own philosophy&#x2014;he will no doubt give, which is that the local authority will not get the additional subsidy unless it can show that, however urgent the need, however high the rate burden and however high the rents, nevertheless private business could not do the job.</p>

<p>While I agree with the hon. and learned Member for Kettering (Mr. Mitchison) that this Amendment somewhat transcends a matter of drafting, there will be no need for me, in explaining the necessity for the words proposed to be left out, to ascend into the regions

of ideology into which he made an excursion.<br/>
If the hon. Member for Edge Hill (Mr. A. J. Irvine) will reflect, he will see that if the accommodation required could be provided, and the need met by any other agency, it is unreasonable that, nevertheless, the local authority should incur an undue rate burden and then approach the Minister for higher subsidies in consequence. This is a charge made upon both the local ratepayer and the Exchequer. In all reason it must be shown that it is necessary that it should be incurred.<br/>
When the hon. and learned Gentleman was stating his case he made a very significant alteration in the wording of the Clause as it stands. He said that if it is shown that the accommodation can be provided by another agency, then the conditions in paragraph (<i>a</i>) will not be fulfilled. That is not so. The reference is to an urgent need which will only be met by accommodation provided by that authority.</p>

<p>No, the condition is that that should be the only way of meeting the need. Unless the accommodation provided is apt to meet the need&#x2014;that is to say, if its character and the rent at which it is likely to be available are such that it will meet the housing need which exists, paragraph (<i>a</i> applies and the Minister goes on to consider paragraph (<i>b</i>)</p>

<p>I was coming to the point of where the burden of proof rests, but for the moment I want to make it clear that it is not sufficient to say that another agency can provide housing accommodation. What has to be shown in order that paragraph (<i>a</i>) shall not apply is that another agency can meet the need, and that is quite a different matter.<br/>
If we assume&#x2014;and that is what the wording of the Clause says&#x2014;that the urgent need can be met by another agency, I think the whole Committee will agree that it would be unreasonable that the local authority should then burden itself with this task and approach the Minister for a higher subsidy.<br/>
The hon. Member for Edge Hill asked where the burden of satisfying the Minister rests. It rests, of course, with the local authority. It is the local authority which makes the application, and it is on its application that the Minister has to form the opinion in the terms set out in the Clause. But, of course, that does not mean that the local authority has got to prove its contention in mathematical terms or in terms which would necessarily be satisfactory in a court of law. The hon. and learned Member for Kettering expressed it very well when he said that this will take place administratively. The Minister has got to form a reasoned opinion by administrative means and at an administrative level that the only way in which the urgent need can be met is by the provision of the accommodation by the local housing authority.<br/>
I suggest that when the wording of the Clause is carefully studied, it will be found to be unreasonable that these words should be omitted, as they would leave the door open, at any rate in theory, to an unnecessary operation and to an unnecessary rate burden and payment of subsidy.</p>

<p>This is a comparatively minor Amendment, and though I do not for one moment accept the hon.

<p>I beg to move, in page 5, line 29, to leave out "and other."<br/>
Curiously enough, at this comparatively late stage in our Committee proceedings, I think that this is the first time that the gloomy spectre that has haunted us all the time we have been considering this Bill has been produced in public for examination. At the back of the policy behind this Bill is this principle of pooling rents, and that is the basis of die right hon. Gentleman's policy, of his Bill and of his gamble with the housing of the nation.<br/>
I think I am right in saying that this is the first and perhaps the only place in which it is specifically mentioned in the Bill. It comes into the Bill at this stage in what one might describe as the means-test Clause. This is the Clause under which the wretched local authority, having got itself into a terrible mess in its housing, overpressed by the burden that is laid on it, has to come to the Ministry and ask for assistance.<br/>
We are discussing, as we were discussing on the previous Amendment, the conditions upon which the Minister is prepared to consider such a request. One of the conditions&#x2014;the one with which my Amendment deals&#x2014;is that, first of all, one must be satisfied that there are no private enterprise builders who might succeed in making a few pickings for themselves before the council steps in. Secondly, one must be satisfied that there will not be a crippling rate burden falling on the authority. Thirdly, one has to decide, not that the particular houses which the authority wants to build cannot be built at reasonable rents, but that if the rents for those and all the other houses in the possession of the local authority are raised to the full and get the full results from rent increases even then the housing revenue account cannot be balanced under reasonable conditions. Only then can an authority go to the Minister and chance its arm by asking for an extra subsidy. That is the background to this Clause, which has been quoted so optimistically and rather innocently by some hon. Members on both sides of the Committee from time to time. Those are, in fact, the harsh terms of this Clause.<br/>
I am not making a speech against the pooling of housing rents. As a matter of policy, carried out by a housing authority after due consideration and after careful examination of its position, I think that in many cases there is a great deal to be said for some degree of pooling rents. I think that is part of a prudent housing policy for most councils. I am not at all quarrelling with the idea that a council, if it wants to do so, as part of its policy, ought to consider whether some of the costs can be spread over all its housing.<br/>
That, however, is quite a different matter. In fact, people who believe, as I do, that there is something in that, and who have spent a certain amount of time trying to persuade their friends that there


is something in it, are the very people who are likely to be most indignant at this principle now being used as part and parcel of a savage slash on Government participation in housing, which is what this Bill is.<br/>
This is not a matter of a council which, after having received adequate support from the Exchequer, as it has been receiving in the last ten years, finds that in those conditions it cannot make a go of things. Here we are considering quite a different situation. Here is a position in which a council which, for all its new house building for general purposes, is not to get any Exchequer subsidy in a year or two's time and even now is only going to get a miserable subsidy. Therefore, not only is such a local authority, which by definition is a poor one, to have its subsidy cut, but it is also to be faced with the enormous rise in the rates of interest, which is quite an arbitrary act on the part of the Government.<br/>
There is no obligation about it. It is only part of a calculated policy of the Government to back out of partnership with the local authority in building up the local authority's social services. The Government have performed these two arbitrary acts of sabotage of local authority housing, and have held the knife which has caused the damage to these councils which, as I say, are poor ones, the ones with the heaviest load of poor people, with the lowest rateable value, the lowest amount of good-class residential property, the least commercial development, with all the difficulties of a struggling industrial town and with a background of poverty. That is the kind of local authority which is going to be affected by this provision.<br/>
8.0 p.m.<br/>
It will not be the City of Westminster which will ask for assistance but the very poor industrial authority which for many years has struggled to maintain its services and to fulfil its housing obligations and which now will be defeated solely because of the Government's arbitrary act. It will not be defeated merely in the sense that it will be unable to carry out some luxury frill building&#x2014;which is what the right hon. Gentleman and the Parliamentary Secretary seem to imply when they are discussing these matters. They brush aside housing for general needs

as if it were not important and as if there was no need to worry about it.<br/>
In fact, housing without subsidy, as has been made perfectly clear, will include all future housing provision for old people and all future housing provision to deal with overcrowding&#x2014;two problems most likely to hit those poor industrial towns to which I have referred. For instance, we have the kind of authority which has the worst problem to face, the biggest burden of old people requiring assistance with accommodation and the biggest need for subsidy housing. I can almost hear the Parliamentary Secretary saying, "They have some slums. Why should they not clear those? They need not bother about the old people."<br/>
Many housing authorities with some sense of social service will not feel that way about housing the old people. They will try to tackle the problem even if the Government wash their hands of responbility for it and will not share the burden. Those are the authorities with the minimum of resources and the maximum of responsibilities. Yet they have to come cap in hand for a means test in order to try to get what has been described as an additional subsidy. In fact, it is not an additional subsidy; it it not some sort of luxury frill. It is what the Government ought to be paying in any event if they were fulfilling their obligations and sharing the joint undertaking of local authority services.<br/>
Before such authorities can receive this subsidy they have to show that they have spread the cost of the Government's financial policy and subsidy policy throughout the range of all houses they possess, whenever they were built, whatever the cost at which they were built and whatever the subsidy they may have enjoyed when they were built.</p>

<p>We are not considering the question of expediency or what is judicious policy in one area or in another, as decided by the elected representatives. This is a case of the Government forcing this provision upon a local authority, whether the local authority likes it or not.<br/>
In any case, is there a very strong case in principle for saying to a local authority, "If we go on building houses for old people it will put a heavy burden on


somebody"? The reason for that heavy burden is that the Government have backed out and will not help. Is there such an irrefutable case in principle for saying that the burden ought to be put on the tenants of old council houses rather than on the general taxpayer? I cannot see that there is.<br/>
Such a tenant may have taken a house perhaps twenty or thirty years ago at what was then the current rent for the house. He enjoyed what was the subsidy approved at that time by Parliament. It is one thing to say that he ought to pay for the increased cost of the repairs to his own house but quite a different thing to say that he ought to bear on his rent, as well as on his rates&#x2014;for they will go up, too&#x2014;the cost of 1957 housing of old people. I cannot see why the existing tenant should bear that cost any more than the general taxpayer.<br/>
I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will not start arguing about whether or not it is a good housing management arrangement to try to pool rents. That is a matter of prudence which can reasonably be left to the local council. We are looking at the compulsion being placed on those unfortunate authorities who are in such a crippled condition that they have to come to the central Government to ask for some help.<br/>
After all, why stop there? I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman has not thought of having a walk round the town hall to see that there is no extravagance. He might say, "You have the mayor's chain. You can pawn that to help. We want to make certain that there is no excessive furniture in the town clerk's office before we are prepared to give you a grant." Why not hand over the town hall to be run as a gambling saloon to meet some of the costs? Why stop at the tenants? Why pin the responsibility upon them for bearing this cost?<br/>
I invite the Committee to say that in this sphere, more perhaps than in any other, they cannot accept the Government's policy, because the Government are using the weapon of poverty and need to force their policy on to reluctant local authorities. This is a case in which, more than in any other, it is wrong to insist upon the pooling of rents. I hope that the Committee will support the Amendment.</p>

<p>I should like to support my hon. Friend the Member for Widnes (Mr. MacColl) in his Amendment.<br/>
I can carry my mind back a few years to when we sat on the Government Benches and when at local authority election time Conservatives throughout the country condemned us for imposing controls and interfering with local authorities in the execution of their duties. Yet the provision in this Clause is a deliberate interference with the function of local authorities.<br/>
By what right does the Minister claim to dictate to local authorities the rent they should charge their tenants? By what act of justice can he claim to hold this threat in his hand that unless local authorities charge the rent he dictates they shall not receive the benefits of the Clause? This is a detestable principle which he is introducing into the Bill.<br/>
We on this side of the Committee believe that local authorities should be left to administer their housing and rental schemes in the way they think fit and proper. Some authorities have introduced pooling arrangements, some have differential rent schemes, some have rent rebate schemes and some have no need of them because there are alternative methods of dealing with the question. The right hon. Gentleman is imposing from Whitehall a means test on every tenant of every local authority in the country. In order to carry out the provision of this part of the Clause local authorities are forced to adopt such a policy.<br/>
Council tenants have been maligned a lot by hon. Members opposite, who very often denounce them. We hear much talk about Rolls Royces and television aerials outside the dwellings of council tenants. What the right hon. Gentleman and hon. Members opposite do not realise is that many of those council tenants have already paid a very substantial part of the cost of the houses in which they live.<br/>
When we talk about pre-war council tenants being low rented, which is not true as a general rule throughout the country


&#x2014;it may be true of some parts but not of others&#x2014;it should not be forgotten that many of them have already paid a substantial part of the cost of the house. That being so, by what right does the Minister impose upon them the burden of paying 1956 rents which are inflated because of the failure of the Government policy, which has sent up the cost of living and the general cost of housing construction? By what right does he impose that burden on people who in many instances have paid more than half, probably 75 per cent., of the cost of the council house in which they now live?<br/>
We are proposing to leave some words out of this part of the Clause. The effect would be to leave with the local government responsibility for arranging its own rents in the way best suited to its own purposes. I do not see why the right hon. Gentleman should claim to interfere in matters of this kind. We have to take conditions&#x2014;building costs and the cost of living&#x2014;as we find them in 1956. In my constituency and most parts of London the economic rent of a three-bedroomed flat in a six storey building is likely to be &#x00A3;3 15s. a week. By what right are we to ask pre-war tenants to pay a substantial part of the current rent of that flat?<br/>
There may be some people who have to be rehoused who can afford to pay such a rent, but others may not. The local authority has ways and means of adjusting that of its own accord. The right hon. Gentleman is quite wrong in basing his decision whether or not he will provide additional assistance upon rental standards. Other factors must be taken into consideration. These very vague words which refer to an "unreasonably heavy rate burden" represent factors which should not be tied to a system of council rentals.<br/>
8.15 p.m.<br/>
It is quite wrong to lay down as the principal basis upon which the Minister will make his judgment the level of rents of council dwellings. I think it quite wrong for him to interfere and dictate to councils throughout the country what rents their tenants should pay. He should have some general regard to the rate burden in the area and certainly some regard to the rate fund contribution and the housing revenue account. He should

also have regard to the cost of new housing construction.<br/>
He should leave entirely to the local authority the administration of its system of rentals. As he has said on many occasions, this subsidy is to be given to local authorities&#x2014;so long as it lasts, of course &#x2014;and they may use it and dispose of it to the best advantage. In this Clause he goes much further than that. He is laying down that, unless it charges its tenants a rent which he thinks they ought to pay, the authority will not get this additional subsidy irrespective of what the rate burden is and irrespective of other factors. That is an unwarrantable interference in the domestic affairs of council tenants. It is an interference in the activities of local authorities. The Minister should have far more confidence in them. He should allow them to have responsibility for the administration of their rental systems and not hold this threat over their heads that they must carry out his dictates before they can hope to get financial assistance.</p>

<p>The reference in Clause 5 to unreasonably high rents being one of the factors the Minister is to take into account before he considers giving an increased subsidy raises an entirely new point in housing legislation. I do not see how the Ministry will be able to operate this provision.<br/>
Who is to determine what is an unreasonably high rent, and how is that to be determined. On what basis is the amount of rent to be calculated? Is it to be a fanciful thing such as we read about in the <i>Daily Mail</i> a week or two ago when it was suggested that thousands of council tenants had incomes of &#x00A3;20, &#x00A3;30, or more a week? I represent a London constituency and I have not yet found a London family with an income of that amount living in a municipal flat. What I do know is that the returns for Income Tax purposes published in the Government's Blue Book on Income and Expenditure show that in 1954&#x2014;the last available figures&#x2014;there were more than 18 million workers whose incomes after tax had been deducted were much less than &#x00A3;10 a week.<br/>
Some of us know the level to which rents have already gone. Even in London, in some of the boroughs, rents are being charged equivalent to, and even more than, 25 per cent. of the tenant's income.


All or us to whom people come in our "weekly surgeries" have experience of complaints by tenants of very high rents which are absorbing such a large proportion of the family income that clothes are being worn out and the tenants find it impossible to replace them. They do not even get enough food&#x2014;which is not surprising in view of the way food prices have been allowed to rise since this Government came into power and the tremendous drop in the value of the &#x00A3;. People are complaining about that kind of thing.<br/>
I will give one illustration. A poor woman who came to see me four weeks ago complained that she was being charged &#x00A3;2 9s. 8d. a week for a two-bedroomed flat. Her husband's wages were &#x00A3;8 a week as a labourer in the electric power industry in London. That, I understand, is the correct trade union minimum rate. The woman had two young children and there was no other income in the family. She and her children were undoubtedly suffering severely because of the struggle to try to make ends meet on a wage of that kind with that amount of rent to be paid. She told me that she would have to get work to enable the family to meet some of its financial troubles. I am sure that her case is typical of what is happening all over the country. Therefore, one has to look very carefully at a suggestion that the Minister or his officers should have power to decide what is an unreasonable rent.<br/>
What is an unreasonable rent in London? I think that 50s. a week is an unreasonable rent for a two-bed-roomed flat in London. It is vastly out of proportion to the pre-war rent for a flat of that kind, even adding to the pre-war rent the 8 per cent. which local authorities and landlords can add for the capital cost of improvement. Is that the kind of figure which is to be used in London? Many rents are much higher than that.<br/>
The councils which are trying to do their job in a humane way are fixing their rents at a much lower level. I read a report by the county council a week or two ago which shows that it is increasing its rents this year. Even so, they work out at about one-tenth of the average wage in London, which, according to the

Ministry of Labour Gazette of a few weeks ago, is at present &#x00A3;10 17s. a week. I should add that they are net rents. Ten per cent. of that figure is roughly the average rent of county council flats in London. How high above that do we go before the rent becomes unreasonable? Are we to adopt a figure which the local authority itself says is unfair?<br/>
It seems to me, therefore, that this is an unworkable part of the Bill&#x2014;unless the Minister intends never to give any additional subsidies, which is rather what I suspect all through the Bill. Any attempt to operate its provisions is bound to create difficulty in application and enormous troubles with the local authorities. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Acton (Mr. Sparks) that this could be an unreasonable interference with the long-prescribed right of local authorities to fix their own rents. I have heard it said many times in the House of Commons that the fixing of rents for municipal properties is entirely the responsibility of local authorities. That is where the responsibility should lie. If rents are too low, there might be difficulty about balancing the housing accounts. I admit that troubles have arisen. Even the wealthy London County Council still has to have a fairly considerable additional subsidy to keep its rents at their present level, and other councils are similarly placed.<br/>
If a Conservative council does not want to make any subscription from the rates, rents are pushed up to a figure which, on present-day earnings, is utterly impossible for the tenants to bear and is the cause of the tremendous discontent which exists, not only in London, but in all the large towns where this kind of policy has been pursued.<br/>
Any attempt by the Minister to operate this procedure in the calculation of additional subsidies is bound to be unworkable. He would be well advised to accept the Amendment to enable himself to operate the Bill, which is difficult enough to work in any case, a little more easily than otherwise would be the case. On practical, humanitarian grounds, rents ought not to be more than about 10 per cent. of a man's weekly earnings. I feel, therefore, that the Clause gives to the Minister a power which he ought not to have and which should be left in the hands of local authorities.</p>

<p>I hope that the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary appreciate how we read the two words which we seek to delete from the Clause. I hope the right hon. Gentleman appreciates the implication that we attach to them. To a local authority which gets into difficulty with its building for general need, which finds itself in difficulty with an overburdened rate fund and with rents rising because of the loss of subsidy, these words seem to us on this side to say, "You need not apply for the additional subsidy unless you are operating a differential rents scheme."<br/>
The Minister has written into the Clause the condition that hard-pressed local authorities need make no application for special consideration and for the additional subsidy unless they have first begun to operate some form of differential rents scheme. That is the implication that we attach to these two words. I should like the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary to say whether we are right or wrong.<br/>
8.30 p.m.<br/>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Wigan (Mr. MacColl) said in introducing the Amendment, this is the only place in the Bill where the Minister has dared to bring in his pet theory of differential rent. Intellectually, he has based his whole case for the reduction of subsidies upon the theory that by spreading the burden, the increase need not amount to more than 8d. a week. His case for the reduction and, finally, for the abolition of the basic subsidy has been built upon this theory of spreading the increased rents, by means of a form of differential rent, over the whole of the property owned by the local authority. This is the first as it is also the last place in the Bill at which the Minister seeks to bring into the Bill this idea of his&#x2014;and it is only an idea, a theory: it has yet to be tested in practice.<br/>
It seems to me that these words are quite unnecessary, even for the Minister's own purposes. He has full discretion to consider every application for additional subsidy. He can consider all the facts of the local conditions; he can go into each case fully, and, unfettered, he can make his decision on each case on the facts of each case. Therefore, there is no reason why the Minister should have inserted into the Clause his own pet theory of the differential rent. He can

have his way. He can help where he thinks his help is needed. He can refuse additional subsidy where he thinks refusal justified. He can use his discretion, completely unfettered, even without these words. I think he would be wise to rely on his judgment of the facts of each case, and to delete this almost impudent insertion of his pet theory into this Clause.</p>

<p>The Clause describes exactly the conditions under which we in country districts labour. I speak particularly about my own county. The Clause describes the conditions of the local authorities there, where there is a great need, an "urgent need"&#x2014;those are the words of the Clause&#x2014;for more houses.<br/>
The costs of building are abnormally high in such districts. They are high because the distances are great to the centres where the materials can be obtained. They are high also because the number of builders is very few and competition is very limited. The rates are abnormally high. I have often mentioned them in this Chamber. There are one or two localities which occupy the unenviable position every year of being the highest rated in the country. That is the position. The provision of accommodation has to be left to the local authorities.<br/>
Why, therefore, are these words necessary? What will happen now? Local authorities will be anxious to provide the accommodation A local authority will say, "The costs will be so much. Our rents here are already too high for the incomes in this rural area. The rates are already abnormally high. Now we must apply to the Minister." What answer will the Minister give, in view of these words? I should have thought that the answer given by the Member for Islington, Southwest (Mr. A. Evans) was right. The Minister has complete discretion whether to give this additional help or to withhold it. What advantage will there be in putting in this additional condition which local authorities must face before they apply? What further protection is there, therefore, for the Treasury or for the Minister?<br/>
I should have thought that this wording was an unnecessary discouragement to the local authorities, who already find themselves in very great difficulties. What


they need at present is encouragement, and I was hoping that this Clause would be the very one to give encouragement to the local authorities in all the rural districts, to the local authorities which are already suffering so much and which are so anxious to provide the accommodation which is needed. If it is not provided&#x2014;and this is another matter I have had to mention here before, and more than once&#x2014;my people, failing to get accommodation, will have to seek their homes and their livelihood elsewhere, although they prefer to remain in the land of their birth.</p>

<p>I am discussing it in relation to this subsection, and I think, Sir Rhys, that in a moment or two you will see how it applies.<br/>
Local authorities throughout the length and breadth of the country are faced&#x2014;I know very few, if any, which are not&#x2014; with the difficulty of providing housing accommodation, and the rates are, consequently, being heavily affected already. Every housing authority is faced with the urgent need for more housing accommodation. Why place a local authority in the position in which it will be impossible for that authority to deal with the situation at all?<br/>
We are asking in this subsection that unreasonably high rents for that and other housing accommodation shall be taken into consideration. Is not the Minister already aware that local authorities have almost come to the limit of what can be charged for the housing accommodation which already exists? In my own constituency, the problem is an extremely serious one. The chairman of the housing committee has described already the amount that is to be put on the tenant as being "a bitter blow." Eleven thousand people are waiting for housing accommodation. Rents have had to be increased by as much as 6s. 6d. a week, and the rents of pre-war houses have been increased.<br/>
I am afraid that the Minister does not understand that it is not only the rent of

the house that is important. There is also the fact that the cost of living in other respects has gone up to such an extent that the local authorities cannot and must not be encouraged to make it impossible for a person to have a home as well. That is precisely what this subsection is asking us to do. It is asking the Committee to accept a position, without the Amendment, in which a local authority has to pool the whole of its housing and further increase the rates, although they have reached the straining point, before the Minister will grant permission for the additional subsidy to be paid.<br/>
That is a very disheartening thing for local authorities, as I know from knowledge of my own constituency. In Leicester, I am quite convinced that the council has done its best to keep rents down. The Government, in consequence of their policy, have forced rents up and up. The result is that people in parts of the town are considerably agitated already about the amount of rent which they have to pay in consequence of the action of the Government. I am certain that there will be further agitation when they know that if an allowance is to be made in a particular district in respect of the subsidy it will have to be paid not only by the people for whom houses are being built but also by the rest of the inhabitants of that town.<br/>
Attempts have been made for years to keep the rents at the lowest possible level, not to raise rents as is intended by the provisions of this Bill, and not to put everything in a pool for the purpose of raising rents. On the contrary, until the coming of the present Government everybody realised that it was essential to keep rents low so that people should have a roof over their heads and, in addition, be able to keep their families in reasonable surroundings. This provision in the Clause means that those with fixed incomes and those who are aged will have their rents increased. People who have budgeted for their family needs must now pay additional rents following upon this pooling idea.<br/>
The Government should think again about this matter. Not only are they interfering with the duties of local authorities, many of whom take those duties extremely seriously, but they are also setting an example to authorities to increase their rents beyond the paying


capacity of the tenants. "High" in itself indicates that the rent is rather heavy, but what do the Government mean by "unreasonably high"? The Government have no right at all to interfere. The country will strongly resent this action. It will still resent it, but will resent it less if the Amendment is carried.</p>

<p>This was a difficult Amendment for the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. MacColl) to propose to the Committee, for the hon. Member is a well-known proponent of the principle of pooling subsidies in their application to the rents of local authority houses. That point of view, however, has long ceased to be heterodox. Today, there can hardly be any local authority in the country which applies the subsidy it receives specifically to the house or groups of houses in respect of which the subsidy is being paid. Most authorities, under varying schemes and methods, pool the subsidies they receive over their existing stocks of houses.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman, of course, has much more information about this than other people can have. Does that apply to the rural authorities in the same way?

<p>They went up because they were being used, in part at any rate, to meet the deficiencies arising on the postwar construction. They are deficiencies in the housing revenue account. That is a typical example of what most major housing authorities experience. Pooling

of subsidies in one form or another is already a generally accepted practice.</p>

<p>If the hon. and learned Gentleman will let me continue I shall come to that point.<br/>
Then, ask the hon. Member for Widnes and his hon. Friends, what about the situation of the local housing authority which, even if it pooled its subsidies, would still find itself in the position either of incurring an unreasonably heavy burden on the rates or of having to charge unreasonably high rents? May I at this point interpose that I do not think there is anything sinister about the expression "unreasonably high" in that collocation. I think the reason for the expression is that a rent could be unreasonable in two directions and that for legal exactitude it was the height of the rent that had to be specified as being unreasonable. It is purely a matter of terminology.<br/>
Although one would hardly believe it from the debate, this Clause is designed to meet the position of those local housing authorities about which the hon. Member for Widnes asked. The right hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Montgomery (Mr. C. Davies) cited his own county, but many of the local authorities in that area are precisely of the type which it is envisaged the Clause might cover. Obviously I cannot express it more definitely than that, because it must depend upon the calculations which follow from the actual schemes put forward to my right hon. Friend. Yet it is that type of case which it is envisaged will fall to be dealt with under the Clause.<br/>
Now follows the question, "What is the interpretation of the crucial qualifying words 'unreasonable in respect of rate burden and unreasonable in respect to the height of the rents'?" No one can quantify exactly&#x2014;I had to get that word in somehow&#x2014;a discretionary expression such as this is intended to be, and must be if the Clause is to leave a discretion to the Minister to deal with the great variety of cases. I would suggest to the Committee, however, that the natural interpretation of an unreasonably heavy rate burden and unreasonably high rents is one which is unreasonably heavy or high in comparison with rate burdens or rents in other reasonably comparable local authority areas. That is the natural


manner of interpreting an unreasonably heavy rate burden or an unreasonably high rent. Naturally the Minister will look at the general level of rents being charged in other local authority areas comparable in character with the one in question, and to the rate burden in comparable areas. It would seem to me to be the natural interpretation of those words that they should rest upon such a comparison.<br/>
Much has been said about this Clause importing a means test. It does nothing of the sort for the individual tenant. There is an essential distinction between pooling of rents and the application of a differential or rent rebate scheme. One can pool rents and still have flat rate rents. A differential or rent rebate scheme is only one form of the pooling of rents, although I must say that when the hon. Gentleman the Member for Clapham (Mr. Gibson) referred to some of the rents charged by the London County Council&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>I see. Certainly there are cases where the level of rents being charged by local authorities who do not apply a differential rents scheme gives rise to the reflection whether they would not be well advised to consider adopting one. However, that is not implicit in the Clause; it is not implicit in the words which it is proposed to delete. The only implication is that the subsidies received by a local authority will be pooled over the whole area of the houses which it owns.</p>

<p>I understood the hon. Gentleman to say that the Clause does not refer to differential rents schemes as distinct from the pooling of rents. May I take it from that that the existence or non-existence of a differential rents scheme will be left to the individual local authority and not considered as a relevant circumstance when the Minister exercises his discretion under the Clause?</p>

<p>What I am saying is that there is nothing in the application of the subsidies received over the whole stock of houses belonging to a local authority which enforces upon that authority the adoption of a differential rents scheme, a

rent rebate scheme or any other form of the pooling of rents. However, there is, of course, a means test in the sense in which the hon. Member for Widnes used the term, implicit in the Clause. It is the provision that the local authority concerned must show cause to the Minister, and the Minister must be satisfied that there is an unreasonably heavy rate burden or unreasonably high rents involved in the contemplated housing operations. That is nothing new to our housing legislation.</p>

<p>I am very sorry to press the hon. Gentleman, but he did not answer my question. Perhaps we are getting to the extreme limits of the Amendment. Is it or is it not the case that a differential rents scheme will be considered as a relevant circumstance by the Minister when exercising his discretion under the Clause?</p>

<p>The Minister has obviously to take everything into account, but the effect of the words:
<q>&#x2026;for that and other housing accommodation &#x2026;</q>
leaves the matter entirely open. That has to be looked at in the light of the circumstances of the individual authority.<br/>
Reverting to the question of the means test in the sense of the local authority which is making the application coming to the Minister, as the hon. Member for Widnes said, "cap in hand," local housing authorities have at any rate since 1946 been invited to come "cap in hand" to the Minister in order to earn the standard amount of Exchequer contribution under Section 3 of the 1946 Act. The Minister has in that case to be satisfied that the provision of the house in respect of which the application is made would impose an undue burden on the district, and then, if the Minister thinks fit so to determine, the standard amount of the annual Exchequer contribution shall be the special standard amount. Therefore, under the legislation introduced by the Labour Party, local housing authorities which claimed special treatment had to go "cap in hand"&#x2014;if the hon. Member for Widnes must have it that way&#x2014;to the Minister to show that there were special circumstances obtaining in their area. The discretion remained then, as it will remain now, with the judgment of the Minister.</p>

<p>I was perfectly well aware of that, and was also well aware that the hon. Gentleman would make that point. The distinction that I drew was that in the case of the 1946 Act the Treasury were already paying a full general subsidy on all houses and, therefore, it was only in respect of the excess that an application became necessary. Also, the specific terms relating to the amount of rent increase were laid down in the Act and were not left to the discretion of the Minister.</p>

<p>Oh, no. The hon. Member is confusing it with Section 7 of the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1946. The word "undue" in "undue burden" was in the discretion of the Minister, just as "unreasonably heavy rate burden" is in the discretion of the Minister in this Clause. The two are on all fours.</p>

<p>That imported a restriction which is not present in the Clause we are considering. The Minister could not give the special standard amount under the 1946 Act, even though he was satisfied that there was an undue rate burden, unless the rents in that area were below the average for comparable authorities. So I do not think that is an advantage on the side of the 1946 Act, if that is the paragraph to which the hon. Member for Widnes is referring.<br/>
In view of the fact that the pooling of rents&#x2014;which is recommended by many Members opposite and which in one form or another is the general practice among local authorities&#x2014;is implicit in the words which are under discussion, it would be unreasonable for any local authority to qualify under the Clause, simply by taking account of the finances of the new houses. Most authorities do not do that at the present time, because they spread the burden over the existing stock. I suggest that the Committee resist the omission of those two words.</p>

<p>The Parliamentary Secretary has been more hard put to it on this Amendment than on many others. He is a most knowledgeable person, and he knows the value of words and he knows the legislation. Deliberately to apply to his context the phrase that we on this side of the Committee are in favour of the pooling of subsidies was very misleading. Of course we are in favour of the pooling of subsidies. In the inter-war years we fought Tory Government after Tory Government to get it. With varying rates of subsidy and varying rates of interest we had varying rents for similar accommodation and we had to keep separate housing revenue accounts for each housing scheme.<br/>
9.0 p.m.<br/>
Local authorities got into an unholy mess, and we had to press successive Tory Governments to permit pooling. Ever since the Housing Act, 1936, housing subsidies have been pooled. Where the Minister deliberately goes wrong is that this is not pooling, but excluding subsidies, for there is no subsidy to give. It is true that we now have the &#x00A3;10 subsidy, but later there is to be no subsidy.<br/>
The Minister is saying that what we ought to do, because the Tory Government are taking away the subsidies, is to spread the lack of subsidy over previous housing schemes so that existing tenants should pay the subsidies which properly should be paid by the Treasury. That is not pooling. If I were in other circumstances I could call it something else. They have a name for it in the Army.<br/>
Let us look at what we are doing. This Clause shows how the Tory Party are prepared to use even the housing of the people for purely party political purposes and to be as ruthless as they can, after they have secured power, which they use for the benefit of their friends. During the time of the Labour Government, subsidies were &#x00A3;16 10s. from the Government and &#x00A3;5 10s. from the local authority rates. Interest was at 2&#x00BD; to 3 per cent. That was a reasonable subsidy from the centre, a reasonable rate contribution and a reasonable rate of interest. Local authorities were then able to build good houses at reasonable rents.</p>

<p>I am keeping to the Amendment, Sir Rhys.<br/>
We are asked, in the Clause, to spread part of the increased subsidy over the tenants of houses that are not yet built. The increased rate of interest meant an increase in the rent of future council houses of 4s. 6d. per week. The Tory Party had only a majority of 20 in the House of Commons so, purely for party political purposes, because they knew that if rents were up by 4s. 6d. a week there would be trouble, they increased the subsidies to &#x00A3;26 14s. and &#x00A3;8 18s., making a total of &#x00A3;35 12s., to keep the rents level. Since that time rates of interest have risen five times in just over twelve months from 4 per cent. to 5&#x00BC; per cent.<br/>
I put this point to the Parliamentary Secretary. If subsidies of &#x00A3;26 14s. from the centre and &#x00A3;8 18s. from the local rates were justifiable when his party had only a majority in the House of Commons of 20, and the rate of interest was 4 per cent., why is the subsidy being withdrawn now and the increased subsidy which was given by the Tory Party at that time to meet the increased cost of interest rates being spread over houses which are to be</p>

<p>There is no question of spreading. This is placing on houses that have already been built a charge over and above the normal charge in respect of houses yet to be built. [HON. MEMBERS: "Answer."] The Government have no answer.</p>

<p>I will give way if the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister can show the justification for spreading part of the increased subsidy given on houses built after 1945 over houses built prior to that date in order to deal with houses which are to be built with less subsidy and at 5&#x00BD; per cent.</p>

<p>In this Amendment we are asking, instead of what the Govern-wants, which is to spread the lack of subsidy and the increased cost of housing arising from the increased interest charges and the withdrawal of the subsidies, over past building, that the determining factor shall be the rent required of a scheme under construction at the time. We consider that that is justifiable.<br/>
There is very little justification for saying that, because the Tory party has deliberately increased housing costs and interest charges, houses built in 1922, 1923 and 1924 should bear increased rents to assist in respect of the rents of houses built in 1956 and 1957. We say that the scheme being undertaken at the time should be the determining factor as to whether the rent is reasonable or unreasonable, and unless we can get a better explanation than we have so far received I must advise my right hon. and hon. Friends to divide.</p>

<p>In this Clause the Minister seeks authority to increase subsidies in certain specified cases, and then seems to place restrictions on his authority which make the practical effect of the Clause almost meaningless. The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the need and desirability of pooling rents between the

low-cost houses and the high-cost houses, but the Government then exclude from consideration for a special additional subsidy a class of house which cannot possibly be pooled&#x2014;the house in an overspill housing scheme.<br/>
If that is not the explanation, I wonder why the Minister seeks to exclude the three categories of houses mentioned in Clause 3. If the Minister seriously wishes to grapple with the housing problem of our great conurbations and, at the same time, help to meet the pressing need of our vital basic industries, he should afford the maximum help to the houses which come within categories mentioned in paragraphs (<i>c</i>, (<i>d</i>) and (<i>e</i>) of Clause 3.<br/>
This problem is vital to cities like London, Manchester, Salford, Liverpool and Birmingham and to all our great congested industrial areas. Tonight, however, I want to pinpoint the problem of houses in category (<i>c</i>) of Clause 3, because this reveals a problem arising from overspill development. I have in my constituency a high successful overspill development&#x2014; the Worsley Town Development Scheme which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Salford, West (Mr. Royle) mentioned earlier this afternoon, was the pioneer effort which led to the introduction of the Town Development Act. This overspill scheme in Worsley, which is an important part of my important constituency, is an excellent example&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>&#x2014;of co-operation between a county borough, a county council and an urban district council. This scheme, which was a pioneer scheme, has been highly successful up to the present. It was a scheme in which the predecessors of the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary took a very great interest. They were looking forward to its completion. Ultimately, the scheme was to consist of 4,500 houses. The standard of the houses built there and the layout of the estate, were highly commendable, but the scheme is now jeopardised by the Bill. There are already grumbles from the tenants about high rents. That is understandable because, as I and the Parliamentary Secretary indicated earlier, in these overspill schemes&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>I am coming to that point, Sir Rhys.<br/>
In my submission, under paragraph (<i>c</i>) these houses should qualify for the discretion of the Minister to give subsidies over and above the &#x00A3;24 provided. Since March, 1955, higher interest rates and reduced subsidy have heightened the problem of higher rents to such an extent as to jeopardise the success of the scheme.<br/>
I want to quote not my own authority, but the authority and statement of Councillor J. Pennington, Chairman of the Worsley Town Development Joint Management Committee, a very responsible and able local government administrator, who recently said:
<q>At a recent meeting of the Worsley Town Development Joint Management Committee strong protests were made against the increased rates of interest now payable by local authorities and fears were expressed that increasing rents arising from the increased interest charges and the reduced subsidy from 1st April last would make it impossible for Salford families in urgent need of housing accommodation to accept houses in Worsley.</q>
It is quite obvious that if rents rise to such a level families from Salford, the exporting authority, cannot accept tenancy of these houses and the whole scheme will fail. The town development scheme will stop. In addition, they are faced with added expense in travelling from their new homes in Worsley to Salford, where most of their jobs still are and are likely to be for some time because industrial development has not yet kept pace with the speed of housing development.<br/>
The treasurer of the Worsley Joint Committee estimates that as a result of increased interest rates and the new subsidy proposals the cost of each new house now building or to be built will be increased by 9s. a week over the cost of houses built up to 31st March, 1955. That of itself is an indication of why this kind of house should come within the provisions of the Minister's discretion in Clause 5 to help towards increased subsidy to lower excessively high rents. This jump in revenue cost of houses building and to be built since March, 1955, will increase the average rents of the whole of the houses in the scheme by 2s. a week in the first year, 1s. 2d. a week in the second year, and smaller amounts in the following years. The smaller amounts result from the fact that as the number of houses completed grows in proportion to the number of houses built in each year, the burden of the higher rent charges will be on a diminishing scale.<br/>
Another important factor is that the increased rents of the overspill houses have the effect of widening still further the gap between rents of overspill houses and rents of comparable houses administered and owned in the ordinary housing scheme of the Worsley Urban District


Council. This quick, serious increase in already high rents jeopardises the success of this so far highly successful scheme and its continuing expansion. As was pointed out by the chairman of the committee whom I have quoted, there will be great difficulty in obtaining Salford tenants at these very high rents; and as I have already indicated, additional travelling expenses will be involved for those who reside so far from their employment.<br/>
The increase in overspill rents will largely take place in the next five years. After the completion of the scheme in from seven to ten years' time, assuming that it does go forward, other rents generally will probably tend to climb nearer to the rent level of the overspill scheme houses. It might well be asked why the Urban District Council of Worsley does not pool the whole of its house rents. Worsley has played the part of the Good Samaritan, it has welcomed these worthy citizens of Salford into its own ranks, but I think it would be asking rather too much of the Worsley council house tenant to bear increased rents to lower the rents of the Salford citizens who come into the town. That would be more than reasonable to expect of the citizens of Worsley, generous though they are.<br/>
Even if that were done, it would not solve this very pressing problem. Worsley Urban District Council has only 1,200 pre-war low-cost houses. When the overspill scheme is completed, there will be 4,500 houses in the scheme by 1962. By that year, in addition to the overspill scheme, Worsley Council hopes to have 2,000 post-war houses. Thus, the system of all-inclusive pooling would give the ratio of 1,200 low-cost houses to 6,000 or 7,000 high-cost houses. The only effect, therefore, of all-inclusive pooling would be excessively to increase the rents of the Worsley council house tenants for an infinitesimal reduction in the level of rent of the Salford overspill scheme. Therefore, that is not a practical solution.<br/>
Where this relatively high concentration of high-cost houses occurs, it presents a particular problem, which should call for the Minister's discretion in increasing the subsidy above the &#x00A3;24 level. These overspill house rents are not only high actually: they are high relatively in relation to the other houses in the area. That, of course, is a cause of some friction, but

this disparity between the level of rents of the Worsley Urban District Council's houses and the level of rents of the houses for the overspill population will tend to diminish after seven or ten years' time.<br/>
9.30 p.m.<br/>
Therefore, while this case is not peculiar to Worsley alone, for there are other similar cases elsewhere in the country, I believe that it is a crystal clear case that calls for the Minister's discretionary powers, if he has any intention at all of using it, and I ask the Minister seriously to consider increasing the subsidy beyond the &#x00A3;24 limit. He could do it on a year by year basis, review it year by year&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>If the Government are serious in their desire to concentrate on the main housing problems, if the Government are serious in their claims to develop housing where it is most urgently needed, and if the Minister is serious in his claim that he is redirecting the housing drive into the most socially useful channels, then here is an opportunity for the Minister to vindicate himself by extending his discretion to the paragraph (<i>c</i>) category of houses.<br/>
If, on the other hand, he adheres to the strict limitations imposed by this Clause, one will not be unreasonable in assuming that the Government's main purpose is to cut back seriously the rate of house building, for let them make no mistake about it, the effect of the Bill and of the Government's policy of high interest rates will be to slow down, if not to stop one of the most successful and socially useful rehousing schemes we have seen in the post-war period. I hope the Minister will reconsider the Clause and agree to introduce some measure of generous flexibility which would guarantee the continuing success of this and other commendable and socially useful schemes.</p>

<p>I am sure the Committee appreciates the sincerity and the eloquence with which the case of Farnworth and thereabouts has been put by my hon. Friend the Member for Farnworth (Mr. Thornton). It was a case relating, as he put it, to Clause 3 (3, <i>c</i>) and, of course, the Amendment is a little wider. One presumes that the Minister


has not put the exception of dwellings dealt with in paragraphs (<i>c</i>), (<i>d</i>) and (<i>e</i>) in the Bill here unless it is necessary; that is to say, unless there are cases in which (<i>c</i>), (<i>d</i>) or (<i>e</i>) houses, but for this exception, might be the subject of his discretion under this Clause.<br/>
We on this side of the Committee are perfectly well aware that the (<i>c</i>, (<i>d</i>) or (<i>e</i>) houses would not have their subsidies cut, would attract a higher subsidy than the general needs subsidy; but, on the other hand, the Minister's discretion under this Clause goes up, in the case of a dwelling other than a flat, to &#x00A3;30, and the (<i>c,</i>) (<i>d</i>) and (<i>e</i>) figure is &#x00A3;24. What we are discussing, therefore, is whether there is any good reason why the Minister should be precluded from giving an extra &#x00A3;6 in the cases of the houses covered by those three paragraphs. I am not going to deal with this point at great length because, as I say, clearly the Minister would not have put in the words unless there were houses to which he could apply this additional remedy, if he does not debar himself from doing so.<br/>
I want to take one case, and I will take a house under paragraph (<i>d</i>) as an instance. Let us take it that there is some industry in the local authority area in question. Let us take it that that industry has urgent needs and that for that reason people have to come into the area, not having houses there, in order to meet those needs. That is the paragraph (<i>d</i>) case. If that happens these immigrants are not going to help the general housing position in the area. They are, on the contrary, going to make it more difficult for the local authority, because even with the &#x00A3;24 subsidy, the local authority will still have to meet more than that in the process of building the houses.<br/>
Whether that is regarded as building expenditure or as services and administrative expenditure, one way or another the burden will be added to a little. It may perfectly well be that as a result of that move into the area there will be a more urgent need for more housing accommodation and conditions will exist, or arise, that cannot be dealt with without an unreasonably heavy rate burden or unreasonably high rents. In those circumstances, I completely fail to see why the Minister should expressly preclude himself

from giving the additional &#x00A3;6 in these cases.<br/>
There is, as one can see in Clause 3, a type of case to which he desires to give special encouragement, and yet, under the Bill as it is drawn, it is precisely to that type of case that he cannot extend the full discretionary relief under Clause 5. I will not say any more about the character of that discretionary relief for the moment because we shall find it easier and more proper to say it on the Motion, That the Clause stand part of the Bill&#x2014;and there is a good deal to be said about it.<br/>
For the moment, I confine myself to the one point raised by the Amendment. Why does the Minister think it necessary to prevent himself giving additional relief, amounting to &#x00A3;6 in the case of a house and a corresponding sum in the case of a flat? Why does he preclude himself from giving that relief in the very class of case which he particularly desires to encourage? Why does he put himself in the position of finding that he is perhaps giving additional relief in an ordinary case and unable to give it in a case equally bad but which happens to fall within the scope of one of these paragraphs?<br/>
I would remind the Minister once more that this relief is entirely within his discretion. First of all, his opinion has to be formed on certain matters, and he can then decide the amount of any additional subsidy. In those circumstances why exclude these categories?</p>

<p>The effect of the Amendment would be to make houses defined in Clause 3 (3,<i>c,</i>) (<i>d</i> and (<i>e</i>) eligible for the discretionary grant under Clause 5. It is an Amendment which is certainly well justified if only to elicit information as to why these three categories of houses have been excluded from the operation of the discretionary grant.<br/>
The hon. Member for Farnworth (Mr. Thornton) said that houses in these three categories should be eligible for this special grant because&#x2014;and this was the main reason he gave&#x2014;they are houses which cannot be pooled in the sense referred to in our earlier debates. That is to say, the subsidies payable on them cannot be regarded as part of a pool of subsidies which would include a great number of other houses belonging to the local authority concerned.</p>

<p>I do not know whether I made it clear, but my remarks were directed entirely to the category (<i>c</i>) houses.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-02-01a.1039.1" hansard_membership_id="6684" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29186" speakername="Mr. Sandys" colnum="1039" time="">
<p>I thought that the hon. Member was introducing the Amendment as a whole. Group (<i>c</i>) houses come under town development, and the hon. Member was referring to a town development scheme in his own area at Worsley which is operated for the benefit of Salford. That is perfectly true about some of the houses but not about all of those mentioned.<br/>
I should prefer to take the three categories one by one. First, I should like to take the one which was referred to by the hon. and learned Member for Kettering (Mr. Mitchison), that is the category (<i>d</i>) houses provided to meet the needs of incoming workers and required for an urgent expansion of industry. We have already very exhaustively discussed this problem when we dealt with the two earlier Clauses. It is the general problem of providing houses for incoming miners and others and I do not think that it would be useful if I went over all that ground again.<br/>
I can say briefly that the reason for not applying the discretionary grant under Clause 5 to these houses is in the main the conditions governing the grant in Clause 5 (1, <i>b</i>), namely:
<q>&#x2026; unless the Minister exercises his powers under this section that housing accommodation could not be provided without imposing an unreasonably heavy rate burden or necessitating the charging of unreasonably high rents for that and other housing accommodation provided by the authority.</q>
We feel that those conditions would not be appropriate to local authorities building houses for families coming in from outside.<br/>
They would imply, and this was the point which was made rather forcibly by the hon. Member for Farnworth, that we expected the receiving authority which was to build these additional houses for incoming workers to pool the subsidies and, if necessary, to increase the rents of their existing inhabitants in order to average down the rents of the incoming workers.<br/>
9.45 p.m.<br/>
The hon. Member for Farnworth said it would be asking too much to expect the citizens of Worsley to accept an increase

in their rents in order to help to keep down the rents of the newcomers from Salford. He then explained that Worsley had only a comparatively small number of houses, that the expansion scheme was considerable, and that it would unbalance their finances and their housing programme. For that reason&#x2014;a reason which I cannot put in a better way than the hon. Gentleman put it&#x2014;we do not think it would be right to expect the receiving authority in such an area to pool the subsidies and to average the rents. Putting them into this Clause would imply that we expected them to do so. If we attempted to insist on such a condition, there is no doubt that all these development schemes would come to an end, because those receiving authorities would refuse to make agreements, and these schemes go forward as a result of agreements between local authorities. It would make such agreements virtually impossible if we adopted that line. Does the hon. Gentleman the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Ellis Smith) want to interrupt me?</p>

<p>I was not saying that. I have said that it would not be practicable to apply these conditions under such circumstances. The additional houses built for the newcomers in such areas must, by and large, be financially self-supporting. I say "by and large," because there is no reason why some contribution should not be made from the local rates if the local authority think that desirable. In the long run, of course, the newcomers bring in rateable value and additional activity and wealth to the new area. But, by and large, we consider that they should be looked at separately from the existing pool of houses in the area into which they come.<br/>
That is the reason why, while providing the higher subsidy of &#x00A3;24, we are not providing the additional grant under the conditions of Clause 5 which are inappropriate. Houses provided by a receiving authority as part of a scheme of town development under Clause 3 (<i>3, c</i>), to which the hon. Member for Farnworth referred, are in much the same position, in certain respects at any rate. It is suggested that Clause 5 should apply to these houses, but for the same reason it


would be inappropriate to apply this condition of Clause 5 (1,<i>b</i>)to the making of a grant to authorities in that position&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>I see that the hon. Gentleman nods his head in agreement. If we were to apply the discretionary grant under Clause 5 to houses built in Worsley, we should be implying that we would do exactly what the hon. Gentleman thinks would be unfair, and I entirely agree. That is the main reason why houses built as part of a development scheme under Clause 3 (3, <i>c</i>) are not included in the discretionary grant under Clause 5.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the Minister, but I cannot accept his reason, because I think that the Minister's discretion in interpreting this Clause would be the charging of a reasonably high rent for that and other housing accommodation provided by the authority. Some attempt was made by the Parliamentary Secretary to give a comparison of high rents. In Worsley we have two separate housing schemes and there would be a reasonable or unreasonable level of rents for one category and a reasonable or unreasonable level of rents for the other category. I think the Minister's explanation is an attempt to get out of what he ought to do in the Clause.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman may think the Clause should be different, but I really think he would not like his Amendment to be adopted in the form that he suggested. The provision is quite clear; one cannot get away from it. Subsection (1, <i>b</i>) says:
<q>&#x2026; that unless the Minister exercises his powers under this section that housing accommodation could not be provided without imposing an unreasonably heavy rate burden &#x2026;</q>
That is the first point.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman says that the new houses ought to be treated differently from existing houses. One cannot have a set of rates for people living in new houses which is different from the rates of people living in existing houses. That would not be practicable. I think I have given clear reasons why it is inappropriate, for the precise reasons which the hon. Gentleman himself advanced, to apply these conditions to a case of that kind.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-02-01a.1042.0" hansard_membership_id="10493" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29306" speakername="Mr. Thornton" colnum="1042" time="">
<p>I would direct the Minister's attention to the fact that the words are:
<q>&#x2026; an unreasonably heavy rate burden or necessitating the charging of unreasonably high rents for that and other housing accommodation&#x2026;</q>
The words "that and other housing accommodation" presuppose two separate categories of houses. Thus, it is within the Minister's province under the Clause to treat them as separate categories and to assume that there are reasonable and unreasonable rents in relation to each category.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-02-01a.1042.1" hansard_membership_id="6684" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29186" speakername="Mr. Sandys" colnum="1042" time="">
<p>If the words were "that or other housing accommodation" they might mean what the hon. Gentleman suggests. However, it was brought out in the debate on an earlier Amendment that what is meant is that the rents over all the houses owned by the authority are to be taken into account in deciding whether unduly high rents would have to be charged in order to build new houses without the additional discretionary grant offered under Clause 5.<br/>
Apart from that argument, there is an additional reason in respect of this category of houses under town development schemes why Clause 5 should not be applied. It is that the Minister already has power to increase the Exchequer contribution up to a total greater than the provisions of Clause 5 permit. Under the Clause the subsidy can be raised from &#x00A3;24 to &#x00A3;30, but under the Town Development Act, as amended by the First Schedule of the Bill, the Minister will have power to increase the Exchequer contribution by another &#x00A3;8, making a maximum of &#x00A3;32. That is a good reason for not including those houses under the provisions of Clause 5.<br/>
In this connection I should like to say just a word, in passing, about the example, given by the hon. Member for Farnworth, of Worsley. It is often a good thing to consider precise and not merely abstract examples. The houses in the scheme at Worsley are owned by Salford. I think that they are built by Worsley for Salford and owned by Salford. [HON. MEMBERS: "They are owned by Worsley."] I understood that they were owned by Salford as happens in many of these cases. Worsley will, of course, receive &#x00A3;24 subsidy for those houses and


another &#x00A3;8 from Salford as its contribution, making a total of &#x00A3;32, which again is more than the houses would get if they had the maximum of &#x00A3;30 under Clause 5.
The "7d. calculation." if I may refer to it as such, which I made on an earlier occasion and to which Members opposite have referred&#x2014;that is to say the increase in the average rent which will be needed as a result of the reduction in the subsidy and the increase in the interest rates&#x2014; for Salford is 7d. It works out to exactly the average for the country as a whole. Of course the rents in Salford are not very high.</p>

<p>However, I will not go into details of that kind now.<br/>
There is a third category to which the Amendment refers and those are houses which fall in the class defined in Clause 3 (3, <i>e</i>), that is to say houses provided by a local authority of a congested area outside its area and on a scale and of a character comparable to that of a new town. Those houses will, of course, attract the higher subsidy of &#x00A3;24. That will help to meet the additional costs</p>

<p>The reason that it is not proposed to allow these authorities to draw an additional grant under Clause 5 is that the houses in these outside estates would belong to the exporting authority. That is clear from the Bill which refers to those houses
<q>&#x2026; provided by the local authority of a congested or over-populated area in some other area&#x2026;.</q>
Those are houses which are built and owned by the exporting authority which has built them in some other area. Those houses will therefore form part of the total pool of the houses of the exporting authority and will therefore be within the pool of the local authority. If the exporting authorities were to qualify for assistance under Clause 5 in respect of those houses, they could, of course, apply for it. However, that is most unlikely in view of the fact that they will be large authorities.</p>
