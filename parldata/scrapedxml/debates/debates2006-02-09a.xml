	<p pid="a.987.11/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The historic problem is that far too few of our 16 and 17-year-olds choose to stay in education and go on to further or higher education. In fact, we have one of the lowest rates in the industrialised world. EMA payments remove the financial barrier that some young people face who would otherwise choose to study. Fundamentally, the question is how we raise aspiration and involve parents in their children's education, and raise the sights of all children. That is why parental engagement is so important in the education system. It will make most difference for our most disadvantaged young people.</p>

I wrote to her on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-05">5 January</phrase>, on behalf of Charlotte Cook, who is the Isle of Wight's Member of the Youth Parliament. She is concerned that the household income threshold for eligibility for the Christmas bonus might take elder siblings' earnings into account. Will the right hon.

	<p pid="a.991.3/1">My hon. Friend makes a very important. Of course, the considerable investment in constituencies such as his from the building schools for the future programme provides important opportunities not just to add sixth-form provision but to remodel and completely rebuild secondary schools. Last year, we brought together capital funding streams from the Learning and Skills Council and schools capital funding in one clear 16-to-19 capital pot, and I am sure that access to that will be able to support some of the proposals that he and the Government rightly want for his constituency.</p>

	<p pid="a.1007.3/1">I thank the Leader for the House for giving us the business for the coming week. He will not be surprised to hear me ask again about the date for the Budget, as he knows that the Treasury Committee recommended that two months' notice of the date should be given. We are less than two months away from the Easter recess, so that advice cannot now be met. Will he at least tell us when he expects to be able to give us the date of the Budget?</p>
	<p pid="a.1007.3/2">Can we have a debate on Lord Carter's review of criminal legal aid, which is being published today? As I am sure that the Leader of the House will know, that is a matter of real concern for high street solicitors.</p>
	<p pid="a.1007.3/3">Yesterday, a Standing Committee considered the new contract for dentists. As there is a shortage of 1,850 dentists, and only half the population are registered with an NHS dentist, will the Leader of the House make Government time available for a debate on dentistry and the problems faced by those who have no access to an NHS dentist?</p>
	<p pid="a.1007.3/4">The Government tell us frequently that they are family-friendly and interested in issues for working families. The Childcare Bill finished in Committee on <phrase class="date" code="">15 December</phrase>, and its remaining stages debate has already been postponed once, yet we have no replacement date. Similarly, the Children and Adoption Bill finished in the Lords on <phrase class="date" code="">29 November</phrase>, yet we have no date for the start of its passage through this House. When will those Bills return to the House?</p>
	<p pid="a.1007.3/5">It was revealed yesterday that the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has been holding talks with councils about scrapping next year's local government elections&mdash; [Hon. Members: &quot;Disgraceful.&quot;] As my hon. Friends say, that is absolutely disgraceful. The Minister for Local Government has said that it is all pure speculation, but as constituents such as mine will want the opportunity next year to vote on the record of their local Liberal Democrat council, which is putting up council tax by 4.95 per cent.&mdash;an increase of 20 per cent. over three years&mdash;and given the backlog of business in the House, will the Leader of the House confirm that no time will be made available for the legislation necessary to scrap the council elections next year, and that next year's council elections will go ahead?</p>
	<p pid="a.1007.3/6">Finally, can we have a debate on the public appeal of MPs? I am sure that the Leader of the House will be aware that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1932" name="David Cameron">my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron)</phrase> has been voted one of the world's 100 sexiest men. [Hon. Members: &quot;Who voted?&quot;] I see that in a BBC poll conducted to find the sexiest Nottinghamshire MP&mdash;I have the right county this week&mdash;the Leader of the House came seventh. Top of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1726" name="Patrick Mercer">the poll was my hon. Friend the Member for Newark (Patrick Mercer)</phrase>, second was &quot;none of the above&quot;, and the Leader of the House even came behind <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1794" name="Kenneth Clarke">my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)</phrase>. A debate would, of course, give my right hon. and hon. Friends an opportunity to give the Leader of the House a few tips.</p>

	<p pid="a.1008.2/1">As the shadow Leader of the House is in a good mood, let me draw her attention to the shadow Chancellor's proposals for what appears to be a forthcoming shadow Cabinet reshuffle. The shadow Chancellor has made it clear that by the time of the next general election there will be no one in the shadow Cabinet over the age of 50. Honour forbids me to reveal the right hon. Lady's age, but shall we say that if the reports are correct, she will be looking forward to a very early general election&mdash;but I have to say that she will be disappointed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1008.2/2">The date of the Budget will be made known very soon. As for the question of legal aid and high street solicitors, as one who has had ministerial responsibility for the distribution of legal aid in the past, I am confident that the Government will continue to ensure that it is available, and that the considerable amount of money contributed by the taxpayer to support the system will be used to maximum effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.1008.2/3">The right hon. Lady asked about the availability of dentists. I announced to the House that there would be a debate on tackling health inequalities on <phrase class="date" code="">Thursday 16 February</phrase>. I am sure that that will give all Members an opportunity to comment on dentistry as well as other aspects of health care, and also to mention the considerable amount of extra money that the Government have put into health, almost trebling the health budget since 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.1008.2/4">As the right hon. Lady said, the Childcare Bill and the Children and Adoption Bill await time in the House of Commons. They will be presented as soon as business allows, but, as I hope I have made clear, we have a very crowded legislative agenda. We are determined to continue the pace of change that the country requires, and that necessarily means that there will be&mdash;as ever&mdash;significant business on the Floor of the House, not least next week.</p>
	<p pid="a.1008.2/5">I refer the right hon. Lady to what was said by the Minister of Communities and Local Government about local government elections:</p>
	<p pid="a.1008.2/6" class="indent">&quot;We expect and intend the 2007 elections to go ahead. The debate on local government reorganisation is gathering pace&mdash;we are having a mature discussion with local government&mdash;and we will make our position clear in the Local Government White Paper in the middle of this year.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1008.2/7">I think that that deals with the various points that the right hon. Lady raised. I am grateful to her for raising them.</p>

	<p pid="a.1010.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is obviously in lively mood now that the Liberal Democrats have started the process of voting for their new leader. I understand that there is a determined write-in campaign on his behalf to ensure that the current rather narrow field is expanded somewhat by his addition. Labour Members would strongly support that campaign, if only we had access to the ballot papers. Given that Liberal Democrat MPs, who can nominate two people, also get two votes in that election, I sincerely hope that they will use at least one of them to support his campaign.</p>
	<p pid="a.1010.0/2">I want to make clear the importance of the Carter review, which the Government will deal with very seriously. I have set out clearly our position on local government reform, and there will shortly be a statement and an opportunity shortly for Members to ask questions of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. As for replaying parliamentary debates, it would be useful for the House to hear from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1932" name="David Cameron">the right hon.

	<p pid="a.1028.4/1">The one big disappointment for many people in the statement is the lack of action on migration, which causes people more heartache that anything else in the system. The Minister said that &pound;90 million will be made available over three years for the stabilisation scheme. Does he think that it will be another three years before the Henshaw review is put into effect, so that it will be six years before the new system is introduced? People will still be on different systems which, as I said, causes much anguish. If the new system is to receive public backing it must be a fair one that treats everyone the same. On debt recovery, if the right hon. Gentleman is going to use private debt collectors, can he assure us that there will be strict monitoring of their effectiveness and, importantly, the methods that they use to recover payment, as the industry has more than its fair share of shady characters?</p>

	<p pid="a.1030.2/1">I agree that, given the myriad problems with tax credits, the solution is not to pass the buck to HMRC. I do not think that that would work. Like many hon. Members, I have seen single mothers in tears in my surgery because they are frustrated with the weaknesses of the system. We must do better. My personal view is that the agency is irretrievably broken but, given that the Department has already months, if not longer, to review the problem and that the Secretary of State's answer is essentially that there will be yet another review, is there anything more positive that he can offer parents who are suffering under the broken system?</p>

	<p pid="a.1039.3/2">We have to look at the people who are in prison today and consider whether prison is the right place for them. I cite foreign national prisoners&mdash;more than 10,000 of them. Is it right that they should be in British prisons rather that in their own countries? I cite remand prisoners. Is it right that they should be in prison rather than being in the courts and moving more quickly through the process? I cite mentally ill prisoners, where there are serious issues about their mental heath care. I cite prisoners on very short sentences caught in the revolving door, where our failure&mdash;I acknowledge that word to the right hon. and learned Gentleman&mdash;to provide credible and effective community sentences has meant that we cannot do what is needed for those people in the best possible way.</p>
	<p pid="a.1039.3/3">I am not telling the right hon. and learned Gentleman that everything has been got right&mdash;I do not think that. I do think, however, that it is fundamentally wrong simply to say that the current system is basically okay and we should work a bit harder at it. We have to focus on every offender and build genuine and diverse partnerships.</p>

	<p pid="a.1047.1/1">On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. May I ask for your guidance on what remedies exist when it is felt that a Minister might have given an incorrect answer to a parliamentary question? I believe that that is the case in respect of my question to the Department for Transport, which was answered on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-30">30 January</phrase> and affects all south Essex MPs. I was told:</p>
	<p pid="a.1047.1/2" class="indent">&quot;There are no committees considering transport infrastructure for the proposed London Gateway port.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-30">30 January 2006</phrase>; Vol. 442, c. 68W.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1047.1/3">Yet I discovered yesterday that the Thames Gateway South Essex Transportation Board is a committee that exists for those purposes and that Government and Go East members sit on that committee. We need transparency and open government on these important matters.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-02-09a.1054.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2010" speakername="Jim Murphy" colnum="1054"  time="013:48:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060209/debtext/60209-19.htm#60209-19_spnew3">
	<p pid="a.1054.2/1">In total, I think that 27 RROs were delivered under the 2001 Act. At the time of the Second and Third Reading of the 2001 Act, it was anticipated across the House that there would be much more substantial reforms as a consequence of it. The right hon. Gentleman asks a reasonable question, and there is a reasonable answer. More than 200,000 businesses across the UK have been contacted in the admin burdens project on which the Government are working. They have identified a stock of administrative burdens, which the Bill will be able to reduce and simplify. The last Government and, indeed, the present Government would probably not have been able to find time to legislate in that way before, and businesses and others welcome the new measures.</p>
	<p pid="a.1054.2/2">Many of the non-contentious aspects of the simplification proposals&mdash;plans for their implementation must be produced by every Department before this year's pre-Budget report&mdash;will find a path through Parliament as a consequence of the Bill. An avenue may also be found for the mergers envisaged in the Hampton report and the penalties review that Professor Macrory is undertaking on the Government's behalf. I believe that 29 of the Law Commission's proposals have not yet been implemented, and that the Government consider about 16 of them to be non-contentious, at least in part.</p>
	<p pid="a.1054.2/3">I hope that I have given a full answer to the entirely fair question asked by the right hon. Gentleman.</p>
	<p pid="a.1054.2/4">As I have said, the Bill removes technical limitations such as the legal burdens concept, and makes the RRO power simpler to use. That power is expected to deliver a better regulation outcome than the removal or imposition of a legal burden. The order-making power will also be able to confer legislative functions, or sub-delegation. It can confer a new power on a Minister to lay statutory instruments subject to the negative or affirmative resolution procedure. That is an important restriction, which will ensure proper parliamentary scrutiny of the exercise of that function by Ministers. In addition, a Minister proposing to make an order conferring legislative functions on a Minister will have to lay an explanatory document before Parliament giving reasons for the power to legislate and the procedural safeguards attached to it. Where possible, Ministers will be expected to lay regulations in draft to illustrate exactly how such functions will be used.</p>
	<p pid="a.1054.2/5">While the proposed new power is much more straightforward and more able to deliver better regulation outcomes, the preconditions in the Bill are stronger than those in the 2001 Act. They have a wider application, applying to all types of provision made by order, not just to those affecting burdens. A Minister wishing to make an order under the new power must ensure that those stringent safeguards are observed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1054.2/6">The Bill specifies five conditions. A Minister must be satisfied that they have been met before embarking on the order-making process. I think that this deals with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1937" name="Rob Marris">the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris)</phrase>. There must be no non-legislative alternatives to the order; the effect of the proposal must be proportionate to its policy objectives; the proposal must strike a fair balance between the public interest in its implementation and the interests of any individuals who would be adversely affected by it; the order must not remove any necessary protections; and the order must not prevent any person from continuing to exercise any right or freedom which that person might reasonably expect to continue to exercise.</p>
	<p pid="a.1054.2/7">An additional condition applies when an order is intended to restate legislation or codify the common law. A Minister must be satisfied that the order will make the law more accessible or more easily understood.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-02-09a.1062.7" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1632" speakername="Oliver Heald" colnum="1062"  time="014:36:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060209/debtext/60209-21.htm#60209-21_spnew14">
	<p pid="a.1062.7/1">I could not agree more. In fact, later in my speech I will talk about the one in, one out principle that Sir David Arculus considered when he was in charge of the Better Regulation Task Force&mdash;now renamed the Better Regulation Commission&mdash;when trying to balance new regulation against the removal of outdated regulation. I accept that protection is also important.</p>
	<p pid="a.1062.7/2">Other measures, such as the International Institute for Management Development's &quot;World Competitiveness Yearbook&quot;, show that the UK has fallen from ninth to 22nd since 1997. The London School of Economics recently warned about</p>
	<p pid="a.1062.7/3" class="indent">&quot;concerns that tougher competition could be undermined by increasing regulation&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1062.7/4">The CBI has said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1062.7/5" class="indent">&quot;Many businesses believe regulation is damaging the UK's attraction as a place to invest . . . the burden has grown and expect it to increase further.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1062.7/6">The Library has shown that there are 3,887 regulations a year on average under this Government&mdash;15 every working day. That is a 50 per cent. increase on what happened under the last Conservative Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.1062.7/7">Against the background of failure that was evident in 2000, Lord Falconer introduced the Regulatory Reform Bill, which was described as a major measure for deregulation. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1062.7/8" class="indent">&quot;The Bill will provide a major tool to tackle unnecessary over-lapping, over-complex and over-burdensome legislation.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2000-12-21">21 December 2000</phrase>; Vol. 620, c. 850.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1062.7/9">In the House on <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-19">19 March 2001</phrase>, the then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Cabinet Office, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1704" name="Graham Stringer">the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer)</phrase>,</p>
	<p pid="a.1062.7/10">was asked:</p>
	<p pid="a.1062.7/11" class="indent">&quot;Do the Government intend the measure to be used to introduce orders that have a net deregulatory effect&mdash;yes or no?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1062.7/12">He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1062.7/13" class="indent">&quot;The Bill makes it clear that each regulatory reform order must contain a deregulatory element.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-19">19 March 2001</phrase>; Vol. 365, c. 118.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1062.7/14">The Bill was described as &quot;a valuable tool&quot;, &quot;an excellent tool&quot; and &quot;a major tool&quot;, but the sad history records that only 27 regulatory reform orders have been made, although everyone expected more than 60.</p>
	<p pid="a.1062.7/15">Of course, a review was promised. It talks about whether it should be possible to amend or appeal primary legislation to do one of three things: remove, reduce, re-enact or impose burdens; simplify legislation; and implement uncontroversial Law Commission recommendations. We wanted that power to be as flexible as possible, so it went out to consultation. Not surprisingly, business groups in particular supported the consultation and the idea of that flexibility, but something strange then occurred. The Government changed tack and removed all reference to removing burdens on business. What we have now is constitutionally novel. The Bill extends the scope of powers available to Ministers while relaxing the constraints of parliamentary scrutiny. Ministers will be able to amend, repeal or pass primary legislation without going through the normal parliamentary procedures. There is no requirement that such measures should have a deregulatory effect, so the danger is that we shall have legislation, regulation and parliamentary corner-cutting with no deregulation at all.</p>
	<p pid="a.1062.7/16">Like the Minister, the Government talk much about deregulation and better regulation. They have their Better Regulation Commission, with its new chairman, and their simplification process, whereby every Department has to find simpler legislation. Expensive consultants have calculated the costs to many businesses of every burden or cost of regulation. Now, we have the Bill, but the sad truth is that so far, despite the talk, there has been no deregulation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1062.7/17">All the talk of one in, one out&mdash;the idea that every time a regulation is passed another should be repealed&mdash;is a vain hope. The Minister will have seen the latest list from the Department of Trade and Industry showing the regulations coming in on <phrase class="date" code="">6 April</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="">1 October</phrase>&mdash;the regulation-making days. It runs to 30 pages, but there is not even the sniff of a list of regulations that will be scrapped. As the Institute of Directors said recently:</p>
	<p pid="a.1062.7/18" class="indent">&quot;We are pleased to see all the policy activity, but are still waiting to see tangible action on the ground.&quot;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-02-09a.1075.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1478" speakername="Tony Wright" colnum="1075"  time="015:26:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060209/debtext/60209-25.htm#60209-25_spnew6">
	<p pid="a.1075.1/1">I am interested in that observation. I have not served on that Committee, but I am told by some who have that it has offered a way of scrutinising some of these orders that is quite different from the process that I caricatured, moving far more towards the sort of procedure that can be captured by a Special Standing Committee. We must move in all those kinds of directions, away from just treating pieces of legislation in terms of the normal party dogfight, and towards getting some intelligent scrutiny. We do that much better through Special Standing Committees. We do it better when we consider Bills in draft. We can also do it better, as I understand it, through the regulatory order scrutiny procedure. We should be cautious about setting our face against these developments, which have a lot to be said for them.</p>
	<p pid="a.1075.1/2">Having said all that, what is proposed in the Bill&mdash;as various Members have said&mdash;is unquestionably a major constitutional issue. As has been said, that is the case for considering it in the way in which we normally consider such measures. I know that the Government will think about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1075.1/3">The whole area of deregulation and better regulation has a history. I enjoyed being reminded of the background to the deregulation measures of the Major Government. I was reminded of John Major's speech to the Conservative party conference in October 1992&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Indeed, some hon. Members were there. John Major anointed Michael Heseltine no less, then the President&mdash;as he liked to be called&mdash;of the Board of Trade, to take responsibility for attacking regulation and leading the deregulation agenda. He said to the conference:</p>
	<p pid="a.1075.1/4" class="indent">&quot;Who better for hacking back the jungle? Come on, Michael. Out with your club. On with your loin cloth. Swing into action!&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1075.1/5">That was very good.</p>
	<p pid="a.1075.1/6">Within a short space of time of being given the job, however, Michael Heseltine discovered that it was not so straightforward. By that time, he had moved on to become the Government's general troubleshooter, and, my goodness, there was a lot of trouble at that time to shoot. He came before the Public Service Committee on <phrase class="date" code="1996-12-10">10 December 1996</phrase>, to talk about how he was getting on with his deregulatory mission. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1075.1/7" class="indent">&quot;This is the dilemma of deregulation, that it is never simple, very rarely are you able just to say, 'Get rid of this', because you are dealing with health, safety, environment, vital aspects of a civilised society. Sometimes you can modify, but once you get into modification you get into complexity&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1075.1/8">That was why I inserted into <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1632" name="Oliver Heald">our exchanges with the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald)</phrase> earlier the point that, in a sense, every burden carries a protection with it. That was Michael Heseltine's conclusion, which is why the process is trickier than we sometimes think.</p>
	<p pid="a.1075.1/9">The Government have been right to move from that narrow focus on deregulation to a better focus on better regulation&mdash;as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development says, from red tape to smart tape&mdash;which gets the notion of the balance right. We should remind ourselves that sometimes we do get things right. The OECD country report on regulation in Britain stated in 2002:</p>
	<p pid="a.1075.1/10" class="indent">&quot;With twenty years of continuous effort behind it, the United Kingdom is one of the most experienced OECD countries in regulatory reform . . . A constant up-grading of instruments has occurred simultaneously with the establishment of an array of regulatory policies, institutions, and tools, many of them innovative and unprecedented. This has formed a set of broadly efficient, transparent and accountable regulatory systems of high quality.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1075.1/11">Across parties over the past 15 years or so, we have developed a robust and sophisticated approach to the whole issue of regulation. The Bill, however, represents a radical departure. The Government have decided on the most radical of the options that they discussed: they are taking power to reform any legislation. That is an extraordinary development, which requires the most careful discussion and scrutiny.</p>
	<p pid="a.1075.1/12">We must retain the value of some of the scrutiny mechanisms that we have developed in existing regulatory reform orders, and build in safeguards. My approach is fairly straightforward: yes, there is a case for new powers, but they must be matched by new safeguards. That is the only way in which to make the proposals acceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.1075.1/13">The three main safeguards are these. First, there must be some limit on the use of the powers. It cannot be right to allow Ministers to reform any legislation in any way that they choose. The Regulatory Reform Committee has suggested that there should be a list of off-limits subjects. Another approach would be to allow change that was compatible with and proportionate to the original legislation. Ministers would then be able to use their powers to simplify legislation and bring it up to date, but they would not be able to transform the law in a way that was entirely different from Parliament's original intention. That would preserve a clear distinction between proposals requiring primary legislation and proposals that could be dealt with through secondary legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1075.1/14">Secondly, an effective veto is needed. If the Government are to be given more flexibility, it is no longer satisfactory for the veto to rest on an undertaking alone. The Government's own consultation document claims:</p>
	<p pid="a.1075.1/15" class="indent">&quot;Parliament will always and should always remain the guardian of what is appropriate to be delivered by RRO.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1075.1/16">It also makes it clear that there can be no straightforward principles such as size or even complexity. If that is the case, Parliament must be able to exercise its guardianship order by order, not simply by approving the procedure in the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.1075.1/17">Thirdly, any proposals to change primary legislation must be properly scrutinised. The Regulatory Reform Committee has called for a minimum scrutiny of 60 days. It is interesting to note that parliamentary scrutiny currently accounts for only a small part of the time taken to process regulatory reform orders. An interesting table in the Regulatory Reform Committee's report shows that on average, the parliamentary scrutiny stage takes only 16 per cent. of the total time taken from initial consultation to approval, so that is not where the delay is occurring. That does not mean, however, that scrutiny should not be proportionate. The Committee itself has suggested that if it is felt that certain proposals need no amendment, it could be possible to do without the second stage of the scrutiny process.</p>
	<p pid="a.1075.1/18">For me&mdash;and, I suspect, a good number of others&mdash;if the principle is to be followed that the advancement of ministerial powers must all the time be matched by advancement in safeguards on the use of those powers, the House should expect the three safeguards that I have outlined to be included in the Bill, in order to provide that security. While I welcome the thrust of the Government's aims, the danger is that ministerial powers could be extended in ways that Parliament did not want or intend, and perhaps was not even aware of.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-02-09a.1077.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1502" speakername="Christopher Chope" colnum="1077"  time="015:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060209/debtext/60209-26.htm#60209-26_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.1077.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1478" name="Tony Wright">the hon. Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright)</phrase>. I have been waiting to hear a speech in support of the Government's proposal, and he rightly drew attention to the challenges associated with regulation. That struck a chord with my own experience. In 1992, I was a member of Mr. Heseltine's deregulation taskforce and I also served on the Health and Safety Commission, which was tasked with trying to reduce the burden of regulation. In that era and the current one, Governments have always talked of proportionality and the introduction of regulation based on risk assessment. Sadly, however, the trend has continued toward more prescriptive regulation. We will discuss on Monday the latest stage of the Identity Cards Bill, which is an example of prescriptive regulation rather than regulation based on risk assessment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1077.0/2">I want to begin by quoting from the letter of the Chairman of the Constitution Committee of the House of Lords to the Lord Chancellor, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-23">23 January</phrase>. He says that</p>
	<p pid="a.1077.0/3" class="indent">&quot;we are concerned by the potential of the Bill's proposals, if enacted, markedly to alter the respective and long-established roles of Ministers and Parliament in the legislative process.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1077.0/4">So he regards this as a serious constitutional issue, which indeed it is. That is why I hope that the Government will withdraw motion 2 on <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1954" name="Greg Knight">the Order Paper. My right hon. Friend the Member for East Yorkshire (Mr. Knight)</phrase>, who is Chairman of the Procedure Committee, very much wanted to join in this afternoon's debate but has had to travel north to visit a relative in hospital. It was he who wrote on the Procedure Committee's behalf to the Leader of the House, who today said that he was considering my right hon. Friend's letter. Well, the time for considering it will be much greater if he withdraws motion 2, rather than trying to force it through this evening.</p>
	<p pid="a.1077.0/5">I recently had the privilege of being reappointed to the Procedure Committee after a gap of some 20 years. When I first served on it, during the Parliament elected in 1983, its membership included Sir Robin Maxwell-Hyslop and the right hon. Enoch Powell. Enoch Powell would be proud of the contribution being made on these very important constitutional issues by the current Member of Parliament for <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1937" name="Rob Marris">his former constituency, the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1077.0/6">It was Enoch Powell who once succinctly described to me the importance of the procedures of the House&mdash;and that was not just because we were both members of the Procedure Committee. He said that in the absence of a written constitution, the procedures of Parliament and of the Commons in particular are, effectively, our constitution: our protection of the people and their liberties against the Executive. That is why today's debate and this Bill are of such importance.</p>
	<p pid="a.1077.0/7">The Minister said that the Bill had stringent safeguards that were more extensive than those in <phrase class="honfriend" id="unknown" name="Mr. Williams">the 2001 Act, but the hon. Member for Cannock Chase and the right hon. Member for Swansea, West (Mr. Williams)</phrase> pointed out that the safeguards were not as extensive as the Minister asserted. Indeed, the precondition that a burden on an individual or a business would have to be removed is no longer part of the Bill. That important safeguard was included in the consultation process but was then dropped by the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.1077.0/8">The Minister gave evidence to the Procedure Committee on Tuesday and said that the 2001 Act defined &quot;burden&quot; too narrowly, because it had to be a legal burden that was being eased rather than an administrative one. I have no problem with extending the definition of burden, but the more logical solution would be to widen the definition rather than remove completely any requirement that burdens should be reduced, if the special procedure is to be used.</p>
	<p pid="a.1077.0/9">The House was very careful to ensure that the protections in the 2001 Act were extensive. On Tuesday, the Procedure Committee asked the Minister whether they would remain, and the Minister replied that &quot;every single protection&quot; in the 2001 Act would. In answer to question 6, he said that, ultimately, the Select Committee could</p>
	<p pid="a.1077.0/10" class="indent">&quot;kick the whole thing out and say, 'We do not believe that this fits the right of Parliament and protections of Parliament to legislate in a sensible way.'&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1077.0/11">The Minister ascribed to the Regulatory Reform Committee the right of veto, saying that it was a real protection for Parliament. In answer to question 9, he said that the Committee had the ultimate power to say that an order should not go ahead at all. In answer to question 12, he said that</p>
	<p pid="a.1077.0/12" class="indent">&quot;indeed, they could just say, 'We don't think this is suitable at all for this committee' and we are back to the drawing board to seek an alternative way of implementing the order.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1077.0/13">The Minister gave the Committee's Chairman an absolute undertaking that it would have an absolute veto if it felt the subject matter was too sensitive and politically controversial.</p>
	<p pid="a.1077.0/14">When the Minister winds up the debate, I hope he will confirm that those assurances given to the Committee will be included on the face of the Bill; nothing short of that will do. The Government have suggested that they might bring forward the appropriate amendments: until they do, I and many other hon. Members will wonder what possible reason there could be for not including such provisions on the face of the Bill. The existing procedures have not been tested in the circumstances that would apply when the Government disagreed with the Regulatory Reform Committee. None of that Committee's recommendations have resulted in a debate on the Floor of the House, with the Government forcing through a measure using the procedures available under the 2001 Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.1077.0/15">It was implicit in the Minister's evidence to the Procedure Committee that he considered that the Government's powers to force a measure through against the will of the Committee would never be used by a responsible and reasonable Government. We have the opportunity to ensure that that is the case. If that happens, I shall not be as sceptical as I admit to being at present.</p>
	<p pid="a.1077.0/16">In its present form, the Bill is in danger of being the sort of subtle sleight of hand of which a member of the Magic Circle would be proud. It is calculated to give much more power to the Government and the Executive, at the expense of Parliament. One reading of the Bill leads one to the conclusion that its primary purpose is not to remove burdens from business or people, but to remove the burden of having to legislate from the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.1077.0/17">The Bill is the ultimate guillotine for debate and discussion. What a bore it must be for Ministers to have to bring Bills before Parliament if they want to change the law, even the common law. It would be so much easier if they did not have to publish a Bill, wait a couple of weeks for Second Reading, and then sit for the best part of a day in the Chamber listening to Members going on about it. Then they have to go up to Committee and answer points made on amendments, and even respond to new clauses that the Government might find embarrassing or annoying. It would be so much easier if the Government could just do away with all that and put their legislative proposals through this new, streamlined procedure. A strong Government would always be prepared, in extremis, to use the powers available. This is our chance to ensure that we do not give such draconian powers to this or any subsequent Government. That is why the Bill will have to be amended to reflect the concerns that have been expressed by two Select Committees and many right hon. and hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid="a.1077.0/18">No Member is a greater enthusiast for deregulation and lifting burdens from business than I am. If the Bill were solely designed to facilitate genuine deregulation and remove burdens, I would be among its strongest supporters. However, I remain to be convinced that that is its primary purpose.</p>
	<p pid="a.1077.0/19">We are used to Government rhetoric and we do not need to rehearse the 45 minutes saga or the weapons of mass destruction when we have before us examples of where the Government have said one thing and done another on this specific subject of deregulation. In its 1997 election manifesto specifically for business, published in April 1997, the Labour party promised:</p>
	<p pid="a.1077.0/20" class="indent">&quot;We will not impose burdensome regulations on business because we understand that successful businesses must keep costs down.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1077.0/21">In the 2001 election, having imposed many more burdens on business in the interim, Labour promised in its business manifesto:</p>
	<p pid="a.1077.0/22" class="indent">&quot;We will deregulate where desirable and regulate where necessary, with as light a touch as possible.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1077.0/23">In 2005, the promise was repeated in the full manifesto:</p>
	<p pid="a.1077.0/24" class="indent">&quot;We will only regulate where necessary and will set exacting targets for reducing the costs of administering regulations.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1077.0/25">However, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1632" name="Oliver Heald">my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald)</phrase> said, the Government have increased the number of regulations, the burden of regulation and the cost to business and enterprise. The hon. Member for Cannock Chase questioned whether the &pound;38.9 billion figure included the cost of the minimum wage. I have looked at the briefing from the BCC and it specifically excludes the cost of the minimum wage. If that was included, it would push the figure up to an even more astronomic level.</p>
	<p pid="a.1077.0/26">We know, from the Library, that in the six years from 1998 to 2003 there were 23,322 regulations, an average of 3,887 a year or 14.85 every working day. Matters were bad enough under the Conservative Government, but this Government have increased the number of regulations by 50 per cent. since the Conservative record was set.</p>
	<p pid="a.1077.0/27">When the Government say that they will not use the powers that they are taking in this Bill&mdash;they say, &quot;Trust us, we're really on your side&quot;&mdash;I think that it is incumbent on us on behalf of our constituents to look more closely at their record of delivering what they say they will do. They have manifestly failed to deliver in the area of deregulation and lifting burdens on business.</p>
	<p pid="a.1077.0/28">The only way that we can guarantee that the Government deliver what they say they intend is to get the Bill amended in the way that many right hon. and hon. Members and I have suggested. I hope that my scepticism will not be borne out and that, by the time that we debate the Bill on Third Reading, it will incorporate those much-needed amendments, and I live in hope.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-02-09a.1085.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1934" speakername="John Redwood" colnum="1085"  time="016:12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060209/debtext/60209-28.htm#60209-28_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.1085.1/1">I accept your reproof in good spirit, Madam Deputy Speaker. Yes, I will.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085.1/2">The issue I wish to raise is not the powers in the Bill, although we need to reach a conclusion on that, but whether the Bill&mdash;as suitably amended, perhaps&mdash;will tackle the Government's underlying problem. Will it help the Government to deregulate&mdash;will it help them to deal with the many clogs in the arteries of business and commerce that the Prime Minister himself has identified? Many months have passed since the Prime Minister made a brilliant speech on deregulation, full of admirable sentiments and analysis&mdash;a speech that I would have been proud to have made. The Prime Minister has a big advantage over me in that he is the Prime Minister and he can do more than make speeches; he can actually implement measures. He can make change happen in the Government that he leads&mdash;when he is leading it, that is. Since that speech was made, however, we have seen nothing to back up the fine words.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085.1/3">The Prime Minister has told us that, for every new regulation introduced, one would be removed&mdash;a crude device that would allow the Government to introduce a big and expensive regulation while removing a cheap and ineffective one, but it would be better than nothing. What has happened since the Prime Minister opined? About 4,000 new regulations have been introduced and almost none has been struck off. It is not working. Since the Prime Minister made his speech in support of better and more sensitive regulation, we have seen no such development&mdash;there has been no abolition of quangos, no reduction in the intrusiveness of the regulators and no measures have been brought to the House for repeal.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085.1/4">The wide powers in the Regulatory Reform Act 2001 that we were told would be used to achieve that aim have not been so used. A mere 27 measures have been subjected to them and even the Under-Secretary was hard pressed to remember any of them or to claim that anything good had happened as a result. People outside are not saying, &quot;Oh, I'm so grateful for the 2001 Act&mdash;my life has been transformed and great swathes of regulation that I used to have to slave under have been removed.&quot; Nothing memorable has happened.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085.1/5">The Under-Secretary made a promising start to his speech. He honestly stated that he had inherited the 2001 Act, which clearly has not been working well&mdash;we might be less flattering and say that it has not worked at all&mdash;and his analysis suggested that the 2001 Act lacked sufficient teeth, so he was introducing today a Bill with more teeth. The House pointed out two problems with his argument: first, the Bill does not actually state that the powers will be used for deregulation&mdash;they could be used for extra regulation&mdash;and, secondly, there are some democratic affronts in the proposals. His defence was interesting. He said that there were more protections in the Bill than there were in the 2001 Act. If that is the case, how can the Under-Secretary claim that the Bill will solve the problem of the 2001 Act which, he established, lacked teeth, was too democratic, too cautiously worded and did not allow Ministers to operate without parliamentary control and oversight? We should repeat the big question for the Treasury Bench in the hope that the Under-Secretary can provide an answer. If these new large powers are given to Ministers how will they be used in the next couple of years, and what is their programme? What do Ministers want to strike off the statute book, and what do they wish to amend or refine, using the powers that could not be done under the 2001 Act or by introducing straightforward primary legislation in the House?</p>
	<p pid="a.1085.1/6">The Under-Secretary was wrong to suggest that I bind my Front-Bench spokesmen and speak for them. As chairman of the policy review, I am not a member of the Front-Bench team and I am not governed by collective responsibility, but I believe that I speak for my right hon. and hon. Friends when I say that, if the Under-Secretary has a good list of things that he would like to repeal, we would be happy to expedite their passage through the House using the usual procedures. If he wished to introduce a deregulation Bill or a repeals Bill&mdash;I can see that my hon. Friends are excited by that prospect, for which we have been waiting for eight years&mdash;I am sure that we would expedite the passage of such measures. It would be possible with the agreement of the usual channels to introduce a Bill that would not need very much scrutiny at all because we would be happy with the measures that it contained. Such a Bill could then proceed using the correct procedures.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085.1/7">Whenever I make the case for deregulation, Labour Back Benchers and sometimes Ministers intervene to ask what specifically I would do, hoping that that is the knockout question. They know that when I was shadow Secretary of State for deregulation in the previous shadow Cabinet, I drew up a list of 53 items that we wish to deregulate, in primary legislation where necessary, including some very significant items indeed. I have sent them on several occasions to ministerial and regulatory offices&mdash;they never seem to remember them&mdash;and whenever I am asked what exactly I would deregulate, those proposals remain on the table. The list will not be the same at the next general election, as my right hon. and hon. Friends in the Front-Bench team will compile a list suitable for the circumstances of 2009 or 2010. It will probably be much longer, as many more things will have been put on to the statute book in the meantime by the Government that we will consider unnecessary or undesirable.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085.1/8">It is useful, however, to consider whether one or two things could be achieved by using proposals in the Bill or by using more direct means. First, only in the United Kingdom have we managed money-laundering regulations in such a cack-handed and clumsy way that people who want to deposit a couple of hundred pounds in a building society or a bank have to take their gas bill, their passport, their driving licence, and testimonials from their neighbours to prove that the money was not obtained illicitly. I cannot for the life of me understand how taking a gas bill to the bank proves that one's money was not obtained illicitly, but apparently it provides protection. I cannot understand how possession of a gas bill proves conclusively that someone lives at an address all the time or that they are an upright member of the community. I think that that should be established in different ways, and it would be better established by the appropriate authorities when there are grounds to suspect someone. That is a better method than making my constituents take all those ridiculous bits of paper to the bank. Often the bank manager or clerk knows exactly who the applicant is, but they still have to go through the rigmarole of asking for those bits of paper. Could that not be sorted out?</p>
	<p pid="a.1085.1/9">Why do we regulate venture capital at all? If we want a flourishing and dynamic economy, the venture capital industry is quite capable of carrying out its affairs business to business without any regulatory intervention. We should deregulate venture capital and take it out of the net.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085.1/10">Why do we need to regulate business to business transactions in financial services? We have a great City of London, but people tell me now that it is getting too regulated and quite a lot of the best innovation in the City of London now is available for markets outside Britain but not for the British marketplace, for the simple reason that there is too much regulatory hassle to go through to get the new idea agreed, and further elaborate restrictions on sale, offer and advertisement. Would it not be possible for Ministers to decide that we do not need to regulate business to business, professional to professional transactions in financial services, and exempt them from all the current regulatory hassle?</p>
	<p pid="a.1085.1/11">Why do we need regulation on data protection? This was not on the original list of 63 items that the official Opposition sponsored, but we have a clumsy system of data protection. It is one of the bigger burdens mentioned in the list referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire in his opening remarks&mdash;over &pound;5.5 billion of compliance, and I do not see that it necessarily offers the protection that the Government have in mind.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085.1/12">When one looks at the impact of regulation, one often finds that it does not protect the data against abuse by criminals and potential criminals and it does not necessarily inform the public, but it represents a very large burden indeed. How many times have hon. Members tried to use data protection and freedom of information to find out legitimate things from the Government only to find that, under existing legislation, there are ways to block that legitimate inquiry and stifle one's appetite for information? Data protection certainly needs a haircut, even if the Government do not want to go as far as reducing it entirely. It seems a disproportionately expensive and complex machine for a rather limited goal.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085.1/13">If we look at EU regulations, we see marvellous examples of the legislative pen working overtime. It is one of the great pities of both the Brussels government machine and of the British government machine that they are so inefficient at doing all the things a Government ought to be doing, apart from legislating, where they seem to be highly productive and capable of churning out large amounts of regulation and law.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085.1/14">Built into the EU system is the idea of the presidency. The new country assuming the presidency of the Community for six months is always told by astute officials in Brussels that its presidency will be judged by how much new regulation it manages to get on the statute book. Each one is given a suitable challenge, sometimes pandering to its inclinations, so the British presidency would be told that some measure was market-opening and a French presidency would be told that a measure was market-closing, and they would be encouraged to go about the business of trying to get it through. Sometimes the Commission has an even better sense of humour, as in the case of the last British presidency, where it set them ridiculous things to do, like giving away the British rebate, and&mdash;surprise, surprise&mdash;the British Government fell for it. One could not make it up.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085.1/15">The idea of the presidency is used to make sure there is more regulation than we need. The British Government are always telling us they are leaders in Europe, so why can they not find a way of saying to colleague members of the European Union that maybe we have enough European law now, or that if we want a little more European law, perhaps we should take some off first, to make room for it?</p>

	<p pid="a.1099.1/1">The intellectual paucity of that remark is such that I shall not even respond to it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1099.1/2">After much talk on deregulation, the Government must deliver, and companies must see that delivery and start to feel tangible benefits for their businesses and the economy. In his opening remarks, the Minister said that the Bill aims to deliver better regulation, but my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham was right to ask how it could do so when it contains nothing that relates directly to deregulation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1099.1/3">We remain concerned that the Bill does not do enough to reduce regulation or create the light-touch deregulatory culture in Whitehall that is so needed. In addition, we are worried about the constitutional problems that it raises. That concern was shared by many hon. Members, including <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1864" name="Alan Williams">the right hon. Member for Swansea, West (Mr. Alan Williams)</phrase> and the hon. Members for Cannock Chase, for Plymouth, Devonport (Alison Seabeck), for Somerton and Frome and for Cambridge (David Howarth), as well as my hon. Friends the Members for Harwich and for Christchurch, and my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham. Indeed, the hon. Member for Cambridge went further and said that the importance of the constitutional issue was such that it should be reviewed and debated on the Floor of the House. We agree, and hope that the Government will make a positive response to that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.1099.1/4">Part 1 of the Bill supersedes the RRO provisions in the Regulatory Reform Act 2001, and gives the Government wide powers to reform legislation and implement recommendations from the Law Commissioners. According to the Regulatory Reform Committee's report published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-31">31 January</phrase>&mdash;I congratulate the Committee on a thorough piece of work&mdash;part 1 is explicitly less focused on regulation than the 2001 Act. There is nothing in the Bill that requires orders to have a deregulatory element. Despite the assurance that the Committee says it needs fully to support the Bill, the so-called safeguards are&mdash;according to the report&mdash;dwarfed when set against the increased powers that the Bill will provide to Ministers. My hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch elaborated fluently on that theme. I also agree with the comments by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome that if something looks too good to be true, it probably is. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1927" name="Stephen Hammond">My hon. Friend the Member for Wimbledon (Stephen Hammond)</phrase>, a member of the Committee, made a similar point.</p>
	<p pid="a.1099.1/5">We should be aware of the recommendations of the Committee. In particular, it noted that as a matter of urgency the Cabinet Office should retrospectively assess the estimates, costs and benefits that have previously been submitted to the House for each regulatory reform order, with a view to establishing whether the estimated savings have been realised. Several hon. Members also noted that the breadth of powers granted could be used in areas that are politically sensitive, not least in relation to the use of criminal penalties. That is an issue that will have to be addressed carefully in Committee. The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome said that part 1 is unacceptable as it stands, and we agree.</p>
	<p pid="a.1099.1/6">Part 2 introduces statutory principles of good regulation which are to be used to inform a code of practice to which specified regulations must have regard. Although we welcome that, we have explained today the need to go much further to create the sort of light touch regulation business needs and to address the concerns that my hon. Friend the Member for Wimbledon expressed about super-regulators.</p>
	<p pid="a.1099.1/7">Part 3 of the Bill relates to legislation emanating from the EU. We have said that we support the idea of making it easier for UK institutions to deal with EU legislation, but&mdash;as my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham and my hon. Friend the Member for Harwich asked&mdash;how will that actually work? As my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire asked, what are the rules and schemes for EU law referred to in the Bill? We need to know.</p>
	<p pid="a.1099.1/8">The Bill has a striking resemblance to parts of other Bills before this House and the other place. Those need to be looked at in context to highlight the growing constitutional trend away from primary legislation. The Company Law Reform Bill and the Government of Wales Bill both include a similar means of introducing orders through forms of delegated legislation. Part 31 of the Company Law Reform Bill is described in its explanatory notes as</p>
	<p pid="a.1099.1/9" class="indent">&quot;a new power to reform company law by means of a special form of secondary legislation.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1099.1/10">It constitutes a significant change to legislation and was described by Lord Freeman on Second Reading in the other place as &quot;a parliamentary outrage&quot;. He then quoted the recommendation of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee to strike out part 31. While those observations are in the context of the Company Law Reform Bill, they tackle many of the same questions of delegated legislation that arise in the Bill before us.</p>
	<p pid="a.1099.1/11">The procedure proposed in part 31 of the Company Law Reform Bill is similar, but not identical to that proposed for regulatory reform orders. The document to be laid before Parliament, for example, is broadly the equivalent of the statement that is to be laid under regulatory reform orders. Although there are procedural differences, part 31 orders are comparable to clause 16 super-affirmative resolution procedure regulatory reform orders. Is the Department for Trade and Industry not talking to the Cabinet Office? For instance, the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee concluded that the existing regulatory reform order procedure is not suitable for large and controversial measures, such as those that may be the subject of part 31 orders. Will the Minister explain when it will be acceptable to use one or the other order? It is bizarre that the Government should introduce three similar but varying super-statutory instrument regimes at the same time. That could cause confusion and conflicting procedures. How does the Minister reconcile that? I would be grateful if he could write to me explaining the rationale behind that very important issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.1099.1/12">Despite the undeniable crossover between the three sets of orders that come from such legislation, we need significantly to increase accountability in any event, as the right hon. Member for Swansea, West said, so that the Bill can be used to control a huge increase in Executive power. That could include limiting the orders to deregulation matters and then to genuinely minor and uncontroversial matters, with veto provisions either in the Bill or perhaps in Standing Orders&mdash;we have yet to debate that&mdash;while recognising the complexities that were noted by my hon. Friend the Member for Wimbledon. It could also include increasing the period allowed for parliamentary consideration, or reducing the subjective ministerial aspect of decision making.</p>
	<p pid="a.1099.1/13">As the hon. Member for Cannock Chase said, those powers could include determining whether an order or primary legislation is appropriate in the first place, or whether to use a mandatory majority or unanimous votes in the relevant Select Committees of ei<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1633" name="David Gauke">ther or both Houses, as my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke)</phrase> suggested. They could include inserting retrospective scrutiny, as mentioned by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome. To answer the questions on delivery, quite rightly posed by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham, they could even include creating a body similar to the proposed company law and reporting commission to review law and conduct independent consultation and propose changes likely to be implemented by order. So there will be much to consider in Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.1099.1/14">Although we acknowledge the Minister's hope to reduce unnecessary red tape and burdens on business, the public sector and voluntary organisations, we want assurances from the Government that that will happen with the Bill. Proper protections are needed in determining whether regulations are necessary in the circumstances, and we remain concerned about the breadth of the order-making powers that the Bill confers. It is vital to review how the Bill will work in practice, which is why we shall request that a sunset clause be inserted. The Bill is of major constitutional significance in changing the way that legislation is processed, taking the onus away from Parliament and directing it to Ministers and Whitehall, so it will be fully reviewed by us in Committee and reconsidered as a whole during its later stages.</p>

	<p pid="a.1108.4/1">I hope the authorities in Northamptonshire will listen carefully to what my hon. Friend said. I do not want any library closed, as I shall go on to say. Unless the Government act more decisively, we could see many more public libraries start to wither away much more rapidly than they have done.</p>
	<p pid="a.1108.4/2">What have the Government been doing? They began with their five-year plan. We are familiar with that in various Departments. That is not a criticism; there should be a plan. They issued a document, &quot;Framework for the Future&quot;, then they got going on the library service itself, with a series of Whitehall-driven initiatives. In 1998, we had annual library plans. In 2001, public library standards were issued. Then we had public library position statements and in 2004 public library service standards. Those have been superseded, I understand, by what is described as a new suite of best value performance indicators within the comprehensive performance assessment culture block. Next year, I understand, there will be public library impact measures.</p>
	<p pid="a.1108.4/3">A blizzard of paper, but while all that has been issued, the service has in general terms continued to decline. The Audit Commission reported that half of all library services were inadequate. In an excellent report last year, the Culture, Media and Sport Committee stated that it was</p>
	<p pid="a.1108.4/4" class="indent">&quot;dismayed by the chopping and changing that has taken place&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1108.4/5">in Government policy. Most seriously of all, its report has been badly neglected. I have rarely seen&mdash;this is not a criticism of the present Minister; it was probably his predecessor&mdash;a more pathetic response than the Government's response to that Select Committee report in Cm 6648.</p>
	<p pid="a.1108.4/6">When asked to consider common processing, the Government responded:</p>
	<p pid="a.1108.4/7" class="indent">&quot;We would want to see common standards adopted&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1108.4/8">On the recommendation on collective purchasing, they stated that they</p>
	<p pid="a.1108.4/9" class="indent">&quot;would wish to provoke a discussion about which model is most likely to succeed&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1108.4/10">not, I think, the smack of firm government. On the decline in borrowing, we have the platitude</p>
	<p pid="a.1108.4/11" class="indent">&quot;the fall in issues may be due to the service not keeping up with social trends&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1108.4/12">That will not do. Public libraries are not a purely local service. Councils have a duties to provide it, but the Minister has a duty to ensure that it is provided. Under the Public Libraries and Museums Act 1964&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1108.4/13" class="indent">&quot;An Act to place the public library service provided by local authorities . . . under the superintendence of the Secretary of State&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1108.4/14">it was clearly laid down in clause 1 that</p>
	<p pid="a.1108.4/15" class="indent">&quot;it shall be the duty of the Secretary of State to superintend, and promote the improvement of, the public library service provided by local authorities in England and Wales&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1108.4/16">We are not discussing the maintenance of the drains or refuse collection. The service is provided locally and Parliament insisted that the Secretary of State has a national responsibility to superintend it in the 1964 Act. Under the 1964 Act, the Minister has powers to intervene, and, as we have heard, he also has funding streams at his disposal. The Government must examine the public libraries service and convince hon. Members that they are properly discharging their duty to superintend it. I have read the Minister's speeches and welcome his personal commitment to the libraries service, so I hope that he will not take it amiss when I say that warm words are not enough and that I want to see the Government act.</p>
	<p pid="a.1108.4/17">I want the Minister specifically to consider five things. First, will he stop the proposed closures in Northamptonshire, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1915" name="Peter Bone">my hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone)</phrase> mentioned and elsewhere? He has a duty under the 1964 Act to intervene where the service is not being properly provided. I understand that he has partly exercised that duty by writing to the library authorities, and I thank him for doing so. I hope that his letter made it clear that he is ready to exercise his power to intervene under the 1964 Act, if a programme of wholesale closures is introduced in the next few months.</p>
	<p pid="a.1108.4/18">Secondly, I hope that he will do more to protect book spending and reverse the decline in spending on books. If the Minister can find the money to provide new technologies such as the internet and support services that allow families to access libraries, surely it is not beyond the wit of the Government to do more to protect the core spend on books.</p>

	<p pid="a.1111.1/1">I certainly endorse that. There is a temptation, of course, for those who want to renew their library services to add additional facilities. The new technologies are important. Other information services linking up with Government information streams can successfully be provided in libraries. Nevertheless, the Select Committee came to the conclusion that my hon. Friend articulated so well&mdash;that books must be at the core of the library service. New technologies come and go&mdash;that is why they are new&mdash;but in the end books and access to books must lie at the heart of the service.</p>
	<p pid="a.1111.1/2">I have given the Minister four or five things that I would like him to consider and act upon. I hope that he will now apply Government more actively to what can be done to improve the service. If we let local libraries continue to decline, we will be failing not only those of us in this House who love libraries, and people who choose to borrow from libraries all their lives, but people who need libraries: those who do not have the luxury of books at home, or quiet places to study them; those who need access to books after school or during the school holidays; those who are studying after work towards better qualifications; and those who are driven to explore the world of information and reference that is available to them. If libraries are service stations of the mind, it should not be left to council bureaucrats to restrict access to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.1111.1/3">Libraries are as much part of our education system and common culture as they are cherished parts of our local community. If they wither away, we lose part of our cultural capital and the local points of reference between the knowledge and literature of the past and our present generation, whom those stocks should enrich. Public libraries are not the council's to cut nor the Government's to neglect. They belong to us all.</p>
	<p pid="a.1111.1/4" class="italic">It being Six o'clock, the motion for the Adjournment of the House lapsed, without Question put.</p>
	<p pid="a.1111.1/5" class="italic">Motion made, and Question proposed, That this House do now adjourn.&mdash;[Mr. Cawsey.]</p>
