<p>The modifications in the practice relating to Appeal Tribunals under the Unemployment Assistance Act to which the hon.

<p>asked the Minister of Labour whether he is aware that large numbers of chauffeurs have become unemployed as a consequence of petrol rationing and of personal economy by private motor car owners; and will he


endeavour to secure employment for some of these men by the release of such ambulance, lorry and motor car drivers as are now employed on air-raid precautions and other war work and who are in receipt of wages but who do not normally require to work for wages?</p>

<p>I am aware that the number of chauffeurs registered as unemployed has increased since the outbreak of war. Every effort is being made to find them work either in their own occupation or in any alternative occupation for which they may appear to be suitable. As regards the second part of the question, I have consulted my right hon. Friend the Minister of Home Security, and I understand that he would not feel justified in suggesting the replacement of competent drivers who have volunteered and have now been trained in air-raid precautions or other war work, by others who have not had the specialised training required for the duties involved.</p>

<p>Is it not a fact that these chauffeurs do not require any training, because it is their living, the work they have done all their lives, and that as these jobs have been taken by people who do not require wages these chauffeurs have to go on the dole?</p>

<p>My right hon. Friend does not take that view at all. The question I am asked to answer is about air-raid precautions. There is a double side to it. There is the question of driving and competency to carry out other work.</p>

The latest information available relates to 3rd July, 1939; at which date the number of men employed under the scheme was 327,779 as compared with 318,286 at 4th July, 1938. As regards the second part of the ques-

tion, I have no doubt that the scheme has been of great value to disabled ex-service men.</p>

<p>Yes, Sir. As has been stated by representatives of His Majesty's Government at meetings of the governing body of the International Labour Office on more than one occasion in the past year, the Government fully approve the decision reached by the governing body at its meeting in February, 1939, that, in the event of war, it should attempt to function as completely and efficiently as possible. Since the outbreak of war, there have been two meetings of the Emergency Committee of the


governing body and a representative of the Government has travelled to Geneva to attend each of them. He has had the opportunity of reaffirming at those meetings the Government's intention of cooperating to the fullest extent possible in present circumstances with the organisation. There is being held at present in Havana the second regional conference of the American States members of the organisation and the Government's support of the organisation has been further demonstrated by the attendance of an observer at this conference. It follows, from what I have said, that, in the view of His Majesty's Government, it is important that funds should be available to enable the work of the organisation to continue on as effective a basis as possible, and it is their hope that all States members, as they themselves, will be prepared to do their part in this respect. The representative of His Majesty's Government on the fourth committee, which is meeting early in December to discuss the League budget, as a whole, including that of the I.L.O., will be instructed to bear in mind the importance of such considerations, with a view to overcoming such difficulties as may arise in the course of the coming year.</p>

<p>The basis of employment in the Emergency Medical Service of house officers was at the outset &#x00A3;350 per annum, normally on a three months' contract, plus board and lodgings or an allowance in lieu. This flat rate was somewhat in excess of the rates paid by voluntary hospitals, though these vary widely according to the type of hospital. This arrangement has now been reviewed and it has been agreed with the advisory committee, with which I have recently been in consultation, that no further individual enrolments of house officers in the Emergency Medical Service should be made, but that hospitals should receive a payment equivalent to &#x00A3;200 per annum for each of their house officers who are required for whole-time work under the emergency hospital scheme.

are capable of satisfactory expansion have been expanded. As regards the diminution of staff and equipment, the majority of hospitals inside the County of London, whether voluntary or municipal, have been reduced.</p>

<p>asked the Home Secretary whether he has now made inquiries into the summary dismissal of Charles Fowler, of Liversedge, Spen Valley, from his post of air warden on the ground that he had written a letter to the local newspaper criticising the air-raid precautions administration; and whether he can make any statement on the matter?</p>

<p>The dismissal of a member of the public air-raid precautions services is a matter for the local authority concerned, in which I have no jurisdiction to intervene.

<p>It was, perhaps, very unfortunate that a form was used which had been prepared for general issue and that paragraph was struck out.

<p>I have no reason to suppose that any danger will arise from the option permitted to motorists to use the new head-lamp mask on either the near-side or the off-side lamp.

<p>The officer in question is aged 28 years and was appointed on 2nd September, 1939; by education and secretarial experience she was fully qualified for the duties of the post she fills. This is a temporary appointment and, in accordance with the usual custom, she commenced at the minimum salary for her grade. On the satisfactory completion of a month's probation, she was, in accordance with the common practice, graded for pay commensurate with the duties she was performing. Her duties require her to act as personal secre-


tary to her father, and my personal investigation reveals that she is carrying out exactly the same duties as her predecessors. As regards the last paragraph in the hon. Member's question, there was no transfer of any established officer to create this vacancy. Her immediate predecessor vacated the post on being selected in the ordinary course for promotion to the rank of a higher executive officer. This carried an increase of salary from &#x00A3;418 per annum to &#x00A3;500, rising to &#x00A3;650. The lady in question is receiving a salary of &#x00A3;200.</p>

<p>This case has been mentioned in a local newspaper as though it were a recent event, but, in fact, it occurred on 15th August last. I find that the question of confirming the award of the visiting justices was carefully considered, but in view of elements of doubt about some of the circumstances of the case, it was decided that it would be right for the offence to be dealt with by a form of punishment other than corporal punishment.</p>

<p>On the outbreak of war steps were taken to reduce to a minimum the population of the prisons in the more vulnerable areas, especially in London. For this purpose, prisoners were transferred from the prisons in the big towns to other prisons; and, in order to find the necessary space for these emergency transfers, a certain number of prisoners who were nearing the end of their sentences were released. Some of the prisoners transferred have resented their removal to places at a distance from their homes, where it is less easy for them to receive visits from friends or relatives, and have regarded it as a grievance that, while some of their fellow prisoners had their sentences shortened, they themselves have received no similar benefit. As a result, there has been trouble in some of the provincial prisons, and a certain number of prisoners have sought to demonstrate their resentment by shouting in a disorderly fashion, and sometimes by breaking cell windows and smashing cell equipment. Appropriate disciplinary measures have been and are being taken against those who have been guilty of disorderly and insubordinate conduct. The emergency arrangements which had to be made on the outbreak of war threw a considerable strain on the prison staffs, and a word of commendation is, I think, due to them. They are dealing with the present difficulties resolutely, steadily and prudently.</p>

<p>Yes, Sir. This question is under close review, but it has been decided that present circumstances do not warrant any restriction or prohibition on the slaughter of heifer calves.

<p>The information in my possession indicates that sales for slaughter of fat cows during October were heavier than normal, though I have no information to show how far this increase could be attributed to slaughterings of in-calf cows. The increase was, no doubt, due to higher prices for fat-cows, caused by local and temporary shortages of imported meat. Larger supplies of imported meat are now available, and prices of fat cows have since fallen, with a consequent reduction in the number of such animals sold for slaughter.</p>

<p>I fully recognise the importance of this matter to many women whose loyalty to their country of birth is strong. Whereas in the last war naturalisation was granted only to women separated from their husbands, I do not propose to adopt the same restriction now, but will limit my discretion only to the extent that is necessary to avoid impairing measures of control which must be maintained in time of war over persons of enemy nationality. If a British-born woman is living with a German or Austrian husband whom it is necessary on security grounds to subject to the special restrictions applicable to enemy aliens it would not as a rule be right to naturalise the wife and therefore to relax the restrictions which are applicable to such a household; but many of the Germans and Austrians now here are in sympathy with this country in the struggle in which we are engaged, and arrangements have been made to exempt such persons from the special restrictions applicable to enemy aliens. In such cases no security measures would be impaired by naturalising a British-born wife. I have accordingly decided that any such woman may, as soon as her husband has been exempted from the special restrictions, apply for naturalisation and that arrangements shall be made to deal with such applications expeditiously.</p>

<p>The windows on the lower floors of this prison are protected by sandbags, and consequently at such times of the day as prisoners are in their cells artificial light has to be used. This prisoner was&#x2014;in accordance with practice &#x2014;allowed out of his cell during the working hours. The records show that 18 days after his admission he applied for a change of sheets. It was not possible to comply with his request at once (the emergency arrangements made in September with regard to the prison population had thrown an extra strain on the prison laundry) but his request was granted as soon as possible. He made no complaint that his cell was verminous and no confirmation can be found of this suggestion.

<p>When a person is brought back to a prison after being out of the prison for production before a court or for any other similar reason, it is the uniform practice that he: shall, before going to his cell, pass through the reception office so that any property he has with him may be checked and that the medical officer may see him. While prisoners are waiting to be seen by the medical officer they are accommodated in apartments such as are described in the question and are given papers and books to read. On one of the days in question there were 66 prisoners who had to be dealt with in accordance with this procedure, and it is possible that some of them were kept waiting for two or three hours. There was no differentiation between the treatment of this prisoner and of all other persons admitted to the prison.</p>

<p>Yes, Sir. As I have already indicated, His Majesty's Government desires to utilise the services of friendly aliens in any direction in which they can be advantageously employed without prejudice to the interests of British nationals. To this end I have made an Order under the Aliens Order under which aliens who arrived in this country before 3rd September last, and whose stay is subject to conditions, may take employment in Great Britain. They will only be able to do so, however, if permission is granted by my right hon. Friend the Minister of Labour and National Service. The permission will be given by means of an endorsement on the alien's certificate of registration for a specific employment and it will be a requirement that any subsequent change of employment must be approved by the Minister in the same way. This scheme will apply to Germans and Austrians who have been exempted by a tribunal from the restrictions applicable

to enemy aliens in the same way as it applies to other aliens. My right hon. Friend the Minister of Labour and National Service informs me that in considering whether permission should be granted in any case full regard will be had to the views of trade unions or similar organisations.</p>

<p>While it is not to be expected that the present moment opportunities for employment will be available for any large number of aliens covered by the Order, the services of certain classes of alien workers possessing high technical skill may be found immediately useful. Instructions to the local offices of the Ministry of Labour and National Service contain specific directions that local officers should not submit an alien for a vacancy unless they are satisfied that no suitable British worker is available. As a measure of security the Order also requires that an alien shall not without special permit take employment in a prohibited place within the meaning of the Official Secrets Act, 1911, as subsequently amended, or a protected place within the meaning of Regulation 12 of the Defence Regulations, or in any of the auxiliary war services set out in a schedule to the Order.</p>
