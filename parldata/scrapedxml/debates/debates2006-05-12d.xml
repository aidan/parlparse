	<p pid="d.649.0/1">Our right hon. and noble Friend Lord Lawson has experience as not only Chancellor of the Exchequer but Secretary of State for Energy. He also has been serving on a Committee in the other place considering the economic effects of global warming and the best cost-effective measures that can be taken. As my hon. Friend will know, the conclusion from the Committee's report is that we should be investing in dealing with the consequences of climate change and global warming rather than trying to spend all our resources on fighting global warming on the doubtful premise that it is all man-made and that by changing our behaviour in this country we can change the planet. That is what our right hon. and noble Friend has been considering in depth in the other place. It is with reference to the report and to the evidence taken by that Committee that he writes his article, which I commend to the House and to my hon. Friend.</p>

He states:</p>
	<p pid="d.649.0/4" class="indent">&quot;Norwegian glaciers are especially complex, some advancing and others retreating, depending on the balance between winter snow and summer melt. From 1930 to 1990, most retreated. However, from 1963 to 2000, maritime glaciers tended to grow significantly, like the Nigardsbreen, which has advanced 280 metres in two decades.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="d.650.1/1">Again, the hon. Gentleman has made an assertion based on the work of the intergovernmental panel on climate change. Since he places such emphasis on that organisation's work, I hope that he therefore accepts the findings of its draft 2007 report, which is available on the internet, which states:</p>
	<p pid="d.650.1/2" class="indent">&quot;Even if greenhouse gases level off now, warming will continue at about the current rate for several decades.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="d.650.1/3">That is new information since we started this debate on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-24">24 March</phrase>. The consequence of that statement is that warming is inevitable and unavoidable for several decades, which surely makes the case stronger for investing in combating the consequences of warming rather than engaging in a futile attempt to prevent it in the first place.</p>
	<p pid="d.650.1/4">A second change since <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-24">24 March</phrase> was the publication of a letter from 41 distinguished international scientists in <i> The Sunday Telegraph </i>on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-23">23 April</phrase>, which is St. George's day&mdash;perhaps my hon. Friend the Member for Bexhill and Battle was celebrating St. George's day on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-23">23 April</phrase> and did not see it. The letter stated:</p>
	<p pid="d.650.1/5" class="indent">&quot;Global climate changes all the time due to natural causes and the human impact still remains impossible to distinguish from this natural 'noise'&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="d.650.1/6">The scientists also noted:</p>
	<p pid="d.650.1/7" class="indent">&quot;observational evidence does not support today's computer climate models, so there is little reason to trust model predictions of the future.&quot;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-05-12d.653.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1502" speakername="Christopher Chope" colnum="653"  time="012:42:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060512/debtext/60512-0009.htm#06051273001000">
	<p pid="d.653.1/1">Exactly&mdash;the Bill does not set the price, but it enables the Government to do so, which is my worry. The microgeneration industry's argument is that at the moment, the market is insufficiently active and needs a bit more subsidy&mdash;in other words, taxpayers' money to prop it up. If the Minister assures us in his closing remarks that no such subsidy, or cross-subsidy, will go into the microgeneration buy-back, I shall be delighted, but I shall also be extremely surprised. My understanding is that the Bill's whole purpose is to facilitate cross-subsidy of, and taxpayer subsidy of, the microgeneration industry. So the Bill could add to the cost burden on those who are least able to bear it. I hope that the Government can allay my concerns in this regard.</p>
	<p pid="d.653.1/2">I turn to one or two specific issues arising from the Bill. Clause 10, which was clause 9 before Third Reading&mdash;I am glad that the Bill was reprinted following its amendment&mdash;deals with an issue that we debated at length on Report: permitted development rights. I am pleased to say that the Minister at the then Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1762" name="Yvette Cooper">the hon. Member for Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper)</phrase>, wrote to me on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-10">10 May</phrase>, saying that concern had been expressed on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-17">17 March</phrase> that this clause might allow the installation of very large structures, such as 50 kW wind turbines, in people's back gardens.</p>
	<p pid="d.653.1/3">The letter states, helpfully:</p>
	<p pid="d.653.1/4" class="indent">&quot;The Bill requires the Secretary of State to form a view as to what provision should be made in secondary legislation to further facilitate the installation of microgeneration equipment by removing unnecessary planning controls. The aim will also be to ensure that planning authorities and householders have a clearer idea of the situations in which microgeneration equipment can be installed without the need for a planning application.</p>
	<p pid="d.653.1/5" class="indent">In conducting the review ODPM will consider carefully the impacts of possible changes. We want to ensure that sufficient control is retained over permitted development to protect the reasonable interests of neighbours, the environment andthe wider community. We will, therefore, have regard toamenity considerations for the permitted development of microgeneration technology, including the impact on visual appearance, and the implications of any potential nuisance, such as noise, vibration and 'flicker'.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="d.653.1/6">That is an important concession by the Government and I am glad to get it, even though it took the best part of two months to provide.</p>
	<p pid="d.653.1/7">The letter continues:</p>
	<p pid="d.653.1/8" class="indent">&quot;Consideration will also be paid to how permitted development limits should be varied for development in sensitive locations including National Parks, areas of outstanding natural beauty and conservation areas, works affecting listed buildings and their setting, and developments in Green Belts. A key part of the review will be a full public consultation on what might be permitted. Once responses...have been considered the Secretary of State will report to Parliament on the recommendations of the review and set out any proposals for change.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="d.653.1/9">That will allay much of the concern that has been expressed about the possible implications of clause 10.</p>
	<p pid="d.653.1/10">The other specific issue that I wished to raise is the time limit for prosecutions in clause 13. I mentioned earlier my hope that the other place would amend the Bill, and I had clause 13 specifically in mind. The clause would allow prosecutions for contravention of certain building regulations to be started within two years, beginning on the day on which the offence was committed. It would also allow the relevant date for assessing that to mean</p>
	<p pid="d.653.1/11" class="indent">&quot;the date on which evidence sufficient to justify the proceedings comes to the knowledge of the person commencing the proceedings.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="d.653.1/12">The sole judge of whether and when sufficient evidence is known will be the local authority, which will also be the very body charged with bringing the proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="d.653.1/13">Clause 13(5) states that</p>
	<p pid="d.653.1/14" class="indent">&quot;evidence is to be regarded for the purposes of subsection (4) above&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="d.653.1/15">which I have just quoted&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="d.653.1/16" class="indent">&quot;as sufficient to justify the proceedings if in the opinion of the proper officer or an authorised officer it is sufficient to justify the proceedings&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="d.653.1/17">That is a dangerous precedent, and when <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1459" name="Eric Forth">my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst(Mr. Forth)</phrase> expressed his concerns to the shadow Attorney-General, he said that he had not previously been aware of it, but he also thought that it was a matter for concern. I hope that that concern will be articulated in the other place and result in amendment of the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="d.653.1/18">One of the advantages of the changes in procedure is that we will have the opportunity to consider Lords amendments to private Members' Bills in October, which should allow this Bill to be considered in depth in the other place. If the Minister wishes to try to justify the draconian powers in clause 13, let him. The Bill is based on a fallacy, or at least an unproven hypothesis. We cannot lightly dismiss the views of a host of international scientists who are not self-serving like the scientists of the intergovernmental panel on climate change, who consider only their own model, which is based on various hypotheses. It is rather as if we were to say that the Treasury economic model must be right because it was produced by the Treasury, when we know very well that on many occasions the Treasury model has turned out to be wrong.</p>
	<p pid="d.653.1/19">Many other scientists, who are not involved with that self-serving organisation, have looked independently at the data and reached different conclusions about the impact of man-made contributions to climate change and about the consequences of global warming. It is disappointing that the Bill's main purpose is based on a fallacy.</p>
	<p pid="d.653.1/20">As a result of the debate, I hope that many more people will make <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1399" name="Andrew Selous">the sort of challenge that my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous)</phrase> said that he had received during the general election campaign. They will wake up to what is happening and realise how certain pressure groups are trying to use climate change to delude the public and justify new regulations and burdens on our people, resulting in deprivation of liberty. Many people are involved in that sinister process, and many who should know better are being caught up by it.</p>
	<p pid="d.653.1/21">I can best conclude my remarks by drawing the House's attention to the quotation from Schopenhauer at the beginning of Lord Lawson's article in <i> the</i><i> Spectator:</i></p>
	<p pid="d.653.1/22" class="indent">&quot;There is no opinion, however absurd, which men will not readily embrace as soon as they can be brought to the conviction that it is generally adopted.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="d.653.1/23">I hope that many Members who have already spoken will reflect on the danger of falling into a cosy seductive consensus trap.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-05-12d.664.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1828" speakername="Alan Whitehead" colnum="664"  time="013:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060512/debtext/60512-0010.htm#06051273001015">
	<p pid="d.664.2/1">Indeed.</p>
	<p pid="d.664.2/2">The number of provisions in the Bill has expanded, and I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith for accepting a numberof clauses from my private Member's Bill, the Management of Energy in Buildings Bill, which unfortunately did not reach this stage. We now have a Bill that is comprehensive, wide-ranging and far-sighted in its proposals for the development of microgeneration and for the role that microgeneration might play in our domestic and commercial energy supply, and in the vital task of combating climate change while ensuring that the lights stay on.</p>
	<p pid="d.664.2/3">There is an alternative way of expressing the statistic in the Energy Saving Trust report, which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1502" name="Christopher Chope">the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope)</phrase> regrettably underplayed. The report says that 40 per cent. of the UK's energy supplies could be provided by microgeneration within 40 years, which is an enormous amount to contemplate. I hope that the Bill will pave the way to that kind of development, through targets, community developments, changes in planning regulations and a variety of other devices.</p>
	<p pid="d.664.2/4">A large number of important contributions have been made to this Third Reading debate and, importantly, most right hon. and hon. Members across the Chamber have agreed on the direction and content of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1459" name="Eric Forth">the Bill. The right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth)</phrase> is, unfortunately, also unable to be here today. In his brief contribution to the beginning of the debate on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-17">17 March</phrase>, he said, with what I might call an air of foreboding, that there was</p>
	<p pid="d.664.2/5" class="indent">&quot;a cornucopia of important issues that we can and should explore on Third Reading&quot;.&mdash;[<i> Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-17">17 March 2006</phrase>; Vol. 443, c. 1778.]</p>
	<p pid="d.664.2/6">I am sure that hon. Members will agree that we have explored a cornucopia of important issues, and that we have done so in a way that has united our endeavours on the Bill rather than divided them.</p>
	<p pid="d.664.2/7">It is fair to say that, just a few years ago, the subjects covered by the Bill would have been regarded as unfashionable, unfamiliar or outlandish. Terms such as &quot;dynamic demand&quot;, &quot;sustainable buildings&quot;, &quot;community sustainable energy&quot;, &quot;renewable heat&quot;and &quot;green certificates&quot; have come into thepublic consciousness&mdash;and, indeed, legislative consciousness&mdash;only relatively recently. As my hon. Friend the Minister has said, however, they are now moving into the mainstream, and I hope that the passage of the Bill will aid the process still further. These technologies and processes can make a real difference both in keeping the lights on and in leading us to a new, sustainable low-carbon economy. They also change the way in which people see their energy use. Through such technologies and processes, people really take ownership of their energy use and generation.</p>
	<p pid="d.664.2/8">In considering that climate change is a global challenge and an individual obligation, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1389" name="Maria Miller">the hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mrs. Miller)</phrase> reminded us, perhaps hon. Members will consider the role of microgeneration in helping to deal with a challenge that I hope all of them will take up&mdash;that of reducing their own personal carbon dioxide emissions by25 per cent. over five years. That can be achieved by, among other things, the domestic installation of microgeneration.</p>
	<p pid="d.664.2/9">I commend the Bill to the House, and I hope that I am not too optimistic in expressing the view that it will receive unanimous support in the Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="d.664.2/10" class="italic"> Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="d.664.2/11" class="italic"> Bill accordingly read the Third time, and passed.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-05-12d.679.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1622" speakername="Michael Jabez Foster" colnum="679"  time="014:35:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060512/debtext/60512-0013.htm#06051273001044">
	<p pid="d.679.2/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to celebrate the health service in Hastings and Rye, and the improvements that have taken place in the past eight years. Primary care services have been transformed, and in the main, general practitioners offer a more comprehensive service than ever before. The Marlborough health centre that was opened 18 months ago by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1958" name="John Reid">my right hon. Friend the Member for Airdrie and Shotts (John Reid)</phrase> is a fine example of the co-ordinated services that can be provided at local level. We look forward to three other such centres in the town.</p>
	<p pid="d.679.2/2">The local Conquest hospital is performing well. As a result of the hard work and dedication of our magnificent staff, no one waits more than 13 weeks for out-patient treatment&mdash;the average wait is six weeks&mdash;and no one waits more than six months for surgery, with an average wait of eight weeks. In the past two years, an MRI scanner has been replaced and a new CT scanner has been installed. We have an ageing population, but a new cardiac care unit ensures that local people have access to life-saving treatment in their own locality. All of that is possible because of the Labour Government's reform and investment after years of under-investment. Our local primary care trusts&mdash;Hastings and St. Leonards and Bexhill and Rother&mdash;under the chairmanship of Marie Casey and John Barnes, with Toni Wilkinson as joint chief executive, have delivered precisely what the Government required.</p>
	<p pid="d.679.2/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1407" name="Gregory Barker">The hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle (Gregory Barker)</phrase> has remained in the Chamber, and I suspect that he will support what I am about to say. Hastings, which was the 34th poorest town in Britain, has received significant extra funding to take account of the more challenging health outcomes for people living in less affluent areas. Why would anyone want to change a system or programme of delivery that is working? Three distinct areas of concern arise from the strategic health authority's proposal, which has caused disquiet&mdash;indeed, outright opposition&mdash;among local practitioners and the public. I hope that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1544" name="Rosie Winterton">the Minister of State, my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton)</phrase>, will assuage our fears about the restructuring of local PCTs, the funding regime and the targeting of resources, and the reorganisation of Conquest hospital services, including the accident and emergency department.</p>
	<p pid="d.679.2/4">The future of our PCT is important to local delivery. The Government recognise the need to target resources on the most needy and to use local commissioning for that purpose, which is why they set up local PCTs, such as Hastings and St. Leonards and Bexhill and Rother, that can work to that end. Hastings and St. Leonards PCT has not only worked effectively over the past four or five years but is on budget. It has shared resources with Bexhill and Rother PCT, and has a joint senior management so that it can secure the benefits of local delivery on an appropriate scale. The outcomes, such as a fall in teenage pregnancies, have proved the effectiveness of that arrangement.</p>
	<p pid="d.679.2/5">To fulfil the Government's ambition of commissioning a patient-led NHS, the SHA suggested that there was a need to create an all-county organisation to the incredulity of local representatives, including MPs and the local councils. We have made our objections known, and I thank Ministers in the Department for insisting that the SHA consultation should consider retaining a local PCT in East Sussex to cover Hastings and Rother. That gave us considerable hope.</p>
	<p pid="d.679.2/6">Unfortunately, although almost every organisation supported the retention of an excellent local service, the SHA has now recommended its original proposal for an all-county arrangement. The proposal is patently wrong and conflicts with Government policy. How can we possibly target poor areas if they must share their allocated resources with rich areas? That is not targeting at all.</p>
	<p pid="d.679.2/7">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health, in answer to a parliamentary oral question, acknowledged that poor areas in rich regions face a particular challenge. The fact is that rich regions consume services at a much greater rate than their poorer neighbours. That is why the south-east of England is in such trouble. It is in the nature of the health service, and has always been, that richer middle-class areas will always create demand beyond their need and will soak up resources from poorer areas if they are given that opportunity.</p>
	<p pid="d.679.2/8">My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister agreed at Prime Minister's questions on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-26">26 April</phrase> to consider the proposal, and I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister has now had a chance to discuss it with him. I cannot overstate how seriously we view the issue. It would be a betrayal of Government policy to share out the resources that are intended to target the poor with the leafy glades of the west.</p>
	<p pid="d.679.2/9">I know that, in other parts of the country, there are proposals for PCTs of a similar size as that proposed for Hastings and Rother but, in our area, the issue is even more important. The PCT in Hastings has managed to be in-budget and still deliver its objectives. Rumour has it that Sussex Downs and Weald&mdash;the PCT that would be joined&mdash;is &pound;2 million overspent and that Eastbourne Downs PCT is about &pound;8 million overspent. Why on earth should we pick up their debts?</p>
	<p pid="d.679.2/10">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State wrote to me on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-30">30 January</phrase> and I have her letter here. She told me that, for the years 2007-08 and subsequently, the funding for the Hastings PCT would be &pound;1,552 per person compared with the national average of &pound;1,388 to reflect the special needs for the provision of GP services in Hastings. It is self-evident that if we lose the ability to receive the money for Hastings through a local PCT, that promise cannot be sustained.</p>
	<p pid="d.679.2/11">The second reason why such targeted resources may not arrive is the next point that I want to raise&mdash;the proposal to top-slice funding for our local PCTs by3 per cent. for the next two years. I have already acknowledged the significant increased funding that the local health economy has received. The promise, as demonstrated by the Secretary of State's letter, was that in the case of Hastings PCT&mdash;the increases in Rother were similar&mdash;we would receive an extra 9.1 per cent. for this year and an extra 9.4 per cent. for the year after. That is more than &pound;10 million extra for the next two years. Now the SHA tells us that, because ofthe need to balance the books in each of those years,3 per cent. of the budget will be withheld.</p>
	<p pid="d.679.2/12">I well understand why the Government need to balance their books, but why on earth should it be fair to take from the poor, such as Hastings PCT, who have managed their budgets and give to the rich who have not? I have already mentioned the massive overspend in Sussex Downs and Weald PCT and Eastbourne Downs PCT. Furthermore, the overspend nationally appears to be about 1 per cent., so why should we who happen simply by misfortune to be in the south-east suffer more from an effective reduction of 3 per cent. compared with the national reduction of about 1 per cent.? I know that the Ministers have said that this will simply be a loan that will be repaid, but how will it be repaid? As a lawyer, I tell my hon. Friend the Minister that a loan means that there is either a programme for repayment or that it is a loan at will, which means that one can get the money back when one asks for it. What is it to be? What is the basis of the loan?</p>
	<p pid="d.679.2/13">Surely it is wrong to disadvantage by administrative action areas such as Hastings, which the Secretary of State specifically says she wishes to advantage. It is the more galling when I say that Hastings PCT does such excellent work and within budget. If there is no Hastings PCT, who is the loan to be repaid to?</p>
	<p pid="d.679.2/14">I come to my third point, but assure my hon. Friend that I have no vendetta against the SHA, although it may sound that way. However, it appears that, yet again, it is the villain of the piece. Earlier this year, we were presented with an SHA paper headed &quot;Creating an NHS fit for the Future&quot;. It claims to be a consultation on improving services in Surrey and Sussex. The paper is described as a consultation, but states that</p>
	<p pid="d.679.2/15" class="indent">&quot;the provision of emergency and elective care needs to change&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="d.679.2/16">I do not take the luddite view that nothing needs to change, but I believe that the SHA is starting from the wrong premise. In short, the proposals are that, in the future&mdash;from, I think, about 2009&mdash;acute services should be delivered at four possible venues: at super-specialist hospitals at one end and local health centres at the other. Quite right. There would then be two intermediate forms of general hospital: one sort dealing with major trauma and accident and emergency, and another sort having a subservient role, which in our case has been described by the local media as the cottage hospital option. The SHA proposes that, generally, populations of about 400,000 would be needed to support major acute accident and emergency centres.</p>
	<p pid="d.679.2/17">In terms of the local delivery in my constituency, the East Sussex Hospitals NHS Trust is responsible for two general hospitals: the Conquest hospital in Hastings and Eastbourne district general hospital. Both have excellent accident and emergency provision, which local people wish to retain. Indeed, I would put it more strongly: that is not subject to negotiation. Of course, the SHA has not proposed the closure of major services at either hospital, but pre-emptive strikes are sometimes appropriate and prevention is always better than cure.</p>
	<p pid="d.679.2/18">The problem is that the SHA suggests that major accident and emergency centres should operate across populations of about 400,000. That leads the residents of Hastings and Eastbourne, and their local newspapers, to read between the lines. They read that to mean that at least one of the hospitals will be downgraded. At present, both communities worry that it will be theirs. Both in Hastings and Eastbourne, local headlines refer to the downgrading to cottage hospital status. I took the view that that was nonsense. I asked the SHA to confirm that, whatever the changes, proposals for a cottage hospital were simply not on the cards. Imagine my surprise when I was told that open consultation meant that nothing could be discounted.</p>
	<p pid="d.679.2/19">I want my hon. Friend to say unequivocally that the Conquest hospital&mdash;and perhaps Eastbourne district general hospital&mdash;will not become a cottage hospital and that, although new and expensive services may well be provided in more regional settings, the existing provision will be maintained. That must include accident and emergency provision and I will tell her why that is so important. Hastings and Eastbourne have ageing populations and the infrastructure in the south-east, including the A259 coast road, is extremely bad. My hon. Friends in the Department for Transport are seeking to do something about that, but that will be some time off. The idea of travelling in an emergency&mdash;be it a heart attack or a serious road traffic accident&mdash;distances of perhaps 30 miles on those blocked roads is a bizarre interpretation of the expression &quot;improving services&quot;. That would be disastrous and could cost lives. It is a complete non-starter.</p>
	<p pid="d.679.2/20">That worry has resulted in the &quot;hands off the Conquest&quot; campaign, which is being formed by the friends of the Conquest and led by John and Margaret Baker, who do so much work in the voluntary sector in supporting the hospital. That is very much supported by the local community and the <i> Hastings and St. Leonards Observer</i> is also currently running a campaign.</p>
	<p pid="d.679.2/21">In conclusion, I suggest to my hon. Friend that the sorts of proposals that I have highlighted are, in terms of Government action, schizophrenic. On the one hand, the Government&mdash;through the then Minister of Communities and Local Government, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1826" name="David Miliband">my right hon. Friend the Member for South Shields (David Miliband)</phrase>&mdash;quite rightly say that local is good and that we must make more decisions locally. On the other, they&mdash;or the SHA, at least&mdash;suggest removing local services and centralising health care organisation and delivery.</p>

	<p pid="d.683.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1622" name="Michael Jabez Foster">my hon. Friend the Member for Hastings and Rye (Michael Jabez Foster)</phrase> on securing the debate. He expressed eloquently the strong local feelings in his area. Obviously, I noted the cross-party support for his comments.</p>
	<p pid="d.683.0/2">I join my hon. Friend in the warm tribute that he paid to all the NHS and social care staff working in his local health community. Their commitment to the continual improvement of the local NHS and social care services is certainly to be commended. I know about that from personal experience because I visited the Conquest hospital at his invitation in November 2004. I witnessed at first hand what can be achieved by adopting a multidisciplinary approach to improving services and was very impressed with what I saw.</p>
	<p pid="d.683.0/3">The current NHS structure is under review as part of the &quot;Commissioning a patient-led NHS&quot; programme. The aim of the programme is to make long-lasting improvements to the NHS and to build on the improvements that have already been made through extra investment in new and existing services. As part of the programme, the number of primary care trusts and strategic health authorities will be reduced. My hon. Friend will know that plans have recently been announced to merge Surrey and Sussex SHA and Kent and Medway SHA into one organisation: the south-east coast SHA.</p>
	<p pid="d.683.0/4">The approach that we are adopting will lead to stronger commissioning powers for PCTs, which will ensure that patients have access to the right care more conveniently and quickly than before. We also know that the mergers will lead to savings of some &pound;250 million, which we will be able to plough back into front-line services.</p>
	<p pid="d.683.0/5">My hon. Friend is obviously concerned about the PCTs in his area. The proposals for the reconfiguration have been subject to a 14-week local consultation, which ended on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-22">22 March</phrase>. As he knows, decisions about the reconfiguration of PCTs will be announced as soon as possible, once the results of the consultations have been considered and any recommendations reviewed.</p>
	<p pid="d.683.0/6">It is too early to say what decisions will be made, but I can assure my hon. Friend that the recommendations will be assessed against the criteria set out in &quot;Commissioning a patient-led NHS&quot;. One of those criteria is the need to strengthen relationships between health care organisations and local authorities by bringing their boundaries closer together. At present, about 44 per cent. of PCTs are coterminous with local government boundaries. We hope that that number will increase significantly due to the reconfiguration of PCTs. The rationale is that a better framework will be provided to enable organisations to work together more closely to tackle priorities, such as reducing health inequalities and improving care for those with long-term conditions.</p>
	<p pid="d.683.0/7">I am aware of the concerns that my hon. Friend has expressed very forcefully about the future of his PCT. I know that he has expressed those concerns in communication with my noble Friend Lord Warner, the Minister with responsibility for reform. I hope that I can assure my hon. Friend that we are aware not only of his concerns, but of those expressed by people in other parts of the country. We are trying to work as closely as possible with SHAs and Members of Parliament to ensure that those concerns are reflected. We are doing what we can to address them.</p>
