<p>asked the Minister of Labour how many men have claimed to be registered as conscientious objectors; how many have now had their cases dealt with by local tribunals; how many have been registered, and of those registered, how many have been ordered to undertake work of national importance; how many have found, and are now engaged in, such work; and what steps are being taken in regard to the remainder?</p>

<p>Up to the end of August, 51,261 men had been provisionally registered in the register of conscientious objectors, 26,447 applications had been considered by local tribunals and 12,868 men had been registered (conditionally or unconditionally) in the register of conscientious objectors. Of these 3,423 had been ordered to undertake civil work specified by the Tribunals other than their existing work, and 1,935 men had found such work. In regard to the remainder, the position is kept under constant review, and my Department gives them all possible assistance in finding the work specified. There is machinery for referring back to the local tribunal any case in which the man appears not to be observing the condition of his registration.</p>

<p>The numbers unemployed in various industries are published monthly in the Ministry of Labour "Gazette."

<p>asked the Secretary for Mines the number of mine workers unemployed in County Durham; whether steps are being taken whereby an equitable share of all orders for home supplies is given to collieries in County Durham, and redundant workers are permitted to accept employment in other coalfields or industries; and whether mine workers definitely retained upon grounds of national urgency are now to receive full wages for all working time involuntarily lost?</p>

<p>The number of unemployed mine workers registered by the Ministry of Labour in County Durham at 12th August was 4,178 wholly unemployed and 13,506 temporarily stopped. Steps are being taken, so far as transport conditions and the qualities of coal produced permit, to give an increased share of orders to Durham. Steps are also being taken, in consultation with both sides of the industry, to encourage the transfer of coal miners from Durham to other coal-mining districts where they are needed, and there has been some relaxation regarding coal miners who are unemployed and wish to take up work in other industries. As I said on 20th August in

answer to my hon. Friend, it is necessary to keep a sufficient margin of man-power available in the coal-mining industry to meet all possible demands, and to provide against local interruptions arising out of war conditions. I cannot add to my answer of 20th August in relation to the payment of full wages for short-time working.</p>

<p>I am well aware of that, and I have discussed that aspect of the question with representatives of the Durham mineworkers, who are well informed on the subject, and who are in constant touch with the mineworkers, with ourselves and with the Ministry of Labour. I am meeting to-morrow the Miners' Federation of Great Britain, and these two districts of Durham and South Wales will be represented. We are doing everything we can to try to relieve the pressure of unemployment in those two districts, which have suffered such a grievous injury by the collapse of the export trade in circumstances known to everyone in this House.</p>

<p>As my hon. Friend is aware, I arrived at an arrangement with my right hon. Friend the Minister for Mines by which there was allocated to the coal industry in May last a labour force which was calculated to meet the requirements of that industry on the basis of the anticipated increased production. I also prohibited people from leaving the industry and undertook to direct others back to the industry. The collapse of France and the loss of European markets completely altered the situation. I have been in constant communication regarding this problem with my hon. Friend, and in order to meet the new situation I took steps to modify the administration of the Order by causing a cessation of the return of people to the mines and further gave instructions that in those districts where inert were unemployed they should be released for other industries. This is a national problem which I am sure the coal industry wish to tackle on a national basis. At present practically all men in the coal industry who are accustomed to work underground are reserved from calling up under the National Service (Armed Forces) Act. That position must, I am satisfied, be altered and the whole matter put upon a more satisfactory basis by calling up a substantial number of coal workers of the lower ages. I am in consultation with my hon. Friend the Minister for Mines as to the numbers who should remain reserved and as to the steps that should be taken to deal with the surplus. I hope to have an early opportunity of discussing the whole matter, in association with my right hon. Friend, with representatives of the organisations on both sides in the industry.</p>

<p>asked the President of the Board of Education whether his attention has been called to the wide discrepancies in the assessment of mal-

nutrition among school children in different Tyneside areas revealed by a recent investigation by Dr. D. M. Goodfellow, of Newcastle; and whether, in view of the danger of increasing malnutrition among school children as a result of the present war, he will take immediate steps to have assessments of nutritional standards brought into line throughout the whole country, so that a reliable knowledge of the facts may be obtained?</p>

<p>I am aware that there are considerable differences in the percentages of undernourished children found by school medical officers in the various Tyneside areas, though the differences shown by the returns for 1939 are not so great as in the returns for earlier years, on which Dr. Goodfellow's criticisms were based. Such variations are, to some extent, real, and due to differences in the social circumstances of the areas, though they are no doubt in part due to differences in the standards adopted by the school medical officers. Where the returns appear to indicate that the medical officer's standard differs materially from that usually adopted, it is the practice of the Board to arrange for a visit to the area by one of their medical officers for the purpose of discussing the matter with the school medical officer and, if necessary, conducting a sample nutrition survey in a group of schools.</p>

<p>Every endeavour is made to minimise interference with the normal employment of Civil Defence volunteers, but those who suffer a loss of earnings through duty performed in their normal working hours are compensated for the actual loss sustained, up to a maximum of 10s. a day for men and 7s. for women. Within the same limits compensation is paid for loss of up to two hours remunerative time following a spell of duty which, though performed outside normal working hours, prevents a volunteer from reaching his place of employment at the normal starting time. Reasonable payments may also be made by local authorities to volunteers where they are satisfied that clothing has been damaged in the course of duty.</p>

<p>In time of war it is necessary that the police should be armed with wide powers of search, and, if there are grounds for suspecting some person of acts prejudicial to the public safety, the fact that he has hitherto enjoyed a good reputation is not a reason for refraining from inquiries, which must sometimes include a search of his premises and examination of his papers. Even if the result of the search is to negative the suspicions, it may be right that the search should have been made, if, in fact, there were grounds for such suspicion. In some cases it is not easy for the police to judge whether the information which reaches them ought to be treated as a ground for suspicion, and I appreciate the hon. Member's desire that errors of judgment in assessing or interpreting such information shall not lead to misuse of the police powers. Whenever complaints are made to me, I cause immediate inquiry to be made, with a view to satisfying myself whether the police had reasonable grounds for their action, and if my hon. Friend knows of cases which have not already been brought to my notice, I shall be glad if he will send me particulars.

<p>The question of broadcasting proceedings of the House of Commons has never commended itself to the House, and I do not consider that any useful purpose would be served by appointing a committee such as is suggested by my hon.

<p>asked the Secretary of State for War what arrangements have now been made for the comfort of troops using the London Midland and Scottish Railway Company's London Road station at Manchester, particularly in regard to a canteen in the station itself, near the platforms; and how many notice spaces and of what size have now been made available at London Road station to indicate the whereabouts of the various voluntary canteens and hostels in the town for troops?</p>

<p>There is a Young Men's Christian Association canteen at the end of the station approach. There is also a rest room in the station, and steps are being taken to have it furnished with collapsible beds and comfortable chairs. In addition, cloakroom, washing and lavatory accommodation is available, free of charge. Two rooms belonging to the London and North Eastern Railway, which are adjacent to the station main entrance, are about to be adapted to canteen purposes. As regards the last part of the Question, I am informed that notices have been put up to indicate the whereabouts of the various canteens, etc., in the town, but I have no details as to the number or size.</p>

<p>In regard to the notices, is not the Minister aware that, as recently as last week, there was only one notice at this railway station and it was of very small size, directing attention to canteens in Manchester, whereas there was an enormous number of advertisements of the London Midland and Scottish Railway directing attention to various resorts and asking people to go to various holiday places?</p>

<p>Will the Minister consider whether more canteens cannot be provided at the stations, because the facilities are pretty bad?</p>

<p>asked the Prime Minister whether, in view of the fact that the only opportunity afforded for discussion on the Government's future appointments of directors of the Suez Canal Company is limited to a Consolidated Fund Debate, he will, in future, render it possible for Parliament to consider these Government appointments, either by making them by Order-in-Council, or by including in the Treasury or Board of Trade vote the income on the Government's Suez Canal shares, even if no money is voted for the directors by Parliament?</p>
