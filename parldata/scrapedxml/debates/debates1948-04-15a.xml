<p>None, Sir, during January, 1948. Reports of Conferences of the major British political parties are displayed by the British Information Services in India as they are received.

<p>While I thank the Under-Secretary for that reply, may I ask him if he will draw the attention of the British Information Services to the need not only to be impartial, but to seem impartial; and whether the fact that the display at one particular time of one particular party's conference does not give an impression of partiality?</p>

<p>Yes, Sir, I quite see that, but at different times the literature of different parties has been displayed alone.

<p>I have already said that this is a question of size, with the special exception of this particular quality.

<p>I have made available in the House today the documents resulting from this Conference. One of these papers reproduces the text of the Havana Charter of the International Trade Organisation which was authenticated by the Final Act of the Conference. Apart from certain points to which the United Kingdom Delegate made reference in the final plenary sessions of the Conference, the effect of the Charter generally does not materially differ from the Geneva draft, which has already been laid before Parliament as Cmd. 7212, but hon. Members will no doubt wish to have the opportunity to study it. Although His Majesty's Government hope in due course, if circumstances are favourable, to recommend the Charter to Parliament with a view to acceptance, it is not their intention to do this in the immediate future.<br/>
The second paper which has been laid contains Protocols making certain consequential amendments to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade which have been formulated as the result of discussions between the contracting parties in accordance with the terms of that Agreement. In view of the wide measure of international agreement which was reached at Havana, arrangements have been made to accept these Protocols.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1948-04-15a.1155.10" colnum="1155" time="">
<p>I appointed the Probation Advisory Committee on 31st January, 1946, for a

period of three years to advise me on questions relating to the administration of the probation system and the other social services of the courts. It consists of 17 members, including six magistrates, a recorder, a clerk of the peace, a justices' clerk, three principal probation officers and other persons experienced in the problems of delinquency.</p>

<p>Candidates for training as probation officers are considered by the Probation Training Board, a body which I have appointed to select men and women for training and to provide facilities for training them. About 40 candidates are awaiting interview by a Selection Committee of the Board. Interviews can now be offered within one to three weeks but 16 of those waiting have asked for their interviews to be deferred.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1948-04-15a.1156.1" colnum="1156" time="">
<p>Outside London probation officers are appointed by probation committees of the local justices; and when a probation committee notifies a vacancy for a probation officer, the aim of the Home Office is to submit to the committee two or three trained candidates for consideration. At present, however, there are more vacancies than trained candidates available, so that usually it is only possible to offer one trainee for interview to each of those committees whose claims are judged to be the more urgent. The most suitable candidate is submitted having regard to the needs of the particular area, the personality of the candidate and, so far as possible, his or her personal convenience.</p>

<p>asked the Minister of Health if he is aware that widespread anxiety has been aroused by his recent circular to local authorities discouraging any development of health centres at the present time; and, in view of the advantages of the health centre stressed by the Medical Planning Commission in 1942, and the obligation resting on local health authorities under the new National Health Service scheme to provide such centres, whether he will now issue further instructions making it clear that it is not his intention to discourage any initiative in the planning and setting up of new health centres.</p>

<p>There is evidently a misunderstanding. I have never wished to discourage health centres, which will be a key feature of the new health service. But I have had to point out the building stringencies of the moment and say that I do not, therefore, expect any widespread programmes yet.</p>

<p>In view of the extent of the misunderstanding that arose over the first circular relating to this matter, and of the immense support there is, particularly amongst doctors, for the idea of group practice, as indeed there is in the rest of the medical world, would the Minister consider issuing a further circular to clarify the situation that has arisen, and also consider encouraging the provision of some health centres in advance of others, where they are particularly needed?</p>

<p>I understood the Minister to say that the trustees were closing this place on their own initiative, but is the Minister aware that they are issuing to all patients a leaflet which, quite unambiguously, says that the clinic is being closed as a consequence of the taking over by the State of the health services?

clinic provides very valuable physiotherapy services for people in Islington, Finsbury and Shoreditch, would he encourage the trustees to keep the place open?</p>

<p>Has the right hon. Gentleman made any progress in coming to a conclusion about the Foreign Affairs Debate the week after next, and has he considered at all the suggestion which we have ventured to make that, at 7.30 p.m. on the second day of the Debate, we should switch to the Motion on European Union, which has so much support in all parts of the House and which stands on the Order Paper in the name of the hon. Member for North-West Hull (Mr. R. Mackay), so that these matters can be discussed?</p>

<p>On the last point, that is the first I have heard of that suggestion, and perhaps the right hon. Gentleman will forgive me if I make no comment. On the first point, I have had a word with my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary, and I am sorry I cannot give a definitive answer at the moment. As the House knows, my right hon. Friend is about to leave for Paris, but, directly he comes back, which will be next week, we will hope that some conversations can take place, either through the usual channels or with the right hon.

<p>Will the right hon. Gentleman recollect that there are, standing on the Order Paper, two Government Motions that relate to new Standing Orders for Scottish Business.

<p>I am anxious to dispose of the Motions regarding Standing Orders affecting Scottish Business, which I understand are generally agreeable. It is a matter of time. I am afraid we cannot fix a date immediately, but the right hon. and learned Gentleman can take it that we will fix it, at a fairly early date, and as soon as ever we can.</p>

<p>Coming back to the matter raised by the right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the Opposition, when my right hon. Friend is considering the possibility of using the last few hours of the second day of the Foreign Affairs Debate for a discussion of the Motion standing on the Order Paper on European Union, will he consider the possibility of extending the time on that day? Surely, two-and-a-half hours is not going to be anything like sufficient for a discussion on that important matter?</p>

<p>If I may say so, the hon. Lady is premature. I have not yet indicated whether the Motion itself will be discussed or taken up in the general Debate. The right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the Opposition made a suggestion, which I promised to consider, but I have not yet committed myself.</p>

<p>I did not think the occasion was worthy of a statement from the Despatch Box. I merely wish to draw your attention, Mr. Speaker, to an inaccuracy in today's HANSARD.

<p>May we have this uncertainty cleared up? The hon. Gentleman says he is recorded as having voted in favour of the Government, but the Government had no opinion on this matter, except that expressed personally by the Home Secretary.

<p>I think the hon. Gentleman made it clear that, in the official record, he is not down as voting, but, in HANSARD, he is put down as having voted. It was, I understand, a mistake

of his name for that of an hon. Member who sits for an Ulster Division.</p>

<p>Are we not entitled, when we have a personal explanation, to ask what it is all about? The hon.

Here we have a Member of the Government, on a first-class subject, abstaining from supporting his Government and saying that he did so because he was obeying instructions.

<p>I beg to move, "That the Clause be read a Second time."<br/>
Last night, after a Clause had been moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Thirsk and Malton (Mr. Turton), the Government accepted the addition to the Second Schedule of the Criminal Justice Act, of the offence of fraudulent conversion, with the result that that offence will become triable summarily. The object of this Clause is to make a further addition to that Schedule, and to provide that the offence of housebreaking and the committing of a felony and the offence of housebreaking with intent to commit a felony shall be triable summarily. Under the provisions of this Bill, by Clause 27, where a court comes to the conclusion that an individual's record is such that the punishment he should receive exceeds their powers, they may, after finding him guilty, commit him to trial.<br/>
One possible and probable consequence of that Clause will be that those with long records will, when they are charged, not consent to have their case tried summarily, but elect to go to trial, with the idea lurking in their minds that they may have a better chance of acquittal before a jury. If that view is well-founded, it appears to follow that the calendars of assizes and quarter sessions will become even more congested than at present. That is an additional reason why we should seek to make triable summarily offences of the nature which those with experience


of the workings of quarter sessions and assizes would say, in the vast majority of cases, could be tried summarily.<br/>
I do not wish to suggest that there are not certain cases of housebreaking which are of a very serious character in the alarm and disturbance they create to the community, but there are other cases where the housebreaking is purely of a trumpery nature; where, for instance, a young man comes before the police court charged with housebreaking and committing larceny, who, because that is the charge, is sent to quarter sessions where the case is disposed of quite speedily, and where he receives a sentence that could have been imposed by a court of summary jurisdiction.<br/>
I suggest that there is no harm in making the offence of housebreaking triable summarily. I further suggest that it would be an improvement to our criminal law to make the offence of attempted housebreaking also triable summarily. It is really nonsense that if a person merely tries to break in by cutting out a piece of wood from the door and does not steal anything, he has, under our existing law, to be sent for trial at quarter sessions or assizes on a charge of attempted housebreaking. Surely there is a strong case for adding that offence to the list of offences triable summarily. I believe that there is a big argument in favour of a greater degree of flexibility, so as to permit petty sessions to deal with housebreaking of a trumpery character, while preserving their power to commit to trial cases of a serious nature.</p>

<p>I beg to second the Motion.<br/>
In doing so, I wish to comment briefly on what my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Manningham-Buller) has said. I would remind the right hon. Gentleman that, as he probably knows already, all the criminal courts in this country are greatly overburdened with work at the present time, and, therefore, it is most desirable, in the interests of justice and of having people tried speedily, to dispose of the comparatively minor offences in the lower courts, where they can be dealt with quickly.<br/>
As my hon. and learned Friend has said, many of the offences of housebreaking are of a most trivial character. Many

of them, however, are very serious, and I do not for one moment wish it to be thought that I am trying to detract from the seriousness of the determined effects of housebreaking, but others, particularly attempts to break into houses, committed by young boys, are quite trivial in character; the breaking of a window&#x2014;a halfhearted, stupid attempt, which is foiled almost at once, or where the offender is caught almost at once. I submit that these are cases that could quite properly be dealt with by a bench of magistrates. I have always looked upon it as being somewhat of an anomaly in our criminal law that this sort of case should not be dealt with summarily. Therefore, I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will be able to accept the new Clause.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1948-04-15a.1190.0" hansard_membership_id="3892" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/14477" speakername="The Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Ede)" colnum="1190" time="">
<p>It is true that last night I accepted one and a half of the new Clauses moved by the hon. Member for Thirsk and Malton (Mr. Turton), because I thought that he had demonstrated that it was desirable that those particular offences should be added to the Second Schedule of the Criminal Justice Act, 1925. When we come to housebreaking, I think that, especially in view of the present prevalence of that crime, it is not desirable that the same course should be pursued. Housebreaking is a crime which gives very considerable anxiety to a large number of people in suburban areas, particularly near London, where people almost divide themselves as among the burgled and the to-be burgled. I know, having been burgled seven times myself before I held this office, the effect that burglary and housebreaking has on the minds of the women folk of a household.<br/>
I should be very reluctant at the present time to do anything that indicated that this House regarded housebreaking as among the minor crimes. One has to trust, if one puts these offences into the Schedule, on the good sense of the petty sessional court as to whether a case goes forward to a higher court or not. While I have no doubt that there are occasions&#x2014;I make a present of this to the hon. and learned Member for Daventry (Mr. Manningham-Buller)&#x2014;when the prosecutor and the witnesses for the prosecution are somewhat relieved when a case does not go for trial, there are also occasions when a court, with very limited


powers in dealing with these cases, sometimes leaves on the minds of the prosecutor and the witnesses the feeling that the case has not been adequately dealt with.<br/>
I am all for relieving the senior courts, where it is possible to do so without injury to the standard of respect for the law of the country, of dealing with trivial cases, but I cannot accept this new Clause, because I think that, particularly at the present time, it is very desirable that we should continue to emphasise the seriousness with which the House regards the offences of housebreaking and of attempted housebreaking. I am not at all sure that what the hon. and learned Gentleman called a half-hearted attempt is something that should be regarded as trivial. I think that it is well to keep in the minds of the criminal classes, as well as in the minds of other people, the idea that this crime, with all the terror which it inflicts on a large number of people who never actually suffer from the depredations of the housebreaker, is regarded very seriously.</p>

<p>In view of the startling revelation which the Home Secretary has made of having been burgled on seven occasions, is that not calculated to give the impression that the Home Secretary can be burgled with impunity, and that joy and jubilation will be created as a consequence in the heart of the criminal classes? If he is so vulnerable as all that, surely adequate steps should be taken to protect him?</p>

<p>I did not seek to minimise in any way the offence of housebreaking. I suggest to the Home Secretary that, with the powers which the prosecution have, and will have, of indicating whether a case should be sent for trial or not, the risk of the serious cases being minimised in the public mind would not be very great if this Amendment were accepted. I would ask him to give further consideration to this matter. It was not discussed on the Committee stage, and it may be that with further consideration, he could go some way towards meeting us.</p>

<p>This is a subject which I have considered for some time, quite apart from

this Bill. I would remind the hon. and learned Gentleman of what I alluded to last night&#x2014;the recent remarks made in a high judicial quarter that the way in which magistrates have used their discretion in dealing with these cases has sometimes been unsatisfactory. I will, of course, consider the matter. I always listen with great respect to the remarks of the hon. and learned Gentleman and of the hon. Member for South Belfast (Mr. Gage), but it would be quite wrong of me to indicate that I thought that I ought to do this in the present Bill.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1948-04-15a.1192.0" hansard_membership_id="10700" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/21582" speakername="Mr. Turner-Samuels" colnum="1192" time="">
<p>think that the hon. and learned Member for Daventry (Mr. Manningham-Buller) in commending this new Clause to us has raised a very important matter. It is perfectly true, of course, that some cases of housebreaking are trumpery, but this Clause does not distinguish between those attempts which are called trumpery and those attempts which may be very serious. This proposed Clause gives the court of summary jurisdiction both the duty and the right of passing the sentence. It is all very well for the hon. and learned Member to say that under Clause 27 of the Bill, the matter can be committed for sentence to quarter sessions, but this Clause vests in the court of summary jurisdiction the power to pass sentence. Supposing a case of attempted housebreaking to be committed by some person with a very bad record&#x2014;a man who has not only attempted to commit housebreaking from time to time, but, in fact, has succeeded and has previously undergone a series of punishments&#x2014;terms of imprisonment.<br/>
What are we going to do with a case of that kind? The sentence there may have to be a very serious one indeed. It may be penal servitude for many years, anything from three to 14 years according to the gravity of the case. Is it suggested that a matter of this fundamental and serious kind should be confided to a court of summary jurisdiction? Surely the hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Daventry could not intend that and yet it is a manifest consequence of the proposal that he is now making. Anyone who is concerned in the administration of criminal justice knows that the worst difficulty is not in trying these people, but of knowing what to do with them and what sort of punishment to


mete out to them. That is one of the most serious problems with which a court of quarter sessions and the judges who go on assizes have to deal.<br/>
The idea that the House should take that serious obligation out of the hands of the higher criminal courts and invest it in those sitting in courts of summary jurisdiction comes, I must say, as a matter of amazement to me. Knowing the hon. and learned Gentleman as I do, I am perfectly certain that if he gave this matter second thoughts he would not wish for that consequence in view of the serious and fundamental fact that the question of sentence is here involved and it may be, as it not infrequently is, that it is one of those cases where the person charged is a person with a very bad record, which the court in imposing its sentence has got to take into consideration. For these reasons I suggest that the House should not accept this new Clause.</p>

<p>I would ask the Home Secretary to consider this matter again. I entirely agree with what has been said about the anxiety caused by housebreaking and the seriousness of this offence. We all desire to do nothing to make people think lightly of that offence. I am not quite certain what will be the effect of this Clause. As I understand it, the court would have the option either of dealing summarily with a matter, of sending it for trial by the ordinary procedure or alternatively&#x2014;I should like to have confirmation of this from the right hon. Gentlernan&#x2014;under Clause 27 trying a case in the summary court and sending it for sentence to a higher court.</p>

<p>The proposed Clause we are now discussing imposes that obligation on the court. It confides to the court of summary jurisdiction the power of the justices to deal with sentence whatever the nature of the case or the record of the accused.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1948-04-15a.1193.2" hansard_membership_id="7902" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30315" speakername="Mr. Lloyd" colnum="1193" time="">
<p>What I was suggesting was that there were certain alternatives. There is the alternative of dealing with it summarily or sending it for trial, or there is the other course of dealing with it summarily so far as the evidence is concerned and forwarding it for sentence to a higher court. From my own experience I will tell the right hon. Gentleman something of which he is perfectly well aware&#x2014;the higher courts are absolutely clut-

tered up with matters at the present time. In many courts the administration of justice has almost been brought into contempt, because so much work has to be done and the sittings of courts are lengthy and held under great stress. If anything can be done to relieve the pressure on these courts it will be a good thing to do.<br/>
For the serious case there are still these two courses of sending for trial in the ordinary way or sending to the higher court for sentence. In the case of a first offence by a man with a clean record, and especially if it is a trivial offence, it could be properly met by hearing it at the summary court of jurisdiction. Take the analogy of larceny. In each case it has to be decided whether on a charge of larceny the accused is sent for trial or dealt with summarily. Some larcenies are trivial, some extremely serious and according to whether they are trivial or serious it is decided which course should be taken. No harm would be done if the same course were adopted in regard to housebreaking.</p>

<p>Naturally, legal men, when discussing questions of this kind, talk about the higher courts being cluttered up with work and not being able to get ahead with the job, but what concerns the poor criminal who has been sent forward for trial is how long a wait he has in the cells before his case is brought to trial. That is something that has to be taken into account, and if we can devise a method of expediting the trials of many of these people who are arrested and held in confinement, so much the better. It is desirable that many of these cases should be dealt with summarily.<br/>
The remarks made by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Gloucester (Mr. Turner-Samuels) have no bearing on this question and are quite irrelevant. If the type of criminal to whom he referred came before a court of summary jurisdiction, that criminal would be passed on to a higher court. I thought that legal men would have known a simple proposition of that kind. I have been before a court of summary jurisdiction and was transferred to a higher court because the court of summary jurisdiction would not deal with such a hardened case as myself.<br/>
There is one thing to which I wish to draw the Home Secretary's attention. He has already referred to it, and it is very important. He mentioned that a lot of housebreaking had taken place in suburban London. It is not only in suburban London that housebreaking takes place, but all over the country. In my own area there is a lot of housebreaking in working-class houses. I have a feeling that when hon. Members opposite talk about trivial and serious cases of housebreaking, they think that if some youth breaks into a working-class home and takes &#x00A3;5 worth of goods it is trivial, but that if someone breaks into a bourgeois house and takes &#x00A3;500 worth of goods, it is serious.</p>

<p>If it is nonsense, what is trivial and what is serious? If someone breaks into a house, why should there be a difference about it? Why should one kind of housebreaking be trivial and one serious? Is it judged on the amount of goods taken? From the point of view of the occupants of a working-class house, the breaking into that house and the loss of &#x00A3;5 may be much more serious than the breaking into a larger house and the loss of &#x00A3;500. What determines trivial and serious? The Home Secretary was quite right to make it clear that there can be no question of considering housebreaking as trivial in any circumstances.<br/>
It is a serious offence and if those who introduced this new Clause had refrained from raising this question of trivial and serious types of housebreaking, a better case could be made for the new Clause. While agreeing with the attitude the Home Secretary has adopted towards housebreaking, I would ask him to consider accepting something else, if this new Clause is not acceptable, to expedite the treatment of these chaps who are charged with housebreaking, so that in many cases&#x2014;where, for instance, it is a first offence&#x2014;they can be dealt with in, a court of summary jurisdiction instead of being passed to a higher court. There are too many men and women who are kept waiting for long weeks in prison before their case comes to trial, and for that reason I ask the Home Secretary seriously to consider doing something to expedite matters so that these people may be more quickly brought to trial.</p>

<p>I should like to say a word in support of my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Manningham-Buller), who moved this new Clause; but, I rise mainly for the purpose of calling attention to the characteristically offensive observation by the hon. Member for West Fife (Mr. Gallacher). If it had been made by anybody but him, and if he were taken seriously in any quarter of the House instead of only as a joke, I should have raised a point of Order. He made the most wounding accusation possible against hon. Members on this side of the House and the hon. and learned Member for Gloucester (Mr. Turner-Samuels), sitting beside him. He said that we did not in the least mind what happened to poor people and that it was only the rich people who concerned us. There the voice from Moscow speaks. There the hon. Member follows the dictates of his masters in making himself personally offensive to other people in the House of Commons.</p>

<p>This matter has already been exhaustively dealt with, but I would like to put one point to the House. At the end of last week I was approached by a very experienced chairman of quarter sessions, with his clerk. They urged that


some such provision as this should be introduced into the Bill, because of the overcrowding of the calendar at quarter sessions. They mentioned cases of petty housebreaking, very slight cases indeed. They were technically housebreaking, possibly of a house being entered by quite a young man, sometimes in a spirit of bravado. Although a man who had broken into the house had taken nothing at all, the case was usually committed for trial. Such cases were crowding the calendar at quarter sessions.<br/>
I was also told that the quarter sessions in the county were now taking more than a week, with two courts sitting, and for very long hours. Many of the cases might quite well have been dealt with by benches of magistrates. I agree with the right hon. Gentleman that we must leave a certain amount to the discretion of magistrates, but under Clause 27 magistrates will be empowered, if they find a man to be an old and hardened offender, to decide that he should not be dealt with by them but should be sent to a higher court. I appeal to the Minister to consider this question afresh and to see whether it is not possible to leave more discretion to courts of summary jurisdiction to deal with cases of attempted housebreaking and of what I might call petty breaking.</p>

<p>I hope that at least one voice will be raised in support of the Clause from this side of the House. The only objection made by the Home Secretary was that housebreaking was a very serious offence. That statement shows very great distrust of the ability of magistrates to deal with such cases. Anyone who practises in the courts knows that there are hundreds of trumpery cases, technically of housebreaking, in which, with all the solemnity of the law, the prisoner is committed for trial. Then there may be a long time of waiting before he is tried, and great injustice is suffered. The proposed new Clause should receive support. I cannot see why the Home Secretary cannot accept it.</p>

<p>I will give this matter consideration. I am not unimpressed by the remarks that have been made. It may be that in my sufferings as a burgled person, I am inclined to some bias in the matter. I am sure that I shall carry the House with me when I say that what are some-

times called petty burglaries create a state of terror in a neighbourhood of which the law must take account. The idea that such cases can be disposed of in the same way as a drunk and disorderly case is disposed of, whether or not it has been called petty or trivial, gives quite a wrong impression in the minds of citizens in whom we have to maintain confidence in the administration of the law in these difficult times.</p>

<p>With the leave of the House I would like to say one further word. We appreciate the caution which the Home Secretary is exercising to prevent the offence of housebreaking from scaring the general public. We are with him in that matter and welcome his attitude. I am sure, however, that it would facilitate the administration of justice if we made some provision of this character. These Sections of the Larceny Act not only cover housebreaking but involve committing for trial even a youth who breaks into a warehouse or a shop and steals fivepence worth of goods. As the right hon. Gentleman has very fairly said that he will look further into this matter, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Motion.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That the Clause be read a Second time."<br/>
I hope the right hon. Gentleman will be able to accept this Clause, which meets a very real need. In Committee he undertook to consider a new Clause on these lines before the Report stage. I am sorry not to have seen one in his name upon the Order Paper. I hope that that fact will not prevent him accepting the new Clause which I am proposing. The argument for it may be put quite shortly, and I hope it will have the support of all hon. Members who have practical


experience of the administration of our criminal courts.<br/>
The Attorney-General will probably Agree that he has had the experience which I have had of defending an accused person, of being briefed, and knowing what the charges are according to the brief, and then being suddenly faced with an indictment read out and having to meet additional charges of a new character, charges added by the prosecution at the last moment, giving no opportunity to the defence to consider what course of action should be taken. That can be done under the present law, and is done. I think it is wrong that an accused person who is standing his trial at quarter sessions or assizes should not know, before the trial starts, exactly what charges he will have to face, or that his advisers should not know exactly what charges will have to be faced so that they may give the accused the best possible advice on the course he should pursue. Those of us who have conducted cases for the defence in criminal courts have experienced the difficulties connected with the sudden addition of charges to an indictment.<br/>
5.0 p.m.<br/>
We suggest in this Clause that a copy of the indictment should be served personally on the accused, or upon his solicitors, at least seven days before the trial commences. I am not particularly attached to the seven days. If the Minister says he would prefer five, six, 10 or 14 days it is immaterial to me, but I suggest that the accused ought to have at least five days' notice. That, I think, should be the minimum. It may be said, "Sometimes a man is committed by the committing magistrates for trial just before the assizes or quarter sessions are due to open, and if he is to be tried there time will not permit of giving seven days' notice." That is an argument which, from an administrative point of view, must be considered. We do not want a man to miss that assize or quarter sessions and have to be taken to another part of the country at considerable expense and inconvenience, or have his case postponed to a subsequent assize or quarter sessions.<br/>
We have provided that the seven days' notice can be waived by the accused. Normally, it would be to the advantage of the accused to waive it if it meant his

swifter trial, and he would not waive it except where the addition of further charges would put him in a difficulty. If the charges on which he had been committed were the same as those contained in the indictment, I believe that every accused person would be right to waive the fulfilment of the seven days' notice, so as to secure a swifter trial on the indictment against him. This Clause further provides that the accused may agree to a shorter period than seven days in appropriate cases. These qualifications upon the original period of seven days would facilitate the trial of a case where a man had been committed only a short time before the assizes or quarter sessions. At the same time the Clause provides for proper notice of what is contained in the indictment and I hope the right hon. Gentleman will accept it because I believe it will add considerably to the better administration of our criminal law.</p>

<p>I beg to second the Motion.<br/>
From such short experience as I have of this House, I am not unduly optimistic about anything, but I had hoped, following what the Home Secretary said in Standing Committee, that he would put down a new Clause on this point himself. I am disappointed to see that the right hon. Gentleman has not put down a new Clause which would embody the principles contained in the Clause we are now discussing. I am not wedded to the period of seven days; I think it could quite properly be shortened to five or four days. We are all familiar with cases where, quite often, the first time the accused person has known of a new count in the indictment has been when it has been read aloud in court by the clerk of assize. That is quite wrong, because there are all kinds of defences that can be founded on the way in which an indictment is drawn.<br/>
I remember an experience which I had&#x2014;not an unusual experience, indeed, a typical experience. In a case in which I was prosecuting, for a fairly serious offence, I was given the indictment on arrival at court and I thought it wrongly drawn. I thought that the defence might object to it, so I did what everybody in my position would have done. I asked the clerk if the other side had seen it and he said, "No." The clerk seemed amazed that anyone should have seen the indictment before the trial. I said it must


be altered, and the indictment was handed back to the clerk with the ink still wet upon it. I am glad to say that my opponent did not know how near his client had been to escaping completely the consequences of what he had done. I am seeking to prevent that kind of thing from happening. I know that this Clause will cause a good deal of administrative inconvenience to people like clerks of the peace, but I do not think that is a reason we should not accept it. I know that at the County of London Sessions there will be great administrative difficulty, but at the same time I believe that the duty to the accused is much more important.</p>

<p>I listened to the discussion on this matter in Standing Committee, when I gave an undertaking that I would try to frame a new Clause for this stage. I have diligently carried out the promise I then gave, but I have been confronted with certain practical difficulties in the way of drafting a new Clause which would be enforceable. This new Clause would impose on the clerk of assize or clerk of peace the duty of serving on the accused, or his legal representative, a copy of the indictment. This is the practical difficulty: if a man has been committed for trial there is no trouble in finding him. The indictment can be served on him in prison, or maybe his legal representatives can be ascertained through the prison machinery, and they can receive a copy of the indictment. However, there are, of course, a number of people who will appear on an indictment at quarter sessions or the assizes but are not committed to prison and whose addresses can be obtained only from the clerk of the summary court, and if he failed to send along the address, it might very well be that the clerk of assize or the clerk of the peace might find that he had committed a breach of this requirement. This is a practical difficulty which I would like to get over. Another difficulty is the period of seven days. It may be that even where the address is known, the accused person may not be at that address on the day which would enable the clerk to comply with the requirements of this Clause. I therefore suggest that there are very serious practical difficulties in the way.<br/>
I am advised that under Rule 13 of the Rules made under the Indictments Act, 1915, it is the duty of the clerk of assize,

after a bill of indictment has been preferred and signed, to supply to the accused person, on request, a copy of the indictment free of charge. What I would like to do would be to get in touch with representative clerks of assize and clerks of the peace and see whether some method could be devised so that there would be provision whereby the indictment would be available on demand a certain number of days, in normal cases, before the opening of the assizes or quarter sessions.<br/>
That would meet the practical point and would avoid imposing this duty, which I suggest might in certain cases be almost impossible for the officers of the court to fulfil: it would enable the indictment to be known to the accused person in sufficient time for him to prepare his defence and he would not, therefore, have an indictment sprung on him at the court and find in it certain things which he did not imagine would be in the charge to be preferred against him. It might not be possible to have as long a period as seven days, but both hon. Gentlemen have intimated that they would be prepared to accept a lesser period if this could be made workable. I hope they will feel that the difficulties which I have encountered are really practical difficulties in the way of imposing a duty on the court in the exact terms of the words they have used. I will energetically pursue these consultations with the clerks I have mentioned, in the hope that I may be able to do something practical.<br/>
My right hon. and learned Friend the Attorney-General reminds me that I used an unfortunate collection of words. I should not have said, "a certain number of days before the opening of the assizes." I should have said, "before the trial." Some assizes and, as we have been reminded this afternoon, even some quarter sessions, now last a considerable number of days, and the phrase I originally used might have imposed a quite impossible burden on the clerks. I hope that the hon. and learned Member for Daventry (Mr. Manningham-Buller) will feel that I have endeavoured to carry out the spirit of what I said in Committee. I am really concerned about this matter. I do desire that an accused person shall have every opportunity of knowing the charges he has to meet, and of knowing them in sufficient time to be able to have his defence properly prepared.<br/>
5.15 p.m.<br/>
There will, of course, be the case of the prisoner who is committed late, and no matter what number of days we put in, it may not always be possible for him to be informed within the prescribed limits. Generally speaking, it is to his advantage to have a speedy trial, but if he regards this point as important and elects to stand over to the next sessions or assizes, he should be able to make the choice. I hope the House will feel that I have endeavoured to meet the point behind this Clause. Between now and the consideration of the Bill in another place I will try to meet it.</p>

<p>The House will agree that my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary appreciates the importance of the point involved in this Clause, but, on the other hand, I think the difficulties which he presented against the Clause are not quite as serious as he has been advised. There are methods by which intimation can be given to the person concerned in very many cases. There is no reason why notice or the document should not be sent by registered post to the last known address of the individual in the same way as it is done in many police court and sessional court matters. In a case where a solicitor has already been briefed, there is no reason why the particulars should not be sent to him.<br/>
I should like my right hon. Friend to realise that those who have had experience of these matters, including himself, find that in many instances the person is confronted with a circumstance with which it is a practical impossibility for him to deal on the spur of the moment or within a day or two. That being so, the statement that he will have available the indictment is not in itself sufficient. Many accused people would not be aware of the fact that the indictment was available, and the case might proceed without any possibility at all of a defence being put up. In those circumstances, I ask my right hon. Friend to try to devise some method by which his original undertaking might be put into more practical effect than by the suggestion he has offered, in order that a person who is to defend himself or is to be defended shall be in a position to understand what the

actual indictment or indictments against him are.</p>

<p>I would like briefly to reinforce the appeal which has been made to the right hon. Gentleman. I think the practical difficulties are surmountable. I have risen to ask the right hon. Gentleman not to be too much impressed by representations which he may receive from clerks of the peace and clerks of assize because&#x2014;I say this at my peril&#x2014;I think there is in this department a good deal of conservatism. The right hon. Gentleman should not be too overcome by representations to the contrary which he may receive. I am perfectly certain that in many cases there is substantial detriment to the administration of true justice in the fact that the accused does not know the actual charge against him.</p>

<p>This seems to be a rather pleasant lawyers' afternoon tea party and I apologise most sincerely for joining in. I have listened to this Debate with very great interest and I listened with particular interest to the sympathetic point of view of the Home Secretary. If someone is to be tried and he does not know until the last minute what will be brought against him, it must put him to very great difficulty. It is all very well for high legal authorities to say that they sympathise with this person or that. We all sympathise, but looking at it from the point of view of giving the ordinary individual a fair deal, it is right that before he comes before these courts he should have fair notice of what will be brought up against him. It is astonishing to me that if someone came before the courts the officers in charge would not know his address sufficiently well to make contact with him on his indictment. It must be possible to overcome that, with the ingenuity which the Home Office have at their call at present. To sum up, my two points are&#x2014;first, the address, and secondly, that all of us want the individual to know what is brought against him. May I emphasise once again&#x2014;because it always gives me pleasure to say nice things rather than the reverse&#x2014;how glad I was to see the Home Secretary in one of his kindly moods today?</p>

<p>With the leave of the House, I will make one or two observations on what the right hon.


Gentleman indicated were his difficulties in accepting this Clause. He said, first, that there would be difficulty in many cases&#x2014;not in every case&#x2014;in serving a copy of the indictment on the accused person or upon his solicitors or, indeed, in knowing who were his solicitors. One appreciates that, but in the majority of cases that difficulty would not arise. What would happen in the cases where the difficulty arose would be that when a man surrendered to his bail he would then get a copy of the indictment, he would be told the reason it had not been served upon him before, and he would then be faced with the alternative either of having to insist on his right of notice of trial&#x2014;which might mean that he would go to the end of the calendar of the assizes or the bottom of the list at the quarter sessions, or go on to another assize or another quarter session&#x2014;or he would waive that right. If he waived that right, there is no consequence so far as the administration of justice is concerned; there is no delay. If he did not waive that right, presumably he would not waive it for the simple reason that the presence of this additional count really made no material difference. I ask the right hon. Gentleman to think that over again, because it does not seem to me that the failure on the part of the clerks to serve a copy of the indictment would have any prejudicial effect.<br/>
Secondly, he referred to Rule 13, which deals with the supply of a copy of the indictment. That rule is largely a dead letter. Very often under the present organisation the indictment is not complete until a short period before the trial is due to commence. I suggest another possible way of dealing with it, because we are all trying to find a way in which this point can be dealt with. It is this: additional evidence cannot be adduced at the trial unless, after the man has been committed, after the depositions are completed, he is given notice of that additional evidence. It might be possible to provide that where a prosecution wanted to add a count to the indictment&#x2014;something in addition to the charges on which the man had been committed&#x2014;they should not be allowed to do that unless they had given notice to the accused in the same way as one gives notice of additional evidence. There is no period on additional evidence at the present time.

I am not sure that would operate, but I mention it in the hope that the right hon. Gentleman will consider it.</p>

<p>By the leave of the House, I would like to say that I have listened to the various suggestions made, and they will all be taken into consideration. In regard to the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for West Leicester (Mr. Janner), I will say that I would endeavour to supply a copy of the indictment but I cannot undertake to supply understanding at the same time; that clearly must be for members of the legal profession to supply to their clients when they get the indictment. With regard to the remarks of the hon. and learned Member for Wirral (Mr. Selwyn Lloyd), I have been associated with clerks of the peace for over 40 years, and I can assure him that I intend in these matters to apply to those who are helpful, who are public spirited&#x2014;and I believe they are the great majority&#x2014;and who desire to see the system of justice administered in their courts as perfect as possible, and who would desire to co-operate in the spirit shown in this House this afternoon. I will earnestly endeavour to do something in this matter in another place.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That the Clause be read a Second time."<br/>
Hon. Members will be aware that under the Summary Jurisdiction Act, 1848, an information is laid before the justices alleging that a person has committed an offence and a summons is issued on such information; if he does not appear a


warrant is issued. Under the Indictable Offences Act, 1848, a summons or warrant is issued on the information, but only where it is intended to issue a warrant is the information required to be on oath. The position, therefore, is that assuming a written information is laid, whether it is sworn or not, it contains the details on which the charge is made, whether the charge be by way of summons or warrant. It may well be that the magistrate who issued the summons, and who knows what is contained in the information, is the magistrate who will adjudicate on the matter; it may be that he is the person who will try the case to ascertain whether there is a <i>prima facie</i> case for committal of the person for trial by jury.<br/>
There are cases, and I suppose they are the rule where the contents of the information are disclosed, but there are cases where magistrates have refused to disclose the information. I venture to suggest that this House will accept the position that an accused person ought to know in detail what is alleged against him, and he ought to be in a position to be able to deal with any charge brought against him. If the information and any documents annexed are not disclosed, then I suggest that the citizen, in effect, is being accused upon a secret document which is being withheld from the court. Furthermore, the defence is in the position that it cannot cross-examine the mind of the magistrate because it does not know what is in his mind. Then there may be the case where a lying accuser gives evidence in the witness box contradicting the private story he has told to the magistrate who, on the information, issued the summons.<br/>
5.30 p.m.<br/>
Often it is only where that information is fully disclosed that cross-examination can be made in detail of witnesses in the witness box. It may well be that the magistrate has something in his mind of which the accused person knows nothing and that may prejudice the case from the start. If the average Englishman were told that a person in a foreign country was being accused on a secret document he would say, "It could not happen here," but it does happen here, and from my personal experience I know that there are cases where magistrates have refused to disclose the contents of an information to accused persons.<br/>
If one looks through the sections of the Summary Jurisdiction Act, or the Indictable Offences Act, one sees that the whole tenor of those Measures is that informations should be disclosed to accused persons, but nowhere is there a direct obligation laid on the court they they should be disclosed. Obviously, a strong case can be made out here, and I suggest that it is of the greatest importance to thousands of persons who pass through the conks, and who are affected by this matter. I hope the Government will see their way to give favourable consideration to this new Clause.</p>

<p>I beg to second the Motion.<br/>
In doing so there is no necessity for me to say a great deal about the new Clause in addition to what has been said by my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke Newington (Mr. Weitzman). I feel there is some association between the new Clause which we have just been discussing, and this new Clause, and I hope my right hon. Friend will see his way to take the same view in regard to this matter. I believe the suggestions contained in this proposed new Clause are in accord with the best traditions of British justice. If the State, or private persons, prosecute a man, the accused should be entitled to know in full detail what is the case against him. I hope that today we may take this further step in the reform of British justice as a further manifestation of the essential fairness of our code of justice. I have not used many words, but my enthusiasm fur this proposal is none the less.</p>

<p>The House will appreciate that it is not in every case that there is any information in writing to disclose. Although in summary cases there is an obligation to have an information in writing, the vast majority of informations are in fact almost identical with the summonses and in indictable offences there may be no written information to disclose at all. Under the Indictable Offences Act informations may, it is true, sometimes exist in writing, but I am told that very frequently in proceedings initiated by summons&#x2014;and proceedings are initiated by summons in a very large proportion of cases&#x2014;no written information exists. This new Clause does only apply and could only apply, to the minority of


cases in which there was a written information. It seems rather illogical that the right of the accused to know the information on which the charges against him have been based, if such a right should exist at all, should depend on the fortuitous circumstance whether such information exists in writing, or not.<br/>
No doubt the real question which the House will wish to consider is whether any such right should be given in any case, even in those where written informations do exist, to the accused to have it disclosed to him. The great objection, it seems to us, is that to provide the accused with a copy of the written information in advance of the trial would necessarily involve disclosing to him, not only the general nature of the evidence upon which the charges against him were based, but also the names and addresses of possible witnesses. That, of course, would enable unscrupulous persons&#x2014;and there are such persons&#x2014;to attempt to get in touch with those potential witnesses before their evidence has come to be given and to seek to induce them in one way or another to alter their stories.<br/>
I do not want to go into the matter in detail, but only recently there was a very important case in which the name of a witness slipped out in the preliminary proceedings, before the witness had come to give his evidence, in which the witness altered his story considerably at the magistrate's court, and disappeared before the trial. That is the sort of danger which might arise if some time in advance of the day on which he comes to give evidence his name and the substance of what it is thought he is likely to say has to be disclosed to the other side.<br/>
In view of those dangers it seems difficult to say that the accused must be given in advance, not the evidence upon which he is going to be tried, and upon which he may be convicted&#x2014;that has to be given on oath, in public, in court&#x2014;but what may have been said, or may not have been said on the information which has nothing to do with the evidence upon which an accused person is tried and eventually convicted. It seems to us in those circumstances that it is not right that the information upon which the prosecution has sought to initiate proceedings, but on which it can no further and no longer rely, should be disclosed to the defence.<br/>
After all, there is no obligation on the defence to disclose their information, although it might be very useful in cross-examination of witnesses called by the defence to see the stories they gave to their solicitors, and to compare them with the evidence they actually give in court. No doubt that would be of advantage, but there seems no good reason when dealing with cases which have to be tried on the evidence given in court on oath, and in public&#x2014;which is what matters to disclose what witnesses may, or may not, have said on some previous and private occasion. The defendant is not concerned with the grounds which may have led the prosecution to initiate proceedings, or even with the grounds which may have led a particular magistrate&#x2014;who is not usually the magistrate who tries the case, although I agree sometimes he may be&#x2014;to agree to the issue of a summons, or the issue of a warrant. What the defence are concerned with is the evidence given on oath, in court. It is only on that that the accused can be committed for trial, or, in the end, convicted. It does not seem to us to be in the interests of justice that there should be any compulsory disclosure, any general disclosure, in all cases of the information which may have led up to the initiation of the prosecution, of the granting of the summons, or warrant. In those circumstances, we are not in a position to accept the new Clause.</p>

<p>I have listened, as always, with great interest to what has been said by my right hon. and learned Friend, but I venture to submit that there has been an ambiguity of thought in his argument. As I understood that argument he said that if the accused was given a sight of the written information he might, were he of an unscrupulous frame of mind, upset the due administration of justice, possibly by getting into touch with the proposed witnesses for the prosecution, thereby preventing the fair and due course of the trial. In practice, in indictable cases the accused is given not merely the names and addresses of the witnesses for the prosecution, but the contents of their evidence. Those who practise in criminal courts know full well that it is not frequently, in indictable cases, that the accused puts the defence before the stipendiary or the bench; the defence is reserved. In practice, what obtains is that the defendant is made aware of all


the names and addresses of each and every one of the prosecution's witnesses and the actual evidence already given.</p>

<p>Is my hon. Friend saying that it is the practice anywhere to give the defence copies of the names and addresses of the prosecution's witnesses and of the evidence which they may be going to give before they have actually given it? They are, of course, entitled to the evidence when it has been given on oath; those are the depositions upon which the committal is based. I do not know of any practice in any court with which I am familiar of giving copies of the evidence in advance.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1948-04-15a.1211.1" hansard_membership_id="12683" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20789" speakername="Mr. Solley" colnum="1211" time="">
<p>I am sorry if there should have been any misunderstanding. If it is due to the inadequacy of my explanation, I apologise. The point I was making was that, in so far as the defendant might be tempted to interfere with the administration of justice because he knows of the identity of the witnesses for the prosecution, he can do it as easily under the present system, whereby the prosecution's witnesses actually go into the witness box in the court of summary jurisdiction, as he could do if the Clause which we are now discussing were adopted.<br/>
I understood the Attorney-General's argument to be that if this Clause becomes law an unscrupulous defendant will be able to tamper with the prosecution's witnesses. It is true that under the proposed new Clause such tampering could take place before the evidence is given by those witnesses, but under the present system the defendant can still tamper with those witnesses, because he knows who they are, it is true after evidence has been given openly in a court of first instance, but before the case goes before the jury, which is really the substantive trial in a case which goes to assize or quarter sessions.<br/>
Another point to be borne in mind is that it is on the basis of the written information that the prosecution normally presents its case. It is by no means unusual for maliciously minded individuals, for their own purposes, to swear to facts or give as evidence statements which ultimately form the basis of this information, which are totally inaccurate and false&#x2014;probably false to the knowledge of the deponent, the person who lays the

information. Why should not the defendant, in such a case, have the opportunity, at some stage or other, of seeing what was said originally by the prosecutor, of seeing to what extent in a particular case such a statement was maliciously and falsely made, and to what extent, if any, the defendant could have his remedy in a civil court as a result of any such false or malicious statement?<br/>
5.45 p.m.<br/>
I put it before the House as a matter of principle that not only should a defendant have the opportunity of knowing with complete particularity the case which is to be made against him; he should also be in a position to check the information which was given to the prosecution, and which initiated the prosecution, with the actual evidence which was subsequently adduced by the prosecution, in order to test, if necessary by cross-examination in court, the <i>bona fides</i> of the prosecution. For these and certain other reasons which have already been referred to, I ask the Government whether they can reconsider their attitude, and if they cannot accept this Clause, whether they can accept the principle and embody it in a clause of their own drafting, at some stage in the proceedings on this Bill.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1948-04-15a.1212.0" hansard_membership_id="6619" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/16600" speakername="Mr. Janner" colnum="1212" time="">
<p>I wish to add a few words on the point which has been made. It may be that the difficulty which the Attorney-General has seen in this matter lies in the fact, as he himself said, that at the commencement of the proceedings he does not desire that the name of witnesses, or somebody who may be called, should be disclosed. That may be very well at the commencement of the proceedings, but surely there is some stage of the proceedings at which this information should be available to the accused person. If my right hon. and learned Friend could devise some method by which the defendant would be entitled to have placed before him the statement on which he had been brought before the court, my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke Newington (Mr. Weitzman) would probably be satisfied.<br/>
As I understand it, the proposal is not intended to give an opportunity to a defendant to utilise information for the purpose of evading the consequences of any acts that have been committed by him. What is really intended is that an


accused person shall know the exact details of the accusation which has been made against him when the proceedings were begun, and so not be placed in a position whereby someone who is prosecuted has not had the information which the court has had. It is reasonable to ask the Government that at some stage before the preliminary proceedings are finished the defendant should have an opportunity of cross-examining on those points or of having a witness recalled if necessary, and of taking such other steps as may be necessary when a malicious prosecution has been instituted against him without there being any real foundation for the information which has been laid. I hope the Attorney-General will reconsider the matter from that point of view.</p>

<p>May I have the leave of the House to deal with one or two of the points that have been raised by the Attorney-General? The apparent difficulty put forward about this Clause is simply that if the information is supplied the names and addresses of witnesses may be disclosed, and an accused person or someone connected with him may, in some unscrupulous fashion, approach witnesses or do something wrongly in regard to the case. In that matter there may be a difficulty to be dealt with. On the other hand, we have to face the fact that we desire to see that an accused person has every opportunity of knowing what case is made against him, and of dealing with it in the greatest possible detail.<br/>
It is wrong that a magistrate who tries the case should have in his mind information which is not disclosed to the accused person. It is wrong that the accused person should not have the opportunity of being given that information. I think the suggestion made by the hon. Member for West Leicester (Mr. Janner) is a good one. If it is thought that disclosing the information at a very early period would bring about the danger of witnesses being tampered with, I suggest that the difficulty would easily be overcome by making the information available to the defence if necessary at some period after the person is committed for trial, but at any rate in such a manner that the accused person would have the opportunity of having that matter before him.<br/>
I am sure that there must be many hon. Members who know of actual

instances of persons going into the witness box and telling stories quite different from the stories set out in the information. Many magistrates allow the information to be disclosed, and them the defence is in the happy position of being able to compare the information and the statements made in the information with the actual evidence given on oath. It can then be demonstrated immediately when a false charge is being made. No accused person should be put in peril in a matter of this kind, and I ask my right hon. and learned Friend to say that consideration will be given to this matter to remedy what I suggest is a very real grievance.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend has now made a rather different suggestion from that contained in the proposed new Clause. He has suggested that copies of the information ought to be made available in those cases where there is a committal for trial, and after the committal. That is a substantially different proposition from the one he originally advanced. I obviously cannot give any undertaking in the matter, but I will give consideration to it and see whether it may be possible to make some such provision in another place.<br/>
I do not think the practice is that the trial court, certainly in indictable cases, has the information before it. It may happen, it may be so in summary cases, that the magistrate who issued the summons, or authorised the warrant is the magistrate who actually tries the case. That is fortuitous. It is no part of the ordinary system of administration of justice that the information should be considered by or be before the judge or justice who tries the case. So far as the defendant is concerned, he knows what the charge is when he gets the summons, or is charged. He knows what the evidence is when it comes to be given. If it takes him by surprise, he is entitled to some adjournment in order to consider it. But he cannot be convicted on anything except the evidence given in the court, and the vital thing for the defendant is not what may or may not have been said on the application for the original warrant or summons, but the evidence against him in the court. I will consider the modified proposal of my hon. Friend.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That the Clause be read a Second time."<br/>
This new Clause raises the question which which I regard as of some importance. I hope that the right hon. and learned Gentleman will also agree that it is one of considerable importance in the practice of our courts, particularly after the discussion which we had last Friday. I am glad that the right hon. and learned Gentleman is able to be here this afternoon to give us the assistance of his views upon this matter. Under this new Clause, provision is made for an appeal from the Divisional Court of the High Court in any criminal case or matter. That right of appeal does not exist at the present time.<br/>
I think it is true to say that that court not only recently, but in the years gone by, has had to decide questions of the highest constitutional importance, and will have to do so in the years to come. During the war there was the question of whether those who live in Eire were liable to conscription. There was certainly the case of whether a Dutchman, resident in this country could, during war, be arrested and taken away and dealt with as a deserter from the Netherlands Forces. There was a recent case when the Divisional Court determined that a man who had been an officer was not subject to military law at the time of his conviction by a court martial&#x2014;a case which the Lord Chief Justice of England said was of the highest constitutional importance.<br/>
In connection with those cases, no matter how important be the question,

there is no right of appeal at the present time. From the Court of Criminal Appeal on a matter of important principle there is an appeal to the House of Lords with the consent of the right hon. and learned Gentleman, or the Solicitor-General. The result is that, in practice, we may have a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal on a criminal matter, and a decision of the Divisional Court in a criminal case or matter, which disagree. If the decision of the Divisional Court comes after the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal there is at the moment no machinery whereby the decision of the Divisional Court can be taken to a higher tribunal.<br/>
I hope that the right hon. and learned Gentleman will now agree that there is a great deal of force in the argument that there should be some right of appeal from the Divisional Court. If I have been able to carry him with me, with the pressure of events which have taken place, to that extent, the next question is, what right of appeal should be given? Before I deal with that question I think he will agree that the only way in which we have been able to challenge the decision of the Divisional Court in the past and the only way to do it under the law as it now stands, is by starting what may be a friendly civil action, or resisting a claim for damges for wrongful imprisonment or something of that sort, and taking that case right up to a superior court. It is a cumbrous, awkward piece of machinery to attempt to achieve a simple matter, and I hope that the right hon. and learned Gentleman will agree that there is a case for a right of appeal to a higher court&#x2014;limited to cases of grave principle and high constitutional importance. I was wrong to use the word "right "&#x2014;I should say in regard to cases where an appeal should be brought.<br/>
If provision is made for an appeal from the Divisional Court what conditions should be satisfied before that appeal can be brought? In this new Clause I have said that no appeal shall be brought without leave of the High Court or the Court of Appeal or the House of Lords. The Parliamentary Secretary, when we debated this in Committee, made some comments on the possible multiplicity of applications for leave to appeal. There is some force in his observations but I am not wedded to that part of this new Clause. It may be that the most satis-


factory manner would be to provide machinery similar to that of appeals to the Court of Criminal Appeal, and then the Divisional Court and Court of Criminal Appeal would be in line, with an appeal to the House of Lords with the consent of the Law Officers. Whichever method is adopted, and whether or not the right hon. and learned Gentleman can accept this new Clause as it now stands, I hope that the discussion will, at least, elicit from him the admission that he now recognises the desirability of providing some machinery for appeal and the statement that he will make provision for that machinery, even if he cannot accept this new Clause, when the Bill is discussed in another place.</p>

<p>I must say at the outset, and emphasise my view, that the mere multiplication of appeals is not in the interests of justice. Finality and certainty are very important elements in the law. I have said before and say again that it is a very grave criticism of parts of our judicial machinery that finality is reached in some cases only after they have been taken through as many as four different stages or levels in the judicial hierarchy.<br/>
On the other hand, perhaps it is not generally a good thing that there should be no right of appeal at all. That is certainly the position in regard to some of the cases which come before the Divisional Court. The House will remember, in considering this matter, that in some cases the Divisional Court is itself an appellant court and in some cases it is a court of first instance. By far the greatest part of its work is concerned, I think, with appeals by way of cases stated by courts of summary jurisdiction; part of it is concerned with cases stated from courts of quarter sessions and these cases may themselves be appeals from courts of summary jurisdiction. And part, but quite a small proportion, of the court's work is concerned with cases in which the court is acting as a court of first instance, dealing with what are called the Crown paper cases, under prerogative writs.<br/>
Possibly under both of those different forms of jurisdiction, and certainly under the latter, cases sometimes come before

the Divisional Court which are of great legal difficulty and of considerable public importance. I say at once that I have a great deal of sympathy with the view which was expressed by the hon. and learned Gentleman, that in those cases the possibility of appeal to some higher tribunal ought not entirely to be excluded. I do not say that because any of us have the slightest lack of confidence in the Divisional Court, which is very often, and indeed is usually, presided over by the Lord Chief Justice and commands universal respect. But the court sometimes deals with cases which are so important and so wide in their constitutional and public implications that it may seem desirable that the highest tribunal in the land should be able to deal with them, and&#x2014;this I think is an important point&#x2014;to do so in a way quite unfettered by the previous decisions of courts of subordinate jurisdiction. Only the highest tribunal in the land can deal with cases in that way.<br/>
The hon. and learned Gentleman has pointed out that the Divisional Court occupies a position which corresponds to and is of the same status as the Court of Criminal Appeal. The same reasons may exist as in the case of the Court of Criminal Appeal for providing for the possibility of appeals in exceptional cases. On the other hand, of course, the same reasons, and they are strong and indeed compelling reasons, exist for ensuring that, in the great majority of cases, the decisions of the Divisional Court should be final.<br/>
All that I think I can say on the matter now is that if the hon. and learned Gentleman is prepared to withdraw the proposed new Clause we will give the matter the fullest, and by no means an unsympathetic, consideration. I have not had an opportunity of consulting with my noble Friend, or with the other persons whom it would be proper to consult in a matter of this kind. I cannot therefore commit the Government finally to introducing a Clause on these lines in another place; but we will give most careful thought to it. The hon. and learned Gentleman will judge from what I have said that it will certainly not be unsympathetic consideration.</p>

I did not disagree with anything he said in regard to the limitations which it is right to place upon appeals from the Divisional Court or as to the position which the Divisional Court now occupies and should continue to occupy in our eyes and in the eyes of the public. I shall watch with interest to see what takes place on this point in another place and I hope that my observation of the report will lead to my learning that a provision of this kind is made in another place to deal with this point.</p>

It was that I would consider with sympathy a provision for appeal in exactly the same circumstances as those which now exist in the Court of Criminal Appeal, that is to say, on the fiat of the Attorney-General, where an important point of law is raised and the matter is of public interest.</p>

<p>Speaking for myself, I should be absolutely satisfied.

<p>I beg to move, in page 4, line 1, to leave out from "court," to "is," in line 2.<br/>
There are, on the Paper, three further Amendments also dealing with Clause 4, which, with the consent of the House and yourself, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, it would be desirable that I should deal with at the same time:
<q>In page 4, line 3 after "practitioner," to insert appearing to the court to be experienced in the diagnosis of mental disorders.</q>
<q>In line 3 to leave out second "the" and insert "an.</q>
<q>In line 7, to leave out from "court," to "a," in line 8, and insert "may, if it makes a probation order, include therein.</q>
The first and fourth of these Amendments make it clear that the inclusion in a probation order of a requirement relating to the treatment of a mental condition is governed by the general provisions of Clause 3, which require the consent of an offender over the age of 14 before the order is made. When we were in Committee, my hon. Friend the Member for Nelson and Colne (Mr. S. Silverman) expressed doubt whether this was the effect

of the Subsection as drafted, and I undertook to consider whether the Clause should be amended so as to make this clear. The effect of the first and fourth Amendments will be to make the Subsection read, reciting only the operative words:
<q>(1) Where the court is satisfied &#x2026; may, if it makes a probation order, include therein a requirement &#x2026;</q>
and so on.<br/>
The second and third of these Amendments deal with an undertaking which I gave to make it quite certain that the medical practitioner who was consulted about the mental state of an offender should be one who was really competent to give to the court guidance on the matters in question. It will be seen that I am moving the words:
<q>appearing to the court to be experienced in the diagnosis of mental disorders.</q>
That is as near as I can get. During the Committee stage, I said that I was not going to confer a statutory distinction upon any particular diploma or society that might be formed of medical men who would claim to possess this particular knowledge. It will be the duty of the courts to make themselves reasonably acquainted with the qualifications of the medical practitioners concerned who give an opinion on the matters on which they are consulted. I think this removes the misgivings that were felt by some hon. Members that an ordinary general practitioner with no great knowledge in this matter could be called before the court and express an opinion and an offender might be dealt with on what was really not very skilled advice. I think that these Amendments meet the pledges that I gave during the Committee stage.</p>

<p>Those of us who have fears about the type of medical men who will be consulted are bound to say that my right hon. Friend has gone per-


haps as far as he can go to satisfy those fears. There is not the slightest doubt at all that it is highly essential, in cases where a question of the mental state of the individual concerned is at issue, that the medical man who has to give evidence, or has to give his opinion, should be a person who really understands that particular kind of complaint, and not be one whose practice has not been concerned with that type of complaint.<br/>
We were discussing yesterday a very important matter in the question of capital punishment. In my view these matters relating to the mental state of an accused person are of equal importance to those matters which were then being discussed, because, in the very large number of cases that come before the courts, that particular condition is of material importance and is very often overlooked. We ought to express our thanks to the Home Secretary for having considered that point. I would have preferred, as I think many other hon. Members would, that he went a little further and said that he would not leave it entirely to the opinion of one practitioner. As my Amendment is not being called, I assume I would be out of Order in arguing that; nevertheless, I still hope that, before the final stages of the Bill my right hon. Friend may realise that the matter is a grave one where the question of the mental condition of an individual is concerned, and may, perhaps, extend his generosity towards allowing another practitioner to be consulted as well.</p>

The more substantial Amendment at line 24 substitutes for the first four lines of Subsection (6), as it is now drafted, a provision in similar terms, subject to the modifications which have become necessary in consequence of the Amendment which we have just accepted to Clause 4 (1), which requires the evidence to be that of:

<p>I beg to move, in page 5, line 30, to leave out "appears to the court to be," and insert "is."<br/>
This Amendment appears, as hon. Members may have noticed, in the same form in many places in the Order Paper. There are many different Clauses in this Bill where it is necessary to consider the age of a person coming before the court, whether for purposes of probation or for going to prison or to Borstal detention, as well as for many other purposes. As the Bill is drafted, in each case the phrase is used: "where this person appears to the court to be of a certain age." That


is a reasonable provision, designed to prevent the necessity for strict proof of age if there is no dispute about it. This is really only a drafting Amendment, because what is now proposed is that the phrase:
<q>appears to the court to be</q>
should be omitted in every case throughout the Bill and that, instead of it an Amendment covering all cases where this question of age arises should be inserted in the interpretation Clause towards the end of the Bill. For the convenience of hon. Members I should say that the Amendment referred to is that appearing on the Order Paper in the name of my right hon. Friend&#x2014;in page 58, line 42, at end, insert:
<q>(3) Where the age of any person at any time is material for the purposes of any provision of this Act, or of any Order in Council made thereunder, regulating the powers of a court, his age at the material time shall be deemed to be or to have been that which appears to the court to be or to have been his age at that time.</q>
There are Government Amendments down in the name of my right hon. Friend which cover all the occasions when this phrase occurs in the Bill, a point which, under the present draft, is dealt with separately in each instance. I am explaining this at length because it is a form of Amendment which will occur many times, and I hope that the House will be prepared to accept it as a convenient form of redrafting.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 7. line 41, at the end, to insert:
<q>and a probationer who is required by the probation order to submit to treatment for his mental condition shall not be treated for the purpose of this Act as having failed to comply with that requirement on the ground only that he has refused to undergo any surgical, electrical or other treatment if, in the opinion of the court, his refusal was reasonable having regard to all the circumstances.</q>
This Amendment is moved in accordance with an undertaking given by the Under-Secretary in Committee to consider the inclusion of a provision to the effect that refusal to undergo a surgical operation should not be regarded as a breach of the requirement of a probation order relating to mental treatment. When we were in Committee my hon. Friend drew attention to the difficulty of defining the term "surgical operation" which would apparently include an injection or electrical treatment. In view of this difficulty, it has not been found possible to draft the Amendment so as to provide in terms that refusal to undergo a surgical operation should not be regarded as a breach of the requirement of a probation order relating to mental treatment.<br/>
The provision made by the Amendment is that refusal to undergo surgical, electrical or other treatment should not be regarded as such a breach if, in the opinion of the court, the probationer's refusal was reasonable having regard to all the circumstances. It will thus be for the court to decide whether the refusal in any particular case is reasonable or not. After very careful consideration we have come to the conclusion that this is the only way in which we can satisfactorily meet the very strong views that were expressed in the Committee, and I hope that the House, and in particular those hon. Members who served on the Committee, will feel that we have met the points which were raised.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 15, line 12, at the end, to insert:
<q>(2) Without prejudice to the provisions of Subsection (2) of Section fifty-five of the Children and Young Persons Act, 1933 (which enables a court to order the parent or guardian of a child or young person charged with an offence to give security for his good behaviour), any court may, on making a probation order or an order for conditional discharge under this Part of this Act, if it thinks it expedient for the purpose of the reformation of the offender, allow any person who consents to do so to give security for the good behaviour of the offender; and Section twenty-three of the Summary Jurisdiction Act, 1879, shall apply to any security so given before a court of summary jurisdiction as if it were given under That Act by a surety.</q>
Under the existing law a probation order is made upon the probationer's entering into a recognizance, and the recognizance may be with or without sureties. The Bill abolishes recognizances on probation, and the general powers of a court to take recognizances do not extend to taking them from a surety where the principal is not himself bound over. There is power under Section 55 of the Children and Young Persons Act, 1933, to order the parents or guardian of a child or young person charged with an offence to give security for his good behaviour, but there are cases where someone other than a parent or guardian may be a suitable person.<br/>
I can recall a case at quarter sessions where a number of lads were brought in front of the court, and the local schoolmaster, who was a personal friend of mine, went into the witness box to give evidence about his knowledge of these youths' characters, and expressed his confidence in their reformation if a certain course was adopted by the court. The chairman of quarter sessions said, "That is very interesting testimony. You know these lads very well. Would you be content to be one of the sureties for their good behaviour and to take an interest in them in the future?" My friend agreed on the spot, and, as far as I know, the result was satisfactory in every way.<br/>
There are on occasion citizens of that type, who might be willing to take an interest in a lad or a girl or a group of young people, and undertake to be responsible for their oversight during the period of probation. It is very desirable that these non-professional probation officers should be encouraged wherever they are willing to act. I hope the House will agree that this is a very desirable Amendment to make to the Bill, so that such persons can, through the act of good citizenship, be available for this purpose.</p>

<p>The Government have every good intention in this proposed Subsection, but there is a weakness on which I would like clarification. It is intended, of course, that
<q>any person who consents to do so</q>
will apply to a person of probity and integrity such as a schoolmaster, as has been mentioned by my right hon. Friend. But I can conceive of a case where a young offender has been brought into crime or wrongdoing through the influence of someone who is not a person of probity and integrity&#x2014;a wrongdoer himself who may have some bad influence on the young offender and who, because of his attachment to that person, would be prepared to stand surety. That situation would be possible under these words,
<q>allow any person who consents to do so".</q>
I was wondering whether the Home Secretary would look into this matter with a


view to inserting qualifying words such as:
<q>allow any person of good character to do so.</q>
This may be a minor point, but the words "of good character" would ensure that the offender would be rescued by the help of somebody of good character.</p>

<p>I wish to make a somewhat similar point to that of my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford (Mr. Austin). Unlike him, I have no fears that the court will give its consent lightly. There is the operative word "may" in the Amendment, and I take it that the court would exercise very careful discretion before they allowed someone in effect to take the place of the probation officer. I would like to emphasise that nothing should be done that would automatically substitute other people for the probation officer, and that only someone who was acceptable as a suitable alternative to the probation officer should be the person visualised in this proposal. On that understanding, I would like to express my full support of this Amendment.</p>

<p>By leave of the House, I will draw the attention of my two hon. Friends to the words which are immediately before those quoted by the hon. Member for Stretford (Mr. Austin):
<q>If it thinks it expedient for the purpose of the reformation of the offender.</q>
It is clear the court would not put Mr. Fagin over the Artful Dodger. I think it is clear that we have taken steps in the Clause to ensure that the person chosen shall be a suitable person. I want to say nothing which decries the professional probation officer, but there are some cases &#x2014;on occasion a member of a Rotary club &#x2014;where someone is willing to undertake the supervision of youths. There are people of that description&#x2014;sometimes the employer may be a very suitable person to use. I hope that the work of supervising the probationer will not become an entirely professional matter.</p>

There was some doubt on the Clause as it was originally drafted&#x2014;I think it was raised by the hon. and learned Member for Daventry (Mr. Manningham-Buller)&#x2014;how it was to be proved to the satisfaction of a court of quarter sessions or assize that a probationer had failed to comply with the conditions of a probation order. Was the matter one to be tried by a jury? In what other way would it be dealt with?

<p>I beg to move, in page 16, line 3, to leave out "the court may by order," and to insert:
<q>an order may be made in accordance with the provisions of this Section.</q>
With permission, I should like to explain this Amendment and the following group of Amendments on the Order Paper. In point of fact, all the first six of these Amendments are drafting Amendments and the substantial part of this proposal lies in the new Subsection (2). In Committee, the hon. Member for Hanley (Dr. Barnett Stross) moved an Amendment with a view to ensuring that there should always be an inquiry as to means before a person was sent to prison in default of payment of a fine. That Amendment was resisted, and it was explained that it would be very difficult to have an inquiry of that sort, but it was suggested that there might be an alternative way out of the difficulty by giving power to certain persons to allow time to pay, or payment by instalments, after the fine had actually been imposed. In fact, that suggestion was welcomed by the Committee.<br/>
The new Subsection which it is proposed to add makes provision whereby a person who has been fined, or whose


recognisance has been forfeited at assizes, can apply in writing to a clerk of assize, or a clerk of the peace, to be allowed time to pay, if no order prescribing time for payment was made, or to be granted an extension of time if such order was made, or to be allowed to pay by instalments or have the period of instalments extended. Power is given by the proposed Subsection to the chairman or deputy chairman, or recorder or deputy recorder, or the judge of the high court in the case of assizes, to make an order on such an application. I hope the House will feel that this provides the sort of safeguard which was asked for in Committee and, in effect, does much the same as though we had not been unable, on practical grounds, to provide for an inquiry as to ability to pay.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 18, line 5, to leave out "of summary jurisdiction."<br/>
I am very grateful that I have the opportunity of raising a matter which has had some discussion in the Standing Committee but which I raise again at this stage of the Bill because I feel it has a tremendous importance for the future, particularly in regard to young offenders. May I read the Subsection with which we are concerned:
<q>A court of summary jurisdiction shall not impose imprisonment on a person appearing to the court to be under 17 years of age; and a court of assize or quarter sessions shall not impose imprisonment on a person appearing to the court to be under 15 years of age.</q>
I felt, and expressed the view in Standing Committee&#x2014;a,nd I had a lot of support in this connection&#x2014;that it was not right in these enlightened days that any young person under the age of 17 should be sentenced to terms of imprisonment by any court in the land. The Subsection lays down that such a position shall apply in the case of a court of summary jurisdiction, but the power is enlarged and widened in the case of quarter sessions or court of assize. I am pressing that what applies to a court of summary jurisdiction in this connection shall also apply to the two higher courts mentioned.<br/>
During the discussion in Standing Committee my right hon. Friend and the hon. and learned Member for Exeter (Mr. Maude) adduced their arguments very largely on the illustration of the Standon Farm case; where young boys actually killed one of their masters. It was suggested that this outstanding case was an illustration of how what we want done would operate. We are now laying down conditions for very many years to come, and we cannot base them upon an individual, isolated case of that kind. We must look ahead, realising that we shall not have opportunities for many years,

probably, of putting this question right, if we do not put it right now. By then, anyway, many of the other provisions of the Bill will have been implemented. There will be places where young persons of that type may receive the right treatment. So I oppose&#x2014;and I am confident that I have much support on all sides of the House&#x2014;the principle that any court should have the power to sentence any person under 17 years of age to imprisonment as we know it now.<br/>
This Clause agrees in principle with what I am saying&#x2014;that no law court shall have that power. Therefore, my right hon. Friend must feel that, in itself, this is a desirable thing. I ask, therefore, Why give that power to the higher courts? Steadily through the years this country has lifted the age at which young people can be sent to prison, and that reform has been approved by the overwhelming mass of our people. It may be many years before an opportunity once more presents itself for further reforms. With the school-leaving age now established at 15 we regard boys and girls as children up to the age of 16 and until they reach their seventeenth birthdays. It is to me a very deplorable thing that such children may be sent to prison with all the stigma that such imprisonment carries with it. We have means at our disposal to avoid that, and we shall have greater means at our disposal as soon as this Bill is implemented. I want to be brief because I share the general desire to get this Bill through, but I feel impelled to make another appeal to my right hon. Friend to have another look at this matter, so that we shall save ourselves for many years to come from sending young persons to prison.</p>

The age of 17 is surely a reasonable one in present day circumstances. That, however, is the age which has been fixed only for the courts of summary jurisdiction. The argument in Standing Committee was that the other courts, run by more experienced people, and which have more severe offences which to deal with, might have these special cases which to deal with. It is always very difficult indeed to draw a line at any particular age. The case of the boys shooting their master has been cited. It is perfectly true that they may be just under the age of 17.


On the other hand, they could easily have been one month under the age of 15. It is very difficult to see where the line should be drawn and to say that those on the one side must go to prison and that those on the other side must be dealt with in some other way. I suggest that the people we represent, generally speaking, would regard with horror the prospect of boys and girls being sent to prison under the age of 17. We have these other methods of dealing with them, and I hope that, on reconsideration, the Home Secretary will be able to tell us that the age of 17 will be the bottom age for the courts of summary jurisdiction, the courts of assize and quarter sessions.</p>

<p>I must say that this Amendment has a very great appeal for me. It is an appalling thing that we send youngsters of less than 17 years of age to prison. On the other hand, I understand the problem with which the Home Secretary is faced. It is the problem of a small residue, with whom it is extremely difficult to deal. We have to realise that that problem exists. What rather worries me is that in the Criminal Justice Bill which was introduced in 1939, the minimum age for all courts was 16. Now it is 17 for courts of summary jurisdiction and 15 for the higher courts. I wonder what has caused the change in the mind of the Home Secretary between 1939 and 1948? It may be the undoubted growth of delinquency&#x2014;and serious delinquency &#x2014;among comparatively young people that has occurred since the war; but these are abnormal times. Had the Criminal Justice Bill of 1939 fortunately been passed we should still have been dealing with the law relating to the imprisonment of juveniles at the minimum age of 16 years. I hardly think that a new Bill would have been introduced to reduce that age. There is a problem, I admit. It is probably very little exacerbated by present conditions. I am not sure that I should vote for the Amendment if it were sent to a Division, but I should be very unhappy indeed if the Clause went through in its present form.<br/>
With regard to the imprisonment of juveniles by summary courts, the Home Secretary has taken power by Order in Council to vary the age. It seems to me that, as the present exceptional conditions pass, and as we certainly shall under this Bill develop new forms of institutions for

dealing with the extraordinarily difficult type of youngsters with whom the Clause as drafted is intended to deal, there may be very good grounds, if not immediately, at any rate, later on, for raising the age below which even a higher court may not send a child to prison. I think that first of all the Home Secretary ought to let us know why the age is being dropped from 16 to 15. I would suggest to him that in another place he takes power, as he has done in respect of Summary Courts under Subsection (3) of the Clause, to raise the age, if and when it is possible, for the higher courts, as well as the summary courts.</p>

<p>This question raises matters of considerable moral and philosophical importance. I hope that the hon. Members opposite&#x2014;the hon. Member for West Salford (Mr. Royle) and the hon. Member for Central Hackney (Mr. H. Hynd), and particularly the hon. Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Benson) who, but for the fact that I always stick to Parliamentary terms, I would describe as my hon. Friend, because he is&#x2014;will not think I am saying anything wounding if I say that the strong feeling of emotional desire to avoid what seems to them horror, is sometimes a bad guide in jurisprudence. We should be concerned with the practical realities of the situation. Over and over again, during the 43 years that I have been in this House, I have heard the sort of argument which has just been put forward. It is easy to produce specious arguments, and to carry them to their logical conclusion; but fortunately the House of Commons, like the British public, is never logical. We might just as well say that it would be terrible to imprison an old man of 75, with one year's life ahead of him, as say that it would be terrible to send a boy of 16 to prison. I do not want to enter into a philosophical argument, but when the Home Secretary replies I hope that he will deal with the practical difficulty that there must be power to send to prison certain people of the age under review because there is nowhere else where it would be safe to send them.<br/>
I do not want to be provocative, but I must deprecate the use of the word "children" here. Do hon. Members opposite realise that boys of 17 fight in


the Army and the Navy? They are not children at all: if they were, they would not be allowed to fight.</p>

<p>I must be permitted to make my own speech in my own way. I am making a statement of fact, as the hon. Member well knows, and it is no use his trying to controvert the fact. For the benefit of the hon. Member, I will repeat my statement. To describe as "children" young men of an age at which they fight in the Army and Navy is a misuse of the word. [<i>Interruption.</i>] It is no use the hon. Member bubbling with indignation and pointing at me. To call such young men "children" is to use the word sentimentally. They are not children but young persons.<br/>
Everybody knows that there are certain young persons who can be dealt with only in the way laid down in the Clause. To judge from the arguments which have been used in this and other matters&#x2014;though not by the hon. Member for Chesterfield&#x2014;one would suppose that in recent years nothing had been done to improve our prison system. We on this side of the House are sometimes accused of not sufficiently enhancing the prestige of this country. Yet some of the speeches made by hon. Members opposite during Committee&#x2014;to which we cannot now refer in detail&#x2014;and on Report, lead one to believe&#x2014;though this is not their purpose &#x2014;that in this country we have the most brutal prison system in the world. In fact we have one of the best, and this Bill, which is ameliorative and non-party, is intended to improve that system. It is only fair to the Home Secretary to say that.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman may reply to his hon. Friends that he is prepared to reconsider this matter. I have risen for the purpose of deprecating both the use of the word "children," and the contention that in no circumstances&#x2014;and I stand by this&#x2014;should young ruffians of 16 be sent to prison. During wartime I have seen and fought against people of 16 who thoroughly deserved to be sent to prison. I object to the view that in no circumstances should such people be sent to prison. I would agree with both hon. Members opposite who have supported this Amendment if this were common practice, and if there were in the

Bill no alternative but that these young persons should always be sent to prison. If that were so, I should be with hon. Members opposite 1oo per cent. But I ask the House to have regard tonight to the practical considerations in this case.</p>

<p>We had a very interesting discussion on this question in Committee, in which my hon. Friends who have spoken today took part, and I appreciate the view which they put forward. It is a horrible thing to send anybody under 17 years of age to prison. It is a still more horrible thing, to my mind, that there are some persons under 17 for whom there is no alternative. I can assure the House that it is only with the greatest reluctance, and after trying every alternative, that we come to this final, sad conclusion. Unfortunately, there are persons under 17 years of age whose tempers are so violent, and whose natures are so refractory, that it is not possible to keep them, with safety to the physical and moral welfare of the other inmates, in these institutions, where we are trying to deal with persons of this age.<br/>
I, as Home Secretary&#x2014;as my predecessors have been, and as I am afraid my successors for some time to come will be&#x2014;am confronted with the fact that in the circumstances there is no alternative treatment for this very small minority of young people. In this Bill the age is reduced from 16 to 15 because, as a result of practical experience, it has been discovered that there were a few cases of boys between 15 and 16 who could not be kept in any other form of institution, and whom public opinion would not have allowed us to liberate into the community without taking some steps to bring home to the offenders the inevitable consequences of the course they were pursuing. One of the boys concerned in the Standon Farm inquiry was between 15 and 16 years of age. I hope it will not go out, as a result of this discussion that any very large number of boys or girls is dealt with in this way.</p>

<p>I cannot give it at the moment, but it is very small indeed. I


can assure my hon. Friend that when I am asked to consent to this course and do so, it is always with the greatest reluctance. Even in the Standon Farm case I took a very long time, and considered all the other courses which might have enabled me to avoid sending the lads to prison, before I finally decided that there was no alternative. I am sure that any other person who has served in my office, irrespective of his party, would adopt the same attitude towards this problem.<br/>
I am grateful to the noble Lord for one thing he said. In the course of the discussions on this Bill some hon. Members have made statements which might indicate that in this country we have a prison system of which we ought to be thoroughly ashamed. I am not saying our system is perfect; it is a long way from being perfect; and because of circumstances of our times it is not so good as it otherwise might be. During the past few days I have had the privilege of showing a very distinguished American visitor to this country round some of the institutions in which we deal with juvenile offenders and young persons. I was assured that this visitor to our shores was impressed with the fact that in dealing with these young people we are a long way ahead of the most enlightened States of the United States of America.<br/>
It is the ambition of everybody connected with this system, which is designed for these young people whom we desire to prevent becoming recruits to the criminal class, that it shall operate in an atmosphere as reformative, helpful and constructive as possible. Unfortunately, there is a number&#x2014;a very limited number&#x2014;of young people who, were an attempt made to keep them inside our more progressive institutions, would, through their evil influence and the way in which they decline to co-operate with those whose ambition it is to help them, wreck the work being done there. I should like to be able to accept an Amendment of this kind, but I have to face the realities in connection with the office I fill. If I accepted this Amendment, I should then be in a position that I could not deal with the very limited number of these young people in the interests of society, and particularly in the interests of the society with which they will be associated when they come within the penal system of the country.</p>

It would be for the convenience of the Committee if we discussed this Amendment with the Amendment in line 15, which immediately follows. In Committee, I undertook to consider amending this Clause to make it clear that "character" means something more than the past record of the individual, and that the court should also take into consideration the mental and physical condition of the individual. These Amendments give effect to this undertaking. The Clause places a duty on the court to obtain information about the circumstances of the case before imposing imprisonment on a person under 21. It is undesirable that the duty of obtaining information about the mental and physical condition should be placed on the court, because this would mean that the court would have to have a medical report in the case of every offender under 21. This danger was pointed out by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Northampton (Mr. Paget) when we were discussing an Amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Hanley (Dr. Stross). As my hon. and learned Friend said, the effect of such a requirement would be to place a very heavy burden on the rates and on the over-worked medical profession.<br/>
Accordingly, the Amendment provides that the court, in addition to obtaining information about the circumstances, shall take into account any information before the court which is relevant to the offender's character and to his physical and mental condition. There will be no obligation on the court to obtain such information where there is nothing in the circumstances of the case to suggest that any such inquiry is necessary. They will, of course, always have information before them as to the past record, where it is known, of the person concerned. This Amendment has been very carefully considered in order to carry out the undertaking I gave.</p>

<q>and that he may thereafter be required to be under the supervision of a probation officer for a period equal to the period for which he is ordered to be detained.</q>
This raises a question which was discussed on the Committee stage, in regard to which the right hon. Gentleman finally said he would give consideration before the Report stage. He undertook to consider whether the words he proposed including in the Fifth Schedule were sufficient to meet the point. Under Clause 17, there is power to send a person under 21 and not less than 14 to a detention centre for a period from three to six months. My Amendment proposes to deal with what should happen to that person when he comes out of the detention centre, where, as the right hon. Gentleman said, he will learn a short, sharp lesson.<br/>
It would be an improvement to this Bill, as well as an advantage, if the court, sentencing a young man to a detention centre, has power to say that he will go to a detention centre for one month and will thereafter be under the probation officer for a period of three or four months. It is very important that the young man should be placed under the probation officer. He should feel that he has an obligation to the court to comply with the requirements of the probation officer after he has served his period in a detention centre. I think that we may get better co-operation in that way, rather than by relying solely on the voluntary efforts of the probation officer.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman, in meeting this point, pointed out that he would make provision for probation officers and after-care committees to look after the person who has been in a detention centre. I am sure that the House will welcome


any steps taken to that end. It is quite a different thing to arrange with a body of the highest repute to take on that duty, than to arrange that the individual concerned shall be ordered by a court to be upon probation after service of his period of detention. I hope that I have made the point clear to the right hon. Gentleman. I am not quite sure that I succeeded in doing so on the Committee stage, having regard to his answer.<br/>
I feel that one does not want a young man to be in a detention centre a moment longer than is necessary, but it may facilitate a court which has a difficult task in deciding what is the right thing to do, and it may enable the court to pass a shorter period of detention, if they had an opportunity, which they have not under this Bill as it now stands, of saying that there shall be detention for one month or six weeks, and, thereafter, the young person will be placed on probation. They cannot do that now. All they can say now is that the young person shall go to a detention centre for three to six months, and, thereafter, it will be left to the excellent voluntary work of the after-care committees and probation officers, but with this important element lacking&#x2014;that the young gentleman will not be under the obligation to comply with the requirements of the probation order.</p>

<p>I beg to second the Amendment.<br/>
One aspect which has not been touched upon concerns the probation officer. If the young offender goes wrong later, he will come into the hands of the probation officer in some form or other, and I think that it is important that the probation officer should be able to have custody of him as soon as he has finished his period of detention.</p>

<p>There is not much, I think, between the hon. and learned Member for Daventry (Mr. Manningham-Buller) and myself on this point. I should like to assure him that I understood his argument previously, although I may not have expressed myself in reply to it in the best way. The fault was mine, and not his, in not making the point clear. Probation for people over 14 is an arrangement that is entered into with the consent of the probationer. We might be faced with the situation that it was thought right to send a young person to

a detention centre. When he heard that, he might be unwilling to consent to be placed on probation after that period. I am not sure whether the hon. and learned Gentleman means that, in this particular case, his consent should not be sought, and that he should be sentenced to probation or not. That would entirely alter the relationship of the probationer to the probation service.<br/>
That is the difficulty with which I am confronted. It may be that a person perfectly suitable for a detention centre would in fact not be sent there because he declined to accept the probation period, if it were left voluntary. If it were made compulsory, then his cooperation with the probation officer might not be as effective as we would desire it to be. The success of probation depends upon some appreciable measure of co-operation on the part of the probation officer. If he regards it as merely an association that has been forced on to him, I do not think that the best effect will be obtained from it. That, as shortly and as clearly as I can put it, is my objection to the form of words which the hon. and learned Gentleman wants to insert into the Bill.<br/>
I have provided in the Fifth Schedule that it is part of the probation officer's duty to advise, assist and befriend in such cases and in such manner as may be prescribed, persons who have been released from custody, and this provision was inserted in the Bill with these particular young people most clearly in mind. I suggest that the efforts of the probation officer to establish contact with the young person will probably be more effective in this class of case if the association is a voluntary one, entered into with consent and not forced upon him by an order of the court. I am very grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman for the interest which he has taken in this matter, and I think that we both have the same object in view. My own fear is that if we make a compulsory probation order, the probation officers do not start off with the kind of relationship which exists where the probationer has consented to the probation order.</p>

<p>With the leave of the House, may I say that the right hon. Gentleman has obviously given great thought to this matter. I was not suggesting compulsory probation orders.


I had in mind that the young offender might well agree to submit to the probation order at the time he is told that he has to go to a detention centre. In these cases, I should have thought that it would have been an advantage that the court should have power to make a probation order. I was not suggesting that it should be compulsory in the least degree. I would like the right hon. Gentleman to give this matter a little further thought.

<q>quarter sessions for sentence in accordance with the following provisions of this section.</q>
<q>(4) An offender so committed as aforesaid, shall be committed&#x2014;

<li>(<i>a</i>) where the court of summary jurisdiction acts for a county other than the County of London, to the appeal committee of the quarter sessions for that county;</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) in any other case, to the next court of quarter sessions having jurisdiction in the county, borough or place for which the court of summary jurisdiction acts;</li></ol>
and where the offender is so committed to an appeal committee, the clerk to the court of summary jurisdiction shall notify the clerk of the peace, and the clerk of the peace shall give notice to the prosecutor and to the governor of the remand centre or prison to which the offender is committed of the date on which the case will be dealt with by the appeal committee, being the next practicable sitting of that committee.</q>
<q>(5) Where an offender is so committed for sentence as aforesaid, the appeal committee or court of quarter sessions shall inquire into the circumstances of the case and may&#x2014;</q>
<q>(<i>a</i>) if.</q>
The House may remember that in Committee Amendments were made to Clause 27 which related to commital for sentences

so that the commital should be to the appeals committee of quarter sessions in counties except in the county of London. The object of this Amendment and the series to page 20 which follows it is to bring the Clause into line with the amended procedure. Clause 18 deals with the committal for sentences for Borstal training. There is in this respect no distinction to be drawn between committal for other types of sentences and committal for Borstal training.<br/>
The reason it is considered appropriate in the other instance under Clause 27 that the appeal should go to the appeals committee is that in any event the appeal against conviction would come before that committee, and if there is to be a committal for sentence it was thought that it was better that it should go before the same tribunal, so that the two could be treated together by the same court. It was also clear that by bringing it before the appeals committee a good deal of time could be saved, because the appeals committee could meet any time. There is a provision under Clause 18 to ensure that committal will not be to assizes as it can be at present, but to quarter sessions in order to bring the procedure of the two sections into line. I hope with that explanation the House will be prepared to agree to the Amendment.</p>

<p>On consideration of what the Under-Secretary has said in regard to Clauses 27 and 18, I am rather worried, and I would urge that the matter should be given very careful consideration, because I am inclined to think that we are going to have a tremendous rush to quarter sessions. Persons will decide that it would be better to exercise their rights to go for trial rather than be tried by the magistrates and then sent on to quarter sessions. They will be advised by their legal advisers not to be tried at petty sessions with the result we will get a rush into our courts of quarter sessions. I very much fear that this will be the practical result of these Clauses, and I would ask that this matter should be given very careful consideration.</p>

This deals with a point raised on Second Reading and in Committee by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for North Leeds (Mr. Peake) and others. It deals with a matter of some considerable importance. This Amendment will ensure that any person arraigned on an indictment will be able to challenge not more than seven jurors without showing cause. Previously the number has been much larger. We had originally intended that this right should disappear.<br/>
I am informed by lawyers that it is very rarely exercised. In fact, although I have, as a magistrate, had to attend quarter sessions on many occasions, I have never seen it exercised. The only occasion on which I have heard it mentioned was on an occasion when the clerk of the peace had forgotten to warn the prisoner, who was a man of some experience in these matters, of his rights. At the end of the swearing of the jury, he drew attention to the lack of consideration which he had received, but he did not challenge anyone when a new jury was called into the box. I think that he thought that he had sufficiently asserted the important principle which was at stake.<br/>
7.45 p.m.<br/>
We feel, and I think that it was felt by the Committee, that the arrangement we make here will adequately safeguard the rights of accused persons. They preserve what is an historic feature of the work of the courts, a thing in itself not to be despised. We also carry out something which is not in the existing law. We give the right of peremptory challenge to persons arraigned for misdemeanour as well as for felony. In these days when those two words have a quite different significance in actual reality to what they have in the popular mind, that again is a not unimportant alteration in the law. I hope that the right hon. Member for North Leeds and other hon. Members will feel that the undertakings we gave are fully met by this Amendment.</p>

<p>I also wish to thank the right hon. Gentleman for moving this Amendment. I think it was I who first raised the matter in Committee. The right hon.

He has adopted a modified form. I thank him for what he has done, but I am sorry that he did not accede to my suggestion <i>in toto.</i> This is a historic right which was enjoyed by accused persons, and though it was not used as frequently as was the right to challenge for cause, it is a right which may possibly, under present circumstances, be used more frequently. It may be used in the case of a Jew who is on trial. He may see a Fascist coming to the box to be sworn, and he may be unable to prove that that is so. If he has a right of peremptory challenge, he can challenge without showing cause. It is obvious that there are other cases in which this right may be most useful. I am sorry that the right hon. Gentleman has not made it a little more expansive, but I thank him for what he has done.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 30, line 45, after "conviction," to insert "order."<br/>
Under this Clause a person convicted by a court of summary jurisdiction shall have the right of appeal (<i>a</i>) if he has pleaded guilty, against his sentence and (<i>b</i>) in any other case, against the conviction or sentence, to a court of quarter sessions. My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for West Derby (Sir D. Maxwell Fyfe) raised this matter in Committee, and suggested that after the word "sentence" the words "or order" should be inserted. The Under-Secretary, in reply, was inclined to make the case that although there were some orders against which the right of appeal already existed by statute, there were many other cases where there was no right of appeal, because the order was of only a trivial character. The Under-Secretary gave a promise, when pressed, that he would look more fully into the point to try to discover how wide the Amendment would go if it were inserted in the Bill, and I would like to know the result of his investigation.</p>

<p>This is a rather important point. No matter how trivial the offence may appear to the public in general, the person concerned very frequently feels very deeply about it. It is a mistake to think that the man who appears in a petty sessional court undergoes a lesser ordeal than a man who has to appear in a higher court. The atmosphere of the police court is quite strange to the vast majority of those who find themselves in that court. Magistrates and officials are perfectly at ease, but usually the person who has to appear before the court finds himself in quite a new atmosphere. Even if the summons against him is for a comparatively trivial offence, he may feel that a stigma will be attached to him for the rest of his life. I have heard it said, even in police court proceedings, that it is foolish for the person who is before the court to appeal against a small fine or a small order. But I have found from my own experience that a man of hitherto good character very often smarts much more under a small order than the man who has a heavier sentence imposed upon him in another court, and who has been accustomed to receiving such sentences.</p>

<p>I would like to support the Amendment, and especially what has just been said by the hon. Member for West Leicester (Mr. Janner).

<p>We have carefully examined this matter since the Committee stage, but our difficulty is the very wide range of matters which is covered by the word "order." All orders which courts of summary jurisdiction can make appear not only in public Bills but in private Bills promoted by municipal corporations and other authorities, and it is very difficult indeed to discover exactly how wide we should go if we included this word in the Bill. I hoped it might be possible to arrive at a limiting definition that would enable me to be sure that I had covered all the substantial grievances, but there are orders which, I think, it might be difficult to include. For instance, is a dog, having been proved dangerous, and already having had not merely his first bite but something else, to be allowed to roam uncontrolled while the appeal is being heard, during which he may perhaps be dangerous again and cause consternation to the inhabitants of the district?<br/>
There are other orders in connection with which it appears desirable that a quick and final decision should be reached. I am, however, not unmindful of what has been said by the right hon. Member for North Leeds (Mr. Peake), and those who have supported him, about the grievance which people sometimes feel when they find that something has been done in a court of summary jurisdiction from which there is no appeal. That being so, I will continue to try to find a way to limit the point so as to include what it is reasonable to include while excluding that which, in the interests of proper administration, I do not believe anyone would desire to see included. This will involve making a very thorough search to find out all the cases in which an order can be made, but I will undertake to see, between now and consideration of the Bill in another place, if I


can do something to meet the view which, I know, is strongly held by various Members of the House.</p>

<q>(7) The powers of a court of summary jurisdiction under paragraph (iv) of the said Subsection (1) (which relates to the grant of bail to an appellant to quarter sessions from a decision of a court of summary jurisdiction) may be exercised by any justice acting for the petty sessional division or place for which that court acts.</q>
This is a useful Amendment which has been suggested to me by the Justices Clerks Society and is a result of their experience in the working of their courts. It deals with the difficulties that arise in respect of courts which meet very infrequently. There are many courts which meet daily or almost daily and others which meet weekly, and in those cases no very great difficulty is likely to occur, but since I have been in office I have had to deal with complaints which have been made with regard to one court which met only monthly. It is clear that a person who had to wait to come before a court meeting monthly in order to apply for bail might, if he was very unlucky, spend 27 days waiting for the matter to be dealt with.<br/>
This will enable a justice acting for the petty sessional division or the place where the court sits, to act. I am quite sure that no one desires to see people kept unnecessarily in detention merely because there is some difficulty about arranging a court at which an application for bail could be considered. This Amendment, coming from a body of men

who I know take great interest in the humane side of the work, is one which I can confidently commend to the House.</p>

<p>I rise to thank my right hon. Friend for having moved this, because it deals with an extremely important point. Very often in the course of practice when a person desires to appeal the difficulty presents itself to those appearing for him and to himself that he cannot get a magistrate in a particular court to grant bail because the court is not sitting.

This Amendment and the next two Amendments&#x2014;in lines 25 and 26&#x2014;deal with the Clause which relates to the taking of finger-prints, a Clause about which some misgiving was expressed on Second Reading and which received very careful investigation during the Committee stage. These Amendments represent an agreement which I think was reached on the Committee by people who had taken differing views about it at first, and I think it sufficiently ensures the taking of finger-prints without imposing undue hardship and indignity on the persons concerned.<br/>
In the first place, we exempt from it altogether children under 14 years. A doubt was expressed as to the meaning of the words, "appears or is brought." We are omitting those words from the amended version of this part of the Clause, and the amended version makes it quite clear that three conditions must be fulfilled before a court can order fingerprints to be taken. The person must be over 14 years of age, he must have been taken into custody, and he must be charged with an offence before the court.<br/>
It was also thought that it was not quite clear that the court was given an adequate discretion in the matter, and we have therefore added the words, "if it thinks fit," in order to make it quite clear that the court has to consider whether it is a case in which this power should be given to the police. I commend these Amendments to the House because they represent a very considerable effort on the part of all hon. Members of the Committee to assist the cause of justice while at the same time safeguarding individual liberty and human dignity. I hope that especially those hon. Members of this House who took part in our deliberations in Committee will feel that I have covered the points which I undertook to cover.</p>

<p>My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Manningham-Buller) particularly raised the point that a person should be taken into custody before his finger-prints were taken, and the Home Secretary has met that point. I think he has also met the other point which was raised. I am obliged to him for having done so.</p>

<p>I regret that the Amendments do not meet the objections which I expressed to this Clause. There can be no objection to finger-prints being taken from all citizens in general, but there are many objections to fingerprints being taken from persons who are not proved to be guilty. This Clause divides the population into three classes &#x2014;those who are guilty and whose fingerprints are properly taken and preserved, those who are not guilty and whose finger-prints are taken and destroyed on acquittal, and those who are not guilty, were never charged and whose fingerprints were never taken.<br/>
This division would not occur if fingerprints were taken in general from all citizens, but this is in fact a discrimination not only between the innocent and the guilty but between those who are never charged and those who are found to have been wrongly charged. It is unfair, illogical and unjust. It could be obviated by providing that finger-prints should not be taken until after a person is found guilty. It is wrong that an innocent person should be forced to allow his finger-prints to be taken before he is proved guilty. This

Clause provides that force may be used, and it is entirely wrong that force should be used on a person who has not been proved guilty and that such a person should be forced to provide evidence against himself, because that is what taking his finger-prints amount to, and that is contrary to the traditions of our system of law.<br/>
Under our system, the onus of proof is on the prosecution, and the accused person is deemed to be not guilty until he is proved guilty. Yet here we have an infringement of the right of the citizen by forcing him to allow his finger-prints to be taken before he is proved guilty. I hope the Home Secretary will reconsider this Clause in order to make it more consonant with the liberty of the citizen as we understand it.</p>

<p>The Home Secretary has fully met the point raised by the hon. and learned Member for North Aberdeen (Mr. Hector Hughes) in accepting Subsection (4) in which he has now provided that:
<q>All finger-prints &#x2026;shall be destroyed on the acquittal of the person concerned.</q>
That is exactly what the Committee wanted. That takes away that perpetual stigma from the person involved, which was exactly the point stressed in Committee. The Clause with these Amendments is a great improvement on the original drafting, and I congratulate the Home Secretary on making it so much more humane and effective.</p>

<p>This, again, is a matter which we have examined with great care, and I wrote a letter to the hon. and learned Member for Daventry (Mr. ManninghamBuller) giving him the result of our inquiries into the subject matter of this Amendment. The main usefulness of the provision in the Clause as to proof of ownership by a corporation has been in cases where the vehicle belongs to a large corporation, for example, the National Transport Board, whose headquarters may be far distant from the place where the offence was committed. It may be necessary to charge the corporation with aiding and abetting an offence, or with some specific offence for which the corporation and not the driver is responsible.<br/>
If, for example, the offence is in connection with the driving of a van or lorry which comes from a local railway dep&#x00F4;t, the police can go to the local dep&#x00F4;t and get a statement from the responsible person there that the van or lorry is one of the Board's vehicles. They will then have to serve a summons on the secretary of the National Transport Board in London, and this will be done either by post or, more probably, by a London police officer taking the summons to the headquarters office. If a representative of the Board does not appear at the proceedings, and no comunication is sent by the Board to the court, the police are able, under Regulation 17 (A) to use the statement of the Board's employee at the local dep&#x00F4;t as evidence that the Board own the vehicle, and the court can then deal with the summons. If the offence is committed by a firm which is not a corporation, the police may serve the summons on the firm as they can on the secretary of a

corporation. They will have to serve the summons on one of the partners or, if it is a one-man business, they will have to ascertain the name of the owner. In either case the police will have to find out before they serve the summons to what person the summons should be addressed. A statement by an employee of the firm that the vehicle belongs to that firm would not dispense the police from having to ascertain who was the owner or, if there is a partnership, the name of one of the partners, as any statement by the employee as to what person was the owner of the vehicle would frequently be worthless.<br/>
It is for this reason that the statement which can be used as evidence of ownership is limited in the case of a firm to a statement by a partner of the firm. It is not the purpose of this Clause to make provision to allow any statement by the driver of a vehicle as to its ownership to be used as evidence. It is the experience of the police that statements by drivers as to the ownership of the vehicle they are driving are often most unreliable, and although in form the regulation will allow such statements to be used as evidence, where the owner is a corporation, in practice such statements are treated by the police with considerable caution, and in the Metropolitan Police district, at least, are never used as evidence.<br/>
It would for the reasons that I have given, be of little practical value to the police to extend the existing provision to statements by employees of a firm, and it would be a mistake to put in the statute a provision which would encourage the police to use as evidence statements, however inaccurate or worthless, by drivers as to the ownership of a vehicle. The provisions of the existing regulation were very carefully drafted so as to make provision by which police time could be saved, without running the risk of a person being convicted upon inadequate evidence. Therefore I hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel that it is not desirable that this Amendment should be made.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in line 16, at the end, to insert:
<q>(3) In any proceedings for an offence consisting of the stealing of goods in the possession of the British Transport Commission or any Executive (other than the Hotels Executive) constituted under Section five of the Transport Act, 1947, or for receiving goods so stolen knowing them to have been stolen, or for an offence under Section twelve or eighteen or Subsection (z) of Section thirty-three of the Larceny Act, 1916, or Sections fifty to fifty-six of the Post Office Act, 1908, a statutory declaration made by any person&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>(<i>a</i>) that he dispatched or received or failed to receive any goods or postal packet or that any goods or postal packet when dispatched or received by him were in a particular state or condition; or</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) that a vessel, vehicle or aircraft was at any time employed by or under the Post Office for the transmission of postal packets under contract,</li></ol>
shall be admissible as evidence of the facts stated in the declaration.</q>
This Amendment, and the three immediate subsequent Amendments to lines 18, 23 and 34, which are merely verbal consequential Amendments, had its origin in an Amendment proposed by the hon. Member for South Belfast (Mr. Gage) on the Committee stage, and an undertaking by my right hon. Friend that he would look sympathetically at this and see whether he could find an Amendment which was even better than that proposed by the hon. Gentleman. In substance I think the hon. Gentleman will agree that this covers his point, and that it goes a little wider. Its object is to meet the great difficulty found, particularly by the railways, in having to bring their servants possibly from the furthest end of the country, in order to hive purely formal evidence which, in 99 cases out of too, is not in dispute, simply about the dispatch of goods which may be under consideration on a charge of theft or something of that kind.<br/>
The only reservation which my right hon. Friend expressed when considering the hon. Gentleman's Amendment was that he felt it might be not only the railways but others which would be concerned, and the House will observe that this Amendment extends also to the cases handled by the Post Office. There is also in paragraph (<i>b</i>) a new provision which

had not been thought of at the time of the earlier discussion. This will enable evidence to be given by statutory declaration that a vehicle, vessel or aircraft was employed by or under the Post Office for the transmission of postal packets under contracts, and will avoid the necessity of producing the actual contract in court. This will be a useful provision, and I commend it to the House.</p>

It only remains for me to express my gratitude, to which I am sure is allied the gratitude of hundreds, almost thousands, of unfortunate employees of railway companies and other services who, in the past, have had to make long journeys and wearisome stays in other towns in order to give purely formal evidence.</p>

<q>(2) A person charged with an offence before a court of summary jurisdiction.</q>
This Amendment deals with a matter to which we gave considerable thought in Committee. It deals with a suggestion as to the rearrangement of counsel's speeches in court. I am bound to say that by the time we reached this stage in the Bill, we were prepared to believe from the large number of counsel we had in the Committee that this was a most important matter. There were occasions when we felt that they should be encouraged to make their speeches in court rather than in Committee. I had to point out, when I. accepted the Clause, that I had no intention of accepting the second part of the Clause, which would allow two speeches by defending counsel and solicitor, one before and one after the evidence, because that would involve giving the prosecution the right of a second speech, and four speeches in courts of summary jurisdiction, I thought, would be an excessive number. My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Northampton (Mr. Paget), not being without experience in these matters, suggested giving discretion to the courts to allow a second speech by the defence and I undertook to consider this before the present stage of the Bill.<br/>
This Amendment and that to line 2 are drafting Amendments. The remaining Amendments to this Clause, in line 4 and line 6, give direction to the court to allow a speech by defending counsel or solicitor both at the conclusion of the case for the prosecution and the conclusion of the evidence, and provide that where this is allowed the prosecution shall be entitled to the right of reply. I hope that I have met the contentions of the various hon. and learned Members engaged in the controversy on this Clause, and I commend the Amendments to the House.</p>

This Amendment, and the next Amendment to line 12, to leave out "as is expedient," are Amendments to the Subsection which lays down that rules are to be made by the Secretary of State to ensure that a person charged with an offence while under detention in prison or in a Borstal or other institution, shall be given a proper opportunity of presenting his case. As the Subsection was drafted, some misgiving was felt by some hon. Members that the words
<q>make such provision as is expedient</q>

<p>I ask pardon for intruding into what has become largely a mutual admiration society of lawyers, but I would like some further enlightenment on the dropping of the word "such" and the phrase "as is expedient." Can it be that all the Law Officers have come to the conclusion to adopt the aphorism:
<q>Expediency is man's wisdom and doing right is God's"?</q>
I would like to know something more about these words, and I ask the Home Secretary if he has given further consideration to certain points brought up in Committee. Rules made under this Clause are to ensure that
<q>a person who is charged with any offence under the rules shall be given a proper opportunity of presenting his case.</q>
What exactly does that mean? Under those rules a person can be prosecuted


for offences against the rules of prison discipline. It may be that the prisoner will be charged under a regulation for making an assault on a prison officer. I would like to know what protection the prisoner is to have and what are to be his rights of defence. In Committee the hon. Member for South Belfast (Mr. Gage), and other hon. Members, asked about the legal representation of prisoners charged with an offence against prison regulations. I would like this point to be cleared up. Does the Clause mean that a prisoner who is charged with assaulting a warder is to be entitled to legal representation by a solicitor or by counsel? This is a very important point, especially owing to the fact that a Subsection in this Clause effects changes under which prisoners may be charged with&#x2014;</p>

<p>I submit that the two points of Order, which I much appreciate, emphasise the point which I wish 'to make. Although on the surface I may seem to be wandering slightly from the point I was making, the word "such" and the words "as is expedient," are relevant to the argument under discussion. In Committee we had a considerable 'amount of discussion, and I would like the Home Secretary to clear up the point. For example, if a prisoner is charged with an offence against a prison warder, he may be sentenced to be flogged. Such a case is brought before the visiting magistrates. I wish to ask whether the prisoner will be entitled to legal representation. It is a very important point for the man concerned. I have before me certain cases which the Home Secretary had under consideration and which were reported in this year's Prison Commissioners' Report. They add point to the argument I am making.<br/>
According to the Appendix to the Prison Commissioners' Report, there was a trial of prisoners before the authorities at Cardiff and they were sentenced to be birched or flogged. When the Home Secretary came to consider the cases, he decided to reduce the sentence in one case from 28 strokes of the birch to 12. I submit that if the prisoners had had the legal advice of my hon. Friends the Member for West Leicester (Mr. Janner) or the hon. Member for Oldham (Mr. Hale) they might not have been birched at all. I am not putting this matter from a legal point of view but from the point of view of the man who is in gaol, and the man


who is always against the State machine and needs the assistance of legal luminaries to put his case properly; the illiterate, primitive man shut up in gaol, with all the apparatus of the law against him. I suggest that if he is entitled to have legal advice in a law court outside, it is more essential that he should be legally represented behind prison walls. The Home Secretary has admitted by his action in the case I have quoted that magistrates are not infallible, and in this case he reduced an inhumane sentence. I ask him to make it clear in this Clause that the prisoner behind prison walls will have legal representation when he is so vitally affected.</p>

<p>I think that this matter was originally raised by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Chester (Mr. Nield). The hon. Member is right in that the point that was in our minds was the question of legal representation. It appears to me that by these Amendments the matter has been broadened and that in fact our point has been achieved. The whole argument then was that if the words "as is expedient" were retained, it might be said that it is inexpedient to allow lawyers into places of this nature. It is easy for a governor to say that it is inexpedient to have a lawyer there. I think that case is completely met by omitting those words and putting the position plainly, as the Subsection now does,
<q>&#x2014;provision for ensuring that a person who is charged with any offence &#x2026; shall be given a proper opportunity of presenting his case.</q>
I hope I am not being presumptuous in saying that it would appear to any lawyer that if a person is to be given a proper opportunity to present his case, that can only mean one thing, that he shall be able to obtain legal representation. By the deletion of these words, "as is expedient" that has now been made possible, and I entirely agree with the Under-Secretary of State. I think that these Amendments precisely meet our point, and I shall support them.</p>

<p>I am rather surprised to hear the hon. Member for South Belfast (Mr. Gage) speak in the way he has done. The words do not seem to me to convey the definite point that a person who is charged with one of these offences shall be entitled to legal representation. After

all, someone or other might come to the conclusion that he has been given a proper opportunity of presenting his case if he has been given a sheet of paper and a pencil and allowed to sit down and write out his case and then come before the particular tribunal that is to hear the case. This is an extremely important matter which does not allow of any question of ambiguity. In my view this Clause should be framed in such a way that there can be no question as to the right of the individual to be legally represented if he chooses to be so represented. We are not dealing here with a trivial matter. It may be that some of the cases which will be dealt with are not of such a grave nature as others, but this Subsection deals with a position which admits of a sentence of flogging. We should not deny in this regard a right which is allowed in other cases. This House ought not to allow any possibility of misunderstanding in this regard.<br/>
The position is even worse for an individual who is being charged within prison walls than it is for a person outside. After all, a person outside can choose if he wants a lawyer. There are circumstances under which he is given free legal aid. There is a court. The atmosphere is different. He may have friends in court. The whole surroundings, bad as they are in respect of any individual in an ordinary court, are infinitely worse when it comes to the position of a man undergoing detention, who has to rely on the good feelings of those who may have very severe feelings against him.<br/>
That being the case, I ask for an assurance from my right hon. Friend that he will incorporate in this Clause some words which will make it absolutely and abundantly clear that in no circumstances shall anybody be entitled to say that the words as they stand ultimately will mean that the person concerned is not entitled to have legal representation. I want that to be perfectly clear, so clear that not only we in this House shall have that assurance, but that no judge or person interpreting this Bill, when it becomes an Act, shall have any alternative but to give that interpretation.</p>

<p>I raised this matter on the Second Reading. Under the Clause the person who is to be given a proper opportunity of presenting


his case is the person who is charged. My experience on other statutes is that if a person claims he is entitled to be legally represented, then express provision is necessary for that purpose. I should be content with the assurance of the Home Secretary that legal representation will be permitted, but I do hope that such assurance will be forthcoming.</p>

<p>This is a point with which I have been very much concerned for many years. I did succeed in carrying the Clause for a prisoner's friend against the Government in the 1939 Bill. The particular Subsection covers not merely the case of the serious offence which may involve flogging, but it also involves the most trivial offences. While I would not suggest the precluding of legal representation, if it were thought necessary, I do suggest that this is something entirely new in our prison system. We shall not get an effective method developed except by trial and error.<br/>
We cannot here possibly attempt to draft rules as to how an inquiry shall be carried out in a prison. We should have to turn the inquiry into a court of law with the whole paraphernalia of a court of law. As that is quite impracticable, we shall have to rely on the good sense and good will of the people administering the prisons, under the Home Secretary, to evolve some method of dealing with the problem raised in this Clause. I want the best possible method evolved by which the prisoner can put his case, but I do not want to tie the Home Secretary to any one form or method.</p>

<p>I think that is quite impracticable. I do not know whether

hon. Members know how many cases come up in the prison each day. It is quite customary for 10, 15 or 20 cases a day to be adjudicated upon by the governor. Any prisoner who wished to make trouble for the Home Secretary to give him legal representation could cause unlimited trouble. There is also the danger that if the trouble maker wished to make trouble by demanding legal representation, he might get more severe punishment.</p>

<p>While accepting your direction, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, on the question of legal representation I think that the most that the Home Secretary can say at the present moment is that he will not exclude the possibility of a prisoner having legal representation where the charge is a very serious one. That is a very different thing from giving the prisoner the right to have it, irrespective of the offence.</p>

<p>I want to confine my remarks to the Amendments. I regard the words which it is proposed to leave out as really meaning rules, made under this provision, which the Home Secretary thinks he can get away with. That is what I understand by" such &#x2026; as is expedient." I have moved to leave out the words "such &#x2026; as is expedient" in order to make it clear that rules made under this Clause shall make provisions for ensuring, not as much provision as is expedient, but as much provision as ought to satisfy reasonable people who have regard to all the circumstances of the case. I thought I had placed myself under a much more severe obligation by proposing to omit these words than by allowing the Clause to stand as originally drafted. I have


placed myself under an obligation to consider the kind of case that has been raised here this afternoon. I promised that I was going to appoint a committee on prison punishment, and these rules will be among the things which will be referred to that committee for consideration. I hope to get some advice from the committee with regard to the way in which this matter should be framed.<br/>
With regard to the rules, it is quite clear that rules of the kind which I am now placing myself under an obligation to produce must deal in different ways with different degrees and circumstances surrounding particular offences. When we were considering this Clause, I gave the committee an account of what I was doing in order to ensure that, in the existing system, I should be assured, when I had to consider a recommendation for flogging, that the whole of what the person concerned wanted to ask had been recorded on the documents in front of me, and that what he had to say should be made known to me.<br/>
Since the Committee stage of the Bill, I have sent round a circular indicating that I shall send an officer to the prison on the occasions when a man is charged with an offence like mutiny, incitement to mutiny or gross personal violence, which might involve him in flogging, so that I can have the evidence in the case reported to me in a way that will enable me to reach a proper judgment on the matter. Let it not be forgotten that the person who orders flogging is not the prison governor, not a member of the visiting committee, but the Home Secretary in every case. That is why I want to be assured, as I am quite sure any hon. Member who had to discharge that duty would want to be assured, that I have the whole story in front of me, because it is very difficult indeed to judge on paper, in any event, and particularly on paper which does not disclose the whole of the way in which the inquiry was conducted. In such a case, it is impossible to reach a satisfactory conclusion.<br/>
That is the spirit in which I have been endeavouring to administer this particular difficult and repugnant part of my duties under the existing arrangements, and I ask the House to accept the fact that I

am leaving out these words, which leave me an avenue of escape from doing what is right and leave me only a duty of doing what is expedient, as an indication that I am endeavouring in these matters to bring the administration of our prisons into line with the most enlightened opinion in the country.</p>

Gentleman&#x2014;and that it is difficult to get members of the prison service. We have to remember that warders and members of the public who have not committed crimes are just as important to protect as the prisoner. I consider that the right hon.

<q>at not less than twelve months.</q>
The purpose of this Amendment is to extend the operation of this Clause to all sentences in prison imposed upon persons under the age of 21. I move it because of the extraordinary contrast between the effect of imprisonment and effect of Borstal on adolescents. If we take comparisons of those with previous sentences, we find that, of those who go to prison, between six and seven out of 10 return to prison; whereas only three or four out of 10 go back to Borstal or do not make good. One of the effective methods of dealing with the Borstal boy is aftercare. It seems to me essential, with the disastrous record that imprisonment of adolescents can bring, that aftercare should also be part of a prison sentence. With this Amendment to Clause 47, and the consequential Amendments to the Sixth Schedule, I propose that every sentence of imprisonment on those under 21 shall carry with it a period of six months' aftercare. The effect of this would be to bring in about nine or 10 times as many youngsters who are sentenced to imprisonment than would be the case under the Clause as drafted. I commend this Amendment to the House and to the Home Secretary.</p>

transfer him to Borstal in spite of the fact that he might be a few months under 16. This has been considered, and my right hon. Friend thinks that this is a sound point, and consequently by this Amendment the words that put that limitation of age upon the power of transfer are omitted.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 44, line 44, to leave out from "term," to the end of the Subsection.<br/>
On the Order Paper the line is misprinted as line 45. We had some discussion in Committee on this provision, by which the Home Secretary can make transfers of persons from prisons to Borstal if he thinks it is desirable. It appears, however, from the language used in the proviso, paragraph (<i>a</i>), that the transfer may be made to Borstal for a longer period than the unexpired term of the sentence. The words in the paragraph are:
<q>(<i>a</i>) as if for references therein to three years and four years there were substituted respectively references to the unexpired term and a period being the sum of the unexpired term and one year.</q>
It would appear that the Home Secretary can increase the sentences without going to the courts. During the discussion the Home Secretary said that that was not so, that the words did not have that meaning, and that he had power only to sentence to Borstal for the unexpired term of the original sentence. However, he said he would look at the matter again to see if this were the correct interpretation of the present wording, and that, if necessary, he would find some less obscure wording to make it quite clear that he had no power to increase the sentences. Nothing has been put down on the Order Paper to that effect, and so I should be glad if the right hon. Gentleman would explain the position.</p>

<p>I beg to second the Amendment.<br/>
I think it is clear as a matter of construction that this Clause does confer on the right hon. Gentleman the power of increasing the period during which a young person under 21 years of age can be deprived of his liberty either in prison or in a Borstal institution. I think I am right in saying that the power conferred

on the right hon. Gentleman by this Clause is entirely unprecedented. While I think a good case can be made out for saying that a young person sent to prison should be transferred to Borstal rather than remain in prison, if Borstal is likely to prove effective in his case, I am not at all sure that the great power which this Clause appears to give of extending the period during which that person can be deprived of his liberty should be left to the sole discretion of any Home Secretary.<br/>
It is, surely, a novel power for any member of a Government of this country to have, there being no trial, and no right of appeal, apparently, from the right hon. Gentleman's decision. I must say that I think the wording of the proviso here makes it quite clear that the effect of what the right hon. Gentleman can do is that he can add to the term during which a young person is kept away from his family and relations, and during which he is under the control of public authorities&#x2014;that the period may be extended to be in excess of the period of detention awarded by the court which convicted him of the offence.</p>

<p>Earlier this evening we received compliments on the improved drafting effected by certain Amendments which were accepted, and I regret that the drafting in this proviso should still appear to give difficulties, although I admit that it is obscure. I have done my very best to persuade the draftsmen to provide better wording, because I am sure that there is no difference between the two sides of the House on what we want to do. I am assured that we are in fact doing what we intend. I am advised that the effect of the Clause is governed as follows. A sentence of Borstal training involves detention for a maximum of three years and supervision for a period from release until the expiration of four years from the date of the sentence; that is, the maximum period of detention plus one year. As I understand it, if at the end of two years a person sentenced to Borstal training is released as having sufficiently profited by that training to be allowed to return to his home or to employment, he is then under supervision for two years; that is, the time to which he was sentenced plus one year.<br/>
The Clause says that if, in the case of a person transferred to a Borstal insti-


tution under the Clause, the unexpired term of imprisonment is less than three years, then for the three years' detention one substitutes detention for the unexpired term, and for the limit of supervision one substitutes the limit of the unexpired term plus one year. Let us suppose that when a youth goes to a Borstal institution he has 18 months still to serve. He will serve a maximum of 18 months in the Borstal institution, plus 12 months under supervision&#x2014;30 months altogether. He will, of course, be under supervision for a year, which might not be so if he remains in prison. I hope that none of us will regard the period of supervision as equivalent to a sentence.<br/>
I have tried to make the position as clear as I can. I am advised that the somewhat complicated wording of the Clause means what I have said. However, I will persevere to see if I can find legal wording to give effect to what I have stated, more or less colloquially, which is certainly the intention, and which would meet the objection raised by the Mover and Seconder of this Amendment. I am certain that we all intend to do the same thing. I am advised by a draftsman, whose work has been very highly complimented during the course of the evening, that he has succeeded; but I will see if he can exercise his ingenuity a little further to find words which will make it as clear to the hon. and learned Member for Daventry (Mr. Manningham-Buller) as it is to the draftsman at present.</p>

<p>May I put a point to the right hon. Gentleman which has

caused a little trouble? The Subsection says:
<q>Provided that if on that date the unexpired term of his sentence is less than three years those provisions shall have effect</q>
That refers us to the provisions in the Second Schedule. If we turn to the Schedule, we find that paragraph 3 states:
<q>If before the expiration of four years from the date of his sentence"&#x2014;</q>
that is the period including the time of supervision&#x2014;the person involved
<q>has failed to comply with any requirements,</q>
he may be recalled. If the right hon. Gentleman looks at the paragraph, he will see that it states:
<q>They may by order recall him to a Borstal institution; and thereupon he shall be deemed to be unlawfully at large and shall be liable to be detained in the Borstal institution until the expiration of three years from the date of his sentence, or the expiration of six months from the date of his being taken into custody under the order, whichever is the later.</q>
It seems to me there is a possibility that the person may be recalled less than six months before the end of the supervisory period, in which case he will have to serve six months from that period, which slightly enlarges the time. That is a real possibility, according to the wording. I do not know whether the right hon. Gentleman desires this, or whether this is a matter which has not been considered.</p>

<p>This is a new point, and it shows how complicated is the whole matter. I am not going to give an answer to so skilled a cross-examiner without having the opportunity of taking advice, but I will have the whole matter investigated&#x2014;I am certain there is no difference between us. We desire that the term of detention shall not be extended, but there is no objection to reasonable supervision for the same period as anyone who had been originally sentenced to Borstal would have undergone. That is what we wish to achieve, and I will devote my energies to ascertaining that we are not going beyond that.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1948-04-15a.1279.1" hansard_membership_id="6749" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/22781" speakername="Mr. Younger" colnum="1279" time="">
<p>I beg to move, in page 51, line 41, to leave out Clause 63.<br/>
This Clause was inserted against my advice during the Committee stage, and I am obliged, therefore, to make much the same speech tonight as I made in Committee in opposition to it. The Clause gives to the courts a statutory power to call for periodical reports upon the progress and conduct of any person detained in an approved school, who has been ordered to be sent there under the provisions of the Children and Young Persons Act; in other words, it gives statutory power to the court which sends a child to an approved school to call, as a right, for reports periodically&#x2014;I do not say how often&#x2014;on the progress and conduct of the child who has been sent there.<br/>
9.15 p.m.<br/>
I want to emphasise that, in suggesting to the House that this Clause is unnecessary and should be omitted, I am not putting forward the view that it is undesirable for courts to take an interest in the subsequent fate of persons in respect of whom they have had occasion to make an order. It is obviously very useful, from the point of view of helping their judgment in future cases, that they should have some knowledge of the results of their work, and that they should know whether a certain youth whom they may have sent, after careful and anxious consideration, for training had in fact made good, and whether their judgment about him had proved right. There is nothing at all between me and the persons who supported this Clause on that score.<br/>
What I say is that no court which has in the past been anxious to obtain information about a case which has been before it has, so far as I am aware, ever found any difficulty in getting the necessary information. It was not alleged in Committee or, at any rate, no examples were given, that a report had been withheld from any court that wished to have a report about one of its cases. I do not believe that the authorities concerned with any young persons who have come before the courts would ever withhold reports at reasonable intervals to the court which was interested. They are only too de-

lighted when the magistrates or other persons who have had occasion to send young persons to them take a lively and active interest in the whole matter. Therefore, if a court asks for information, it already gets it.<br/>
The Clause, however, goes much further than that, and suggests that there should be statutory power to demand this information. I do not say that if this power were given it would necessarily be abused, or that any very great harm would be done, but I say that there is no need for it, and that all the facilities can be made available, and would undoubtedly be made available, to the courts without any such statutory power. I think it is wrong in principle to put into an Act of Parliament a power for which no need has been shown. Secondly, I think it is wrong in principle that we should give power to a court or any other body to demand that some other body periodically reports, unless it has at the time when the report is demanded some function to perform in the matter.<br/>
It is perfectly clear, I think, that when a court asks for these reports, it has no longer any function to perform concerning them. Once an order has been made and the person has gone to an institution, it is for the authorities there to regulate the whole of the future treatment of the person concerned, unless, of course, for any reason that person has to be brought back to the court for some offence, or for a revision of the order; and in that case there can be no need for any additional statutory provision for the information to be supplied.<br/>
I also think, and I mentioned this in Committee, that while there seems to be no actual need for statutory power, there is the possibility of one or perhaps two rather undesirable results. It may well be that if the power were in the statute periodical reports would be asked for almost as a matter of routine. That would add to the work of the people who prepare them and to the papers in the office of the court, and would serve no useful purpose. I do not think that we should add to the work in that way unnecessarily, in the absence of any good ground or proof for introducing this power.<br/>
As I have said, the court has in fact no control over the case once it has left the court, and I think that the giving to the


court of statutory power to call for information might well persuade certain members of the court to think that they had some right to interfere. They might well ask at some future date why that power was given to them specifically by Act of Parliament if it were not that they might express to the authorities their displeasure at what was being done or their belief that the case had not subsequently been well handled. It is not desirable that the court should be encouraged to think at this stage that it has any further control over the case.<br/>
Those are the disadvantages of giving a statutory power. I re-emphasise what I said in my opening remarks: I do not think there is anything at all between the Government view and what the supporters of this Clause said they wanted. All they wanted was that information should be available, on request, to courts. I do not think there is any need for a statutory power for that purpose. Nobody mentioned a single case where a report had been withheld, and I do not believe that it would ever be withheld. We gave an assurance in Committee that if hon. Members had any doubts about this, we would be prepared to set those doubts at rest by issuing instructions to all the authorities in all the institutions which might be concerned with this that when a court asked for periodical information, that information should be granted. I believe that such an instruction is unnecessary, but we gave the assurance that we would do that. I ask the House to say that a statutory power of this kind is unnecessary and that it is wrong in principle to put in such a power when no need for it has been shown.</p>

<p>I find myself&#x2014;and I believe some other hon. Members do&#x2014;in exactly the same difficulty as we were in during the Committee stage. This Clause was carried against the Government by 18 votes to three. It was an entirely non-party vote, and only two non-official Members voted for the Government. The Under-Secretary used exactly the same contradictory arguments on that occasion as he has used tonight. He says that it is undesirable that the courts should ask for periodical reports. That is the effect of his argument&#x2014;</p>

<p>Yes. He said it was undesirable. I noted his words very carefully at the time. He said that after the child or young person had been convicted, the courts should not have any further interest in him, but that it was for the school to deal with him.</p>

<p>The noble Lord will forgive me, but that is not so. I said that it was undesirable that the courts should be encouraged to think that they hail any further right to interfere in the case or that they had any function in the case. I thought it was extremely desirable that they should be interested in knowing, for their information in regard to future cases, how their previous decisions had worked out. That would be a good thing and there would be no difficulty in their having that information, What I said was undesirable was that they should be encouraged to think, as I believe they would be by this Clause, that they have a function to perform in respect of the case. They have no function to perform in those circumstances.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman has agreed to everything I said. He has said that the court should not be encouraged to believe that they have any right to interfere in the case. The Clause contains no suggestion that they have any right. The case has been disposed of. All the Clause does is give them the power&#x2014;I ask the House to note this&#x2014;which the hon. Gentleman at the end of his speech tells us that they already possess by custom, of asking for periodical reports. However, for some obscure reason which has not been made clear to the House on this occasion and was not made clear to the Committee, and was consequently responsible for the majority of 18 against three in favour of the Clause, the hon. Gentleman is not prepared to have put into the Measure a power which is in fact already enjoyed by the court in the shape of the custom which has grown up.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman uses as his principal argument for objecting to this the fact that if it were put into the Bill it would be an indication to the courts to do something quite different from what they are doing at the present time. According to his own admission, at the present time they do, in fact, in a particular type of case, ask for, and are granted,


reports about the progress of a child. I should have thought that I knew something about the Children and Young Persons Act, 1933. What is being done is in accord with the spirit of that Act, but for some reason that I cannot understand the hon. Gentleman refuses to give statutory enactment to it, for the trifling reason that if statutory enactment is given to it, it will encourage the courts to go beyond what they are doing at the present time. On his own admission they are doing what this Clause seeks to lay down. I do not want to go to a Division on it, but it is regrettable. In regard to our procedure here, I should say that we are not content with the present procedure. Amendments which have been defeated upstairs are not called, but when a vote on <ob/> Clause has gone against the Government it is discussed in the House, and we are merely given the same answers as we were given upstairs: It is unfortunate.</p>

<p>The latter part of last evening and a considerable part of today I have devoted to dealing with pledges that I gave in Standing Committee, and I have fulfilled those pledges by new Clauses and substantial Amendments to the Bill. If it was not possible to meet my hon. Friends and Members of the Opposition I have quite frankly said that the draftsmen were not able to provide the necessary words. This is really an administrative problem. We all know the difficult position in which a body is put when it is stated in a statute that it has a right to do something. It entirely alters the relationship, which, in this case, I am glad to say has grown up between many courts and schools.<br/>
The schools welcome visitors and contacts from the courts, but they are always on the basis that it is an act of courtesy on the part of the schools to receive the visitor or make the report that is required. In fact, there are one or two schools and

other institutions which are becoming such show places that I am told there is rarely a day when they do not get a visitor of some kind or other. On occasions they would like to have a clear day in which to get on with their ordinary work without interruption. I desire that the voluntary co-operation between the courts and the schools should continue. I do not want to put the courts in the position where they can of right demand a report with regard to a particular case. I want to emphasise to the magistrates and to the schools that from the day the young person enters the school he becomes the entire responsibility of the staff and the managers of the school. While they will be glad to give an account of how the young person is getting on, the responsibility for that child on the part of the court has ceased from the moment he enters the school.<br/>
9.30 p.m.<br/>
I venture to suggest that that is a sound administrative line to adopt, and that one desires the relationship between the courts and the schools to be on a voluntary and not on a statutory basis. I am taking steps to make it quite clear to the schools that that should be the basis of their relationship with the courts who send them children, or with courts who might desire to send a child if they thought, when they saw the school, that it was the suitable place for a child whom they had under consideration or whom they might possibly in future have under consideration. I hope that the House will feel that this is the best way in which to arrange this relationship, and I can assure the noble Lord that it is no sense of disrespect to the views expressed by the Committee that I ask the House to reverse the decision taken in Committee.</p>

<p>Is the actual age of the young offender to be taken into consideration or not? If it is, then I do not think that my hon. Friend's Amendment affects that purpose. The actual age ought to be taken into consideration. Let us take a simple case. We may have a young offender whose age is 16 but, by reason of physical development, may appear to the court to be 18. If he appears to the court to be 18 years of age, that is deemed to be his age. If that is so, then an offender of 16 years of age can be sentenced to imprisonment, and if my hon. Friend desires to effect by this Amendment that the actual age of the offender is to be taken into consideration, then it could be done by the insertion of a few words that in the absence of proof as to the actual age his age shall be deemed to be the age which he appears to be. As the Amendment is drawn, I respectfully submit that it does not effect that purpose at all.</p>

<p>I rather think that my hon. Friend is on a sound point. I do not know what age my Under-Secretary might be taken for by people who did not first consult Dod. I know that I was somewhat surprised, when I consulted Dod, to find what a veteran I had appointed as my Under-Secretary. Therefore, I think it would be desirable in another place that we should put in some words which will ensure that, unless there is proof to the contrary, this shall be deemed to be the age. Some of the young children who come before the courts are somewhat like Topsy. It is difficult to get birth certificates and reliable evidence as to their age, and in such cases it will be necessary to adopt the procedure in this Amendment. But where the biological age can be demonstrated beyond doubt, I think it is desirable to make it clear that the court is not then to say, "Well he looks older or younger," than

his birth certificate would make him out to be.</p>

<p>I have put down this Amendment in response to an appeal made to me by my hon. Friend the Member for South Battersea (Mrs. Ganley). It deals with the provision under Section 35 of the Licensing (Consolidation) Act, 1910, which provides that a person convicted of a felony is disqualified for life from holding a justice's licence. In my short period of office I have had the instance of a man who desired to get a justice's licence who at some early stage of his life had committed some offence which was technically a felony. During these discussions the word "trivial" has been used to cover a wide variety of matters. This offence really was trivial but the only way for this man to get a justice's licence was by His Majesty granting him a free pardon for the felony which he had committed a long time before. This Amendment will avoid that kind of thing happening in the future.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That the Clause be read a Second time."<br/>
This is a not unimportant new Clause which will extend to courts of quarter session and assize the discretion, which is already possessed by courts of summary jurisdiction, to award costs to a defendant who is successful. It has been sometimes a serious defect in our administration of justice that, although a defendant might be put perhaps to very great expense in defending himself in the course of indictable proceedings in the criminal courts, there were no circumstances in which those courts before which indictments are tried could award him costs.<br/>
I am not by any means saying that costs should automatically be awarded in every case to a successful defendant. In the majority of cases, whilst one rejoices with the defendant at his acquittal, it would be wrong to impose on the community the burden of paying the costs of the defence. But where the case is one in which there are exceptional circumstances&#x2014;which, for instance, the court considers perhaps ought never to have been brought, where the proceedings have been unusually protracted, or where the prosecution has been a private one&#x2014;it seems right that courts before which cases are tried on indictment should have the same powers as are already possessed by the justices of ordering costs at their discretion. This new Clause will have that effect.</p>

<p>I am very much obliged to my right hon. and learned Friend for having framed this new Clause. It is a consequence of a Clause which I put down during Committee stage, as a result

of which he gave an undertaking to deal with the matter. I am a little sorry that in presenting this Clause to the Committee my right hon. and learned Friend saw fit to suggest that it ought not to be used too often by the courts. I hope that he will have a change of heart in regard to that, and perhaps when we reach a later stage he will suggest to the courts that they should be very generous in this regard. It will be difficult for a person who is acquitted, if costs are not awarded to him, to hold up his head in society, because a distinction may be made between the person who has been awarded costs when acquitted and the person who has not. I think that is rather serious. I hope that the courts will interpret this new Clause generously and that a person who has been acquitted will, except in very exceptional circumstances, be entitled to have repaid to him at least a reasonable portion of the costs which he has incurred, without the slur being cast upon him that he has not been sufficiently acquitted, if one may use that expression, as to have the costs awarded.<br/>
There is one other point which I ask my right hon. and learned Friend to consider between now and the final stages of the Bill. There are cases&#x2014;there have been some recent ones&#x2014;in which a great injustice has been done by the committal of certain individuals from petty sessional courts to the higher courts. I do not want to go into details. I think that the Committee will be aware of some of the cases. It seems to me that now that we are introducing this important Measure at long last&#x2014;because it has been a very serious defect in our procedure&#x2014;it might be considered reasonable that, to some extent, this might be made retrospective. That might perhaps not be done by legislation, but by my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary considering the matter an <i>ex gratia</i> one in respect of those who have suffered severely by having been placed in a grave position of peril when there was no justification at all for it.<br/>
I know that my right hon. Friend is a man of very warm heart in these matters and that he will appreciate that those who are sometimes put to enormous expense in having to clear their characters, and who are sometimes told by the Judge in the Court of Appeal that there was not the slightest shred or shadow of evidence to justify taking the proceedings or the committal, should


be considered in a similar manner to those who come within the provisions of this new Clause. I commend that to the Home Secretary and the Attorney-General, and I hope we shall have a statement at a later stage showing that they do not regard this as a small matter but as something which should, quite properly, be allowed.</p>

<p>May I ask the Attorney-General to tell us whether this new Clause, with its generous provision, will apply to Scotland? I ask this question because it may be a very considerable time before similar legislation is introduced affecting Scotland. Some of the Clauses in this Bill affect Scotland, and some do not. I hope that, if there is any generous new Clause introduced into this Bill, Scotland will have the advantage of it.</p>

<p>I think most of us on this side of the Committee will welcome this Clause and consider it important. At the same time, I cannot feel that the argument of the hon. Member for West Leicester (Mr. Janner) is really very sound. I think it would be very dangerous if people were to feel that, in criminal cases, costs would follow the event as they do in civil cases. Although I quite agree that this is a very useful power to have and to use in appropriate cases, I feel that it should be rather carefully used, because it seems to me that, if it becomes widely assumed that costs are to follow the event, it might have a serious result on the detection of crime which might be very far from the wishes of those who support the new Clause.</p>

<p>I should not like this new Clause, which is an important one, to be passed without some commendation from this side of the Committee as well. It removes a long-standing grievance, and I think the Government are to be wholly congratulated and sincerely thanked for what they have done in this respect. It would also be true to say that the hon. Member for West Leicester (Mr. Janner) took the initiative in the matter, and I think he is to be congratulated, too.</p>

<p>There are three short points I wish to make. It would be

quite impossible and quite unconstitutional to make any provision of this Clause retrospective. Nor, of course, has my right hon. Friend any legal power to dispense public funds in an <i>ex gratia</i> manner in matters of this kind. As to the general principles in accordance with which this Clause should be operated, the matter will be entirely within the discretion of the courts which may operate it. I am bound to say, as far as I am concerned&#x2014;and I think most persons who are concerned with the administration of justice would take the same view&#x2014;that it would be highly dangerous if it were to be thought that costs will always, or even normally, follow the event. We anticipate that the courts operating these provisions will follow, in general, the kind of practice that has been adopted in courts of summary jurisdiction in this matter and that they will award costs only in those rather exceptional cases where there are the particular kind of circumstances to which I alluded in moving the new Clause.<br/>
In regard to the point raised by my hon. Friend regarding the application of the Clause to Scotland, this Clause does not apply to Scotland. I can hold out some hope to my hon. Friend, without committing my right hon. and learned Friend the Lord Advocate in any way, that there is another Bill which is dealing with cognate matters so far as Scotland is concerned. It may be that provision will be made in that Bill, but I do not know.</p>

<p>appoint a fit and sufficient person to record the proceedings before the second court and also for the appointment of an additional crier for the second court. The second and third amendments in this group give the necessary powers to enable such officers to be appointed for each additional court. Several times during the course of today's discussion we have heard of the difficulties that now confront courts of quarter sessions owing to the very long calendars in front of them. This is a practical way of enabling courts, where cases are very heavy, to deal with the situation that confronts them.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 78, line 10, at the end, to insert:
<q>Section 309 of the Government of India Act, 1935, praying that the Government of India (Family Pension Funds) (Amendment) Order, 1948, be made in the form of the draft laid before Parliament.</q>
This is a brief and simple Order which concerns what is called the transferred section of the India Family Pension Funds. This section arose in 1937, when certain balances were transferred to the United Kingdom from India. The problem has arisen that with falling rates of interest, it is found impossible to make investments to maintain the income of the funds. The purpose of the Order is to empower the Commissioners to purchase freehold ground rents in England and Wales. That is an additional power to those now possessed.</p>

<p>I rise to report to the House one or two problems I found on a journey which I recently made to the Caribbean. I will deal with the problems country by country, and explain what advantages may be gained by this country by following out certain proposals I will make to the House. I will also explain to the House the problems of those different countries. This is rather different from the usual procedure in an Adjournment Debate, but I have taken advice and I am told that this is perfectly in Order.<br/>
The first place at which I made inquiries particularly was the Bahamas. As this is a very important dollar-winning part of the British Empire, I took great interest in finding out in what new way our dollar position could be improved there. I had a conversation with the wife of the Governor, Lady Murphy. She recommended three things very strongly that would bring in a large amount of dollars. The first was goods in the shops. It was her opinion that American tourists going to the Bahamas would gain an idea of what British goods were like if they were in the shops, and which they would not otherwise see unless they came to this country. She looks upon the Bahamas as being a shop window for British products.<br/>
She was very insistent also that British educational films should be seen in the Bahamas. What they are getting at the moment there are American crime films which are doing a great deal of harm. Lady Murphy believes that good British educational films will be very acceptable there and productive of good. She was also concerned that there should be a British hospital for American visitors. There are plenty of American specialists who would give their services free. She wanted sanitary appliances brought from this country, because she seemed to think that sanitary arrangements here are much better than those elsewhere. Scientific instruments ought to be provided free for such a hospital; and since such a hospital would be for American tourists, it would be a very important dollar-earning project. In the Bahamas the spread of

tuberculosis is greater than anywhere else in the West Indies, and more attention should be paid to that problem.<br/>
While there I inquired about the system of government. There is an Assembly of 27 members, nine of whom are coloured. However, the coloured people are not satisfied with the system of election which has operated up to the present, by which there is an open vote, and they say that they are victimised. At the next election there is to be a secret vote, when it is hoped that colour Labour will have a majority.<br/>
I had an opportunity of visiting the Fort Montague Hotel, formerly used as a barracks for American soldiers, which has recently been bought by Butlins. Last year, when the hotel was first sold, the price paid was &#x00A3;150,000. Later in the year the hotel was sold for 380,000, including putting the hotel in good condition. Butlins then paid 450,000 for it.<br/>
It was explained to me later that too much money is going into the Bahamas. That is causing the Governor a certain amount of worry, because it has the effect of increasing wages all round. The Governor's wife cited as an example a coloured butler who demanded &#x00A3;10 a week plus food, whereas the butler she took out from England was paid only &#x00A3;4 a week. A seaside house which before the war would have cost &#x00A3;2,000 in England would sell over there for &#x00A3;50,000. Complaint is made that there is no food production because the merchants in Bay Street have agencies with American and British firms, and they do everything possible to prevent the production of food in the Colony. That is all I want to say about the Bahamas, whence I went to Haiti.<br/>
In some parts of the Caribbean one cannot go from one country to another direct; a round-about route has to be taken&#x2014;sometimes taking weeks to travel a distance which could be covered in an hour by air. Yet, in spite of that, in the Caribbean there is astounding ignorance of aviation. Before leaving England I tried unsuccessfully to book a passage to Haiti, being told that I should have to do so over there. When in the Bahamas I tried to book a passage to Haiti, but could not. Even the Governor tried, but could not do so. The Governor called in the Rt. Hon. Harold Christian, who is the director or manager of the


Bahamian Airways Company, but even he could not obtain a passage for me, and did not know how to. Eventually I had to go to Miami and book a passage from there. Oddly enough, there is a regular line running from Miami, yet in the Bahamas nobody seemed to have any knowledge of it.<br/>
In Miami I asked at the Pan-American office whether I could book from Santo Domingo to Havana, but they told me that I could not. Yet when I was in Santo Domingo I was told to book to Havana direct by Pan-American Airways. That illustrates that, despite the great distances to be covered, there is ignorance of the possibilities or importance of air travel, even when one approaches the Governor or the director of an airways company.<br/>
Haiti has a terrific history. As a matter of fact, the seeds of the French Revolution started there. The name of Napoleon seems to crop up throughout the Caribbean. His wife, Josephine, came from Martinique. When he tried to conquer Haiti, he sent first an army of 40,000. The liberated slaves fought him and beat him, and altogether it cost him 60,000 men. We went there, and we lost 80,000 men in Haiti. General Maitland was forced to surrender, and it was probably the biggest surrender on the part of the British Army up to the time of Singapore. Voodoo is still practised there, and it cannot be stopped. It has come down from the times of slavery.<br/>
They want to take our textiles, hardware, biscuits, whisky and soap. They used to get these commodities from Britain by paying dollars, but they cannot get them now. Would it not be far better for us to concentrate our exports on these countries instead of on the United States? All these countries are dollar-paying countries, and their currencies are very high; in fact, it is possible to interchange one's money with dollars as one goes along. Whatever markets we get in Central America or in the Caribbean will be permanent, whereas this terrific export drive we are now making to the United States to get dollars is for a temporary market only, because when that market has been sufficed, it will no longer require our exports. The Board of Trade should give more attention to these markets. These people want our

goods, and they have a great affection for Britain, because Britain, to a great extent, helped to liberate these countries. We were the first country to recognise the independence of Santo Domingo, and we helped Simon Bolivar who liberated Venezuela. There is not the same great love for the United States, because they have interfered far too much in the local politics of these countries. It used to be the usual thing for them to collect their debts by sending in the marines, and these countries have never forgotten that. They have a special appreciation for Britain, and it would be to our benefit in the long run to pay more attention to these countries, with their dollar-earning capacity.<br/>
I come now to films. Our films are very much appreciated in these countries much more so than the American films. They want our films. I was told&#x2014;but I have no means of proving this&#x2014;that, in order to boost the showing of "Great Expectations," they billed it as an American film. Haiti is a coffee-growing country. They told me that they would make special arrangements with us for payments if we would do business with them. Until the war, all their coffee went to Switzerland, but they would prefer to do business with us.<br/>
In Santo Domingo they have a proper Parliament, with labour representation, coming under some sort of dictatorship, and this brings me to the question of dictatorship in the Caribbean. I had a long talk with the dictator. He told me that there was a car at my disposal, and he said, "You can go where you like. If you find anything wrong with this country, you can report it." I could find no dissatisfaction there at all. I found that there was great happiness and tremendous prosperity. That brings me to the question: can we expect to be able to implant in these countries that have had 300 years of slavery, probably a thousand years of cannibalism before that, and a hundred years of chaos on top <sup>*</sup>of it all&#x2014;which are just emerging into our ideas of civilisation&#x2014;a democracy like ours? I do not think that we can. I think that we have to work our passage with them and develop them according to their own standards.<br/>
The dictatorship in Santo Domingo has been spoken about. I had every opportunity of investigating everything there


I found a clean city, good roads, shops piled with goods, plenty of money, no grumbling, an adequate police force, and a functioning Parliament. I spoke to various members of their Parliament&#x2014;in fact I addressed in Spanish a combined meeting of both Houses. I am making a special effort to explain this because it is a dictatorship. This dictator lines his pockets, there is no doubt about that. He helps his family, there is no doubt about that; but he has brought prosperity out of chaos to his country. We have bought the sugar crop in Santo Domingo. By the way, Santo Domingo was the first place to be visited by Columbus. It had the first cathedral and first university in all America.<br/>
Recently they had a scare of invasion. There were definite preparations to invade Santo Domingo from Cuba. When I was in Cuba, I took the opportunity of investigating, and it is perfectly true that certain preparations were being made. Whereas this dictator had an estimate of three million dollars a year for education, he had an estimate of only two million dollars for the army. Here we have a dictator who was giving more to education than to his army. It may interest the House to know, in view of happenings here, that capital punishment was abolished in Santo Domingo in 1924. It was abolished here yesterday. They have women's votes, compulsory education and free elections, although if the President does not like a member he puts him out. They have big exports of tobacco, meat and peanut oil. It is peanut oil we are trying to grow in Africa. I went into the peanut oil factory and it was working very satisfactorily.<br/>
The country has reserves of &#x00A3;30 million in gold dollars. They have a well established university and a hospital for workers, in which there are 12 doctors for 175 patients. The university has an over-supply of doctors which they are lending to Porto Rica, which is an American dependency. They have no medical faculty in that place. The people of Santo Domingo complain that in 1916 the Americans interfered in their domestic life and for that reason they are not keen on having too much to do with the Americans. Canadian influence is strong and so, peculiarly enough, is the Methodist Church. All religion is tolerated, and there are 5,000 Protestants. That is a country in the

Caribbean which comes under a dictatorship, so that these things have to be judged not by what is a dictatorship and what is not, but what suits a country best.<br/>
The whole world has subscribed to a monument there to Christopher Columbus. It is going to cost millions of dollars, and the award for the monument has been given to a young British architect by the name of Gleave. I spoke to him and to several other British people in Santo Domingo. They told me they had no complaints and that they are treated well. They are very prosperous. They want from us technicians, economic advisers, chiefs of police and naval officers.</p>

<p>They will have to learn Spanish. Due to this trouble of the invasion from Cuba, they are negotiating with us to buy two destroyers and they want naval officers.<br/>
I went to Cuba and I spoke to the President, the Foreign Secretary and a Commission of Parliament. The trade unions in Cuba are coming strongly under Communist influence, and that is what is causing the trouble between Cuba and Santo Domingo. They are afraid there is going to be the trouble in Cuba that there has been in South America. The peculiar thing about Cuba is that they have a wealth of dollars but no petrol. People have to wait in queues up to 10 or 12 hours to get a couple of gallons of petrol. They have the dollars but people cannot get sufficient petrol for their lorries.<br/>
I had a talk with the Foreign Secretary and he is very concerned about selling this country Havana tobacco and cigars. He is afraid that if the British public do not get Havana cigars they will lose the taste for them and the market will be totally lost. He even said that they would consider taking sterling under those conditions for some of their exports. The British people have complained there about staff. They have to employ local staff who are not up to the standards of work. But those are their troubles and what they have to put up with. With regard to trade figures, Cuba has 705 million dollars a year exports out of which the Americans take 467 million. We take 131 million and the rest of the world take 106 million roughly.</p>

<p>I think we get more, because we get &#x00A3;131 million altogether. The next country was Mexico. What struck me as most important in Mexico was the high regard in which the British Council was held. In fact, nowhere else in the world where I have been has the British Council so much influence on the inhabitants. It comes under a very able manager, Mr. Wilson, and wherever you go you come up against the influence of the British Council. If it could only function everywhere as it does in Mexico it would be a very valuable asset.</p>

<p>I did try to make some inquiries while I was there from technicians in the British colony about the oil question and the insurance question. They all were of the same opinion, that we had frightfully mismanaged the insurance question. We sent out a man who was totally incapable of negotiating with Mexicans. He had no idea of the temperament of Mexicans and our insurance business was just thrown away. With regard to oil, there again they said if we had proper negotiators there we would have salvaged something&#x2014;</p>

<p>I cannot tell the hon. Member what it was. Mexico wants to buy from us machinery, hydro-electric plant and equipment. The B.B.C. representative, Mr. Wesley, complained that the B.B.C. took off the most listened-to item, the afternoon programme, and said that ought never to have been given up.<br/>
From there I went to Guatemala. I had the intention of going on to British Honduras, but at the request of the Minister in Guatemala I refrained from so doing. The average opinion of people on the spot is that if we give way on the question of British Honduras, we shall have to give way on all questions of all British territories in Central and South America. The moment we give way on British Honduras it means giving way on the Falklands, and that will mean giving way on British Guiana and even Trinidad. British Honduras has a great wealth of mahogany, indigo and chicle. These are great dollar-earning things. But the all-round complaint is that we have done nothing in the development of British Honduras. I have talked with the Negro population. They number about 60,000. They do not want to change; they want to remain with Great Britain. Guatemala itself is one of the most backward countries in the whole area. When I was in Guatemala&#x2014;</p>
