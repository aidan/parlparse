<p>I have received a detailed report on the vegetable crops referred to by my hon. Friend. Caterpillars have been prevalent in the district and have eaten some of the vegetables.

<p>Of the Regular Army combatant officers at present serving on the active list who have held the rank of brigadier for 18 months or more, 70 per cent. hold the substantive rank of colonel and 30 per cent. the substantive or war substantive rank of lieutenant-colonel. Of the former, slightly under a third would be eligible for the colonel's maximum rate of retired pay if retired now, and of the latter two-thirds would be eligible for the lieutenant-colonel's maximum rate. It is not in the public interest to give actual numbers. As the rate of retired pay varies with age, service and substantive or war substantive rank on retirement, the rates of retired pay eventually awarded to these officers may be considerably in excess of their present entitlements.</p>

<p>I know that my hon. and gallant Friend has in mind the special case of brigadiers, which is not a rank, and

<p>asked the Secretary of State for War (1) whether he will give the full recommendations of the inter-departmental committee in regard to their decision that the rate of allotment pay for dependants of officers, including officer prisoners of war, should be fixed at two-sevenths of the officer's pay; on what evidence this decision was based; and what was the cost of living when this inter-departmental committee reported;<br/>
(2) whether he is aware that the allotment of two-sevenths of a missing officer's pay to his dependants has been found in many cases to be quite inadequate, even when added to family lodging allowance; whether he is aware that many wives of officers reported missing at Singapore are suffering considerable hardship, in consequence of the inadequacy of this allotment; and whether he will make some more generous provision for these ladies?</p>

<p>All an officer's emoluments, including family lodging allowance, are paid direct to him, and he makes his own arrangements for his family's support whether he is serving at home or abroad. Unlike other ranks an officer can draw family lodging allowance without making any compulsory allotment from his own pay. When an officer is notified as missing his pay and family lodging allowance continue to be credited to him

for four weeks and any arrangements that he has made continue as before. At the end of that period the officer is no longer credited with pay and allowances, but a payment is made to the family equivalent to family lodging allowance plus two days' pay a week. I have no evidence to show that this supplement is unrepresentative of the allotments made to their families by the majority of officers. I will, however, look further into this and I should be glad if my hon. and gallant Friend would send me particulars of typical cases which have been brought to his notice. When an officer is notified as a prisoner of war pay and family lodging allowance are credited to his account and any arrangements that he has made can continue. To meet the case where there are no such arrangements or they have broken down the War Office has power to divert family lodging allowance and pay to meet the needs of the family.</p>

<p>In my speech to the House on 23rd July I referred to complaints from small retailers that they were not getting their fair share of supplies. I undertook to investigate these complaints and have made inquiries accordingly. The evidence is conflicting. On the one hand, small shopkeepers complain that they cannot obtain goods, which they see in the windows of larger stores or multiples, or advertised in the Press. On the other hand, it is clear that many suppliers, wholesalers and manufacturers have been distributing goods to their customers fairly, some having worked out elaborate systems of rationing for this purpose. But, whether or not there is serious maldistribution now, as time goes on and supplies become shorter, there is a real danger that a large number of the smaller shops may be squeezed out of business. For many reasons this would be undesirable. Stocks of essential goods should be widely dispersed, in order to minimise the risk of air-raid damage. Secondly, many rural areas depend on small shops. If these get insignificant supplies, the consumers in those areas must go short. Thirdly, to economise transport, people should shop near home and avoid as far as possible expeditions to the larger shops in neighbouring towns or districts. Finally, increasing Government demands for storage and office accommodation must be met and we must look to the larger shops to yield up substantial amounts of space.<br/>
I have, therefore, come to the conclusion that some positive action is needed to assure to the small retailer his fan-share of the available supplies. What I have in mind is that, for certain classes of goods, each small retailer should receive a percentage of his purchases in a standard year. These percentages would be fixed by the Board of Trade and would depend on the relation of supplies in the current year to those in the standard year. Arrangements would also have to be made for extra supplies for areas where, owing to movements of population and other causes, needs of consumers have increased. A scheme of this kind could be imposed by Order. But I do not want to make fresh Orders, if I can get the same results by voluntary methods, and I believe that in this case, with the cooperation of the trade, we can get what we want with the minimum of compulsion. I propose to begin with clothing, pottery and hollow-ware&#x2014;three of the most important trades&#x2014;but I do not rule out the possibility of further extensions later. I intend to appoint small joint committees of retailers, wholesalers and manufacturers, for each of these three trades, with independent chairmen, to advise me how best to apply a plan of this kind to their trades, and, when the plan is approved, to supervise its working. If any Committee reports that a particular firm refuses to follow the approved scheme, I propose, after due inquiry, to issue directions to that firm.<br/>
These proposals will promote fair distribution, both between areas and retailers. But further steps are needed. Economy in the handling of small orders can be realised through bulking them, either by arrangement between the wholesalers dealing with a particular area, or by the shopkeepers in an area combining their purchases. Such arrangements present difficulties, but my intention is to facilitate them in every way possible. We must ensure that distribution is conducted on the most economical lines, and that no unnecessary transport or labour is used to move goods from manufacturer and wholesaler to consumer. We must face the fact that supplies will become even shorter as stocks run down, and that fresh calls will be made on the retail trade to provide labour for war purposes. I have been in touch with my right hon. Friend the Minister of Labour on this problem

and he will be announcing shortly the new arrangements to be made. It is, I fear, inevitable that, as the war continues, the difficulties of retail traders will increase and I have, therefore, had to consider what steps can be taken to assist those in trouble. I have discussed with my Noble Friend the Lord Chancellor the Retail Trade Committee's proposal for an extension of the Liabilities (War-Time Adjustment) Act. We came to the conclusion that such extension is unnecessary. So far little use has been made of this Act&#x2014;probably because traders do not understand how much help can be obtained from it. I am taking steps to remedy this. I wish to emphasise that it is not necessary to withdraw from business in order to take advantage of the Act. It helps those who stay in, as well as those who go out. I hope that traders, to whom the war has brought financial difficulties, will not hesitate to have recourse to this Act, which was designed precisely for the kind of circumstances in which they may find themselves. I think I have correctly interpreted the feeling, both of the House and of the retail trade, in concentrating upon proposals designed to help traders who are still in business. But I have not forgotten those who have already withdrawn or who may be forced by circumstances to withdraw in future. The first step to safeguard their interests is the establishment of a register, and this I propose to do forthwith.</p>

Is it to be registration of those traders who have been put out of business and is it intended that they will get priority in re-establishing themselves after the war?</p>

<p>His Majesty's Government have never countenanced any general order for the tying up of prisoners on the field of battle. Such a process, however, may be necessary from time to time under stress of circumstances, and may indeed be in the best interest of the safety of the prisoners themselves.<br/>
The Geneva Convention upon the treatment of prisoners of war does not attempt to regulate what happens in the actual fighting. It is confined solely to the treatment of prisoners who have been securely captured and are in the responsible charge of the hostile Government. Both His Majesty's Government and the German Government are bound by this Convention. The German Government by throwing into chains 1,370 British prisoners of war for whose proper treatment they are responsible have violated Article 2 of the aforesaid Convention. They are thus attempting to use prisoners of war as if they were hostages upon whom reprisals can be taken for occurrences on the field of battle with which the said prisoners can have had nothing to do. This action of the German Government affronts the sanctity of the Geneva Convention which His Majesty's Government have always been anxious to observe punctiliously.<br/>
His Majesty's Government have therefore approached the protecting Power and invited that Power to lay before the German Government our solemn protest against this breach of the Geneva Convention and to urge them to desist from it, in which case the counter measures of a similar character which His Majesty's Government felt themselves forced to take in order to protect their prisoners of war in enemy hands will immediately be withdrawn.<br/>
Until we learn from the protecting Power the result of this protest, I have no further statement to make upon the subject, and I should strongly deprecate any discussion which might be prejudicial to the action of the protecting Power and consequently to the interests of the prisoners of war of both belligerent countries. As soon as a reply is received, a further statement will be made to the House.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 1, line 7, to leave out "eight," and to insert "seven and a half."<br/>
The effect of this Amendment would be to prolong the life of this House by six months instead of the 12 proposed in the Bill. That this House shall prolong its life was decided last week, against the votes of some of us. I, therefore, regard that issue as not being discussable to-day, and I am sure the Chair will agree with me in that view. But I think we can consider whether 12 months is the correct period for which the life of this House should be prolonged. In the Second Reading Debate I and one or two other hon. Members brought forward evidence which, clearly, did not prove to the satisfaction of other hon. Members that this House is now an object of derision among the people of this country, but I think that that evidence was, at least, powerful enough to suggest that among some patriotic citizens of this country this House is appearing, ever more and more in an unsatisfactory light. In these days, when political as well as military developments move pretty swiftly, I suggest it is by no means impossible that within a short time a substantial number of our fellow-citizens may become extremely impatient with this House of Commons and may ardently desire that it should be brought to an end. In these days a lot may happen in six months, and I think six months would be a much better period for which to prolong the life of this present House than the 12 months proposed by the Government.<br/>
I hope the Minister will not reply to this Amendment by re-emphasising the difficulties of holding a General Election and suggesting that there is no alternative but to prolong the life of this House in its present state. During the Second Reading Debate some of my hon. Friends

and I drew attention to what seemed to us to be a feasible halfway house between indefinite prolongation and a General Election, I do not think the Minister, in the course of his reply, referred to our arguments, and obviously, I cannot repeat those arguments now, but at any rate there are other alternatives to a 100 per cent. General Election which might come up before the House six months from now and which the temper of the people might by that time force upon the House.<br/>
There is one other reply which I hope the Minister will not make to my arguments. He may be tempted to say that this Amendment can make no practical difference and he may support his argument by saying that if the House prolongs its life for 12 months, it is none the less open to the House, or to the Prime Minister, or to the King, to end the life of the House at an earlier date whereas, on the other hand, if we now prolong our life for six months, it will remain open to us in six months' time to prolong it for a further six months. So, the Minister may argue, my Amendment would make no substantial difference. I think that argument would come very poorly from the lips of a Member of the Conservative party, because the difference between what I propose and what the Government propose concerning the situation in six months' time is the precise difference between contracting in and not contracting out; in other words, I think it is important that in six months' time the House should be faced by the necessity, if it so desires and if hon. Members so dare, deliberately by positive action to prolong its life all over again and that hon. Members should not now put themselves in the nice, easy, comfortable position that they will not have to bring up this question for decision for another 12 months. For these reasons, I hope the Committee will support the Amendment.</p>

<p>There does not seem to be any great enthusiasm in the Committee for the Amendment moved by the hon. Baronet the Member for Barnstaple (Sir R. Acland). He suggested various arguments which might be put forward against his Amendment, but I could not discern in the remarks he made any arguments in favour of it. The


short question before the Committee is whether we should pass enabling legislation, and enabling legislation only, for a period of 12 months or for a period of six months. The Government, having given their best consideration to the matter, came to the conclusion that it would meet the general convenience to introduce legislation covering a further period of 12 months. After all, 12 months is a convenient period. In the Expiring Laws Continuance Act every year, we renew Acts of Parliament for a 12 months' period. In my view, the hon. Baronet has put forward no sound reasons for shortening the period in this case, and I hope the Committee will reject the Amendment.</p>

<p>The hon. Baronet the Member for Barnstaple (Sir R. Acland), in moving his Amendment, said that the House is looked upon by the general public in an increasingly unsatisfactory light, but he did hot fortify that statement with any arguments. It would appear from the by-elections in which the hon. Baronet has participated that not only is the House looked upon as performing its duties to the nation in a thoroughly satisfactory way, but no interest is taken by the electors at large, when the opportunity is placed in their hands, to indicate their feelings in the matter.</p>

<p>Very well, Colonel Clifton Brown; then I will oppose the Clause, and although it was not permissible on the previous Clause to give reasons why there should be a General Election in this country in a shorter period of time, I hope I may be permitted to give reasons why there should be a General Election in Northern Ireland. I cannot understand the reason for including Northern Ireland in this Bill. That inclusion has prejudiced the question to a large extent, and the matter ought to have been dealt with in a separate Bill. I want to take this opportunity of explaining the reasons for which there should be a General Election in Northern Ireland and the people there be given an opportunity to voice their opinions and come to decisions at the poll as to whether or not the Government, or members of the Government, are entitled to continue in office or in the House. That can be decided only if the people are faced with the claims and the answers in an election struggle in Northern Ireland. The Government of Northern Ireland have had a fairly


long run. So has this House. The comparison, however, is not a good one. In this country there has been a general lack of interest regarding the Government, and although there may be differences, they are as to whether or not the war has been waged successfully or energetically enough; but there are in Northern Ireland issues that are very pregnant with tremendous possibilities in that country. These issues should be faced at an inquest at the polls in order that people may either purge the Government of some of their bad elements, or at any rate give the Government a knowledge of the opinions of the country.<br/>
The Labour party in Northern Ireland has made a request to the Labour party in this country which I should have thought deserving of more attention than it has been given. They have asked that a General Election should be held and that there should be a National Government formed in Northern Ireland, a demand which I do not intend to urge or to take part in. But I believe that the Labour party in Northern Ireland are desirous of an opportunity of going to the polls to seek to increase their representation and to put before the electors their views about the mishandling of affairs and the general mismanagement by the Government, and that the grave suspicions entertained in the minds of a large percentage of the population should be aired. That is also being urged by the Nationalist minority, who also have grievances that they want to put before the people. Then there is the large number of Unionists who disagree with the Government. The by-election in the late Lord Craigavon's seat was lost by a crushing majority, in spite of the intervention of the Prime Minister in a last-minute appeal. It might be urged that the Labour party and the Nationalists do not count, being small minorities, but surely Members of this House and the Government are bound to pay heed to the fact that the Unionist party are at long last beginning to repudiate their Government and are desirous of administering to it the rebuke and the punishment at the polls which they believe it deserves.<br/>
The Government have taken power to suppress the activities and the power of the City Council in Belfast, and a very large number of Unionist members are overwhelmingly opposed to the assumption

of these powers of dictatorship. My friends from Northern, Ireland may disagree, but I am presenting the case as I have heard it, and as I see it, and as my experience teaches me from the angles that I was told of it. When I find even the Lord Mayor and a large number of the members of the City Council saying that the Government take power to suppress the City Council in order to cover up their own misdeeds, I begin to wonder whether it is the City Council or the Government that ought to have been suppressed. Undoubtedly this is a public issue which would be fought out with tremendous heat at the polls. If the Government of this country seek to prevent the electors from passing their verdict on these public questions, they are doing a tremendous disservice to democracy, because if democracy is to live, it must voice periodically the feelings and the views of the people, and, while there is no drastic change in the mind of the people of this country, there is a dramatic and drastic change in Northern Ireland.<br/>
The Home Secretary is being attacked in Parliament and in the country as being a man who has interests other than democracy in the suppression of the City Council. I heard a few days' Debate on a Motion of Censure, which showed conclusively to my mind that it was desirable that Northern Ireland should have an opportunity of expressing itself upon the actions of the Home Secretary. The accusation was made that the City Council was suppressed because of one or two suspicious actions of members of the Council. One that was put forward was an attempted sale of land to the Council. The man who attempted to sell it had got it for a few thousand pounds and he attempted to sell it for something like &#x00A3;110,000 or &#x00A3;113,000. The Home Secretary was the agent for this man. When public opinion became incensed regarding these attempted deals and the police began to make inquiries into heavy bribes that had been offered, the man who could have given the greatest amount of evidence, the man who attempted to palm it off, and whose agent was the Home Secretary, was issued with a permit to leave the country and go to Canada and the United States. The question was discussed in the Northern Ireland Parliament, and the old answer was given by the Home Secretary which has worked very well during a long period of time: "I do not propose to


answer all these allegations m ade against me. I place myself in the hands of the House. The country knows me. I am not disposed to enter into these discussions at all."<br/>
Two other points were raised, one regarding a cinema licence which had been refused by the Home Secretary's Department. When an appeal was made to the Home Secretary, he acted as agent in the appeal against the decision of his own Department, and he got the licence granted&#x2014;I am not suggesting by undue influence, but, by the fact that it was the Home Secretary appealing against his own decision, the thing was got through. There was a glaring case of a man who was prosecuted for drunkenness in charge of a motor car and for dangerous driving, and he was fined in the courts. Although the police department and the Home Secretary's Department were involved, the Home Secretary acted as the agent in the appeal against his own police. The court granted leave to appeal and the conviction was quashed.</p>

<p>I am showing the reasons why there should be a General Election; there is a strong public feeling on all these issues in Northern Ireland. I cannot defend the case for an election in Northern Ireland unless I show the background of discontent in that country. The Home Secretary was invited to go to a meeting of 60,000 or 70,000 people in Belfast to defend himself, and he refused. Three-quarters of the Government in Northern Ireland who voted in the Lobby in justification of the Home Secretary have interests in the Government in some way. As a result the vote was not a reflex of public opinion in the country. A large number of Unionists with whom I discussed the question, including the Lord Mayor and Conservative business men, and also men in the street, said that the Government should be sent to the electors to be purged of certain elements in it so that there could be some drastic change in the running of affairs in Northern Ireland.<br/>
The Nationalist minority have a tremendous grievance against the Government. They have 300 or 400 people interned in

Northern Ireland. I am not defending any man who has committed a crime for which he is found guilty. If a man is discovered with arms, he should stand his trial. A large number of the people who have been interned in Northern Ireland, however, have been interned without charge and without trial for over five years. They just lay in prison cells while the Government are in office. The Government should face the public and give an account to the public of this treatment of human beings. It is not a case of being interned in war conditions, for large numbers of them were arrested in 1937 and 1938. They are young and middle-aged men, and they are still languishing in gaol without charge or trial. Is that a state of affairs that should be allowed to continue without the Government going to the electors and giving an account of their stewardship? During a period of the war many crimes are committed and many people are found with arms. There is also grave suspicion about where the money comes from. I do not deny that something of that kind exists. Any person who breaks the law should stand a trial and receive punishment. I am not defending them. I am defending the many men who are in prison without charge. There is a grave suspicion, indeed, a belief, in Northern Ireland among a section of the people that these men are interned because of political and religious antagonism and intolerance, and that they are denounced, without any knowledge of the crimes they are supposed to have committed, and put into gaol. I asked to see the conditions under which they were living, and the Home Secretary refused to allow me to do so. I understand that the conditions are a public scandal. The Nationalist minority say that there are many members of that body who do not in the slightest break the law, or interfere with the normal procedure of justice or who do not take up arms or purchase arms, or who do not traffic with the enemy. They contend that they ought to be able to interrogate the Government at the polls.<br/>
If any Members have a doubt about what is taking place, let me give an example. I was asked to go to a cemetery in Belfast to see the interment of a young man who had died in the Isle of Wight where he had been held on some charge by the Home Secretary of this country. He died of tuberculosis, and his corpse


was taken to Belfast. I cannot understand why I should have been asked to go to the interment. I went to the cemetery and saw the service. There was a mass of armed police such as I have never seen even in Nazi Germany. After the interment the police tramped over the graves and there and at the gates of the cemetery seached every civilian in the crowd. Such disgraceful conduct was enough to arouse hostlity and should not be allowed to go on in Northern Ireland. Decent citizens should protest against this form of Nazi treatment of minorities in that country. The Nationalists justly say that men should not be allowed to continue in prison if the Government do not go to the country in a General Election. Governments during an election go through a process of civilisation, because when they are in contact with the electors the electors are inclined to modify their attitude and exact promises from the Government. Moderate elements sometimes crop up even in the Tory party, and they say, "We object to this going on in our name," and they exact promises from Ministers which lead to a change in policy.<br/>
The Nationalist minority say that the persecution of minorities should cease and that it should be put an end to by a process of election. Many people in Northern Ireland say that the Government are existing to a large extent upon the-subsidies that are provided by this House and that Government Departments are packed with the friends&#x2014;scores of names were given to me&#x2014;of politicians in Northern Ireland doing jobs at good salaries, and that the taxpayers of this country are having money extracted from them to keep the Government&#x2014;not a democratic Government&#x2014;in Northern Ireland going. The Nationalists claim that they have a possible alternative to the present Government and that they could defeat practically every Minister at the polls. If that is true, it is wrong to allow the present state of affairs to continue. The dependants of whose who are interned in Northern Ireland are not given any form of allowance&#x2014;a most disgraceful thing&#x2014;and when the minority seek to raise funds to maintain the families of these internees, they are refused the right to engage in many activities such as flag days. Therefore, I say that it is a great pity that though in ordinary times this

House gets very hot and bothered about the struggle for democracy, when there is a chance of showing that no democracy exists in this part of Great Britain we find an absence of Members. If a Division is called, however, they troop into the Lobby, knowing the case neither for nor against, but just voting down any proposal that the Members of the Northern Ireland Parliament should be sent to the electors.<br/>
I maintain that there is this strong feeling prevailing, and I say that no Member is true to himself or the public of Northern Ireland if he tries to convince this Committee that the opinion I have expressed is not strongly held in Northern Ireland, because these views are being voiced and being fought out in the background. I say that democracy is not ruling in Northern Ireland, that Nazi tyranny is operating against the minority, and that it is a tyranny which has usurped its power in the most brutal manner. On behalf of the internees, many of whom may be quite innocent men, and on behalf of the citizens of Belfast who feel that the suppression of the City Council is wrong and undemocratic&#x2014;if there were grafting elements they ought to have been purged&#x2014;I say that democracy should be allowed to operate through the great bulk of decent men serving on the City Council. There is a demand from the Labour minority that there should be an expression of opinion from the country. Therefore, I am speaking against this Clause because I thing the Government of Northern Ireland and the incompetent Mr. Andrews, a spineless politician, should be sent to the electors to get a verdict upon their activities; and I have no doubt that if the people of Northern Ireland desire democracy to live, they will find some alternative, within the ambit of Parliamentary democracy, to a Government which has been guilty of many heinous crimes.</p>

<p>It speaks well for the hon. Member for Shettleston (Mr. McGovern) that he came to Belfast on holiday, and I am really sorry that the Under-Secretary did not grant him permission to go to Eire to continue his stay.

<p>Yes, I asked the hon. Member to do so when he came to Belfast. First of all he wanted to borrow a bicycle. The only bicycle we had at home belongs to my small daughter, and I could not see the hon. Member mounting it and getting as far as Monaghan, which I believe was one of the places he wanted to visit. The late Sir Joseph McConnell, who was Member for Antrim, offered to provide the hon. Member with a bicycle, but, after all, I suppose, like many of us he is getting to the age when cycling does not appeal to him so much. However, it so happened that at my request we lunched together in a public restaurant. There were seven of us at table, I think. One of the men was a disgruntled member of the Belfast City Corporation&#x2014;now the intimate friend of the hon. Member. I refer to Councillor S. B. Thompson. It was really "jam" for this councillor to have someone to whom he could unburden his soul, and naturally he took the hon. Member under his wing as a prize exhibit and took him over to the Corporation Chambers. There he met quite a number of members of the council. I regret that a great number of them are disgruntled. There, among other things, they were photographed together, which is something they always do in Belfast, though I escaped on this occasion.</p>

<p>I paid for the lunch and I will pay for the lunch of the hon. Member if he comes to Belfast. As I say, this photograph was taken. The hon. Member has mentioned the Lord Mayor. One of the things which the Lord Mayor himself told me was "They wanted me to go into the group with them but I was not going to be photographed like that." Those are his own words. He was not going to be associated with the hon. Member and his party. Moreover, the Lord Mayor has assured me that he never asked the hon. Member to put forward his case in this Chamber. The hon. Member must have had a very busy fortnight. He says that he was refused permission to visit the prison. That is a

definite statement which I am bound to deny. My Friend the late Member for East Belfast, now Lord Glentoran, told me that in the last day or two arrangements were made for the hon. Member to go into the prison, but that in spite of&#x2014;</p>

<p>On a point of accuracy. Lord Glentoran told me that opportunity would be given to me to visit the prison. He said that he would see the Home Secretary and get the permit. It was conveyed to me by a Member of the Northern Ireland Parliament that I had to telephone the Home Secretary to get the necessary permission. I did so, and was told that the Home Secretary had laid it down that I should not be allowed to visit the prison. His secretary said that he regretted this very much, but he was only conveying to me the decision of his chief. I thought the arrangement had been made, but permission was definitely refused, and the Home Secretary stated in the Press that he had refused permission.</p>

<p>My information is that there was no question about it. Lord Glentoran did make the necessary arrangements but it was in the week during which the hon. Member went to Eire. The fault was not in the office of Lord Glentoran. With regard to the interned men, it is a well-known fact that they have the right to appeal when they want to do so. They can ask that their cases should be heard, but as is the case with all the I.R.A. men they refuse to recognise the court, and the hon. Gentleman knows it. I do not want to delay the proceedings here by describing any more of the hen. Member's movements during his stay in Belfast, but it is remarkable that he should have delivered in this Chamber the speech which he made concerning one of the strongest men in the Ulster Parliament, Sir Dawson Bates. He has a very hard task. What happened near my home on Saturday last? A bomb was thrown at the police barracks during the blackout, three women were wounded and two policemen shot, one of them dead. Sir Dawson Bates has a terrible task and he deserves the thanks of every decent man in Northern Ireland. I assure him that he has their confidence.<br/>
As to the proposal to exclude Northern Ireland from the Bill we in Northern Ireland are in exactly the same position as you here. We have the 1939 register


which would not be very reliable. We have no conscription in Northern Ireland. When the Government of the day first brought in the Military Service Bill it included Northern Ireland, but it was subsequently proposed that Northern Ireland should be left out. We did what we could to have Northern Ireland included and on that issue we voted against the Government which we were sent here to support. I spoke in the House demanding that we should be included but we were not. What has happened as a consequence? Young men on our side have voluntarily enlisted in thousands and we have many workers over here on munitions. What chance is there of a fair election now? There are over 100,000 voters in my constituency of North Belfast, where the greatest damage in Belfast was done by air raids. Thousands of houses were destroyed and many thousands of men and women were killed, yet in those circumstances it is still suggested that we should hold an election and work on the old register. What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander and we have as good a right to this postponement as you have.<br/>
What happened in connection with the Belfast Corporation was that there was a scandal about the tuberculosis hospital. A public inquiry was instituted and disclosed a very alarming state of affairs. The Home Secretary told the Corporation to put their house in order or he would take action about it. A committee was appointed including Nationalists, Labour men, Conservatives and an Independent. They got out a report. The council said then: "Very well, you can drop it all. Thank you very much we have no further use for you." The Government of Northern Ireland could have done nothing else but bring in the Bill which has been brought in to deal with the situation. They have not dissolved the Corporation. Several of the men whom the hon. Member for Shettleston met and to whom he talked about their grievances, intimated that if the Bill became law they would resign in a body but they were still there when the hon. Gentleman was in Belfast.</p>

<p>Is it not true that the Belfast Corporation accepted something like 11 of the 13 proposals of the Government and that the dispute on the remaining points was of very small consequence;

and that in the midst of the negotiations, the Government closed down and threatened a dissolution?</p>

<p>There is no question of that. The authority of the Home Secretary having been flouted, he did the only thing he could. About the three administrators, who have been appointed, it is marvellous that they took the thing on. Their appointment is for four years. As regards the two Parliamentary by-elections to which reference has been made, as the hon. Gentleman said, the first was for the seat of the late Prime Minister. The present member is a strong Unionist, a strong Orangeman and a Church man&#x2014;a thoroughly good man. [<i>Laughter</i>.] I do not see why those facts should be thought of as laughable. In the other by-election, at Willowfield, I would point out that the successful candidate, Alderman Midgley, speaking at Albert-bridge Hall on 28th November, 1941, said:
<q>There must be no alteration of Northern Ireland's political status without the consent of the Northern Ireland people, which meant that a referendum would have to be taken on the issue, and he (Alderman Midgley), had not, and would not, associate himself with any policy which sought to separate Northern Ireland from its association with the British Commonwealth, or from its association with Great Britain.</q>
Our big point is to keep up our good relations with this country. I am sorry to talk about these domestic things, but so much has been made of them, that I had to say something about them. I appeal to this Committee on the broader issue to give us exactly what you are taking for yourselves. Do not try to make us have an election at this time, when it would be a farce.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I was not present when the Second Reading Debate took place. I was serving in my unit. Maybe it was my fault for not finding out that the question of Northern Ireland was to be raised. However, I read the speeches to the best of my ability, including, with considerable interest, the speech of the hon. Member for Shettleston (Mr. McGovern). I cannot really believe that this subject need have been raised at all. I cannot see the need for this controversy. I read the speech of the hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Stokes) on the Second Reading, and he made some terrible threats about what he was going to say


about Northern Ireland. I would like to say to him that my colleagues and myself are not afraid of any of these terrible threats, but we are afraid of something far worse&#x2014;at least I am&#x2014;and that is, a repetition of that dreadful state of affairs which took place at the end of the last war and a few years afterwards. Some of it is going on now. People armed with tommy guns and other lethal weapons are shooting down our policemen, and that probably is the answer to the hon. Member for Shettleston as to why a certain number of people are being kept in prison under rather different circumstances than those under which people are kept in prison here under the Emergency Powers Act.<br/>
I suppose the majority of hon. Members have not the experience of some of us of what happened in Ireland at the end of the last war and the few years that followed. I had the unpleasant experience of my father's house having been shot up. I do not pretend to be a brave person. I have been bombed several times in this war. I was terrified, I admit. On the journey abroad with my unit there were moments in the convoy when, again, I was terrified, but when one is in uniform it is a different matter; it is one's job. When it comes to civil war, the situation is very different, and that is one thing which I hope will never recur. I cannot help feeling that several people have been over to Ireland and have returned rather like Columbus, thinking that they have discovered the whole thing.<br/>
The hon. Member for Shettleston has been to Belfast recently. As an officer I recently went to Bagdad. The moment a grateful War Office will give me permission to go to Northern Ireland, I hope to go there and take up all those questions which were debated the other day, and which are being debated to-day. I hope that the hon. Member for Shettleston will accompany me if he can get away. Various points were raised in the Debate. One of them which I would like to discuss now is this question of conscription which was discussed by the hon. Member for North Belfast (Mr. Somerset). Again I must refer to the hon. Member for Shettleston. I know that he is a doughty debater but an eminently fair one. When he was talking about conscription the other day&#x2014;I only read his

speech&#x2014;I think he was rather hurting the feelings of Members of this House who represent Northern Ireland. It was not lour fault that conscription was not introduced. I understand that Mr. de Valera announced that in his opinion it would be a bad move to have conscription for Northern Ireland, and conscription was cut out. The voluntary system generally means that the best young men, the best of your manhood, are the people who come forward first. In Northern Ireland the situation is exactly that. The best of our people have come forward. That means that a certain residue are going to be left behind. They may be just as good, but they hold rather different views, and the views of that minority are that Northern Ireland should be joined up with the South of Ireland. In war-time, as everybody knows, it would mean that Northern Ireland would have to become neutral.</p>

<p>I think the hon. Member for Bridgeton (Mr. Maxton) said that in his view, because we had not a Coalition Government in Northern Ireland, it was a good reason why prolongation should not be given to the Northern Ireland Government. With all due respect to the hon. Member, I do not


think that a very fair point, for this reason. The idea of Coalition is that the biggest party coalesces with the largest minority, but when the largest minority refuse to take their seats&#x2014;whether they draw their salaries, I do not know&#x2014;it makes the situation rather difficult. Again, supposing the largest minority, the Nationalists, did actually take their place and came into a Coalition Government, there would be the most extraordinary situation of the Unionist members doing their utmost to prosecute the war and a Nationalist minority doing their utmost to make Northern Ireland neutral. In my view that is not a very good idea for running a Coalition Government. I will not detain the Committee for more than a few moments, but I would like to make a point raised, again, by the hon. Member for Ipswich". In the course of his speech he said that, after listening to various speeches:
<q>&#x2026; the reflection passed through my mind if we could get rid of Northern Ireland by handing it over to the people to whom it naturally belongs &#x2026;"&#x2014;[OFFICIAI, REPORT, 30th September, 1942; col. 867, Vol. 383.]</q>
I do not quite know whether he quite realised what he was saying. He does not seem to realise that if we did as he suggested, we should hand over a very valuable training ground for military purposes. There are quite a number of American troops there, and quite a number of aircraft training centres. Even more important, there are seaplane bases there doing valuable work in trying to win the Battle of the Atlantic, which the Prime Minister said recently is the most important thing of all. I would ask the hon. Member to recollect that these men are doing magnificent work in Coastal Command in Catalinas, Short Sunderlands and other machines. If you are really to hand us over to the South of Ireland, then this valuable area is lost.<br/>
In conclusion, I would say that if we are to have an election in Northern Ireland, it means that we shall fight that election, as the hon. Member for North Belfast said, on a 1939 register. A large number of Ulster troops who would be eligible to vote are fighting abroad. There is a battery of my friends from the towns of Newtownards and Bangor, and a great number of them will never come back. The last I heard of them they were in Tobruk. When I inquired at the War

Office about them, I was told they were listed as "zero." It seems to me that the hon. Gentleman opposite has raised more of a debating point, which has just a smack of party politics about it. My colleagues and I will play party politics with anyone when the war is over; but let us for the moment cut out party politics, and do our utmost to carry on the prosecution of the war successfully.</p>

<p>I am very diffident about intervening in this Debate, but I feel that the plea put forward by the hon. Member for Shettleston (Mr. McGovern) should not be accepted by the Committee. We have in the North of Ireland an extremely difficult and embarrassing situation, and I cannot conceive that a General Election taking place in the course of the next year could fail to add fuel to the flames already burning in that part of our Commonwealth. I think the feeling of hon. Members with regard to Ireland at present is to do and say nothing that will add further difficulty to the situation of that unhappy country. We have, as the Noble Lord has just said, a large number of American troops there, and it would be exceedingly unfortunate if the controversies arising from a General Election were to be introduced in the presence of those American troops, who have been so well received by all sections of the population. I have always tried to encourage better feeling in Ireland: years ago I was in a national movement there whose main purpose was to bring the various sections of public opinion in Ireland more closely together; and I do not want to see anything happen which would make feeling worse in that country.<br/>
I admire very much the interest taken by the hon. Member for Shettleston in the affairs of Northern Ireland. I know he is inspired by the highest motives. I know that he feels deeply about certain events in Northern Ireland. I am sure that if he had the opportunity he would make a very great contribution to bringing about a happier state of affairs there, but this proposal of his is not calculated to make things better. I am sorry that certain personalities have been introduced in this Debate. I would like to think kindly of everybody, and the hon. Gentleman went a little far in some of the personal allusions he made. We do not help to get a better atmosphere and a more kindly outlook by observations of that sort. The


real consideration is whether it is wise, in the present political situation in Ulster, to have a General Election early next year. I say that careful consideration of the contingencies that are bound to arise, the difficulties that will develop, and the thousand and one problems, of personal and domestic and entirely Ulster quality, that will be presented during an election would arouse feelings that many of us would wish were dead for all time. I hope that the hon. Member will, therefore, support the Government in carrying the Clause.</p>

<p>I sat here during the whole of the Debate on the Second Reading, listening, without moving a muscle, to various diatribes and attacks upon Ulster. I wanted very much to speak upon that occasion, but as my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Londonderry (Sir R. Ross) and my hon. Friend the Member for County Down (Dr. Little) were here, I thought it better, as they were not able to come over this week, to reserve what I had to say for this occasion. I understand, from what was said in the speeches on the Second Reading and by the hon. Member for Shettleston (Mr. McGovem) to-day, that three. reasons have been brought forward why the Parliament of Northern Ireland should not be prolonged. The first was that the constitution of the Parliament of Northern Ireland was&#x2014;so it was argued&#x2014;unsatisfactory. The second was that the Government of Northern Ireland had suspended the Belfast Corporation. One Member devoted the whole of his speech to that subject, and it was raised again to-day by the hon. Member for Shettleston. The third reason was that we should have imitated the Imperial Parliament and adopted a form of Coalition Government.</p>

<p>What struck me as perhaps the strongest of all the speeches was that made by the hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Stokes), who, I am glad to see, is in his place. He said:
<q>So far as I can understand from my contacts in Northern Ireland, the majority of the people there would like a General Election.

<p>Thank you, Mr. Williams. I had just come to the end of the quotation, I am glad to say. I should like to reply to the hon. Member for Ipswich, so far as his observations referred to this Clause, I will invite the hon. Member to come over to Belfast. I will offer him the hospitality of my humble roof, and, if he will come, I will take him round Belfast, and Northern Ireland generally, and show what has been done by this Government in the last 20 years: how the whole Province has been completely transformed, and how schools have sprung up in every direction. I will guarantee, if the hon. Gentleman will accept my invitation, to protect him from a repetition of the unfortunate misadventures which befell the celebrated Mr. Pickwick when he visited Ipswich, and I will prove, I think, to the hon. Gentleman that the late Lord Craigavon did more for Ulster than even Cardinal Wolsey did for


Ipswich. Cardinal Wolsey was the greatest statesman that the ancient borough has produced, with, of course, the sole exception of the existing Member. During the last 33 years that I have lived in Northern Ireland our experience has always been that we have invited these gentlemen, these exceedingly severe critics, to Ulster, who, when they have seen what the Government of Northern Ireland have done, have been completely converted. Goldsmith was a very great Irish poet and he used these words which are applicable to these gentlemen:
<q>And fools, who came to scoff, remained to pray.</q>
The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Wakefield (Mr. Greenwood) laid stress upon what he called "the defective constitution of the Parliament of Northern Ireland." Indeed we are told that the Labour Members sent a deputation over here and were received by the Labour party in this House in order to state their reasons why the Parliament of Northern Ireland should not be prolonged. I should like to say in this connection that these gentlemen representing the Labour party might have asked their local representatives also to give them a hearing. I have the honour to be the Secretary of the Ulster Unionist Parliamentary Party and should have been the channel of communication. I would have gladly arranged a meeting with all our representatives and we should have heard what these Labour gentlemen had to say. However, a memorandum has been presented by the members of the Labour Party and a memorandum also by the Nationalists in which they say that they laid proposals before the Cabinet, the Ministers here and the leading Members of Parliament. I am not a leading Member of Parliament and therefore I was not favoured with one of these manifestoes. I think that perhaps the real reason why they did not send it to me was rather that they knew I was too well acquainted with the facts and that I was able to answer them. What is the allegation put forward against renewing our House of Commons? They say&#x2014;this is a quotation of only one sentence&#x2014;"
<q>The Six Counties Government "&#x2014;&#x2014;</q>
that is what they call it; they will not give it the name of Ulster&#x2014;
<q>has so far been kept in office by retrograde sectarianism and by the machinery of gerrymandering constituencies.</q>

As far as retrograde sectarianism is concerned I have nothing to say except to make this observation from my experience of over a third of a century in Ulster. Our religion so far from being retrograde is exceedingly progressive and enlightened, I fully admit however that that is a question of opinion, but the charge that we gerrymandered the constituencies is a statement of fact. They go on to allege that "proportional representation was an essential part of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, designed to secure a degree of fair representation to the minority but it was swept away by the Northern Ireland Government for obvious reasons." Fortunately, the facts and figures are there. The last election under proportional representation took place in the year 1925. The Nationalists and Republicans together succeeded in obtaining 12 seats. The first election under single member constituencies took place in the year 1929. What happened? The Nationalists and Republicans had eleven seats. They gained one seat in Belfast at the expense of Labour and they lost two seats, one in Antrim and one in Armagh.</p>

<p>I only felt it right to point out in reply to these statements that the constituencies have been gerrymandered, that they could not have been gerrymandered because the difference between the number elected under proportional representation and the number elected by the single member constituencies is only one representative. If the constituencies had been gerrymandered, the Nationalists would not have lost only one seat. Whereas they had 12 representatives under proportional representation, they had 11 under the single member constituencies. That was the point of my argument, and I think that it is a statement which is really relevant to the question because these gentlemen said that you must not renew this Parliament of Northern Ireland because of its unsatisfactory constitution.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Gorbals (Mr. Buchanan) in his Second Reading speech devoted the greater part of it to this point and I think I might be in order in dealing with it because it is very important and great play has been made with it in this Debate. Speaking as a representative of the Queen's University of Belfast I can say that we maintain the best possible relations both with the corporation of Belfast and with the Gcvernment of Northern Ireland. Even if I had an opinion on this controversial matter, wild horses would not drag it from me but I would like to say that this is not an act of Nazidom, not a <i>coup d'&#x00E9;tat</i>, but that this Bill for the reform of the Belfast Corporation was carried by enormous majorities through the House of Commons and through the Senate of Northern Ireland. It was fully debated and discussed; it was not an executive act, as one might have been led to believe from this discussion. It was a Bill and it was passed into law on receiving the Royal Assent from His Grace the Governor of Northern Ireland. My point is this: that no one has ever argued that this House of Commons is to be a court of appeal from the Government of Northern Ireland. The Parliament of Northern Ireland has acted in this respect within its powers and what right have you to set this House up as a court of appeal from the Parliament of Northern Ireland on a question of this great importance?<br/>
With regard to the point that because we have not adopted a Coalition Government like you here and that, therefore, our Parliament should not be prolonged I would like to quote from a Question put by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for South-West Bethnal Green (Sir P. Harris) who said:
<q>While recognising the very strong case against an election in these circumstances would it not be a reasonable thing to suggest that roms endeavour should be made to formulate a National Government on the lines of this Parliament in order to prolong its life? "&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 23rd July, 1942; col. 168, Vol. 382.]</q>
Has your Coalition Government over here been such an immense success that you wish to impose it upon Northern Ireland? One of the greatest, if not the greatest, of your Prime Ministers used this very apt phrase:
<q>England does not love coalitions.</q>
Those are words pronounced in this House some 90 years ago by the great Disraeli.


Of course they referred to the Coalition of Whigs and Peelites which he had facing him but I have no doubt that he was going back to the still more celebrated Coalition of Fox and North, a Coalition which the younger Pitt overthrew and appealed successfully to the country&#x2014;</p>

<p>I am always ready to bow to your ruling, Mr. Williams, but I would like to say this. When these people say, "Why haven't you a Coalition Government "? I say, "If you have a Coalition it means you have to coalesce with someone." You cannot have a coalition without coalescing With whom do you intend to invite the Government of Northern Ireland to coalesce? Is it with six Nationalist Members, four of whom are absentees after having taken the oath and thereby earned the right to their salaries and who have never once, I am told, put in an appearance? Of the remaining two Nationalists one is irregular in his attendance, while the other one is a successor to the late Mr. Joseph Devlin, who was a distinguished Member of this House. He is the only one who attends regularly. This is the largest section of the opposition. What about coalescing with the Labour party? Well, there are three members of the Labour party. I know them all; I have studied their speeches and every man's hand is against the other man's. If one can judge by what they have said they differ far more from one another than from the Government of Northern Ireland. I hope this House will realise that conditions for a coalition in Northern Ireland are very different from what they are over here.<br/>
I know that the greatest crime one can commit in this House is to make too long a speech because time is so limited and there are other Members who wish to address the Committee. Therefore, I will content myself with this conclusion: Suppose you represent a constituency where a large majority has voted against you at the last election because it was a three-cornered fight. The majority of your electors have voted against you and therefore, you represent a minority. You were elected not by a majority but merely by a plurality. Now, if a large proportion of your electors are Irish Nationalists your

action in attacking Ulster to-day can of course be fully justified because you must placate a certain section of your constituency by twisting the tail of the Ulster lion.</p>

<p>I rise to speak in support of what my hon. Friend the Member for Shettleston (Mr. McGovern) said at the opening of this Debate and to oppose this Clause. First, perhaps, I had best deal with the remarks of the Noble Lord the Member for Down (Viscount Castlereagh) &#x00E0; propos my attitude in this matter. I am glad to see him back safely from Bagdad. He said he was afraid that if we had another election in Northern Ireland, there would be a repetition of what happened before in the way of civil strife, more especially if these contentious matters continued to be discussed in this House. I want to make it clear that it is for that very reason that I wish to see a change of Government in Northern Ireland. I fear that if the present situation&#x2014;the miserably bad Government&#x2014;continues there will be an ever increasing amount of discontent in Northern Ireland and that we shall have a repetition of the very thing which the Noble Lord fears. He then went on to make what seemed to me to be a fundamental admission, and one of which I hope Members of both the Northern Ireland and the Eire Government will take note. In referring to some remarks I had made about returning Northern Ireland to the people to whom it belonged, he said that if we did that it would mean handing over the bases to Eire, and the country would become neutral. I was delighted to hear him admit that the country is now invaded and is not in the hands of the Irish people to whom it rightly belongs.</p>

<p>I do not dispute with the Noble Lord what he says about fighting for the Empire. I have elicited from him the admission that the present situation in Northern Ireland is not right and that, in fact, Northern Ireland is invaded by people who have no right to rule it. That, however, is by the way. The important point I want to make is that it would not necessarily follow that, if there were a unified Ireland as a result of a new control in Northern Ireland, we should


have to hand over the Northern bases. If we could get&#x2014;and I believe we could, with good will on both sides&#x2014;a union of North and South, it might very well be that we should get the use of the Southern Irish bases as well. That point ought not to be lost sight of. With regard to the remarks of the hon. Member for Belfast University (Professor Savory), I will, of course, gladly accept his invitation to visit Ulster with him at the earliest possible opportunity. I shall take the greatest delight in going round with him. Unfortunately, my contacts with Northern Ireland have been in the main of a business and not of a political nature. I should be interested to have first-hand evidence from the hon. Member of the state of affairs which he claims exists there.</p>

<p>I am on such terms with the Home Secretary that I am sure he will be glad to see me out of the country. I am not sure that Cardinal Wolsey will not turn in his grave at the suggestion that the present Member for Ipswich competes with him in statesmanship; I shall however hope that with his inspiration before me, I may one day achieve some degree of like eminence. But in any event we shall be delighted to see the hon. Member for Belfast University in Ipswich, and I shall be delighted to take part in a debate with him in the Borough on the Irish situation. As to the hon. Member's statements about fair representation, I ask the Committee to bear in mind that, when quoting figures in support of his argument that there is fair representation, he failed to point out that of the 52 seats, 39 are held by Unionists, who polled only 55 per cent. of the votes cast. How that can be called fair representation, I fail to understand.</p>

<p>That is not important to my main argument. I come now to the main point that I want to make. The hon. Member complained that some of us had described the Northern Ireland Parliament as a racket and a ramp. I shall seek to prove by evidence other than my own, and

in support of my contention that this Clause ought not to stand part of the Bill, that those terms are fundamentally correct. I would remind the Committee that the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, under which the Northern Ireland Government functions, states:
<q>In the exercise of their powers to make laws under this Act, the Parliament of Northern Ireland shall not make a law so as either directly or indirectly to establish or endow any religion, or prohibit or restrict the free exercise thereof, or give a preference, privilege or advantage, or impose any disability or disadvantage on account of religious beliefs.</q>
I want to show, in support of my contention that the Clause should not stand part, that this, is not being done, and that the vilest discrimination is being shown against people on account of their religious beliefs. I will quote some extracts from what eminent people in Northern Ireland, and others, have said on the question of the Northern Ireland Government. At the time of Lord Craigavon's death, the following was written in the "Manchester Guardian":
<q>The Government of Northern Ireland is unique in the annals of Parliamentary Government in its stability. Lord Craigavon was its first Prime Minister, and two others of the present Ministers have sat with him in the Cabinet continuously since the summer of 1921. The Unionist party is in perpetual power. It is the perfect example of Government by caucus. There are substantial minorities, Nationalist, Republican, and Labour, but by electoral and administrative manipulation, the scales are weighted against them.</q>
It goes on to say:
<q>The large proportion of office holders in a small House of Commons has always tended to give undue weight to the Executive and the maintenance of the orthodoxy on which it exists.</q>
I will quote now from what was said by Mr. T. Henderson, who is, I understand, an Independent Partitionist Member, in a speech in the Six Counties Parliament on 12th March, 1940:&#x2014;
<q>He was amazed at the cost of running the Government. It was no wonder that some of the friends of the Government had advocated the appointment of commissioners to run the country. The Northern Government was only the agent for the British Government and they had practically nothing to do. The entire affairs of the country were administered by British Ministries, the Ministry of Food, etc. The millions of pounds required to run the Government could be saved if the Government stopped its activities for the duration of the war. The Government was only an ornamental Government, it had no power, it existed simply to provide jobs for wealthy friends of Ministers and others not so well-to-do, and was the most costly Government in the world.</q>


That is evidence from one of the Members of the Northern Ireland Parliament. I will quote some more disturbing statements from two former Parliamentary Secretaries, who, unlike Parliamentary Secretaries usually, saw fit to resign. In 1940, Mr. Warner was Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Home Affairs, and he resigned because of the alleged extravagance and inefficiency of the Administration. He stated that expenditure on the police showed an utter disregard for public money. His resignation was followed shortly afterwards&#x2014;I am not sure of the exact date&#x2014;by the resignation of Colonel A. R. Gordon, who was Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Finance, and who stated:
<q>The Government, as at present constistuted, is, by the nature of its personnel, lacking in drive and energy and utterly lacking in understanding of what war means, and it is unable to sustain us in the ordeal that is before us.</q>
Finally, I would like to quote a letter which was published recently in one of the more reputable journals in this country, "The Tribune." It is from a serving member of His Majesty's Forces who, until recently, was resident in Northern Ireland in the Forces, and has had, as he claims, ample opportunity of studying this matter at first hand. He concludes his letter as follows:
<q>It is true that the Nationalists favour the neutrality of Ireland, but can we blame them? After 21 years of political trickery and gangsterism, can we be surprised that there is no enthusiasm to defend imperialism? </q></p>

<p>With no sympathy for the hon.

<p>May I give one more short quotation from a soldier who has been serving in Northern Ireland?
<q>I am not exaggerating when I say that predominantly Catholic districts have developed into ghettos ruled by police tyranny and suppression. Young men known to hold non-Unionist views have been dragged from their homes at the dead of night and taken in armed vans to prison (not by full time police but by B. Specials) where they rot without charge with no prospect of trial and no communication with their families or legal help ",</q>
which is pretty well what the hon. Member for Shettleston said. I want to call attention to a particular incident in support of my claim, which happened quite recently. I do not support people dashing about with arms and shooting at policemen, but I want to call attention to the Belfast trial of the six young men who were sentenced to death on account of the shooting of a Belfast policeman. The point I wish to make deals simply with the official attitude of the Belfast Government in this matter. The background of that affair is the dreadful fact, as is indicated in the quotation that I have just read, that the Northern Ireland


Government are in the habit of sending armed police vans regularly into the Catholic working-class districts and beating up the Catholic workers without reason or rhyme. The method of selecting the jury shows the complete lack of fairness of the Northern Ireland Government. The empanelment of the jury was taken from 450 citizens. It was done in that way in order to prevent any Catholics sitting on the jury. There are over 100,000 Catholics in Belfast, but, astonishing to relate, not more than 50 were on the panel. The Government, as the names were called, objected to 39 members. I do not say that all were Catholics, but they would not have a single Catholic or woman on that jury. That means that those people who were supposed to be facing fair trial by jury were in fact tried by their enemies, people politically opposed to them. The Judge, in his summing up, said that but for the fact that the dead man was a policeman the verdict would be one of manslaughter; as he was a policeman it must be one of murder, though there was clearly no intent to kill. It is time this House sat up and took notice of what the Northern Parliament is doing. It is outrageous that that kind of thing should go on. In the end they hanged the man who, it was proved, did not kill the policeman. Some of the shots in the body came from that man's gun, but the fatal bullet did not fit the gun of the man who was hung.<br/>
It is time we took more interest in what is going on over there, because in my opinion and in that of others the Government are not fit to hold the position they do hold. The hon. Member for Moseley (Sir P. Hannon) suggested that an election would lead to more disorder, especially with American troops there, but why have an election? The matter can be dealt with in another way. In my view it would be to the advantage of everyone, North and South, and this country as well, if the Government of Northern Ireland were suspended, and, for that reason, I support the hon. Member for Shettleston in opposing the Clause.</p>
</speech>

<p>I desire to support my hon. Friend in his opposition to this Clause. I do not think this House should allow the Irish Parliament to be prolonged. My hon. Friend has given very good evidence that the opinion of most people in the Six Counties is in favour of a General Election and no

prolongation of Parliament. My hon. Friend urged that respect should be shown for the views of those who are in a minority in the Irish Parliament. The Nationalists and the Labour party are strongly of opinion against a prolongation of the Six Counties Parliament, and thiey desire a General Election.<br/>
My hon. Friend gave instances of the bad treatment that is being meted out to members of the minority in the Six Counties and the internment of the citizens of Northern Ireland without any trial. I remember that when I came into this Parliament things were being done in Northern Ireland that aroused tremendous discontent. In the West of Scotland and other parts of Britain there was strong criticism of the Ulster Government. We could get no opportunity because of the constitution to raise our protest against these happenings on the Floor of this House. That treatment is going en still and the people in Ireland and this House would not be justified in acceding to the request of the Government in Ulster to prolong their Parliament. There is one point that has evidently been misunderstood by spokesmen for the Ulster Government. They complain about the attack that was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Shettleston on the Six Counties Home Secretary, Sir Dawson Bates. The hon. Member did not make an attack on Sir Dawson Bates. What he did was to report the attack that was made upon him in the Stormount Parliament. He gave a report on what he heard in that Parliament of the charges made against the Heme Secretary. The statements about Sir Dawson Bates were made by Members of the Northern Ireland Parliament and not by the hon. Member for Shettleston.<br/>
There is one difficulty which I admit in connection with an election. That is the 1939 electoral roll. If, however, the people in the Six Counties are willing to waive that difficulty, if they are anxious for a General Election and are against the Government, as the by-elections seem to show, we should not allow a prolongation of their Parliament. The by-election results are a lot more significant than the hon. Member who gave an account of them would lead the Committee to suppose. They seem to show that the people who had formerly supported the Six Counties Government


are now overwhelmingly against them. If the people want a General Election, we should not be a party to allowing the Six Counties Government to avoid going to their constituents. The overwhelming majority desire to have the opportunity of expressing judgment on their Government. Everything that was said in regard to Belfast Corporation might be said with equal effect against the Six Counties Government. This House is not justified in continuing the life of the Northern Ireland Parliament against the overwhelming opinion of the people in the Six Counties.</p>

<p>When the Minister introduced this Bill he said in effect that it would never do to interfere with the Northern Ireland Government as Mr. Andrews would tell him to mind his own business. But he should have told Mr. Andrews when he was asking for a new lease of life for his Parliament that it was his business to get a Government that would bring about the greatest possible amount of unity in Northern Ireland. That was a big job. Through bringing about a greater measure of unity in Northern Ireland they would bring about a growing measure of unity between Northern and Southern Ireland, and that was a still bigger job. The Northern Ireland Government, however, have adopted the same attitude towards unity as the Prime Minister in his recent speech adopted towards unity of the mass movement of India. It is continually aggravating and worsening the situation. There are forces representing the Labour movement and other progressive sections in Northern Ireland, and if they were taken into the Government and a Government actually representing the people was instituted, a big change would take place in the situation.<br/>
One could dwell a long time on the terrible conditions that obtain there. There is absolute terror ruling in parts of Ireland. Nobody would encourage or justify the terroristic tactics of those who are so keen for Ireland but who are doing Ireland such considerable injury by pursuing a wrong policy. Nothing, however, can justify the conduct of the Andrews Government and the forces that are being used by that Government. Therefore, if the Minister is going to accept the responsibility that the sponsorship of this Bill

places on him, he must talk to the Andrews Government, he must let them know that they are doing a great disservice to this country and the cause of the democratic peoples if they maintain the divisions and the differences that continue to exist. If you read some of the Press, listen to some of the speeches and watch the things that are going on, you would think that the Andrews Government and many of those associated with them were living in the old evil days when every method of aggravating and tormenting political and religious opponents and exacerbating differences were adopted. I remember what used to happen in the old days when there were people from this House and the House of Lords stirring up sedition and carrying on subversive agitation. I worked in Belfast at the time of the worst conflicts over there. There are people in this House and in the Andrews Government who are living in that period.<br/>
They do not understand the situation that confronts the people of Ireland, the people of this country and the people of Europe. The Minister has got to make it clear to the Andrews' Government that this one-party Government&#x2014;and that a party of a most reactionary character&#x2014;cannot be allowed to maintain itself there. It is all very well for those sitting on the Front Bench to smile, but the people in Northern Ireland cannot smile. The suffering there is terrible.</p>

<p>I am all in favour of one-party government when there is only one class; that is something that justifies


itself, but where there is a mixed community and there is one-party government by a party of the most reactionary character, it constitutes a danger to this country at the present time. That is something which the Minister cannot smile away. He has a responsibility. Will he accept that responsibility? He has often come before Parliament giving the impression that he was prepared to play the strong man and assert his full power in this, that or the other direction.<br/>
Here is one direction where, if ever, there is need for asserting authority. He has authority and it should be asserted. Let us get the best forces in the North of Ireland drawn into the Government from the Labour party and from other progressive associations for the purpose of bringing about what everyone ought to desire, the greatest measure of unity between Falls Road and Shankill Road. That is a big job and it needs a big Government to do it. If we can get a movement that will end the disruption, a movement towards a unity between the Falls Road and the Shankill Road, we shall have travelled far towards getting unity between the North and the South of Ireland. Is the Minister prepared to do something to bring about that desirable end? If so, he will let the Andrews Government know that they must make big and broad changes in the control and direction of affairs in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>I do not see that that is any reason why there should have been any differentiation between the hon. Member for Shettleston and himself, but there has been a differentiation. The words in which he expressed himself are those which have frequently been given expression to by those who are prepared at all times to condemn Northern Ireland. The hon. Member for Shettleston has said that the Northern Ireland Government is behaving in an abominable manner to the minority there. I should like him to tell me where Northern Ireland has misused the powers given to it by the Act of 1930 and has in any way hindered the minority from living their ordinary lives, performing their ordinary duties and making themselves useful public citizens in every way. The "Manchester Guardian" has been quoted to-day. It is a paper that was always against Ulster and always in favour of Southern Ireland. Such letters and speeches as the hon. Member has quoted have frequently appeared in the "Manchester Guardian." Just as frequently we have done our utmost to get the "Manchester Guardian" to publish denials of what has been said, but, for what reason I do not know, the "Manchester Guardian" has refused again and again to publish those replies. There is no secret about that, because it is common knowledge with us in Ireland. It is the same with a large section of the Press in England. When we try to get our view put before the British people publication of it is refused.</p>

He has had the opportunity time and time again to put his case before the British authorities just as have those who are interned in Northern Ireland, but they have all refused to recognise the Northern Irish Government.

<p>This is an important point.

<p>That is a matter of opinion. The Northern Ireland Government have had the greatest difficulty in carrying on just because of these matters referred to by the hon. Member for Ipswich, in regard to Falls Road. The police know very well where ammunition is to be found if they visit those districts.</p>

<p>The hon. Member shows his ignorance about conditions in Northern Ireland. The ordinary police visit those districts regularly. During this Debate, the Government of Northern Ireland have been made little of, in some of the speeches. I should like the hon. Member for Shettleston to tell us how he would get over the difficulty of the register. There would only be a 25 per cent. toll, and there is no remedy for it at the moment.</p>

<p>I do not know what the hon. Member's experience is. It comes to this, that we have made up our minds that as long as the war continues and the Government decide that there shall be no election here, we shall act accordingly. We have done our utmost as a Government and a people for the prosecution of the war, but there are people in Ireland, and in Northern Ireland particularly, who want the defeat of England and who are doing their utmost to bring about that defeat. It is those people who are causing the whole of the trouble, and hon. Members are assisting them by making some of the speeches to-day. I hope that the Motion will be approved by a large majority, to show to Northern Ireland that they have friends here v/ho will support them in their endeavours to stick to the British Government.</p>

<p>I think that the Committee are nearly ready to come to a decision on the Amendment. We have listened to a long Debate, a good deal of which concerned the domestic affairs of Northern Ireland. I confess I


always find it more difficult to reply to a discussion on a question when no comprehensible arguments have been put forward in support of it. Although this appears to be a big day in the annals of the Independent Labour Party, and a three-line whip has evidently been issued, and the attendance of the party has no doubt been such as to earn encomiums from all quarters of the House, yet I have not heard from them any argument that appeals to any logical sense. The legislation which we propose as regards Northern Ireland is purely permissive in character. Nothing that we do to-day can ensure that there is no election in Northern Ireland for a period of 18 months. The question of holding or not holding a General Election in Northern Ireland will fall to be decided by the proper constitutional procedure, which is similar in Northern Ireland to the procedure here. So far as I can make out, the only reason adduced by the opponents of the Motion to approve Clause 2 is that they dislike the present Government of Northern Ireland. That is, in effect, what all their arguments boil down to.</p>

<p>The hon. Member sympathises with all the Opposition parties in Northern Ireland, and he" therefore presumably dislikes the Northern Ireland Government. Why he should imagine that, if a General Election is forced upon Northern Ireland in March next by the omission of Clause 2 from the Bill, there will be a Government in Northern Ireland which he will like better than the present one, I cannot understand. In election after election a Unionist Government has been returned in Northern Ireland. The hon. Member, in his Second Reading speech last week on the Bill, astonished me by the arguments he adduced in favour of not holding a General Election in this country and in favour of holding one in Northern Ireland. His main argument against holding a General Election here was that, in war-time, minority

parties might easily be swept out of existence in the avalanche of the General Election, and why he should therefore assume that a General Election, if one were to be held in Northern Ireland, would be bound to redound to the advantage of the Opposition parties, I really cannot understand.</p>

<p>At no time in my speech did I oppose the holding of a General Election in Great Britain. What I did say was that the people of this country were more behind the Government of this country than the people of Northern Ireland were behind their Government, and I said "hat because of that, if it was intended to hold an election in this country, certain preparations, which I enumerated, were essential for the holding of that election and that until those conditions could be met the holding of an election would be a farce.</p>

<p>The hon. Member says he did not speak against the holding of an election in this country. If he will look at the third paragraph of his speech in the OFFICIAL REPORT, he will find that he said:
<q>Are we to have a 'coupon election' in order that the Government may get rid of a few difficult Members in the House?" [OFFICIAL REPORT, 30th September, 1942; col. 842, Vol. 383.]</q>
He went on to show very good reasons why we should not have an election to get rid of the hon. Member and the other Members of the Independent Labour Party. On that point I agree that it would be a pity if some of the more picturesque Members of this House were to be swept away in the course of a war-time election. The hon. Member for Moseley (Sir P. Hannon), who has had much longer Parliamentary experience than I have, and who made an interesting speech, said that the question which we had to settle was whether it would be wise to have an election in Ulster early next year. I think even that is stating the point which the Committee has to settle rather too narrowly. What in effect we have to settle to-day is whether, having established a Parliament in Northern Ireland we should extend to that Parliament the same powers of prolonging its maximum duration as we have taken for ourselves over here already on three separate occasions. I cannot see the slightest argument in favour of our interfering with the internal


affairs of Northern Ireland and saying to them, "Although we are free to decide whether an election shall take place here or not, you in Northern Ireland must have an election, whether you like it or not in March next year." Having established the Parliament of Northern Ireland I</p>

<p>I regret to detain the House longer on this Bill. I do not think I would have attempted to do so if I had realised, as I should, how very harmonious Irish matters always are. I speak as one who among many have frequently been the subject of gibes both in this House and in the Press because we came here under a party truce. I myself came here only 1&#x00BE; years ago. I make no apologies for that and I do not think I have been altogether a rubber stamp member we have heard so much about. For many times, like the hon. and gallant Member for Preston (Captain R. Churchill) I was borne stricken from many a blood-stained field because at one time I represented a lost cause. I ask Members to examine the records of their own elections in 1935, and many will find that they came to this House on a minority vote. In that respect, I do not believe that I could be regarded as exceptional in this Parliament, although that allegation is always made against people like myself. I think that there are several reasons why a General Election should not be held at the present time. People have constantly said that it would be impossible on the present Register. A great deal has been made of the fact that the Register is completely out of date, and that in many cases probably it does not represent 40 per cent. of the electorate. But people who have objected to an election on that Register have said that there is another way, and that an election could easily be held on a ration-card or an identity-card vote. Advocates of a General Election who have been here even a shorter time than I have, have said that this would be a simple matter. For several reasons, I do not think that that would be the case. I think they have for

gotten that they would have to determine the age of the voter. Many young people between 18 and 21 might claim the vote, and a considerable amount of machinery would have to be set up to determine whether those people were 21 or not. It is said that they would only have to bring a birth certificate but this would add considerably to the difficulties.</p>

<p>My attitude, I think, is clear. If you rule me out of Order, Mr Deputy-Speaker, I shall have to give up my speech. The Government have asked that this Bill should pass through this Parliament, and unless it does there will be a General Election. I am trying to show the difficulties there would be if there was a General Election at the present time, and, therefore, why this Bill should pass through its Third Reading stage.</p>

<p>I am aware that on the Third Reading the subject of Debate is very much circumscribed, but I want to keep within your Ruling, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, as far as I possibly can. There are one or two points I should very much like to be allowed to make. The Home Secretary, in introducing the Bill on Second Reading, was very emphatic in


pointing out why it has been necessary to insert a second Clause relating to Ulster, because in the Act of 1920 it is laid down that there must be a General Election in Northern Ireland every five years. Therefore, when the question is asked whether the House of Commons and Senate and Governor of Northern Ireland had any power to prolong their own existence, the answer is, "No, they are bound by the Act of 1920, and there must be a General Election every five years." We have to come to this House of Commons and ask it to pass an over-riding Bill which will suspend temporarily the Act of 1920 and enable us to postpone having a General Election in the same way as you will postpone having a General Election for your House of Commons over here. You are to have your Parliament prolonged, and we are asking that our House of Commons in Northern Ireland will be able to do the same.<br/>
It is not often that I listen to the orators in Hyde Park, but two Sundays ago I heard a very eloquent oration. A gentleman got up and said that the Parliament in Northern Ireland was unrepresentative, because it had abolished proportional representation. If they were to have proportional representation at this moment, they would immediately abolish "Partition" and join with Eire. That argument has been taken up already by various speakers. Nationalist Members of the House of Commons and Senate have sent a petition to the Cabinet.</p>

<p>I am afraid that the question of arguments which may be taken up by Nationalist Members and others do not come within the Third Reading of this Bill, which merely declares that the Northern Ireland Parliament shall be extended, and the hon. Member must stick to the Third Reading.</p>

<p>Very well, I will take another opportunity of replying, but I think that the argument I am going to make now is strictly relevant, Mr. Deputy-Speaker. Speaking from my own experience, as the representative of the graduates of Northern Ireland, that is the <i>&#x00E9;lite</i> of Ulster, and as Ulster forms the <i>&#x00E9;lite</i> of the United Kingdom, therefore my constituents are the very <i>&#x00E9;lite</i> of the whole United Kingdom. A very large proportion of these have voluntarily joined His Majesty's Forces. You refused to apply

conscription to Northern Ireland in spite of the unanimous wish of Ulster Members here, and these gentlemen have volunteered.</p>

<p>Were you to propose a General Election at the present moment, obviously it would give a false representation of the opinion of Northern Ireland. I am speaking of my own experience and of my own constituents who enlisted in their thousands. It is true that there has not been for many years a contested election in the university for representation at Westminster, but these graduates also have a vote for their county or the City of Belfast or wherever they happen to reside, and they would be prevented from exercising their franchise. Therefore&#x2014;and I think I am within the bounds of the Third Reading&#x2014;it is absolutely essential in the interests of fair play that these electors should record their votes and that you should not hold a General Election at the present time, but when they come back, have your election and let these noble electors, the very cream of the country, vote and elect their representatives to this House of Commons as well as to the House of Commons of Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>I rise to pronounce the benediction. It has been worth while to have this discussion if only to listen to the speech of the hon. Member for the Queen's University of Belfast


(Professor Savory). It shows that there is some value at any rate in university representation, though I have never believed very much in that before. I hope that the Debate will continue on a note of conciliation, because the vast majority of the Members of this House realise that it would be suicidal to have an election. What we have really decided is to give the right to Ulster to say whether it wants an election, and that is self-determination in its broadest aspect. I will not detain the House for another minute, except to say that I wish that these people could compose their differences in the same decent way that we people in Yorkshire do ours.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 1, line 10, to leave out "December," and to insert "March."<br/>
My purpose in moving this Amendment is to draw attention to the matter of filling casual vacancies in local councils. This matter was discussed on the Second Reading, and attention was drawn to the fact that whereas casual vacancies for this House are filled by election, those for local councils are not. The object of this Amendment is to substitute the month of March for December, so as to give the Government time to consider whether a better method of filling vacancies should come into being in place of the existing method. At present local councils are closed corporations, and that is bad for&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>No, Colonel Clifton Brown. Although it is not possible to extend further the argument which was developed on the Second Reading, I hope the Home Secretary will give sympathetic consideration to the argument that it is desirable


that this Bill should be extended only to March in order that the whole question may be given more consideration by the Government than it has received up to the present. The impression generally is that in their original intention the Government did not envisage the war going on so long or that the consequences would be so serious. When they propose to extend the present procedure for another year, I hope they will be willing to give further consideration to this matter. Although they are perhaps not able to give a definite pledge now, I ask that on a further occasion when they extend this Bill this question should receive the Government's sympathetic consideration.</p>

<p>I appreciate your Ruling, Colonel Clifton Brown, that one cannot go into the specific manner in which one wants this Bill altered, when it comes to an end, and we therefore have to make it plain that we object to its remaining in operation as it is now.

<p>If you rule that way, Colonel Clifton Brown, then I cannot elaborate that point any further, but I want to say this: I feel sure that the Home Secretary will be influenced in this matter by the volume of Parliamentary opinion on the subject. If he finds that a large number of Members, belonging to all parties, hold strongly that some effort should be made to alter the system we have been working on up to the present time, I feel sure that he, as a good democrat, will bow to such opinion and will consider between now and when the Bill comes forward again the possibility of introducing Amendments. During the last two years my voice has been almost a lone voice in opposing this Measure. But it is so no longer. A considerable volume of opinion has been expressed on the lines of what my hon. Friend the Member for Cheltenham (Mr. Lipson) and I have said to-day.

It was so, for instance, on the Second Reading, and I have reason to believe that others are prepared to take the same view. I do not expect my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary, because two or three people express their views strongly on this subject, to take any very serious steps, but if he finds that a representative body of Members in all parts of the House do so, I believe it would be his desire to look into the matter in a much more serious way than has been done up to now. I am precluded from using some of the arguments put forward on the Second Reading, but I am sure he will bear them in mind&#x2014;he knows them well&#x2014;and will take them as said although they have not actually been said on this occasion.</p>

<p>I wish to support the Amendment, but I do so for different reasons from those stated by the hon. Members who moved and seconded it. I support it because I have contested six municipal elections in November. Whenever there may be municipal elections&#x2014;I hope it may be in 1943&#x2014;I trust that, considering the amount of illness caused by having elections in November, the elections will not be fixed either for December or the old evil day of 1st November. I intervene simply to suggest that when alterations are being made in the election law in the dates of elections, consideration should be given to the question of whether, just as the month of March is stipulated for county council and similar elections, common sense should not intervene and reign supreme and March be fixed for the holding of municipal elections.</p>

<p>Within the limits of your Ruling, Colonel Clifton Brown, clearly it would not be in Order to refer to the arguments which a number of us would have liked to put before the Committee. I hope the Home Secretary will consider sympathetically the suggestions that have been made and that, if he is not able to accept the Amendment, he will at any rate indicate that the Government will give consideration to some alternative methods of dealing with this matter. If the Bill is passed in its present form, without the Amendment, it will mean that the whole machinery of local democratic Government will continue in suspense. That is something which was perfectly justifiable for one year or even for two


years, but it cannot be justified as a continuous process going on year after year. If the Amendment is not accepted, it will mean that interest in local affairs will tend to die out among a large section of the electorate and a small group of people will have complete control and will be able to co-opt members of local government bodies without any consultation with the wider body of electors. That is not good for the continuance of democracy. It is not a party matter, because in many parts of the country, particularly in the smaller localities, party considerations do not enter into the election of the local authorities". It is very important that the electors should continue to be interested and should have an opportunity of expressing their interest. If the machinery of election is in suspense for a long period, this will have a deleterious effect on the whole life of the community. Therefore, I hope the Home Secretary will consider seriously the plea that has been made to him.</p>

<p>I hope my right hon.

<p>I realise that I am entirely lacking in the necessary skill to give the Committee, within the terms of your Ruling, Colonel Clifton Brown, the reasons I support the Amendment. It must be clear, however, that there is a feeling of disquiet in the country about this matter. At the present time the associations of local government bodies are considering the form of postwar local government, and it is true to say that in almost every case there is emphasis upon the necessity for the maintenance of the democratic system. The County Councils Association, which is a very important body, is considering the question of post-war local government, and as the discussion takes place, it is clear that the desire is that we should not depart to any extent from the democratic principle. During the war we are departing from it. We cannot help doing so. We cannot run the war by committees. I want to express the view that the present method of appointing local government members cannot be considered as truly reflecting the mind of the people. There are certain aspects of the case which ought to be considered. The Home Secretary will know of some instances where the agreement upon which the original Act was based has not been kept. When the original Act was passed, there was agreement in the House that parties would be entitled to co-opt their members and that if a member of a party died or resigned, that party would be able to nominate a successor. That agreement has not been faithfully kept.</p>

<p>Hon. Members have been so reasonable and friendly in their observations that I find it difficult not to surrender completely forthwith. I am in some difficulty in replying, because I also must mind my step and not in any way conflict with the Ruling that you, Colonel Clifton Brown, have given. I am in the position that I know almost exactly the arguments which the hon. Members for Cheltenham (Mr. Lipson), East Wolverhampton (Mr. Mander) and others would have put up if they had been able, and I know the full, complete and devastating answer to all those arguments, which I think the Committee would accept as conclusive. Nevertheless, we are dealing with a Bill which is to renew an Act of Parliament, and we cannot get to the point of amending the Act itself. I cannot get into the field of argument which hon. Members would have put before the Committee had it been possible, but I assure them there there are very strong arguments the other way, which I am sure they would have taken serious notice of.<br/>
It is the case that Parliament dealt with itself differently from the way it dealt with local authorities. In the original Act we decided that no local elections should be held, and that was quite conclusive, whereas Parliament was prolonged for a year, without, of course, any prejudice to the right of the Prime Minister to advise His Majesty to dissolve Parliament, and therefore neither a General Election nor a by-election was prohibited in the case of Parliament. But, wisely or unwisely, Parliament dealt differently with local authorities and

prescribed that there should be no election of any sort while the Act was in force. I think it would be inconvenient to accept an Amendment to limit the duration of the Bill to six months. If Parliament is legislating at all it ought not really in other than very exceptional circumstances to legislate for less than 12 months, which is a convenient temporary period; I do not think it would be reasonable to cut that down by half, but, in considering the Bill next year, assuming that I am still at the Home Office, I will instruct my officers that the attention of the Home Secretary shall be drawn to the arguments which have been put forward in the House and elsewhere as to any perfections or imperfections in this legislation.</p>

<p>I will give instructions that, when the Bill is being prepared next year, all the points that have been raised shall be put before the Home Secretary. I do not wish to deceive the Committee by leading them to think it probable that the kind of alteration which some Members have in mind is likely to commend itself to the Home Secretary, because there are very strong arguments the other way, and I should think it is about 100 to 1 against any alterations being made. Nevertheless, certain points have been brought to my attention, both in the House and in Committee and privately by the hon. Members for Cheltenham and East Wolverhampton, and I will see that they are given consideration so that they can be weighed up.</p>

<p>Of course, there is nothing magic in choosing the month of December, but actually in practice it means that there will not be an election till 1944, because the practice is to have local elections in November, It would be more appropriate to select some other month, so that if, by good luck, we should have a victory next summer, we should have our elections in November, 1943.</p>

<p>There are intelligent reasons for November.

<p>I wonder whether the Secretary of State could make a little clearer the effect of this Clause. We all feel regret that there should be at least the appearance of a withdrawal of a right which might be of immense importance to the individuals concerned. I am sure that my right hon. Friend desires to see that the review which will be held in all

cases where the capital sentence is inflicted under the Emergency Provisions should be considerate and impartial. Is there no way in which there could be a similar method of appeal in India to that of asking for leave to appeal to the Privy Council. If such provision were made there would not be a long delay but there would be a guarantee of the same rights of leave; to appeal as apply in other cases.</p>

<p>I imagine so, yes. It does not exclude any petition on grounds of mercy or compassion in the individual case. That will go to the Viceroy as it always has done. What it does exclude is a practice which has grown up in certain parts of India over a number of years of putting in an application for special leave from the Privy Council to make an appeal. Of some 570 applications which have been made during the last six years only five were allowed, and in the case of only two of these did the Privy Council find that there was a case for an appeal and granted it. The thing has become even in the ordinary course of law in India something in the nature of a scandal. We did not think it right at a time like this to attempt to introduce changes in the ordinary law. On the other hand, in the case of serious disturbance with the enemy actually in the immediate neighbourhood it was thought to be very undesirable that sentences of death, imposed largely for their deterrent character, should have to wait for three or four months for their certain confirmation. The present Clause is provided to deal only with an emergency situation.</p>

<p>We ought to express our thankfulness that at such a time the Government of India and the Secretary of State have made this provision for a class of people who cannot help themselves, protecting them from the power of the usurer and the ensuing alienation of their land, which has long been a curse in many parts of India among the poorest sections of the population.

<p>I entirely agree with the hon. Member's comment. Some of the aboriginal tribes as well as the peasants of provinces like the Punjab require to be protected against the money-lender. A recent decision in the courts indicated that the drafting of the original Clause in this connection was a little too narrow, and so for "mortgage or sale" the word "dispositions" has been substituted, and similarly the words "agricultural, land" have been redefined in conection with legislation which covers, for instance, the sites of farm buildings and water rights. It is true, as the hon. Member pointed out, that in this matter we are protecting many of the most helpless elements in the Indian community, but I would also point out that we are incidentally protecting, in the Punjab at any rate, those classes of peasants, both Moslem and Hindu, who provide between them very nearly half the Indian Army, and who would certainly be very much disturbed if they felt that the rights which they have hitherto enjoyed had in any manner been put in question.</p>

<p>I want to raise upon this Motion for the Adjournment the question of the report recently issued by the Bank for International Settlements and our present relationship with that body. A number of Members, including myself, asked some Questions to the Chancellor of the Exchequer on 1st October, and the Chancellor gave a full and frank answer. As far as that answer went it was reassuring. It was at least satisfactory to know that our directors and representatives on the Bank for International Settlements have not had any contact or negotiations with the German directors on that body. But there were quite a number of points which it was quite impossible to deal with by Questions and answers, and I raise the matter to-day so that many fears and suspicions which are in our minds about the Bank may be dealt with when there is more time and when the Chancellor will have ample opportunity to give a fuller answer to the Questions we wish to put to him.<br/>
We frankly have suspicions about the Bank for International Settlements, because of the history of the Bank in the past and in particular in view of the behaviour of that Bank at the time when the German army occupied Prague. The Bank was then instrumental in handing over to Germany &#x00A3;6,000,000 of Czech gold, which it had deposited with the Bank of England


in this country. The House will remember the very strong protests that were made from all quarters on that occasion. The House will probably also remember that it was only possible to drag the truth about these proceedings from the Government at that time with very great difficulty. Every effort seemed to be made to hide that transaction from us. Therefore I- suggest that it is an obligation on the House to-day to consider very carefully the recent activities of the Bank for International Settlements, and to consider whether in present circumstances we are wise to remain associated with that organisation.<br/>
The history of the annual report recently issued by the Bank is rather peculiar. Apparently this report, a very long document running into over 200 pages, was first presented to a general meeting of shareholders&#x2014;I do not know of whom they consisted&#x2014;on 8th June of this year, by the President of the Bank, an American named Mr. McKittrick. On 4th September, there was a Press conference in Basle, where the Bank is situated, and the contents of the report were given to the Press. On 5th September, the German Press reported some extracts from this report, obviously with great glee, because the extracts presumably confirmed many of the desires of the German Government. Anyhow, we can be certain that the Press would not have given such prominence to this report of the Banks for International Settlements unless it had been favourable in German eyes.<br/>
On 17th September some of the German papers arrived in this country, and the reports appearing in those papers were copied by some of the financial journals here. Considerable public interest was aroused, but it was not until 1st October that the matter was raised here in Parliament. We were then assured by the Chancellor of the Exchequer that nobody in this country was in possession of this report and that neither the Treasury nor the Bank of England knew anything about it. Afterwards, the Chancellor of the Exchequer was good enough to say that there had been a mistake and that actually the Ministry of Economic Warfare had a copy. Up to that time, 1st October, the Bank of England, which is closely associated with the Bank for International Settlements, had apparently no knowledge of this very important report, and, as far as

we know, had taken no steps to obtain a copy. The House will be aware that on the directorate of the Bank for International Settlements sit Mr. Montagu Norman and Sir Otto Niemeyer, although these gentlemen, we are told, have not recently taken any part in the activities of the Bank.<br/>
The first question one would like to ask is how it is that, after all that period, and a fortnight after the Press had carried at some length extracts from the report, the Bank of England had, on 1st October, apparently no knowledge at all of the report. One would like to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether the Bank had taken any steps to obtain the report or to make any investigations to see what was being said in the name of the Bank for International Settlements, and, presumably, in the name of the directors of that Bank. If the answer is that the Bank of England took no steps, were not interested, in the report of the Bank for International Settlements, I suggest that it is an example of public irresponsibility which is positively staggering. But our real concern in this matter is this: This survey&#x2014;and the report is very largely a survey of international affairs&#x2014;has been issued by an organisation on which this country is represented by very distinguished bankers but which, in fact, is under the control of the Nazis That is obviously a very dangerous and even serious situation.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in reply to a Question by the hon. Member for Stoke (Mr. Ellis Smith) the other day, said that the Bank for International Settlements was only under the control of Germany to the extent of 50 per cent. I cannot understand where he got that figure, because to-day he answered a Question put to him by the hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Stokes) and gave the names of all the central banks for various European countries who own the shares, and the number of shares owned by each bank. It is perfectly clear from that answer to-day that over 70 per cent. of the shares under the control of the central banks are in the possession of the Germans, either directly or indirectly, because these banks have come under the domination of Germany during the last two years. So this bank is quite definitely under the control of the German Government.<br/>
Moreover, I suggest to Members that they should look for a moment at the directorship of the bank. There are 16 directors; two of them are neutral, two of them are British, and 12 of them are either German, or represent countries under German domination. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has told us that this report has been drawn up by the president of the bank, Mr. McKittrick. I would be the last person to suggest that Mr. McKittrick is in any way biassed or that his integrity is not absolute, but I suggest that a report of such great length and complexity could not be drawn up by one man. The president of the bank may well be the sole person who takes responsibility in the matter, but in point of fact it must have been prepared by many other people in the bank. In view of the fact that some of the contents have been welcomed so very much as useful propaganda by the German Government, one has a right to wonder whether the manager of the bank, a German, Herr Hechler, did not take a prominent part, at any rate, in drawing up some parts of that report.<br/>
There are two parts of that report which have been pounced upon by the Germans to help them in Germany m their propaganda, and which have been quoted at very great length in their papers, and which I submit to the House are so objectionable that they provide very strong reasons for us to dissociate ourselves entirely, not only from the report, but from the Bank which produced it, and which may produce more, and even more unhelpful reports in the future. The first item pounced upon by the German Press for publication was that dealing with interest rates. The German Government have boasted that they have been able to reduce interest rates in their country. Recently they have been forced to increase them, because they found very great difficulty in getting the public to lend the Government money. They have been forced to increase their interest rates, and it has been very awkward. They have had great difficulty in explaining this necessity. It is therefore natural that they are quite delighted when the Bank for International Settlements comes along with a report which puts forward theoretical justification for the raising of interest rates, based on facts which, I submit, are quite untrue. The report of the Bank for

International Settlements suggested, on pages 15 and 16, that there is a worldwide movement for increasing interest rates in almost every country. I am sure that that is not true; but, naturally, the German Press hit on this, and carry this story as a justification for the increase of interest rates in Germany.<br/>
The second thing is even more serious. The report lays down principles for a post-war economic system. The House will agree that it is very dangerous for a body with which we are nominally associated&#x2014;and, in the eyes of the world, rather closely associated&#x2014;to issue a report laying down post-war schemes of reconstruction. The Bank for International Settlements is known throughout the world for, not only very close Nazi associations, but its Nazi domination. We have our directors still on the board, and that bank produces in its annual report proposals for setting up the economic basis of a new Europe after the war. That, I think, is very serious. It suggests to the German people that there is some form of collaboration between the Nazis and the Allies whom they are supposed to be fighting. It may give them hope of a peace arrangement between some elements in this country and in Germany. The facts can be easily distorted by the German propaganda machine so as to make the people of Germany believe that somewhere in this country appeasement still lives&#x2014;if not in this country generally, in banking circles. Even more harmful might be the effect on public opinion in the rest of the world, if people see this body issuing such proposals and no action taken by the British Government. I hope that there will be some action by the Government to dissociate themselves completely and effectively from this body, seeing that the report and the action taken by the Bank must be quite out of accord with the general attitude of the peoples of the United Nations, who are determined to fight the enemy and not to associate with the enemy in any possible way, least of all in drawing up at the present stage of the war even the outline of a scheme for economic agreement after the war.<br/>
I think that something more than a public disclaimer is necessary. That disclaimer has been made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who said that we were not responsible for the report, and that it had been issued solely on the responsibility of the American President of the


Bank. A far more convincing gesture is necessary to show our emphatic disapproval, not only of the document, but of the Bank for International Settlements in producing the document in this way. I do not know what good grounds we can have for associating any longer with the Bank for International Settlements. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said the other day that there were good national reasons. What in the world are those good national reasons? Have we got large moneys invested with the Bank, and are we likely to lose them if we dissociate ourselves from it? The Chancellor answered that question to-day, when he said that the British Government have deposited with the Bank 26,500,000 reichsmarks, which is a little over &#x00A3;2,000,000, and that no interest, is paid on that amount. If that money is to-day in the hands of the Axis nations, whether we dissociate ourselves with the Bank or not it will remain in the hands of the Axis nations, and nothing will bring it back to us.<br/>
If that money is not in the hands of the Axis nations, why should we not dissociate ourselves from the Bank? The money is presumably still in our hands. Unless the Chancellor of the Exchequer is able to give us something more concrete than he has in the past, there does not appear to be any financial reason why we should remain associated with the Bank for International Settlements. If our object is merely to get reports from the Bank of what is happening, we can leave our interests very well in the hands, as I suggested the other day, of the Swiss banks. Unless the right hon. Gentleman is able to suggest some justifiable reason, which he has not been able to do up to now, why we should maintain directors on the Bank and why we should have people on the managerial staff of the Bank, the proper thing to do is to dissociate ourselves from the Bank as quickly as possible. We get the worst of both worlds. We are associating with the Bank in the public mind but apparently are not responsible for any of its actions or of the actions of the President of the Bank. What a ridiculous position.<br/>
The difficulties that exist to-day may become worse. There may be other reports issued by the Bank. We do not know what it is going to do in the future. We have Montagu Norman and Otto Niemeyer on the Bank nominally as

directors but apparently not responsible for anything. The only satisfactory conclusion of this problem is a clean break with the Bank, and I very much hope that the Chancellor of the Exchequer will to-day tell us that he is going to do that or will give very good reasons why not. If we made such a break, it would provide irrefutable evidence to the world of our attitude to the report which has been issued, and no one could possibly accuse us of talking behind anybody's back to the Germans. Moreover, if we had this break with the Bank and dissociated ourselves entirely from it, I am sure that such an action would be popular in this country with the memory of the Czech-gold affair and the shameful manner in which the Bank for International Settlements at that time acted as Hitler's agent to get Czech gold from London back to Germany. I am certain that if we dissociated ourselves completely from the Bank, it would meet with the whole-hearted support of the people of this country.</p>

<p>The House has listened with great interest to my hon.

<p>My hon. Friend says that it was the history of the Bank that had aroused his suspicions, but when one looks into the history of the Bank, it is quite clear that its original parenthood, at any rate, was unimpeachable. It came into existence as the child of most respectable parents. It was one of the instruments for facilitating international transfer under the Young plan, which, the House will recollect, enjoyed the approbation of the late Mr. Philip Snowden and the Labour Government of that time. So that if it fell away from the paths of righteousness, the falling away took place at a later stage in its history. My hon. Friend's argument really proceeds upon the publication of the last report of the Bank. It is not so much anything which the Bank has done or failed to do to which he objects; it is to certain passages which have found their way into the Bank's


annual report and which have apparently aroused certain approbation among newspaper men in enemy countries. My hon. Friend says that having regard to the history of this institution and to the fact that it has now seen fit to put into its report something which has excited the praise of enemy journalists, we ought forthwith to withdraw from it and have no more to do with it.<br/>
If my hon. Friend had been able to come to the House and point to something which this institution had done which was of an unneutral character, or which was directly or indirectly prejudicial to any British or pro-Allied interest, I think we should all have known very well what to do. But my hon. Friend's argument does not go anything like so far as that. I have no doubt he has made most exhaustive inquiries into the recent activities of the Bank for International Settlements. If there had been anything unsavoury in what the Bank has been doing, no doubt he would have been able to come to the House and tell us all about it in the greatest possible detail. But one of the most significant things about his speech is that the only criticism he has been able to direct against the Bank is based solely upon two passages in its annual report.<br/>
That report, I understand, was the work of its American chairman. Before we take the drastic step of withdrawing altogether from this Bank, which, at the outset, was such a useful and innocuous institution, the House will require some rather stronger case for doing so than my hon. Friend has been able to put forward. I can see no reason why we should withdraw our representatives from the Bank for International Settlements, but I can see several good reasons why they should remain there.<br/>
The first reason is this: My hon. Friend, as he says, is very suspicious of the Bank. He says, "Here is an institution which is capable of mischief." That may be perfectly true, although he has not been able to point out any particular act of mischief of which the Bank has been guilty. He says," Here is something that may be used to our prejudice." If that is the case while the composition of the Board of Directors of the Bank is as it is at present, how much more would it be the case if we withdrew our representatives and left this institution entirely

in the hands of our enemies. Surely, that would mean that we should be simply running away from it and, for what it is worth, handing it over to those who would undoubtedly use it for the purposes of the Axis countries.</p>

<p>I am not assuming that they have taken part in the transactions of the Bank. What I am suggesting is that their presence on the Board is a restraining influence on the other members of the Board, whether they actually take part in the business of the Bank or not. Suppose that we withdraw our representatives, are we going to leave the American President of the Bank alone, surrounded by the representatives of the Axis countries? My hon. Friend was not able to tell us what is the position of the United States Government in the matter. I assume that the President of the Bank is not a representative of the United States Government, but we do not know whether they are willing, and, indeed, we do not know whether they are able, to withdraw him from his present position. Until we know a little more about that, I suggest that it would be very unwise for us to withdraw our representatives, even if they are only sleeping partners, and leave the American President of the Bank alone surrounded by the representatives of enemy countries and countries which are at present controlled by the enemy. This Bank for International Settlements was, at its birth, a highly respectable and highly useful international institution.</p>

<p>The hon. Member says that no bank can be. As I listened to the hon. Member for North Lambeth (Mr. G. Strauss), I felt that if this institution had been called by some other name and had not been called a bank, it might have been less likely to arouse the suspicions of some of my hon. Friends. At any rate, this Bank started its life as a very useful instrument for international transactions. Some of us hope that the time will come when its usefulness will return, and when that time comes it will, I think, be a great advantage that we should have an institution of that sort, available for all those


transactions which we may require it to carry out when the war is over. It would be a pity now if we were to do something which would destroy altogether the international character which it still possesses by reason of the fact that our representatives, in name at least, are still members of the Board. We should do much better to allow this particular sleeping dog to continue in his present harmless slumbers, in the hope that at some future time he may be aroused again to a useful period of wakefulness.</p>

<p>I always regard with reluctance any proposal to do away with an existing international organisation. I quite agree as to the highly respectable parentage of this body, but even criminals in the early years of their lives are often very estimable persons, and the more one looks into the history of this organisation the more doubtful one becomes whether it is wise for us to remain associated with it. It seems to me that the Bank for International Settlements does not realise that there is a war on. They are acting as if things were exactly as they were in pre-war days. The chairman is the national of a country at war with Germany, and the manager is a German. They are nationals at war with each other, but they are sitting there day after day co-operating in the management of the Bank. It is a nauseating spectacle to my mind. There are British representatives, but the attitude of those who defend the Bank is that they take no part whatever in it. They are doing no harm and they have no influence; they are wholly detached. But my hon. and learned Friend has told me quite a different story. He says the prestige and distinction of the British representatives are so great that though they are in this country and are not in contact with the Bank, they put the fear of God into the President and those who are operating it from day to day. It is clear, therefore, that they are playing their part and certainly exercising influence of some kind.</p>

<p>My argument was that they may have a restraining influence on the other members, and I pointed that out in conjunction with the fact that the hon. Member for North Lambeth (Mr. G. Strauss) has not been able to point to any unneutral act that the Bank has committed so far.</p>

<p>I may have put it in more picturesque and stronger language, but it is really the same thing. The hon. Member cannot see anything that the Bank has done wrong, but surely the mere fact that you have a United States citizen, our ally, sitting and working alongside a German is quite enough to do a great deal of harm to the Allied cause throughout the world and to arouse the suspicion that we cannot be terribly serious about certain aspects of the war if we permit a thing of that kind to go on. I understand that there are also two British subjects on the staff working with a German manager, and taking his orders. It seems to me a sorry spectacle.</p>

<p>The idea, of course, is that it is the American President of the Bank who is doing all the work of the Bank entirely on his own responsibility, but we have been told that in some sort of indefinable way the British directors are in the background exercising a certain amount of influence, and, if they do, we may be quite sure that the German directors, whether they are there physically or not, are also exercising a certain amount of influence, particularly on the German manager.<br/>
I do not think it can possibly be said that the different national interests, British and German, are wholly detached from the operations of the Bank. I should have thought it was desirable for the American President to resign and make way for some neutral who could be generally trusted to take an objective view and not allow the Bank to come out with proposals with regard to the post-war world. A person cannot be on a board and say he will not go to meetings and have nothing to do with it. We cannot escape responsibility of some kind nor can the Germans, and I should have thought that in the circumstances it would have been much wiser for the British and American representatives to have come out.<br/>
What is the reason for desiring to remain in? My hon. Friend was not far from the truth when he suggested that it was because we had a certain amount of


money invested in the Bank, and the Chancellor is naturally interested in finance wherever he can see it, even in the most exceptional places. After all, when we win the war we can do what we like with Europe, with the Bank or anybody else. We can dictate our own terms. It is a mere illusion, and a banker's illusion, to imagine that by associating with this Bank we are protecting our financial interests in any way. My right hon. Friend should look further into this difficulty and see whether he feels that at this stage we should remain in any way associated with a body which presents a united front among enemies and allies, working together in the financial sphere and putting forward some scheme for the post-war world. It seems to be all wrong and I hope we shall put an end to it.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for North Lambeth (Mr. G. Strauss) based a good deal of his fears and suspicions about the Bank for International Settlements upon what he described as this very important report. If, by any chance, that report was not particularly important in the relevant sense of the word, a good deal of his case would fall to the ground. I think that one of the strongest currents of feeling which has prompted this discussion is that general feeling of suspicion about anything that carries the name of bank. It has often been a source of wonderment to me that those who become most excited when banks are mentioned are generally those who in the natural course of their lives have had least occasion to have practical connection with banking. It do not think that this Debate about the Bank for International Settlements, as evidenced by the speeches we have heard from the other side, has been any exception to that general rule. Members of Parliament are not unique in this respect. Even the most spiritually-minded persons exhibit the same symptoms as we may observe from orations we have recently heard at places as far apart as Bradford and the Albert Hall. In passing, may I say that I did happen to notice in the newspapers that the ceiling of the Albert Hall was giving way? I do not know whether it is possible that some of the things said there the other afternoon proved too much for the structure of that solid Victorian building.</p>

<p>As my hon. and learned Friend and namesake the Member for Ilford (Mr. G. Hutchinson), for whose excellent speeches I so often get the credit, has said, we have to consider this matter objectively, and there appear to be two points at issue. One is the assets, the money interest that we or our nationals have at stake in this Bank, both our stock interest and our deposits. Will those interests be benefited by our getting off the Board of the Bank, or will they be harmed? I should have thought that in so far as our interests can be protected by having British representatives there, we should be better off if we keep representatives there. But if we do not, what is proposed? Is it suggested that we should hand our representation over to the American chairman, and ask him to look after those assets for us? If so, I should imagine that he would say, "Thank you for nothing." And we cannot, after all, in any way control the decisions which our American friends may take with regard to this Bank.<br/>
The second point is the question of whether the Bank for International Settlements is likely to be a useful instrument in post-war times. Certainly, even with the most uninformed minds, one would think it is likely to be, but it is rather a technical matter, and I should think that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would, naturally, be guided by expert opinion thereon. I should imagine he would naturally consult the Governor of the Bank of England, and possibly people in the Treasury like Lord Keynes and Lord Catto, who really do know something about this subject. I hear some signs of dissent, and I have no doubt, for instance, that the hon. Member for Lowestoft (Mr. Loftus) would desire the Chancellor to consult His Grace the Duke of Bedford and Major Douglas.</p>

<p>I think that matter will have to settle itself by reference to the OFFICIAL REPORT. To sum up this whole matter, it appears to be rather in the nature of a storm in a tea cup. I hope that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer will so regard it, will dismiss it quickly from his mind, and charge his mind with the very much more important matters which we have asked him to undertake in connection with the winning of the war.</p>

<p>I think in justice to the President of the Bank for International Settlements that a statement which is embodied in the very opening of its report ought to be made known to the House. The President there says:
<q>In its activities the Bank has always adhered to the spirit of scrupulous neutrality which it laid down for itself in the autumn of 1939, avoiding all transactions whereby any question can possibly arise of conferring economic and financial advantages on a belligerent nation to the detriment of another.</q>
In fairness to the author of the report, who, as far as one can gather from the context, prepared the report entirely on his own authority, that qualification ought to be brought to the notice of the House. It is said that the post-war policy suggested in the report is not favourable to the interests of this country.<br/>
One of the dominant considerations for this country at the close of the conflict will be the adjustment of our international trade. This report is very exhaustive in many respects and is very educational to those who have gone over the graphs which have been prepared and over the figures, which have been brought up to the end of March of the present year. It will be a distinct advantage to this country if we retain our membership of the Bank for

International Settlements. The small part taken by the Bank of England at the present time in the activities of that organisation is of no consequence, but after the war it will be most important that this country should be represented upon it.</p>

<p>I always feel when I take part in Debates on high finance that I am somewhat at a disadvantage. We have had the wisdom of the hon. Member for Hastings (Mr. Hely-Hutchinson) who seems to be an authority on these matters and who, indeed, occasionally works overtime on Sundays in giving the readers of "The Times" his views. We represent the British taxpayers and I have an idea that the taxpayers have some interest in the Bank for International Settlements. Therefore, we may be forgiven if we take a certain amount of interest in the subject, although it may not be the most enlightened interest. Is that our fault? I do not think so. Here we have the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the representative of the taxpayers of this country. Yet on occasions when we have tried to obtain some enlightenment from him in this House, he has affected to know nothing whatever about the doings of the Bank for International Settlements. When we questioned him recently about the report of the Bank for International Settlements he said he knew nothing about it. Now we know that the report was all the time in the hands of the Ministry of Economic Warfare. Whatever be the upshot of this Debate, perhaps the Chancellor of the Exchequer will allow us to suggest he might co-operate a little with other Departments of the Government before he comes to this House to deny all knowledge of these subjects. He should consult other Government Departments, in which case he might be able to give us a little more information.<br/>
What is the report which we are discussing? I regret to say that we know very little about it. Of course, the Chancellor of the Exchequer knows nothing about it. Perhaps he may have got some enlightenment since he has been consulting with some other Government Departments. [HON. MEMBERS: "It is in the Library."] If we want to know anything about the report we must turn to the German newspapers, and in particular to the "Frankfurter Zeitung," which hon. Members will know is a very well-informed


German newspaper. Long before this matter was discussed in this country this paper with all the disadvantages of the censorship that prevails, had very extensive reports and summaries of this report. I suggest that we are entitled to know something more about what is going on in the Bank for International Settlements, for this reason: We are substantial shareholders of the Bank for International Settlements. I have very little to do with limited companies, public or private, but I had always understood that shareholders were at any rate entitled to know something from the directors as to their operations in the shareholders' interests. It seems to me we know nothing, or very little, about what the Bank for International Settlements is doing.<br/>
I agree that when the Bank was originally set up it had a useful function. In effect, it was an international clearing bank, and obviously as we were taking part in international trade we had a very vital interest in it. What disturbs me is to find that Germany is the largest shareholder in this Bank. What also disturbs be is to find that of the total number of shares issued, of which we hold I think something like 19,772, the United Nations in the aggregate control some 47,000 shares and the Axis nations some 152,000 shares of the Bank for International Settlements. Is there any international trade at present between the United Nations and the Axis nations? If so, I could quite understand that there would be a very good reason for the Bank for International Settlements functioning. But I understood it was prohibited by the law of this country for British nationals to have any dealings with enemy nationals.<br/>
The report so far as I have seen it, or extracts from it, to a large extent enunciates views with which I should be very much in agreement. I have no fault to find with some of the views it expresses on after-war trade. I think they are most enlightened views. The only doubt that remains in my mind is how far does Germany, through its German directors, subscribe to those views. I cannot believe for one moment that the German directors and the German interests agree wholeheartedly with the views which have been expressed by the American President of the Bank for International Settlements in this report. Therefore, I think it is the bounden duty of the Chancellor of the

Exchequer to give this House a little guidance, to tell us a little more about the mysteries of this Bank and not merely to wash his hands of the whole affair like Pontius Pilate&#x2014;as he has apparently done when questioned in this House. I want to know what is happening to the 26,500,000 Reichmarks which belong to this country. It is a strange thing incidentally that we should have our investment in Reichmarks; I should have thought they might have been in something more substantial than that, dollars perhaps, or what about the pound sterling? Where are the Reichmarks invested, and if they are invested in Germany, what is happening to these deposits? It is up to the Chancellor to enlighten this House a little more than he has done.<br/>
I do not want to raise any question of a mare's nest. I want to examine the matter from the same angle as my hon.' Friend the Member for Hastings (Mr. Hely-Hutchinson) did&#x2014;the cold financial angle, the utility purpose of the Bank for International Settlements&#x2014;and to dissociate from it sentiment and winning the war and all that sort of thing. Facts are what we want. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has been very chary of giving us facts when we have pressed him in this House. My hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich (Mr. Stokes) and my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke (Mr. Ellis Smith) have put questions to him. We have extracted some information, but only under great pressure. There used to be another international institution, which also had something to do with Finance, and with morals as well. That was the League of Nations. The League of Nations was founded on an excellent theory, far more excellent than that of the Bank for International Settlements. That theory is in abeyance for the duration of the war, apparently, for very good reasons. If the Bank for International Settlements is to remain for the duration of the war, with our directors on its board, we want to be quite sure that any statement of policy issued by the Bank, whether signed by an American president or subscribed to by the German director, coincides with the policy of His Majesty's Government. I believe there is too much going on at present which this House would repudiate if it knew all the facts. I want the Chancellor of the Exchequer, as one of his colleagues on the Treasury Bench once said, to "come clean" with the House


and to tell us something of the facts, about which the House and the country must, otherwise, remain in darkness unless they turn to the German newspapers.</p>

<p>This is a democratic assembly, where we can pool our ideas, in order to reach mutually-accepted conclusions. In the development of democracy in this country, we have been prepared to give one another our pledge to do our duty in accordance with our understanding of that development. But to be addressed in the superior manner adopted by one hon. Member today is not conducive to that democratic method of debate. The hon. Member spoke strongly, and I want to speak equally strongly. I am relatively young, and yet for the second time in my life we are involved in a world war. Let me assure the hon. Member and all who agree with him that we represent forces in this country and in the world at large that are gathering strength. We have had the benefit of the educational facilities now available to the ordinary people of this country. We cannot go into this matter to-day, but many of us would welcome an opportunity of threshing it out with people in any part of this House who adopt that superior attitude. I understand that the German Press reported on the Bank for International Settlements before we knew anything about it in this country. If that is so, this House is vitally concerned. I and other hon. Members received a letter from the Chancellor, dated 3rd October, 1942. I do not want to read the whole letter, but here are the relevant passages:
<q>It is the fact that neither the Treasury nor the Bank of England have received or have seen a copy, but I find that the Ministry of Economic Warfare had one. This is the only copy that: has been received so far as I have been able to discover, and it has only just been brought to my notice.</q>
I readily accept that, but it calls for some explanation. It is an indication that in the fourth year of the war effort there is not the co-ordination between the Departments there ought to be and that there is a certain amount of inefficiency, and it certainly calls for an explanation. This report gives, on the back of it, the names of the directors, and only four of these can be described as neutrals in this war. In addition, several of the executive officers of this Bank for International Settlements are bound to be opposed to

this war. Perhaps the Chancellor will take that cynical smile off his face. [HON. MEMBERS: "Order."] It is time that that was said, because we have had to put up with it too much during the past 12 months when considering questions, as many of my hon. Friends will agree. We are entitled to ask whether these people are meeting in any way and whether, if it is true that the directors are not themselves meeting, their representatives are meeting, and are communications taking place between the Nazi Powers and the representatives of our own people? On page 5 of the report the President says:
<q>I its activities the Rank has constantly adhered to this principles of scrupulous neutrality.</q>
I would ask the right hon. Gentleman or any Member of this House whether he believes that. There can be no neutrality with the Axis; therefore we ought not to be associated with them in this way. We should not even allow our names to be published along with the names of Nazis in this report.</p>

<p>I will deal with that later I find from the report that the French Government have paid as occupation costs an amount exceeding all the budgetary expenditure of France. How can there be strict neutrality on the part of representatives of a country which is responsible for carrying out a policy of that kind? The Nazis have broken every international obligation, and yet the Chancellor of the Exchequer has answered Questions in this House to the effect that he believes that they observe the strictest neutrality. We all heard the recording of the speech of the Prime Minister last night. It was a scathing indictment of the Nazis. It was a good speech. But how can we applaud a speech of that kind and at the same time try and reconcile this report? How can we applaud a speech of that kind and yet at the same time say that this Bank has observed the strictest neutrality?<br/>
An answer which the Chancellor has given to a Question on this subject was:
<q>I am satisfied that the Bank conducts its affairs on the basis of strict neutrality.</q>


There cannot be strict neutrality of any kind where the Nazis are involved, and it needs some understanding, and will need some explaining to the people of this country, why we should be associated with a Bank that is dominated by the Nazis or with representatives of the country dominated by them. The Bank for International Settlements gave us a nasty blow in 1939. Many of my hon. Friends will remember the great controversy that raged in the House just prior to the handing-over of the Czechoslovakian gold reserves. I suppose some people would describe that as maintaining strict neutrality. A study of the Bank's report facilitates an examination of the British economic position, and in a war in which we are fighting for everything that is worth while we should not be associated, as I have said, with an institution that is dominated by enemy representatives and which facilitates an examination of the British economic position. We ought immediately to withdraw from it.<br/>
I remember a former President of the Board of Trade introducing the Bill which made it illegal for industrial concerns to maintain their relationships with enemy countries. Members on the other side who are directors of industrial concerns remember that immediately on the outbreak of war all relations of an industrial character had to be broken off. We all remember how we suffered as the result of the pre-war cartel arrangements with certain big concerns in Europe.<br/>

<p>We are still suffering as a result of these arrangements, particularly as regards aircraft. How can the Chancellor reconcile the introduction of such a Bill as that with the statement that our financial arrangements should be maintained through this Bank? I remember in 1936 the jeers and sneers we had to contend with when we raised a certain issue regarding Ribbentrop. Now it is obvious who was right. The Anglo-German Naval Treaty and the activities of Ribbentrop were a victory for German diplomacy just as this is a victory for

German diplomacy, and in my view it should be repudiated in unequivocal terms. I thought I was the last speaker before the Chancellor, but as I believe other Members want to address the House, I will conclude by saying this: After the war we shall be faced with a serious economic situation throughout the world. In the view of the movement to which I belong and the people in the country, the only way forward will be by a policy of economic co-operation. That policy ought to be based upon an understanding that is being worked out now by the United Nations. There is a conflict between a policy of that kind and the policy contained in this report. Had there been more time I would have dealt with this matter in more detail, but I want to say, in conclusion, that I believe the people of this country, when they know that we are still parties to the Bank for International Settlements, will be satisfied with only one action, and that is the complete severance of our relations with this Bank on which the Nazis are represented.</p>

<p>I intervene in the Debate for two reasons. In the first place, I want to put a point to which I hope my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer may be able to reply. We have been told that this report was drawn up by the President of the Bank for International Settlements, an American citizen. I understand that the term of office of the President of the Bank is nearing completion, and I want to put this point. Supposing that his successor is a neutral or a belligerent whose sympathies are heavily with the Nazi system, and supposing that the next report is drawn up by such a President merely as Nazi propaganda, what will be our position then, having two directors closely associated with the British Government on the Board of the Bank?<br/>
I had not intended to intervene in the Debate. I have not, for a certain reason, had the opportunity of speaking in this Chamber for some six months, and I did not intend to speak just yet, but I am compelled to do so by the attack made upon me by the hon. Member for Hastings (Mr. Hely-Hutchinson). It was quite unprovoked. I was sitting here quietly and then simply intervened to ask one question of the hon. and learned Member for Ilford (Mr. Hutchinson), and the hon. Member for Hastings suddenly


attacked me. I cannot understand why. He is a bank director. In my speeches in this House, and in my writings, I have gone out of my way to testify to the ability and integrity of the management of the joint stock banks, The hon. Member accused me of being an advocate of the solution known as the Douglas Social Credit system. In my first speech in the House I made it clear that I did not advocate that solution, and since then I have made that clear in speech after speech. Then I challenged the hon. Member to withdraw or substantiate his charge. He attempted to do so. How? He said I was vice-president of the Economic Reform Club, which advocated the Douglas Social Credit system. I share the vice-presidency of the Economic Reform Club with distinguished Members of the Upper House&#x2014;Lord Northbourne, Lord Sempill&#x2014;and also with Lady Snowden, and others. The constitution of that Club specifically lays down that it does not advocate any particular solution. I told the hon. Member I have been a Member of the House longer than he has. I have never known an hon. Member who made a charge and who, when challenged to substantiate or withdraw it, has not withdrawn or definitely proved his charge. I must say that I am surprised that the hon. Member did not behave in accordance with the usual great traditions of this generous House.</p>

<p>I am sure that we all welcome back the hon. Member for Lowestoft (Mr. Loftus). While I do not want to intervene in the controversy, I know that he has had a very severe time during his absence from the House, and I wish to say how glad we all are to see him back again.<br/>
I welcome the opportunity of saying a few words on this matter, not because I think the country is disturbed about it, but because I think that if the reports of the Debate were circulated without any reply from me, there might well be some misapprehensions about the position. What we have to consider to-day is whether any circumstances have arisen which should cause us to sever or alter our association with the Bank for International Settlements as at present constituted and conducted. What is the present position as I know it and as I am advised? Since the outbreak of the war, having regard to

difficulties which must naturally arise from the constitution of a Bank of this kind, the conduct and control of the Bank have been and are to-day in the sole hands of the President of the Bank, an American citizen. [An HON. MEMBER: "Is he a partner in Higginsons? "] I could not say. He has occupied this position for nearly three years.</p>

<p>There may be a German manager, but the conduct and control of the Bank have been his sole responsibility and duty. This gentleman has our complete confidence. We believe that, all the way through, he has adopted a policy of strict neutrality, and we believe he has honestly and faithfully pursued and effectively achieved that policy. No transactions have taken place since the war between the Bank of England, acting as a member of the Bank, and the enemy central banks forming part of the institution. There have been no business relations whatever between them. The Bank to-day in fact only carries on what may be called routine business, and the ordinary transactions which take place having regard to the circumstances of to-day. The Bank is so situated that no transaction has taken or can take place under the present arrangements which would confer any economic or financial advantage on a belligerent nation to the detriment of another.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1942-10-13a.1594.2" colnum="1594" time="">
<p>Questions have been put to me regarding the directors, the possibility of conversations between them and matters of that kind. Since the outbreak of the war the directors have never met, and the British directors have no contacts direct or indirect or any association whatever with the enemy directors. What is the position of this country? I am only concerned with this matter from the point of view of the best interests of this country. We have considerable and substantial interests and rights in the Bank under the International Trust Agreements between the various Governments. There is the British deposit amounting to between &#x00A3;2,000,000 and &#x00A3;3,000,000. The Bank of England also have a shareholding of about &#x00A3;4,000,000, of which 25 per cent. has been called up. Our association with the Bank obviously brings no economic or financial advantage to the enemy. It is certain, as


I said in answer to a Question to-day, that Germany pays interest to the Bank, and from the Bank's assets, of which that interest forms a part, we receive a dividend.</p>

<p>Why has this matter arisen again at the present time? It has been going on for two or three years. As I understand it, it is because of the issue of the recent report of the Bank. The hare was started by a writter in one of the financial papers, who obviously could never have seen the report as a whole, suggesting that the report would create a great stir in political circles, that it was wrong for British and Allied nationals to be associated with Germany and other Axis Powers in elaborating a report on post-war conditions, and that by so doing the British directors had considerably exceeded their powers. The same writer also found&#x2014;and I think he is the only one who has been successful, perhaps more successful than my hon. Friend who opened the Debate&#x2014;allusions in the report which could be said to favour Germany. I am glad to observe that no other paper has adopted such a view. I do not think there is any justification for any of those statements. There has been no political stir except what my hon. Friend has been able to accomplish today. The directors have had no association whatever with this report. As appears on the face of it, the report is that of the President alone. It is his sole responsibility, and no one else has had any concern with it.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1942-10-13a.1595.1" colnum="1595" time="">
<p>I had an opportunity, as have hon. Members, of looking at the contents of the report. I should say, speaking generally, that there is nothing exciting or exceptional in it and certainly nothing to which exception can be taken. One can take passages here and there into which anyone who wanted to make trouble might possibly introduce some meaning which is critical of this country. On the other hand, it might very well be said that this report contains passages which propound ideals and objects which are diametrically opposed to German objects and policy. I was interested to observe this morning the comments of one of the well-known writers in the "News Chronicle." He said that he had had access to a long summary of the document, and wished to say a word about it. He recites how at the beginning of the report the American President at the Bank stated that the Bank had constantly adhered to the

principle of scrupulous neutrality which it laid down for itself in the autumn of 1939, and says that on reading the extracts available to him he can detect in the document no signs whatever of even the slightest departure from this attitude of scrupulous neutrality. I think anyone who looked at it from an unprejudiced point of view would say that that was a very fair statement of the position. In answer to my hon. Friend opposite, who put the question to me, I certainly see nothing in the report&#x2014;and I do not know whether he does; I do not think he does&#x2014;which would cause us to vary or to alter our previous policy in connection with the issue of this report of the Bank.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1942-10-13a.1596.0" colnum="1596" time="">
<p>I do not think it is material, but I shall be glad to answer the question about the issue of the report to the Press. As I understand it, the Bank for International Settlements, in accordance with their normal practice, gave out to the Press in Switzerland a summary of the report on 4th September. I suppose they held the usual Press conference and that all the Press were there, and I take it that it was as the outcome of that conference that the German Press reported the matter in their papers. I think that whatever correspondents of the British Press were there did not see that there was anything very exciting in this report, and, so far as I am aware, they gave no publicity to it. Of course, that was a matter entirely for them. Having read the report myself, I can understand that serious readers, those who are interested in a matter of this kind, would naturally prefer to see the whole of the document. At any rate, what happened was that they had the usual Press conference, and our own Press representatives there evidently did not see that sinister light in the report which other people have seen. As to copies of the report reaching this country, again I do not think that is a matter of very great importance. I did state in the House, what I understood to be the case, that no copy of this report had reached this country. At any rate, I had not seen it, and the Bank of England had not seen it.</p>

<p>It turned out afterwards that one of our Departments had a copy of it. They had not informed me of the fact, thinking, I expect, that I had a copy when I had not one. There is nothing


very exciting about that, either. In order that any doubts on this matter may be quieted, if it is possible to quiet them, let me say that I am informed that at about the same time as the Press summary was given out by them, the Bank for International Settlements posted copies of the report to this country. Some few weeks later they posted copies to Germany, the intention being that the copies should arrive at both central banks at about the same time. I hope nobody is going to complain about that. It only means that the post has been slow, delayed or something of that kind. In fact, the copies that were sent to the Bank have not yet arrived.<br/>
I was asked about the shareholding of the Bank. I do not think that that has any relevance to our attitude, although we are concerned with the preservation of our own assets. I gave an estimate, on the basis of the original distribution of the shares, that the Axis interest would be in the neighbourhood of 50 per cent. Since the war some of the central banks have been transferred to this country and the status of others is doubtful. Therefore, estimates can legitimately vary on this matter. The exact proportion, whether it is 50 per cent., 60 per cent. or 70 per cent., is, from my point of view, immaterial. In fact, the shareholders have no rights of control under the constitution of this Bank, in the sense that they are not at the general meeting; and the general meeting does not elect the Board and does not control the policy of the Bank.<br/>
My last few words to those who are interested in this matter are that, in my judgment, nothing would be gained and much might be lost if we attempted to sever our relationship with the Bank, as at present controlled and constituted. The neutrality of the Bank has been maintained by the control of the President and by our membership. It might very well go if we went. If we were able to withdraw our directors, it would obviously be easy for the persons concerned, particularly if the American President of the Bank were to disappear, to call a meeting of the directors and for the assets to be dealt with very differently from the way in which they are being dealt with to-day. I can, at any rate, say that if we were to withdraw, the position of the President would undoubtedly be affected. There

would be every prospect then of the whole of the assets of this Bank falling entirely into the hands of the Axis. There is no way, under the constitution or otherwise, by which we could ask the Swiss to look after our interests in this connection.<br/>
There is another aspect of the matter which I hope the House will consider. Some of our smaller European Allies, in particular some of the countries occupied by Germany, might very well be liable to suffer loss, in consequence of our withdrawal. They might have their interests imperilled, just as we should have our interests imperilled, if we withdrew, quite apart from the possible loss of the Treasury interest in the Annuity Fund and the shareholding of the Bank. Under these circumstances, the Bank might very well become an Axis-controlled institution. The Germans would be able to put pressure upon it which would imperil all its assets, and Germany might find means of using them for her own war purposes&#x2014;not only those invested in Germany, but those in other countries, and our retirement would in fact remove the most effective safeguard that the Bank's substantial holdings in Europe will continue to be administered according to strictly neutral principles and for strictly neutral purposes, and we would run the risk of a hitherto neutral institution of not inconsiderable wealth becoming an enemy institution with all its consequences.<br/>
I would only say this, in conclusion, to my hon Friends: I have emphasised throughout that this is our policy, so long as the Bank is constituted and conducted as at present&#x2014;and I need hardly assure the House that I have no interest other than to see that those of our country and our Allies are served&#x2014;and I will see this matter is carefully watched. If there were any important changes or alterations, the matter would undoubtedly be reviewed again, and any decision that might be arrived at would have to be arrived at in the: light of any new position that might arise. I feel quite confident myself that in present circumstances we are serving our best interests and those of our Allies in the policy we have taken up, and cenainly nothing has happened, either in the report or in the events of the last few days, in my judgment, to make us alter our present policy and the way we conduct our affairs in relation to it.</p>

<p>May I ask one short question, because the Chancellor apparently contradicted himself in his statement, and I think we want to be clear? I understood that he said the deposits at the Bank earn interest in Germany or elsewhere and that that interest helps to pay Great Britain interest on our deposits at the Bank. [HON. MEMBERS: "No."]

I am sorry if I am mistaken. That would be in contradiction to the answer he gave.</p>
