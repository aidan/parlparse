<p>That is very gratifying. I am sure that the landowners are very interested in this matter.<br/>
Will the Secretary of State tell us how the speech made by the Under-Secretary, when winding up the debate on this White Paper last Thursday in which he said that no saving in public expenditure was involved, squares with paragraph 35 of the White Paper "New Policies for Public Spending" which specifically states:
<q>By the middle of the decade this is expected to lead to a saving in public expenditure of &#x00A3;100&#x2013;&#x00A3;200 million &#x2026;"?</q>
That is clearly a contradiction. Will the right hon. Gentleman clear it up for the House and for the country?</p>

<p>I have done this before, but I am glad to do it again for the hon. Gentleman. The amount now being spent on subsidies is not to be reduced. In fact, for Scotland it is likely to increase

in the coming years. But if the previous system had continued, the amount would have escalated into a very much greater sum by the middle 1970s. That is where the saving comes in.</p>

<p>asked the Secretary of State for Scotland whether he will now withdraw his proposals on the reform of Housing Finance in Scotland, Command Paper No. 4727, in view of the policy of the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced on 19th July, 1971 concerning a voluntary prices and incomes policy.</p>

<p>Does the Secretary of State realise that we did not get an answer to our argument that this was inflationary within the so-called prices and incomes policy which the Government are seeking to adopt? Will he comment on that and confirm that, on the day after the White Paper to which my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) referred in the last Question, he said, according to the <i>Glasgow Herald,</i> that he was cutting that figure, which he talked about as escalating, by &#x00A3;10 million to &#x00A3;20 million in the fiscal year 1973&#x2013;74?</p>

<p>I should need to see the article in the <i>Glasgow Herald,</i> which I have not seen and which no one has produced to me, to answer the hon. Gentleman's last point and to explain on what it was based. Regarding the present situation and the proposals in the White Paper, the annual average increase in council rents is to be limited to 50p a week. That means that the rents can increase only by reasonable steps each year. That increase must be related also to the equivalent limit which the Labour Government set on the average increase in rents of 37&#x00BD;p at the height of a pay freeze.</p>

<p>Will the right hon. Gentleman accept that these proposals, in conjunction with the other means tests, will create a situation which many working men in Scotland, although they get a 25 per cent. increase in wages, will be worse off in consequence of all the means-tested benefits which they will lose?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-08-04a.1550.5" hansard_membership_id="2094" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29610" speakername="Mr. Campbell" colnum="1550" time="">
<p>I do not accept that. The means test, if the hon. Gentleman


wishes to refer to it as such, is not new. It is a test under rent rebate schemes which was strongly advocated by the Labour Government in at least two circulars sent to all local authorities in Scotland.</p>

<p>I thank my right hon. Friend for that Answer. Does he appreciate that the percentage of owner-occupied houses in Scotland is 25 per cent. compared with 50 per cent. in England, 53 per cent. in Wales and 55 per cent. in Czechoslovakia? Does he appreciate that the action which he has taken will do much to stimulate house ownership and help to relieve unemployment? Has his attention been drawn to the Report produced by the then Minister of Public Building and Works in 1963 on the Production of Building Components in Shipyards? Does that Report help the shipyard order position?</p>

<p>I am well aware of the contribution which the private sector, in addition to the public sector, can make to housing in Scotland.

<p>asked the Secretary of State for Scotland what further consideration he has given to providing the Highlands and Islands Development Board with financial incentive differential to attract industry as was recommended by the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs in 1970.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-08-04a.1554.2" hansard_membership_id="12537" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/11621" speakername="The Under-Secretary of State for Home Affairs and Agriculture, Scottish Office (Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith)" colnum="1554" time="">
<p>Since the Select Committee reported there have been several discussions with the Board about the industrial incentives available in the Highlands and Islands. These have been increased during this period, and the present differential seems to me reasonable.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-08-04a.1554.3" hansard_membership_id="7009" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29118" speakername="Mr. Johnston" colnum="1554" time="">
<p>Surely the hon. Gentleman will admit, as the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs established, that the differential is not enough to make any difference to an investment decision for a company in the Highlands? If the Government believe in the development


of the Highlands, especially at a time when unemployment is higher than for 20 years, the hon. Gentleman must act now to change the situation or the Highlands will again be the tail-end Charlie at the time of recession.</p>

<p>We believe in development in the Highlands. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not ignore the improvements that have been made in incentives since the Select Committee's Report. There have been improvements in building grants and in loans for advance factories. I assure the hon. Gentleman that the matter is under discussion with the Board, and that we shall keep the position under review.</p>

<p>Is the hon. Gentleman not aware that the economic collapse in West Central Scotland in particular and the measures taken to attract industry there, such as the creation of a special development area, make it all the more difficult for the Highlands and Islands Development Board to attract industry to the Highlands? Is he not aware, also, that the miserable measures which he has taken since the Select Committee reported are completely inadequate to attract new manufacturing industry to the Highlands?</p>

<p>I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman is ungrateful for what has been done for the Highlands. I ask him to bear two points in mind. The special incentives given to other areas decrease the differential by a certain amount, but the hon. Gentleman must remember that the kind of industry which the Highlands attract is not necessarily the same as that attracted to the central area. Second, despite what is happening in central Scotland, and the help that is given there, the Highland area enjoys special advantages in loans and grant assistance.</p>

<p>asked the Secretary of State for Scotland how much money was approved by the Highlands and Islands Development Board in grants and loans in the first quarter of 1971; and how this figure compares with the corresponding periods in 1969 and 1970.</p>
</speech>

<p>In the first quarter of 1971 the Board approved grants and loans amounting to &#x00A3;490,266. The figures for the same quarter in 1970 and 1969 are &#x00A3;372,194 and &#x00A3;194,000.</p>

<p>I thank my hon. Friend for those figures, which entirely contradict some of the suggestions by hon. Members opposite that the Board is sleeping. He will know, of course, that a great amount of these loans and grants have gone to help with the increase in tourist accommodation, but, unfortunately, this is still much below what is required in the Highlands. Would he consult his right hon. Friend so that necessary legislation may be introduced to provide grants to people buying large old houses and improving them? At present, these grants are not available because they are not building additional rooms. This is very important in the Highlands.</p>

<p>Equally, what the hon. Member must realise is that, while one wants to see more jobs in Scotland&#x2014;more jobs in relation to the money spent&#x2014;it is particularly encouraging, in the face of the legacy of economic stagnation that his party left behind when they left office, that in the first quarter of this year the Board found so many projects which were worth approving.</p>

<p>The answer is quite simple. These are grants and loans approved for projects in the Highlands or for individuals coming to help with those projects. I do not think that that supplementary has anything at all to do with this Question.</p>

<p>Is my right hon. Friend aware that my estimate is that the selective employment tax has cost the Highland counties over &#x00A3;10 million? Surely the Board welcomes the progressive removal of this burden, which has taken out &#x00A3;2 million more than the Board's splendid work has put in.</p>

<p>I believe that my hon. Friend has already received information from the Chancellor of the Exchequer on his first point. The halving of S.E.T. and the announcement that it will be abolished in two years has been greeted with great relief by the Highlands, an area which probably suffered from it more than any other part of Britain.</p>

<p>Is the right hon. Gentleman not prepared to rebut the nonsensical figures of his hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur)? Is he unaware that more than twice the amount which has been alleged to have been collected in S.E.T. was spent on one project in Invergorden alone and that, since the abolition of investment grants, the Highlands have seen no new major industry coming in at all? What is the right hon. Gentleman doing to build on the foundations laid by the previous Government to build up manufacturing industry in the Moray Firth area?</p>

<p>If the hon. Gentleman was listening to a reply just now, he will have heard that the increase in the amount of grant and loan given in the first quarter of 1971 represented a considerable increase on the amounts which the Highlands and Islands Development Board had given out for new projects in the same period in the previous two years.</p>

<p>The information about present rents and about deficits on housing revenue accounts is published in "Rents of Houses owned by Public Authorities in Scotland, 1970", Cmnd 4607, and "Rating Review January 1971". The level of rents required to balance housing revenue accounts will depend on the amounts of the new subsidies and increased costs, which will vary from authority to authority and cannot be forecast with any precision.</p>

<p>Would not the right hon. Gentleman agree that he has a responsibility to inform council tenants and local authorities in Scotland that if the terms of the White Paper become law it will mean that after the transitional period council tenants and other public bodies will have &#x00A3;156 added to their present average rents per year, and that that will be the standard rent?<br/>
Second, would not the right hon. Gentleman agree that his answer to the second part of the Question shows that if local authorities were to square their

housing revenue accounts the figure would be less of a rent increase than &#x00A3;156? Does the right hon. Gentleman propose to back the trade union movement in its demand for increased wages to meet this colossal and scandalous proposition of increased rents?</p>

<p>I do not accept the hon. Gentleman's estimates. The rebate scheme will, for the first time, be a national scheme throughout the public sector and the private sector. It will help those who cannot afford the new rents. As I said earlier today, rents can rise only by a certain reasonable step each year. The previous Government doubled the average council house rent in Scotland in 5&#x00BD; years. Ratepayers in Scotland will benefit&#x2014;and many tenants are ratepayers, too&#x2014;because at the moment they are paying 37 per cent. of the cost of council housing, with tenants paying 40 per cent.</p>

<p>Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that my constituency is an area of high unemployment, with a present rate of 6&#x00B7;3 per cent., and that it is also a low-wage-earning area? It is quite easy to project what the standard rent will be in Kirkcaldy at the end of the transitional period, particularly in respect of the four-apartment house. I understand that the weekly payment will be more than &#x00A3;5.<br/>
Will the right hon. Gentleman undertake to provide more generous rent rebates under this scheme or, better still, will he tear up this White Paper on Housing Finance and introduce an improved and more generous subsidy structure for providing houses in Scotland?</p>

<p>It will certainly benefit the whole housing situation in Scotland to remove the incredible distortions which exist at present, when ratepayers are paying nearly as much as tenants for council housing.

<p>Is it not the case that these Questions relate to the standard rent which is aimed at balancing the housing revenue account? Will the right hon.

<p>When the hon. Gentleman raised this matter in Committee he made a calculation and said that if the rent were trebled it would produce a standard rent of &#x00A3;6 in Motherwell.

20th July in the Press, to whom it was presumably given on 19th July.

<p>I cannot accept the accuracy of the hon. Gentleman's supplementary.

Having debated that in Parliament, my right hon. Friend and I had the opportunity of very long discussions with the different sections concerned, including shop stewards. Some of the shop stewards took the line which the hon. Gentleman described, but others who took part in our discussions were considering and discussing the proposals which had been put forward by the four advisers, who included three leading Scots whose main concern must be the welfare of Scotland and Clydeside.</p>

Will he see that we have an opportunity to debate a glaring omission from the Green Paper&#x2014;namely, the omission of any comment about the loss of industrial rating due to extensive closures? I am referring in particular to the way in which Clydebank, Dumbarton and other Scottish towns are being sadly affected by the loss of rating, not just for one year and at once but for several years.

<p>In my statement to the House on 10th May about the RB211, I reported that the United States Administration was seeking authority from the United States Congress to guarantee up to &#x0024;250 millions of additional credits for Lockheed. The House will recall that, because of the heavy commitment which we were prepared to undertake on the engine, we wished to be satisfied that the aircraft project itself could be completed. The United States Congress has passed legislation which would permit the granting of United States Government guarantees on further loans to Lockheed. I am awaiting notification from the United States Administration that it is prepared to give the guarantees for the benefit of Lockheed in an amount of up to &#x0024;250 millions, which amount the United States Administration considers sufficient to carry out the TriStar project. I am also awaiting from Lockheed confirmation of


orders for the aircraft from existing airline customers.<br/>
Provided the notification is received as expected from the United States Administration and from Lockheed, I am happy to say that the RB211 programme will proceed and that some 30,000 or more people at Rolls-Royce and in the company's supplier firms can now expect to continue work on this major engine programme. This has been a major consideration in our deliberations on the subject and I hope this will relieve some of the anxieties of those involved whether as employees, Rolls-Royce suppliers or trade creditors.</p>

Thirdly, will he explain what safeguards will be taken following the sacking of I.R.C., which acted as a watchdog, to ensure the continued viability of Rolls-Royce and other aero firms?

<p>I thank the hon. Gentleman for some of his remarks. First,

the nationalisation, if that is the right word, was announced at the same time as the collapse of Rolls-Royce, not nine months after.

<p>Amid the euphoria, is this not the occasion to go along to the Treasury Solicitor and to those who advised the Attorney-General and discuss seriously the advice given to successive Governments in the case of Beagle and Rolls-Royce as to whether it was really necessary to put these firms into the hands of the Official Receiver at all?

<p>I beg to ask leave to move the Adjournment of the House, under Standing Order No. 9, for the purpose of discussing a specific and important matter that should have urgent consideration, namely,
<q>the deteriorating situation in the probation service and the urgent need for an immediate and adequate pay settlement.</q>
The rising crime rate and the increasing overcrowding in penal institutions has given, and is giving, cause for national concern, and the Government have recognised this in stating their plans to reorganise the penal system. Those plans are based on the expansion of the probation service from its present strength of 3,400 to 4,700 by 1975. Yet net gains in personnel have been declining over the past three years and it is doubtful whether the service can even meet its present commitments.<br/>
It is becoming increasingly difficult, due to the inadequate salaries and excessive work loads of probation officers, for the service to attract professionally-trained recruits, especially when it faces direct competition for trained personnel from the new local authority social work departments which are able to offer qualified personnel up to &#x00A3;400 more per annum than they could be offered by the probation service.<br/>
The matter is of extreme urgency, for unless an adequate pay settlement is offered in the near future&#x2014;and I stress "in the near future"&#x2014;an increasing number of probation officers may well leave the service, particularly the younger, university-trained officers, and this will severely dilute the standards of service and also make it impossible to implement the proposed advances in the treatment and rehabilitation of offenders.</p>

I refer to what started as a nuisance but which has now become an impediment to the work of the House, particularly in its Committees, namely, the widespread use of loudspeakers by vessels going up and down the River Thames adjacent to the House. It has now

reached the extent to which witnesses giving evidence before Select Committees cannot be heard, and the shorthand writers, who have the difficult job of recording what is said, have great difficulty in taking it down.

But I am very doubtful whether it is a matter of privilege. Therefore, I hope that it will not be persisted in as a matter of privilege.<br/>
The House, I am led to believe, is likely to rise tomorrow. By the time that it resumes its sittings the Thames boating season will, I think, be over. Perhaps the matter could be considered during the winter through a variety of channels. If the nuisance is persisted in next summer or earlier when the House is sitting, perhaps the hon. Gentleman will raise the matter again.</p>

<li>(<i>b</i>) may be made subject to the reservation that the organisation or panel, at any time when it is recognised as sole bargaining agent in pursuance of the recommendation, shall not have exclusive negotiating rights in respect of matters which are at that time being dealt with under the specified arrangements or which are then the subject of a collective agreement negotiated under those arrangements."</li>

<q>(1A) If the recommendation of the Commission is subject to a reservation under section 46(8) of this Act, the order of the Industrial Court shall specify the more extensive bargaining arrangements, as specified in that recommendation, and shall be made subject to the like reservation.</q>
I have had it suggested to me that it might also be convenient if the Opposition's Amendment to Lords Amendment No. 92, to leave out from 'question' to end of Amendment, were also to form part of the same debate. I hope that that will perhaps be for the convenience of the House.<br/>
The purpose of these Lords Amendments is to deal with an important question which we believe we had adequately covered in the original drafting of the Bill but which, we find subsequently, we have not. The point is this. The bargaining agent provisions of the Bill are limited to single employers, or employers associated only in the financial sense, but in practice over wide areas of industry it is exceptional for all the terms and conditions of a group of employees comprised in the bargaining unit to be negotiated by the agent for that unit. For example, in the typical engineering firm the basic rates of workers in that group, and other terms and conditions of employment, are customarily negotiated nationally between the Engineering Employers' Federation and the Confederation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Unions, but these nationally agreed terms are almost invariably supplemented at company level by further agreements which provide for payments


above the basic rates and also for many other things as well. Clearly, therefore, it seems to us that the bargaining agent provisions ought to be sufficiently flexible to deal with the situation where there may be bargaining at different levels in respect of a particular group of employees.<br/>
As I said at the outset, we had thought this was covered in the Bill as drafted, because the C.I.R. has power under Clause 46(7) to make its recommendations subject to any conditions which it thinks fit, and we thought that that covered the point I have just made. We thought that where a satisfactory national arrangement for negotiating terms and conditions of a group of employees was the subject of a recommendation the C.I.R. under that subsection could make it a condition, if it thought fit, that the recommended bargaining agent should accept that it had no negotiating rights in respect of those terms and conditions which were negotiated nationally.<br/>
This, as I say, we find is not the interpretation which we believe the courts would put on the Clause in the Bill as drafted originally, and we are now advised that we should make Amendments, and that is what we are doing, so that we can adequately cover this question of bargaining at different levels.<br/>
The problem arises primarily because of the tightness of the existing definition in Clause 42. Thus, although the Lords Amendments which we are now discussing are fairly extensive, they really do no more than make explicit what we thought hitherto was implicit in the provisions.<br/>
The Lords Amendments basically do two things. First of all, Amendments No. 74 and No. 75 make some necessary modifications to the definition of "bargaining unit" and "sole bargaining agent" in Clause 42.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-08-04a.1595.0" colnum="1595" time="">
<p>Amendment No. 78 provides a new and I think comprehensive definition of "more extensive bargaining arrangements". Amendments of the existing definitions are necessary to make it clear that the phrase "bargaining unit" relates in the case of a particular group of employees to those terms and conditions of their employment which are not the subject of negotiations in more extensive bargaining arrangements such as national or company-wide negotiations,

and also to make it clear that the sole bargaining agent has no negotiating rights in respect of matters which are dealt with under the more extensive bargaining arrangements.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-08-04a.1596.0" colnum="1596" time="">
<p>The second thing which the Amendments do is to enable the Commission on Industrial Relations to do what, as I have already said, we thought it had already the power to do under Clause 46(7). Amendment No. 92 inserts a new subsection into Clause 46 empowering the Commission on Industrial Relations to make its recommendations subject to reservation that the recommended bargaining agent shall not have exclusive negotiating rights in respect of matters which are dealt with under the more extensive bargaining arrangements.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-08-04a.1596.1" colnum="1596" time="">
<p>I want to make it clear that this does not mean that everywhere the C.I.R. finds that there are these more extensive bargaining arrangements in existence it will be compelled to recommend that the sole bargaining agent would have to be subject to reservation. The new subsection will give the C.I.R. discretion&#x2014;and I think it is right&#x2014;to decide whether or not more extensive bargaining arrangements should be accorded priority over the negotiating rights of the recommended agent in an individual company or bargaining unit in the discussions.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-08-04a.1596.2" colnum="1596" time="">
<p>That is important, and needs stressing. We are not wanting to tie the hands of the C.I.R. We are wanting to loosen its hands. It was the Bill as originally drafted which tied its hands, making it impossible for it to make such a reservation. We are making it possible for the Commission to make reservations, but not compelling it to do so.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-08-04a.1596.3" colnum="1596" time="">
<p>I have to deal with two small consequential Amendments made necessary because of the changes. First of all, it is the purpose of Amendment No. 93 to make reference in Clause 47 to the possibility of this reservation by the C.I.R. under the new subsection to be inserted in Clause 46. Secondly, the new subsection (1A), which is contained in Amendment No. 100 and which is to be inserted into Clause 48 will require the Industrial Court, when it makes an order enforcing a C.I.R. recommendation, to specify in the order the more extensive bargaining arrangements.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-08-04a.1596.4" colnum="1596" time="">
<p>These, then, are the purposes of these Amendments, the central purpose of


which is to give the C.I.R. discretionary power where it thinks it appropriate&#x2014;but only where it is appropriate&#x2014;to protest the primacy of negotiations at the higher level, and it seems to us sensible and in line with traditional British industrial relations practice.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-08-04a.1597.0" colnum="1597" time="">
<p>I am surprised that the Opposition, in the Amendment they have put down to Lords Amendment No. 92, should apparently be seeking to reject it. Of course, it is true that the Donovan Commission recommended extension of company and plant bargaining, and I certainly accept that. All I would say to balance it is that national level bargaining is accepted on the side of both trade unions and managements, and where it is appropriate it has proved its value over a long period and, I believe, will retain its value even in modern conditions. Where it fails, and where, indeed, it has done seriously in some areas, is where a national body attempts to settle in a standardised national form terms and conditions which simply are not appropriate in the context of varying local conditions, and because they are not appropriate to local conditions they are not acceptable, and therefore, do not carry support and authority and acceptance.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-08-04a.1597.1" colnum="1597" time="">
<p>Some national bargaining wrongly attempts to do too much&#x2014;this is what the last few years have shown in some areas&#x2014;and it is much better that it should be replaced by good, orderly, stable local bargaining at company and plant level. There is nothing in these Amendments which would deny or hold back the movement towards more effective company and plant bargaining.</p>

<p>Would not the right hon. Gentleman agree that national bargaining tends to set minimum standards? I recall that when I was in the engineering industry, in 1963 the basic rate for a skilled worker was only &#x00A3;10 12s. whereas the average earnings were over &#x00A3;25 a week. In other words, the national bargaining was out of all relation to what was actually happening.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-08-04a.1597.3" hansard_membership_id="2146" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/11649" speakername="Mr. Carr" colnum="1597" time="">
<p>I accept that point. I am not standing here as the great champion of national bargaining as it has often been practised. I welcomed at the time, and still welcome, the importance which

the Donovan Commission gave to the recognition of the growth of local bargaining which had taken place in its recommendation that this should be further extended. I am not going back on that view in any way. Nor do I believe that these Amendments would hold up such a process.<br/>
What I am saying is that because we have in the light of experience, some of it painful, discovered and become increasingly aware of some failings in our traditional system of national bargaining, it would be a mistake to throw the whole thing out of the window as though the whole concept of no value. There was and still is value in it&#x2014;value from industry to industry and perhaps from time to time. All we are saying in these Amendments is that where the C.I.R. finds that the national bargaining for the setting of minima in pay or conditions is working well and is acceptable to both unions and management, it is sensible that it should be able to protect that national bargaining and limit local bargaining to the things which the national bargaining cannot effectively do. Equally of course where it looks into a case and finds that national bargaining is ineffective, it will be free to say so and to make clear that in future these matters ought to be dealt with at local level.<br/>
I believe that these Amendments provide the necessary flexibility which will encourage the development of local bargaining on a sound basis while protecting, where appropriate, and where it is wished for by both sides, the presence of national bargaining for certain issues where it is going on effectively. I am surprised that the Opposition should seek to reject this change&#x2014;all the more so because their spokesmen in another place took a totally different view.<br/>
For example, the noble Lord, Lord Champion, in accepting these Amendments for the Opposition in another place, felt that they did bring something to the Clause which was formerly missing. He went on to say that he could not pretend that he had discovered this missing link for himself but felt that he should have done and wished that he had done. He added that, since it had now been discovered, he welcomed the Amendments and felt that they would improve the present arrangements. That was the view of the Opposition, strongly expressed


in another place&#x2014;so much so that, without further debate, after Lord Champion's statement the Amendments were accepted without a Division. I hope now that the whole House of Commons, and the Opposition in particular, will consider these Amendments in the spirit in which I have explained them and will feel that they do improve an area of the Bill which I think is probably one of those which, over the years, can be of most value in developing more sensible bargaining structure in industry.</p>

<p>Having read the proceedings in another place, I regret that the right hon. Gentleman did not open his remarks in the same frank way that the noble Lord, Lord Drumalbyn, presented these Amendments in another place. Lord Drumalbyn's speech was in contradistinction to the right hon. Gentleman's today. The right hon. Gentleman has suggested that the Government are presenting the Amendments as a result of further careful and deliberate consideration. In fact, the origin of the Amendments lies with the representations made by the employers' associations&#x2014;in particular, the Engineering Employers' Federation&#x2014;which, right from the publication of the Consultative Document last year, have repeatedly expressed their concern, both in private and public, about the licence that would be given under his proposals to people at shop floor level in the pursuit of productivity bargains and so on which would apply in the event of industry-wide agreements.<br/>
One of our initial points of concern, which the right hon. Gentleman will be familiar with because we have referred to it so often, relates to the exercise by the C.I.R. of certain of these powers which, in this state, are derived via the N.I.R.C. We have repeatedly expressed our objections to the C.I.R. being yoked

to that court. I shall not labour the point again, because I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman is in no doubt about the depth and strength of those objections or about our concern that the C.I.R. should be exercising any power at all while it continues to be so unrepresentative of industry as a whole.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman should direct his remarks at Lord Cromer and the gentlemen of the City. My right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition has repeatedly drawn attention to the difficulties created for the Labour Government by the hostility of the leaders of the class which right hon. and hon. Members opposite represent. Let us hear no more nonsense and hypocrisy about that from the right hon. Gentleman. These Amendments are a straight concession to the employers' associations and put on one side the basic Donovan thesis about the decentralisation of collective bargaining and the unrealities of the formal industry-wide system.<br/>
I thought the Royal Commission's Report had shattered once and for all the illusion in which the right hon. Gentleman apparently still persists about the


effectiveness of industry-wide agreements. The Commission said:
<q>&#x2026; the assumptions of the formal system still exert a powerful influence over men's minds and prevent the informal system from developing into an effective and orderly method of regulation".</q>
It is sad that the right hon. Gentleman has succumbed to the influence of the employers' federations rather than to the view of the Royal Commission.</p>

<p>Whether the right hon. Gentleman likes it or not, he is in these Amendments aligning himself with the employers' federations. This is the effect of these Amendments. He is associating himself with those who cling pathetically to the illusions of the past and who want to hang on to the pretences of a discredited and obsolete system. I thought the right hon. Gentleman welcomed the Royal Commission's Report&#x2014;indeed I recall the welcome he gave to it&#x2014;and it is a matter of regret that he now seems to be washing his hands of it.<br/>
The informal and fragmented reality of factory bargaining cannot be coordinated into a coherent and rational system by attempting to revert to the past. The growth of plant bargaining in recent years has been an explicit recognition of this fact.</p>

<p>Did the hon. Gentleman not hear me say when I moved the Amendment that I am in favour of the extension of plant bargaining? Secondly, is he really saying on behalf of his party that he is opposed to all national bargaining? Is this the point of view of the trade union movement? I do not think it is&#x2014;any more than it was the view of the Labour Party in another place.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentle man must recognise that the views put forward on these benches are the views of the Parliamentary Labour Party, not necessarily the view of the trade unions. We claim that because we stand with the trade union movement, we naturally reflect in this House the aims and aspirations of the trade unions and their members,

because we are one and the same, we are part of the same body.<br/>
I am accusing the Secretary of State of channelling the forces of change in the wrong direction. We recognise that industry-wide agreements still have some influence and still exist, but they exist in a period of change. There are those who, like the Royal Commission, recognise the forces of change and who can see the direction in which we ought to go; they have put up signposts in that direction. This is a direction in which my right hon. Friends, the Labour Party and I seek, to go. The right hon. Gentleman is turning the signposts round or is turning a blind eye to them. Instead, he has chosen to acquiesce in the demands of the industrial Canutes, the dinosaurs, in an attempt to preserve an unreal and meaningless <i>status quo</i>. It cannot be done. The pretence of the old, centralised bargaining system, based on national negotiations covering a whole industry, has been overtaken by the reality of more meaningful negotiations at factory level.<br/>
There is one other point of concern, which is the principal reason that we have tabled our Amendments. This arises directly out of the new subsection (8)(<i>b</i>). It may be that we have misunderstood the situation. It is a complex subject and I am glad that at times we have been given legal guidance by the Solicitor-General. I gather that he is a hieroglyphist in the British Museum&#x2014;if that is the right word for one who deciphers mysteries&#x2014;but unfortunately there are not enough Solicitors-General to go round to advise all the shop stewards who will have to follow these provisions. It seems to me that subsection (8)(<i>b</i>) could go beyond the effect I have just been describing. Although it makes provision for the C.I.R. in determining what sole bargaining unit to take into account, the new subsection may give the opportunity to limit the sole bargaining unit in an establishment which falls outside.<br/>
Our fear and anxiety is that this power could be used to have a precisely opposite effect from what we should wish to see. In other words, a particular bargaining situation may lead to those seeking to be the sole bargaining agents not being given the power to negotiate.


They would not have the power to raise terms and conditions to a higher level than that which prevails in industry generally.<br/>
If the right hon. Gentleman is unable to assure us that this will not be the effect&#x2014;and I am not saying that this necessarily will be the right hon. Gentleman's intention&#x2014;then I am afraid we shall have to look carefully at whether we will press the Opposition Amendment to a vote.</p>

<p>If I may have the leave of the House to speak again, I was taken aback for a moment that no other hon. Member opposite wishes to say anything on these Amendments, [HON. MEMBERS: "What are you complaining about?"] I am not complaining. I was merely expecting hon. Members to repeat their well-known speeches on this and other subjects. [HON. MEMBERS: "Cheap."]<br/>
I was a little astonished at parts of the speech of the hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Harold Walker). He began by accusing me of lack of frankness in not saying that the Engineering Employers Federation and other employers federations have pressed this point. There is no question of lack of frankness. This is well-known public knowledge. I am not concealing anything since this is well known to anybody who takes an active interest in the subject. The engineering employers and other employers have made no secret of their concern about the value of national bargaining in certain areas. I received representations from various employers and various employers' associations. It is not my fault if the trade unions had nothing to say one way or the other to me on this subject. They could have come along, but did not.<br/>
I suspect, however, that many trade unions do not share the wholehearted enthusiasm of the hon. Gentleman, and apparently of the Official Opposition, for chucking all national bargaining out of the window. [HON. MEMBERS: "No."] Well, this was the impression given by the hon. Gentleman, with unusual vehemence. I will look at his words, and perhaps when I see them in cold print that impression will not be so great, and indeed I hope that is so. Certainly my impression was as I have indicated it. What in fact I said in moving the Amendments was that there is no desire to stop the

move towards more and more effective, orderly and stable local bargaining. We completely support the Royal Commission's analysis in this respect.<br/>
But we believe&#x2014;and I think that many people on both sides of industry believe-that within its limits our traditional national bargaining system, well tried and well valued by trade unions as much as by employers, has a part to play. It may be a different part to play from that we have seen in the past, it may be a lesser part, but in our view it would be wrong so to frame this law about bargaining agents that the C.I.R. was not permitted to allow it to play the part which both sides of industry might wish it to play and which, if allowed, would be to the benefit of the whole of industry, workers as much as management, and of the country as a whole. That, therefore, is the intention.<br/>
4.30 p.m.<br/>
At the very end of his speech, the hon. Member for Doncaster asked a specific question. I confess that I should have appreciated the opportunity afforded by a speech from the Opposition benches of a few moments' grace during which I could have checked the technicalities of the question, but I shall answer him in this way. I assure him that it is not the intention, as I think he accepts, that the Amendment should have the effect which he suggested; and I do not believe that it will do so.<br/>
We have to realise that it is inherent in our whole system, and inherent in the concept of the C.I.R. approach, whether as envisaged originally by the right hon. Lady the Member for Blackburn (Mrs. Castle) and her hon. Friends or as now extended within the concept of the present Bill, that we do not tie the hands of the C.I.R. We consider, on balance, that, rather than tie the hands of the C.I.R. too closely, we ought to set up an industrially sophisticated body and leave it to use its common sense in the circumstances and on the merits of each individual case. We do not think it right to tie its hands in detail by statute as to what it can and cannot do. That is the sense of the Amendment. All these Amendments give the C.I.R. more discretion rather than less.<br/>
I assure the hon. Gentleman that the C.I.R. could not do what he suggests. I have had advice, although, obviously, I have not had a chance to discuss it.


While I have been speaking, I have received definite advice from advisers whom I trust, just as I know the hon. Gentleman trusted them in the past, that the C.I.R. could not do what the hon. Gentleman fears. It is very definitely not our intention that it should be able to do it, and I think I can now add that it will not be able to do it. I think it right that we should give the C.I.R. the discretion which we propose.<br/>
I accept that feelings run strong about the Bill, but I hope that all of us will realise that the C.I.R. is there as an industrially sophisticated body, and I regret the present attitude of the trade unions to it. I shall do my best to appoint to that body people of genuine professional skill and knowledge, and recognised as such by all sides of industry. There will remain seats vacant for people from the trade union movement if and when they feel able to participate in it.<br/>
I very much hope that the trade unions, whatever view they may take about the Bill and whatever hopes they may have that at some date there may come another Government who will repeal it, will realise that, while the Bill is on the Statute Book, it will be not just in the national interest but in the interests of the trade unions and their members that they should participate in these bodies. They will be welcome. The places will be there for them. Even if the Bill provides a context which they sincerely do not like, I hope that all of us will do what we can to encourage them to participate, for I believe that it will be to their benefit, and not just to the country's benefit, that they should do so.</p>

<p>In his opening remarks, the right hon. Gentleman invited a contribution or two from our back benches, so I put this point to him now. It is his conception of the C.I.R. which has mucked the thing up. The central idea of a body of this kind brought together has been supported by a good many of us on this side, but in the situation created by the Secretary of State there is unanimous opposition from the entire officialdom of the trade union movement&#x2014;from the extremities of the Left to the extremities of the Right&#x2014;to the repressive aspect of the set of circumstances which he has created. It is his concept which has mucked the whole

idea up, yet he seems so disappointed about it.</p>

<p>I do not accept the hon. Gentleman's premise; nor do I believe that events will prove his suggestion right. I am sure that events will prove, even if I am not absolutely right, that I am more right in my hopes than he is in his fears. But I still say to the hon. Gentleman and his right hon. and hon. Friends that, even in the framework of this legislation which they so deeply dislike, the C.I.R. itself is given no direct powers. This is deliberate. I still hope that the vast majority of cases going to the C.I.R. will go through the normal voluntary machinery. That is my hope and my intention. Only rarely, I believe, will the C.I.R. deal with a case which has to go to it through lack of voluntary procedure and willingness via the channels of the National Industrial Relations Court. I hope that those will be but rare cases, but even in those rare cases&#x2014;this has been deliberately done&#x2014;the C.I.R. will be denied any teeth, any powers of compulsion. It is still a body of inquiry, report and persuasion, centred very much in the voluntary field.<br/>
I hope that, as the months go by, this will come to be realised and that distinguished members from the trade union movement will feel able to serve on it without in any way forgoing their basic dislike and disapproval of the Bill and their hopes that one day it will be repealed.</p>

<p>Is it not plain that a wholly moderate and reasonable trade unionist like Mr. George Woodcock would never have resigned the chairmanship, a job he loves, if he had not been totally convinced by his experience of the working of the C.I.R. that the Bill would damage that work?</p>

<p>That was not the reason which Mr. George Woodcock gave. Hon. Members on both sides who wish to know his views ought to turn to the actual words which Mr. Woodcock used. Naturally, I have not got them with me at the moment, so I am speaking from recollection, just as the right hon. Lady must be, but my recollection is that, while making clear that he did not support the Bill&#x2014;he has always made that clear&#x2014;he made clear also that it was not because of the Bill that he felt he must resign


from the C.I.R. but because of the decision of the T.U.C. in respect of it.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman seemed disappointed that we did not give him the benefit of our knowledge of these matters. But this is a huge issue&#x2014;we all realise how big it is&#x2014;and the Amendments which he has put to us run in a very narrow groove compared with the magnitude of the subject matter. We do not want to open up the whole subject now. Indeed, you would probably rule us out of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, if we went into the wider aspects of it.<br/>
When the right hon. Gentleman merely generalises on whether there should be national or local bargaining, he does not do justice to the subject. I know of industries in which there never will be local bargaining no matter what the law says. I know of industries in which, in the course of the next few years, national bargaining will cease to exist. Therefore, when the right hon. Gentleman puts it in the black and white context, he is not doing justice to a huge issue.<br/>
I can understand the suspicions and anxieties which have been aroused in my hon. Friends by certain advances by the Engineering Employers Federation. It seems that, in the engineering industry, which to my knowledge has had local bargaining for the last 40 years, it is putting the clock back if those same employers are now emphasising the need to keep national bargaining as the premier structure within that industry. The preservation of national bargaining, as it has been preserved, has done a lot of harm, especially in some sections of engineering which are causing the most trouble.<br/>
I can look back a long way on these matters. For instance, I believe that the problems in the motor car industry stem from the fact that it tried to adapt itself to national bargaining, which has nothing to do with the production of motor cars. We know, especially in engineering, that, as my hon. Friend the Member for Sal-ford, West (Mr. Orme) said, national bargaining has been looked upon as the way to establish minimum basics.</p>

<p>But this presupposes that there will be superimposed a payment by results system. I have always felt that where we went wrong in the car industry was in trying to add to a pretty low basic rate a payment by results system. This is nonsense, as the Minister will probably agree. It was because we were all hog-tied by the national bargaining system that many of the troubles which we have since experienced in that one industry have come about.<br/>
I know the right hon. Gentleman well enough to appreciate that he would not wish to preserve a national structure which presupposed that it went wrong locally the moment we attempted to apply it. It is sad to see any kind of industry in which that can happen being limited in its ability to go forward to a negotiation which can get rid of much of the structure which has caused these problems in the past.<br/>
I thought how remarkable it was that Donovan was so out of date. We appear to be told that it is a good thing to have local bargaining. Some of us were indulging in factory bargaining 30 years ago, long before the issue became a question whether it should be done nationally or locally. I was on national committees looking after national bargaining at the same time as I was conducting factory negotiations which, in many ways, superseded national bargaining.<br/>
If the right hon. Gentleman is to take this to the logical point of saying that, for instance, in the coal mining industry we want now to recreate district bargaining, he will have a holocaust on his hands. Years ago, the question of district bargaining in the coal mining industry was the source of a huge number of strikes. I have no authority to speak for the union concerned, but I am sure that it would not accept any idea of returning


to the district bargaining which it hated so much. Who could believe that, for example, in the railway industry, there could be local bargaining? The whole thing just would not stand up.<br/>
The problem facing the right hon. Gentleman is that it is not possible in legislation to lay down a structure which is applicable to all these varying industries. I hope that in his discussions with industry he will keep this point very much in mind.</p>

<p>I have been asked to reply for the Opposition.<br/>
When the Secretary of State spoke a second time, with the leave of the House, he spoke with all the pain of a kindly uncle who has been offended because some refractory nephew has refused a present which has been sent to him. The reason that the trade unions have not cooperated with the C.I.R. is. that it is inextricably linked to the working of the Industrial Court, to the imposition of damages, and to the legal paraphernalia and proceedings which they find so repugnant and which most sensible observers believe will not be helpful to the improvement of industrial relations. It is for that reason that we have the Amendment to Amendment No. 92.<br/>
If, when he opened the debate, the right hon. Gentleman was speaking about the inter-relationship between local and national bargaining, if he was speaking in the context of a voluntary system without the imposition of courts, orders and proceedings for damages for unfair industrial practice, his remarks would have been absolutely impeccable. But the proposal which he is putting before the House is that the Commission should be able to exclude from a sole bargaining agent arrangement certain matters to be negotiated at national level. That is good enough. Indeed, in our Amendment to Amendment No. 92 we say that the Commission may specify the more extensive bargaining arrangements in question. But if we accept the rest of the Amendment, it means that the process of law can follow a union which tries to negotiate a matter which has been reserved in which it does not have exclusive negotiating rights. Such a union could find itself brought before the court for damages for an unfair industrial practice. These proposals taken on their own

are unexceptionable; it is linking them with the legal paraphernalia of the court which the trade union movement finds unacceptable. That is why, at the appropriate stage, we shall divide upon our Amendment.</p>

<q>Mr. Woodcock made it clear yesterday, both in his letter to Mr. Carr and in a public statement, that he would not have resigned only because of the functions assigned to the C.I.R. by the Industrial Relations Bill. It was the trade union boycott that had decided him.</q>
<q>He had hoped that when the Bill became law most references to the C.I.R. would be by the consent of the parties and not require the use of compulsory provisions. But to help employers and unions in voluntary reform"&#x2014;</q>
[<i>Interruption</i>.] I think that hon. Gentlemen opposite ought to listen, because this is important. It gives the lie to the suggestion by the right hon. Lady that Mr. George Woodcock resigned because of the terms of the Bill. He did not.<br/>
I will repeat that last passage so that it may sink into the consciousness of hon. Gentlemen opposite:
<q>He had hoped that when the Bill became law most references to the C.I.R. would be by the consent of the parties and not require the use of compulsory provisions. But to help employers and unions in voluntary reform the C.I.R. needed their assistance and co-operation.</q>
<q>From now on, by the decision of the special Trades Union Congress last week, there would be no union co-operation. To extend their boycott to all the activities of the C.I.R., Mr. Woodcock said, was to assumed 'comprehensive guilt from limited association'.</q>
I would have thought it was obvious from that passage that Mr. George Woodcock was impliedly criticising the special meeting of the T.U.C. for its decision in this matter and making it plain that he was not resigning because of the contents of the Bill.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman ought to be


aware that on his appointment Mr. Woodcock gave an interview in which he referred to the C.I.R. as the greatest advance in industrial relations in his lifetime, and that during that same interview he said that he was opposed to the principle of legal enforceability. He repeated that statement, and the reason for his resignation is clear. It was that he objected to legal enforceability being imposed on the C.I.R.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment.<br/>
This is a clarifying Amendment. Its purpose is to clarify the definition of a joint negotiating panel, that is, a body consisting of representatives of two or more organisations of workers. The purpose is to ensure that the definition of a joint negotiating panel is not limited to those panels which are authorised to enter into legally enforceable agreements. It was never the intention to make the definition so narrow, but that could possibly be the effect of the paragraph as it is drafted.<br/>
What we want to ensure is simply that a body is a joint negotiating panel if it can commit any organisations of workers represented on the panel as if those organisations of workers were a direct party to any agreement reached by the panel. The Amendment will ensure that even if joint negotiating panels are only authorised to enter into agreements which are binding in honour only they will fall within the definition of "joint negotiating panel".<br/>
We feel that this is clearly a sensible Amendment, and we hope that it will be accepted.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman referred to this as a clarifying Amendment. I suppose that it is an advance on some of the mystifying Amendments that we have had from his right hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General. But it is more than that, though I do not want to take up much time on this.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-08-04a.1612.2" colnum="1612" time="">
<p>The Amendment is necessary, and the Government have belatedly recognised that because one can hardly conceive of any joint negotiating panel which could be vested with the power to enter into binding collective agreements. As the Clause stood it would have included, and restricted inclusion to, panels vested with those powers. That would have been a nonsense, and the Government have recognised that.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-08-04a.1612.3" colnum="1612" time="">
<p>Paragraph (<i>d</i>) presumed far too much, and now the reality is recognised by the hon. Gentleman, by implication, in the Amendment. The reality is that few, if


any, collective agreements will be made in circumstances where the parties intend them to be binding. The Government know that from yesterday's debate. All that they have imported into the law is a preliminary point in almost every set of negotiations, whether the agreement should or should not be binding, and by this they have changed the whole process of collective bargaining. But we went over that pretty thoroughly yesterday. To have left the original wording would have been to ignore reality.</p>

<p>Amendment No. 79 consists of replacing old Clause 44 by a new one. Amendments Nos. 80 to 83, 86 and 87 involve replacing the singular with the plural at six places in Clauses 45 and 46. Amendment No. 85 simplifies the meaning of "associated employer" in Clause 45. Amendment No. 89 does the same in


Clause 46 in relation to an extended reference.</p>

<p>The effect of all these Amendments is to take account of the changes made in this House to Clause 43, whereby the Commission, when a question is referred to it, has greater flexibility and can deal more appropriately with a reference. The questions as originally formulated in the old Clauses 42 and 43, without Amendment, were in different forms according to whether the application was made by an employer, a union or the Secretary of State.</p>

These changes are a necessary consequence of those previously accepted in this House to Clauses 44, 45 and 46.</p>

<p>As the Solicitor-General said, the object of Amendment No. 79 is to substitute new Clause No. 44 for the present Clause 44. We on these benches are in some difficulty. During the Committee stage the Government tabled certain Amendments, and, if I remember aright, those Amendments were not reached in Committee because of the operation of the guillotine. They concerned the sole bargaining agent, and at this stage I ought to reiterate that this is a principle to which we are opposed because we are opposed to the whole concept of the agency shop. I appreciate that we have discussed this matter in connection with previous Amendments; it is ground that we have already

traversed, but that cannot be avoided, much as we would like to do so.<br/>
As the Solicitor-General said, new Clause 44 must be taken in conjunction with Clause 43. This proposed new Clause, which is entitled
<q>Reference to Commission on application under s.43",</q>
like the one which it replaces, precludes any application under Clause 51(5). At this stage the Clause becomes extraordinarily complicated because Clause 51(5) must be considered in association with Clauses 49 and 50. Clause 49 allows any employee in a sole bargaining agency to make an application to the Industrial Court. A trade union should not continue to represent the workers if the workers do not want it to do so, provided that, I think, two-fifths of the workers signify in writing that they support the application. By Clause 48, unless at least one-fifth of the employees have signified their support for the application, an application cannot be made.<br/>
We believe that the whole principle is wrong. We regard it as a most complicated business and, although it may tidy up the other Clause, nevertheless, we cannot support the Amendment because we oppose the whole principle. We believe that the C.I.R. should not be involved. The Industrial Court should not determine any such questions. It should exist on the basis on which it previously existed. We do not believe that this proposal would help good industrial relations. In addition, it would mean that the courts would be very much overloaded and that there would be long periods of time before issues could be solved.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Norwood (Mr. John Fraser) the other day mentioned "Catch 22". The more one goes into this and discovers the cross references involved, the more complicated it becomes. In those circumstances, we shall have to oppose the Amendment.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment.<br/>
The purpose of the Amendment is to require the Commission on Industrial Relations to send a copy of its report under Clause 46 not only to the recommended bargaining agent but also to any other organisations of workers which appear to the Commission to be directly concerned in the questions considered by it. This seems to us a sensible and desirable change, and, what is more, it is in accordance with the C.I.R's present practice.<br/>
It seems right, for instance, that, as a matter of courtesy, any organisation of workers whose claims to recognition were considered in a Clause 46 report should receive a copy of the report rather than have to read about it in the Press or buy a copy for themselves. This is a small but sensible adjustment, and I hope that the Opposition will be able to accept it.</p>

<p>Clause 46(3) gives directions to the C.I.R. as to the sort of considerations that it must take into account in making a recommendation about bargaining agents. It says that:

<p>We could see no objection to introducing this.

<p>Whatever the right hon. Gentleman thinks he has achieved by trying to reassure certain people of certain things, he has not reassured me of anything. I remind him of our powerful expression of opposition to the division of trade unionists that is represented by the special register and this method of catering for professional workers.<br/>
That powerful opposition was voiced on Report, and I do not recall the right hon. Gentleman presenting an adequate explanation on that occasion of what the Government mean by professional workers or professional persons. What criteria are to be employed to remove these individuals from the rest of the trade union movement?<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman will recall that on a number of occasions he lectured me about the wordiness of proposals. I recall his complaints about the superfluity of words in legislation. Indeed, I remember the right hon. Gentleman frequently using the word "tautology" in this context. Why has he now introduced these superfluous words? If it is desirable to have this discrimination in favour of a certain group of people, it should be covered by the existing wording which relates to their training, experience and qualifications.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman talked about the need to allay fears, but he did not say


what they were or who had voiced them. He then said that these steps were being taken to reassure people. Who needs reassuring? Then he told us that certain needs had to be met. What are they?<br/>
While acknowledging the practicalities of the situation and the need to modify absolute principles to meet the real needs of the situation, the guiding principle should always be that justice is indivisible. Likewise, the trade union movement is indivisible. Here the right hon. Gentleman is introducing something that is divisive, and unless he can offer a satisfactory explanation, I shall have to recommend my hon. Friends to oppose the Amendment in the Lobby.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-08-04a.1623.0" hansard_membership_id="2363" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/19183" speakername="Mr. Orme" colnum="1623" time="">
<p>The Secretary of State began by referring to a direction to the C.I.R. Earlier he said that the C.I.R. was independent and free&#x2014;that George Woodcock had resigned not because he did not want to work with the C.I.R. but because the T.U.C. had made it impossible for him to do so. Now he is saying that the C.I.R. is to be directed to take special account of professional organisations and others.<br/>
This division which the right hon. Gentleman is attempting to create within the trade union movement, between ordinary and professional groups of workers, is deplorable. Those of us who have the trade union movement at heart have watched with pride the spread of unionism into the middle classes and professional groups. <i>Bona fide</i> trade unions have sprung up in many sections of the professional sphere where unionism did not exist previously. The right hon. Gentleman seems to be trying to call a deliberate halt to this progress through the special register and by the C.I.R. being directed to treat certain groups of workers differently.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Don-caster (Mr. Harold Walker) asked some pertinent questions to which the right hon. Gentleman must reply. We are entitled to know what the fears are and who expressed them. Have they come from doctors, nurses or professional engineers? Hon. Members may have in mind one professional organisation which was involved in the infamous Newcastle-upon-Tyne case. Why do the Government wish to introduce different standards

for professional workers? I ask this without any hostility to these people.<br/>
With the development of the multinational company, higher management and other professional groups are realising the importance of trade unionism. They need protection nowadays because many of the decisions affecting their future are taken not in Britain but in the United States, Frankfurt and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Will my hon. Friend comment on the problem that will face many professional workers who are not members of professional organisations which are chartered or limited companies? Is it not a fact that many professional workers who join organisations which are real trade unions in the full sense of the term, such as A.S.T.M.S., will be placed at a severe disadvantage as a result of this Measure? Does my hon. Friend agree that the real purpose of this part of the Bill and of the special register is to undermine the extension of professional trade unionism by using the phrase "professional workers" in an entirely different sense?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-08-04a.1624.1" hansard_membership_id="2363" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/19183" speakername="Mr. Orme" colnum="1624" time="">
<p>My hon. Friend is absolutely right, particularly in referring to the fantastic success that A.S.T.M.S. has had in recent years in organising beyond the level of what are called ordinary workers and into the professional classes. He is also right to say that this Measure may result in professional workers being placed in a different category from their counterparts and that this could represent a threat to the extended organisation of bodies like A.S.T.M.S.<br/>
It is clear that the battle will be fought far from the factory bench. The traditional conflict that has gone on over trade union matters of this kind in the mines and docks will be transferred to the higher echelons of the industrial sphere, mainly because of the vast number of workers in the middle category of management and those with professional ability who have become organised in trade unions.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman is going out of his way to protect small select groups. The Royal College of Nursing comes to mind in this context. Many organisations have not been militant in fighting for the rights of their members. For example, the rights of nurses were not sufficiently sought because the nurses' representatives


did not consider the task of improving rights a suitable job for them. Bank employees also found the need for trade unionism. It was not until the Union of Bank Employees was formed, and exposed the manner in which its members had been left behind, that a sufficient change was brought about in banking.<br/>
Many organisations representing select groups of workers have not developed in a trade union sense. Does the right hon. Gentleman feel that these provisions will in any way inhibit the activities of, for example, Clive Jenkins? Why is he taking this action?</p>

<p>Do not these people have the same rights as others to develop their organisations as they wish? Why, because they want to do it their way, should they automatically be labelled reactionary, when other people are automatically labelled progressive?</p>

<p>They were so unsuccessful on representing those whom they purported to represent that these other organisations have replaced them. My accusation is that the Minister is trying to bolster up these old organisations, and stop the spread of broad trade unionism in the sense of unions which are affiliated to the T.U.C. and prepared to associate with industrial trade unionism. I should have thought that the Minister, and particularly the Prime Minister, who talks of the classless society, would have been pleased to see the professional unions more towards the T.U.C. We believe that these present proposals will retard that movement.</p>

<p>It becomes increasingly obvious that the hon. Member for Salford, West (Mr. Orme) is having great difficulty in sustaining the mountain of rhetoric he heaps on every House of Lords Amendment. He has just referred to the C.I.R. being dictated to, yet in the Bill we find that, far from the C.I.R. being dictated to, the whole of the relevant passage is qualified by the words "the Commission shall consider" or the "Commission shall have regard".<br/>
There is no question there of dictatorship, of the wording being binding on the C.I.R. in its totality. Paragraph (<i>b</i>) adds that it is designed to

<q>&#x2026; promote a satisfactory and lasting settlement of the questions in issue in the reference.</q>
How can that be tied up with the hon. Gentleman's comments, which indicated a deep purpose of dissension in the Government's mind, and a degree of dictatorship to the C.I.R. which is not in the Bill?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-08-04a.1626.0" hansard_membership_id="9684" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/31062" speakername="Mr. Ronald King Murray" colnum="1626" time="">
<p>The words "professional or other" appear to be wholly out of place, and the explanation given to us does not convince me. The present wording of the appropriate part of the subsection covers the nature of the work the people are employed to do, and
<q>their training, experience and qualifications.</q>
A moment ago the Secretary of State said that we were all equal in our wishes, or that they were all equal in their wishes; I am not sure which version he used. If the right hon. Gentleman really means what he says, the logic of his thinking should be to leave paragraph (<i>b</i>) as it stands, because no artificial distinction is made with regard to training, experience or qualifications.<br/>
I do not want to be legalistic, but I think that both from the legal point of view and from the point of view of common sense the word "qualifications" is very apt to cover the whole spectrum of qualifications of the semi-skilled worker up to the highly-skilled technician and up to and including the highest level of professional qualifications. Therefore, the use of the word "qualifications" does all that this part of the Bill is required to do, according to what the Secretary of State has told us.<br/>
If that is so, it is impossible to appreciate why the words "professional or other" are brought in. They do not qualify anything. On the contrary, they rather introduce an ambiguity, and suggest that at least some kind of distinction is being drawn between professional and non-professional qualifications. Yet it appears from what we have been told that that is not intended. In that case, why put in these words?<br/>
There is a rule of law known as the <i>ejusdem generis</i> rule, though I hesitate to say that it applies here. Yet it is just possible that that rule might be conceived of as applying here, in which case the word "professional" would, as it were, redirect the meaning of "or other", and that instead of reading this in the sense


of professional qualifications on the one hand and other qualifications on the other the two might be taken together.</p>

<p>Would not the hon. and learned Gentleman acknowledge that his own extreme hesitation in advancing that argument&#x2014;and it is inadmissible in this context&#x2014;is due to the fact that it refers only to "professional or other", and that by identifying only the professional qualification it is not taken to identify a <i>genus,</i> and that it is for that reason that his argument, rightly advanced with hesitation, is without foundation?</p>

<p>I am grateful to the Solicitor-General for his intervention. I put the argument forward very tentatively, and he is probably right to say that it is not a sound argument. On the other hand, I am not convinced by what the Solicitor-General said, because it seems not certain that a court would take the view that no <i>genus</i> is defined. The word "professional" is special, and if one comes across that word with other words of qualification the normal canon would bring the <i>ejusdem generis</i> rule into play. The word "professional" is very special, and if we have that word with the words "or other qualifications" for the first time a court might take the view that this word, with the others attached, might attract that principle. I put it as a possibility which cannot be ruled out, and as long as that possibility exists I ask the right hon. Gentleman to reconsider the Amendment.</p>

<p>I admire and welcome the ingenuities of the hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Edinburgh, Leith (Mr. Murray), and I am even more grateful to my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General for entering into a legal argument, which, as a non-lawyer, I am not able to do. It may not surprise the hon. and learned Gentleman to learn that I am more inclined to take my hon. and learned Friend's advice than his on this occasion.<br/>
The hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Harold Walker) pointed out with some fairness that in recent years, when he and I sat on different sides of the House from those on which we now sit, I used at times to chide him for the inclusion of unnecessary words in legislation, and I

do not in any way object to his getting his own back. It is now my turn to bend over and take six of the best, and I receive them, I hope, with equanimity.<br/>
The reason for the introduction of these words was to allay fears, and to reassure. Hon. Members opposite have asked "Who? "and" What?", but their remarks show that they know the answers. The people in mind are people like professional engineers, doctors, and the like, who find themselves in modern employment, in the way in which both modern industry and modern medical research, for instance, is developing, working in the midst of a large number of people in conditions which did not apply some years ago. Those people have genuine fears. The fears may be unreasonable; fears often are, even though they are genuine. I do not think that we should in any way object to giving reassurance provided that in doing so we do not harm anyone else. I do not believe that this recognition of those fears and this reassurance in any way harm anyone else. I therefore see no objection to the Amendment.<br/>
The subsection of which the phrase forms part charges the Commission not only to take account of these things and these people but to take account of the identities and common interests of all groups of employees within the union at which the Commission is looking. It is, therefore, not exclusive of others. We have here people who increasingly find themselves as little minority groups within larger units and, whether they are reasonable or right, they have these fears and it is right to reassure them.<br/>
The hon. Member for Salford, West (Mr. Orme) pointed out that trade unions were now spreading into the middle and professional classes. That is right and inevitable, and it will go on. But, if that is so, I should have thought that not only did we owe these people the right to develop their organisations in their own way, but that if the more traditional type of trade union, to put it that way, wanted to win them over into its ranks, and it could well be in their long-term interests so to be won, such a trade union would be well advised not to have overridden, or to have seemed to have overridden, the genuine fears of such people. Rightly or wrongly, some of them are afraid that


they will be swallowed in an environment which is alien to them and which at this stage they do not believe to be in their interests.<br/>
It may well come about that if the trade unions concerned advance their cause and their recruiting with some sensitivity for the feelings of these people and for the feelings of others, they will be won over, in which case that will probably be for the general orderliness of the industry and the bargaining that has to take place and in the interests of the people concerned, but these feelings must be treated with a little sensitivity and understanding.</p>

<p>Would not the right hon. Gentleman treat with the same sensitivity and understand the fears advanced by many members of organisations such as A.S.T.M.S., because by definition many professional workers have to join a professional organisation in order to work in the profession and that professional organisation may have some negotiating right which automatically puts A.S.T.M.S. at a disadvantage?<br/>
Secondly and more important, if it does not register, it cannot get an agency shop, and the organisation which does register may apply for an agency shop, so that A.S.T.M.S. would be at a second disadvantage. I believe that A.S.T.M.S. would overcome that disadvantage as there are various methods of doing so, but, with his great sensitivity, does not the right hon. Gentleman realise that these fears are being expressed far and wide by many professional workers?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-08-04a.1629.1" hansard_membership_id="2146" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/11649" speakername="Mr. Carr" colnum="1629" time="">
<p>Of course I do. One way out of one dilemma of A.S.T.M.S. would be to register, and that would be sensible, right and proper. But if it decides not to do so&#x2014;and it is perfectly free so to decide&#x2014;it is not free to decide in all ways, to do some things but not to do others.<br/>
Of course we recognise the fears of members of A.S.T.M.S., but in any particular circumstances we ought to appreciate more particularly the fears of a minority. It will be within the recollection of the House that when these matters were discussed earlier I strongly refused to consider suggestions for giving in specific terms special consideration to some minorities but not to others. I said that if I had some understanding of the fears

of two or three doctors working among 300 or 400 clerical workers, equally I could understand the fears of two or three clerical workers working among 300 or 400 doctors. In whatever circumstances, one should have particular regard to the genuine fears of the minority. That is what we are doing here.</p>

<p>Would the right hon. Gentleman express equal concern on behalf of those tiny minorities which are discriminated against by professional bodies? Here I hope I shall touch a responsive chord in the right hon. Gentleman. He and I were discussing our mutual disabilities the other evening and we were referring to the way in which osteopaths are not recognised by the medical profession and as such discriminated against by a profession organisation. I should like him equally to turn his attention to that kind of situation.</p>

<p>Indeed, but that is not an industrial relations matter. That is a matter of statutory professional qualifications, the sort of qualifications which the country in its wisdom, or lack of it, believes it right for a man to possess before he can offer a certain service in certain important areas. It is an important matter, but this does not concern the industrial relations position of minorities, which is what we are concerned with now.<br/>
The Opposition are, of course, entirely free to decide whether to divide the House. We believe that these words should be included. We believe that they will allay fears which may be unfounded, but which are genuine, without harming majority interests now or in prospect.</p>

<p>I am glad that my right hon. Friend is sticking firmly to the point and refusing to retreat before the rather confused arguments which are being addressed to him. This is a matter of great importance. The question is whether people with professional qualifications are to be allowed to stick together if they want to.<br/>
I listened with interest to the hon. Member for Salford, West (Mr. Orme). If I understood him aright, he said that there was something wrong about that and that it was a matter for suspicion, alarm and apprehension if people holding professional qualifications in accountancy,


engineering, or medicine chose when entering industry to act collectively with others sharing that qualification. I cannot for the life of me see why they should not. I cannot see why, if they choose to do their bargaining through a professional organisation, the law should get in their way.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman has got my argument wrong. We are not opposing professional people joining an organisation of accountants or lawyers. We are saying that where appropriate they should also join a <i>bona fide</i> trade union.</p>

<p>Exactly. The hon. Gentleman has put it very clearly. He did not put it so clearly in his speech. If people want to join a trade union, by all means let them do so; but what about those who do not? Is the hon. Gentleman prepared to give people who wish to do their bargaining through a professional organisation and do not want to join a trade union the freedom so to choose, or does he wish to deprive them of that freedom?</p>

<p>If people who are not in a union do not expect and do not receive the benefits enjoyed by those who do join, there may be some justification in that argument.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman is now trying to shift the argument. I bring him back to the straight question. Let us imagine that a professional engineer, who is a member of his professional organisation, joins industry and chooses that his bargaining about his terms of employment should be done through his professional body. As things are, he is free to do so and he is free to say that he will not join a trade union. Does the hon. Gentleman propose to take that freedom from him now?</p>

<p>On the contrary; the hon. Gentleman appreciates the argument, but he declines to meet it. He was more explicit in his interruption than he was in his speech, but his speech was a plea in support of the assertion that professional people should be compelled to join trade unions even if they did not want to join.

I believe that the House does not have the smallest right to say to professional people in industry that if they do not want to join a union Parliament will make them do so.</p>

<p>I agree that the man who does not want to join a trade union on that basis has every right to say that nobody should compel him. However, if the firm says that he cannot join it unless he joins the superannuation scheme, would the hon. Gentleman think that that man had a right to withdraw from that superannuation scheme?</p>

<p>That, too, is a separate question. There may well be a case for saying that an employer should not have that right, but that is not what I am arguing; that is a separate question. I am arguing the question which is before the House, raised by this Amendment. I am interested to see how far I can get an answer as to whether the Labour Party is saying that professional men who go to work in industry are to be free as they are now to leave bargaining on their behalf to their professional organisations or whether it is saying that this freedom must be taken away and these men compelled to bargain not through their professional bodies but through a trade union.</p>

<p>I do not recall the hon. Gentleman normally wishing to attribute to the Labour Party or to any other group something that is not so. It is uncharacteristic of him, and he knows I mean that. What is behind this&#x2014;and let us take the steel works as an example&#x2014;is that there have been many organisations over the years&#x2014;A.S.T.M.S. is not the only one; the Steel Confederation is another&#x2014;which have sought to recruit middle and junior management and felt it right to have them in the same organisation, expressing solidarity. That is what is behind the Amendment, not the general problem of whether there is a right to belong to a union. We object to people in professional bodies being placed in a special category because we fear that this will militate in future against the desire of the unions to recruit junior and middle management into their ranks. That is all there is to it.</p>

<p>I do not care whether it does militate against the tendency which


the hon. Gentleman regards as admirable. That is a matter of opinion. If professional people go into the steel industry and choose to join a trade union, in the sense that the hon. Gentleman is using that phrase, then by all means let them do so. I do not have the smallest objection, and neither have the Government. Suppose such people do not want to join. Are they still to have their present freedom? Apparently not. There will be freedom one way but not the other. The hon. Gentleman seems to think like Henry Ford, that they can have it in any colour they like as long as it is red. [<i>Interruption</i>.] It is interesting to see how unwilling the critics are to face our questions plainly and answer them plainly.<br/>
I am glad to see that the Minister will not be shaken by these cloudy and disingenuous arguments, all the more so since in the past the trade union move</p>

<p>ment has been willing enough and eager enough to recognise that there are distinctions between skilled and unskilled workers. If skilled workers wish to form a union of their own the trade union movement has never discouraged it. It has never said, "We cannot permit unions for skilled workers". Yet when we ask for the same principle to be applied to the new kind of worker now entering industry we are told that such a principle is monstrous. It seems that the case against this is not only muddled and disingenuous but an attempt to undermine the principles on which trade unionism has been based.</p>

<p>These are drafting Amendments and their purpose is quite simple. Clauses 42 to 46 are drafted in terms which may concern either a single employer or a number of associated employers where "associated" is used in a sense of financial association. Clauses 47 to 53, on the other hand, are drafted in terms of only a single employer. Clearly, consistency is necessary and desirable. The Lords Amendments achieve the Government's intention of carrying right through the recommended provisions the concept of associated employers. Thus an order under Clause 48 could be directed to more than one associated employer.<br/>
The purpose of Lords Amendments 102, 108 and 110 is to carry right through the recognition provisions the concept of associated employers, and the intention here is that obligations incurred by a recognition order should, where they relate to carrying out collective bargaining in relation to the recommended bargaining unit, rest on "two or more associated employers" both jointly and singly, but in relation to the obligation when negotiated severally the intention is that it should rest on the employers jointly.<br/>
The new subsection (3B) to Clause 53 is a consequential Amendment to take account of any more extensive bargaining arrangements which may have been specified in an order by the National Industrial Relations Court.<br/>
These Lords Amendments regularise the situation, and I hope that they will be accepted even though their basis, the thinking behind the Bill, is, as we know, not always accepted by the Opposition.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-08-04a.1644.1" hansard_membership_id="9684" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/31062" speakername="Mr. Ronald King Murray" colnum="1644" time="">
<p>The what I might call minor Lords Amendments in this group are, as the Minister says, of a drafting nature, but it seems to the Opposition that Amendment No. 110 is one which takes unto itself the principle of these Lords Amendments. I have some difficulty with this, and I hope that the Government may give us some clarification of the significance of Lords Amendment No. 110. If some clarification is not forthcoming I think I would be bound to commend to my right hon. and hon. Friends that they seriously consider voting against this group of Lords Amendments.<br/>
My difficulty comes in two parts. The Minister defined "associated employers" in a way which was rather wider than that in the definition Clause, Clause 158(6) and I think that for the assistance of the House I should read that definition, because it is very narrow:
<q>For the purposes of this Act any two employers are to be treated as associated if one is a company of which the other (directly or indirectly) has control, or if both are companies of which a third person (directly or indirectly) has control; and in this Act 'associated employer" shall be construed accordingly.</q>
In a debate which we had a short time ago the Solicitor-General reaffirmed the proposition that the words "associated employer" have this technical meaning throughout the Bill, but the Minister a moment ago spoke about two companies being financially associated. He will appreciate, I am sure, that that is a different conception. Companies can be financially associated in a number of ways and need not necessarily be associated in the way described in Clause 158(6). They can be financially associated if one company holds a percentage of shares in the other without control, or they can be financially associated, obviously, by being involved in a common enterprise of some kind.<br/>
Therefore, the first question which I put to the Government is, in what sense are the words "associated employer" used here? Is it the sense which the hon. Gentleman has just stated&#x2014;financial associations of some kind&#x2014;or the narrow and strict sense of Clause 158(6)?<br/>
Depending upon the answer to that, there arises the second difficulty, which is the main ground of difficulty for the Opposition. It is not clear, whatever "associated employers" means, why this distinction should be drawn between collective bargaining on a joint and several basis, if I may use that terminology. Subsection (3A) of Amendment 110 talks about
<q>&#x2026; bargaining either alone or jointly with any other employer or employers comprised in the order".</q>
If, for the purposes of subsections (1)(<i>a</i>) and (2) of Clause 53, one is to get various employers responsible alone or jointly for carrying out what is required of them, if it is justified there why is it not equally justified in subsection (1)(<i>b</i>)? The positive job to carry on as a joint negotiation

with a sole bargaining agent is important, but it is just as important that the negative side should be carried out properly as well. If one does not impose in subparagraph (<i>c</i>) the same kind of duty that one imposes in subparagraph (<i>b</i>) one is, when considering the positive responsibilities under subparagraph (<i>b</i>), allowing an employer to say, "I will jointly bargain with the other employers, but I have no responsibility because they will not play." Given that attitude, nothing will be done. The logic of this is far from clear.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-08-04a.1646.0" hansard_membership_id="7823" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30376" speakername="Mr. Kennelh Lewis" colnum="1646" time="">
<p>This is an interesting legal argument, but in practical terms no employer could possibly take the attitude which the hon. and learned Gentleman has just described, since he or one or other of the employers would be in immediate trouble. They simply would not be able to get anything done on the labour relations side.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-08-04a.1646.1" hansard_membership_id="9684" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/31062" speakername="Mr. Ronald King Murray" colnum="1646" time="">
<p>I am obliged to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. I do not want to take up time. The point I am making has both a legal and a common sense content. I prefer to take my stand basically on the common sense point. If the employer is getting legal advice on his duties and responsibilities and he is told that this is a sole bargaining right, that is one thing, but if he is told that this is a joint bargaining right, that is quite another. Legally, the point is unanswerable and I suggest that it is also unanswerable from the common sense point of view. One needs to know what "associated employers" means. Does it mean the narrow definition in Clause 158(6) or is it in the broad concept which the hon. Gentleman gave? From the common sense point of view, one may assume that the obligation with regard to negative duties is of lesser quality than the obligation with regard to positive duties.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-08-04a.1646.2" hansard_membership_id="387" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/16355" speakername="The Solicitor-General" colnum="1646" time="">
<p>The term "associated employers" is defined in the Bill. "Financially associated" is a colloquialism which no doubt falls below the very high forensic standards of the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Leith (Mr. Ronald King Murray) but it accurately fulfils the definition as set out. The intention of these provisions is again to be divided into two halves. The provisions in Clause 53(1)(<i>a</i>) and (2) make it


an unfair practice for the employer or associated employers concerned to carry on bargaining outside the recommended structure. In that context, the intention is, whether they do it jointly or severally, that if either one of them by himself or all of them together begin bargaining with a union other than the recognised union, that should be unfair; neither could bargain either severally or jointly.<br/>
On the other hand, the provisions in relation to Clause 53(1)(<i>b</i>) are in relation to the obligation of the employer to bargain seriously with the recognised union. If the C.I.R. has analysed the situation and has concluded that, in relation to a group of associated employers&#x2014;all of them as a group&#x2014;union X is entitled to recognition and that the group should bargain with it, that obligation is expressed as being a joint one and the employers as a group are told, "You must recognise as a group union X and must bargain as a group with it." That obligation has to be discharged jointly. It is the positive obligation which must be discharged by all the employers together in respect of the recommendation of the C.I.R. and it would destroy or fragment the bargaining structure recommended by the C.I.R. if the employers could bargain in penny packets in this context.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-08-04a.1647.0" hansard_membership_id="9684" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/31062" speakername="Mr. Ronald King Murray" colnum="1647" time="">
<p>The hon. and learned Gentleman has put the point very clearly, and I understand it. When one comes to what he has called the "positive obligation"&#x2014;I tried to use the terms "positive "and" negative" obligations&#x2014;supposng one of a group of employers says, "I cannot fulfil my positive obligation because one other member of the group will not." Is there no obligation at all on him then? It seems to me that there is not.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-08-04a.1647.1" hansard_membership_id="387" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/16355" speakername="The Solicitor-General" colnum="1647" time="">
<p>The employers are obliged to act jointly. The bargaining structure was made on the recommendation that the employers should act jointly. If one of the joint employers declined for some reason to bargain within the group, he would not be fulfilling his positive obligation to bargain. It might be that the Commission, on re-examination, would conclude that a different structure should be recommended.<br/>
A structure with the positive obligation is closely parallel to the provision in

Clauses 6 to 18 onwards of the Labour Government's Bill, where bargaining operations could be specified in relation to an employer or group of employers in regard to matters national, local or regional. In that situation, the Secretary of State would have made an Order requiring bargaining to be undertaken, and if such bargaining had turned out to be ineffective for the kind of reason which the hon. and learned Gentleman now suggests, one would have had to go back and get an amending order from the Secretary of State. One can visualise the breaking down of a recommended bargaining structure in the operation of a positive obligation and I am certain that one would be able to see the reason why the obligation is not being discharged.<br/>
I hope that I have sufficiently clearly explained, in the context of the philosophy of the Bill, the contrast between positive and negative obligations and why Clause 53(1)(<i>a</i>) and (2) are separated from Clause 53(1)(<i>b</i>).</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment.<br/>
I understand that it would be convenient to discuss at the same time Lords Amendment No. 97, in line 25, leave out "by" and insert:
<q>in respect of a recommendation relating to".</q>
Under these provisions, an investigation can be made into the bargaining situation by the C.I.R. so as to come up with a solution which recommends an unregistered organisation as the sole bargaining agent, but no application can be made for a statutory enforcement of that set of bargaining rights and obligations in respect of an unregistered organisation unless and until it has become registered.<br/>
The Bill was amended when last in this House to allow the process of recommendation to go as far as the making of the recommendation of the C.I.R. in respect of an unregistered organisation but the other part of the pattern was not completely included. The provisions


were amended in this House to provide that if at the time when the organisation applied for recognition rights to be enforced it had become registered, then it could gain advantage of an enforceable order, but they were not so amended to impose the same requirement on the unregistered organisation at the time if the employers made application in respect of it.<br/>
Hon. Members opposite may agree or disagree with the concept that the ultimate right to have bargaining rights recognised and enforced should be confined to a registered organisation, but this particular pair of Amendments is necessary to ensure the same principle applies whether the application of enforceability for a recognition order is made by the organisation or by an employer. It is on that basis of consistency that I commend these Amendments to the House.</p>

<p>We abhor the discrimination against unions which choose not to register. It is a constant theme of this legislation that puts unregistered unions in the position in which trade unions found themselves almost a century ago. The Amendments show that the net is being drawn ever more tightly. Subsection (2) should have gone out of the window altogether. Indeed, such an attempt was made in the other place on 18th May when the noble Lord, Lord Champion, moved an Amendment. The noble Lord said:</p>

<p>We appeal to the Government, as did the noble Lord, to rethink this question of unregistered trade unions because of the discrimination imported into the Bill. In the other place Lord Belstead, replying to Lord Champion's Amendment, gave the game away when he said:
<q>The right to apply for a ballot on the C.I.R. recommendation under Clause 46, which results in an enforceable recognition order in the event of a majority vote in favour, is one substantial new right. We cannot accept that it should be available to an organisation of workers &#x2026;"&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, House of Lords, 18th May, 1971; Vol. 319, c. 353&#x2013;4.]</q>
What the Government are trying to do in this debate is to force unions to register whether they want to or not. It is not right for the Government to say that the unions have a choice. They are being left with no choice because of the obligation that is being laid upon them and the risk and disadvantage involved if they do not register.</p>

<p>The Government are storing up a bitterness which will rebound upon them. They have not begun to understand the extent of that bitterness. There is a subdued and seething anger in the trade union movement at present which, at every turn of the screw, runs from the Upper Clyde down to the Thames. This is one more turn of the screw and will make it more likely that eventually the floodgates will burst. The Government may go on turning the screw and we shall vote against it, but later the Government will reap the whirlwind in a far more unpleasant way.</p>

<p>Hon. Members will see that the three Amendments are identical as a matter of words. Clause 49, to which they are directed, allows the recognised position of a union to be challenged by an agreed percentage of the employees in the bargaining unit. At present, an application for withdrawal of recognition of sole bargaining agent status can be made only in respect of a trade union, the expression "a trade union" appearing twice in subsection (1) and once in subsection (2).<br/>
These three Amendments will replace the expression "trade union" by the expression "organisation of workers". They have two effects, one, from the point of view of hon. Members opposite, benevolent, and the other&#x2014;though I hesitate to say it&#x2014;from their point of view malevolent.<br/>
The benevolent effect is this. As the Clause now stands, it would not be possible for a group of workers or anyone else to challenge the recognised bargaining rights of a house union. If the only organisation which can be challenged is a registered trade union, and if recognition is accorded to an unregistered, non-independent, craven and submissive house union, as the hon. Member for Salford,

West (Mr. Orme) describes it, the position of that house union, embraced, as the saying goes, in a sweetheart deal with the employer, could not be challenged under the Clause as it stands. The benevolent effect of the Amendment is to allow a registered union or an aggrieved minority to challenge the position of that unregistered house union.<br/>
I come now to what I have called the malevolent effect, from the point of view of hon. Members opposite, though it is only with the greatest hesitation that I acknowledge the "mal" at the beginning of that word, because it is only very mildly malevolent. The opportunity to challenge an unregistered organisation should be accorded to the disaffected minority. According to the foundations of the Government's proposals here, it would not be right if it were easier to withdraw recognition from a registered organisation than from an unregistered organisation. So the effect of the second part of this proposal is that either the one-fifth or the two-fifths&#x2014;whichever be the situation&#x2014;of the workers involved would be able to secure a hearing of their case if they were challenging either a house union or an unregistered union in just the same way as they would be able to challenge the position of a registered union under the Clause as it stood when it left this House.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-08-04a.1656.0" hansard_membership_id="4631" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30154" speakername="Mr. John Fraser" colnum="1656" time="">
<p>If I may deal with the malevolent aspects first, I will say that the Solicitor-General is nothing if not thorough. He resembles less, perhaps, the Lord Chancellor in the House of Lords than the Lord Chancellor in the Gilbert and Sullivan opera who said "I've got them on the list and none of them be missed". In this case, the hon. and learned Gentleman is not missing an organisation of workers.<br/>
The organisation of workers cannot apply to the Court in the first place for recognition because the preceding Clause of the Bill states that it can obtain recognition only if it is a registered trade union and that if it ceases to be a registered trade union, the recognition order ceases to have effect. Therefore, the point in allowing an application to be made to the Court to end a recognition agreement can arise only in circumstances where the organisation of workers, despite the assistance of the Court, has obtained


recognition from the employer, the recognition having been obtained without having to go through the legal procedures. Nevertheless, lest one small organisation of workers escapes, this part is being amended.<br/>
If I may comment on the benevolent aspect of the Lords Amendments to which the Solicitor-General referred, throughout the Committee stage we tried to alter the definitions in the Bill so that an organisation of workers would never by definition be a house union. We attempted from time to time to put in the word "independent". Had those Amendments been accepted, the so-called benevolent aspects of these Lords Amendments would not be necessary.</p>

<p>The purpose of Lords Amendments Nos. 105 and 106 is twofold. First, we wish to clarify the procedure which has to be followed by the National Industrial Relations Court and the Commission on Industrial Relations in Clause 50. Secondly, we want to make further provision for the safeguarding of minority interests when ballots are taken on withdrawal of recognition.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-08-04a.1659.3" colnum="1659" time="">
<p>Perhaps I might say first a few words about the necessity for clarifying the procedure in Clause 50. For a number of reasons, it did not seem to us that the procedure at present laid down was very clear or as consistent as we would like. In particular, it did not make it clear that when the C.I.R. decided that the ballot should be limited to a certain section of the bargaining unit, each section

of that unit should be separately balloted. This seems to us obviously to be desirable. If only one section of the bargaining unit were balloted, the position of the bargaining agent might be in doubt in the remaining part of the bargaining unit which had not been balloted. It therefore seemed to us that by far the best course would be to require, as the Amendments do, that the ballot should be taken in all parts of the unit so that the position of the bargaining agent was left in no doubt in any part of the unit.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-08-04a.1660.0" colnum="1660" time="">
<p>The reason why we have provision in Clause 50 for ballots to be held in part of the bargaining unit is to enable the C.I.R. to hold a ballot of a dissident minority group within the bargaining unit which feels that it should not remain within that unit. In such a hypothetical case, the remainder of the bargaining unit could probably be quite satisfied with the performance of the established bargaining agent. It seems to us right that the remainder, too, should be balloted so that their position is left in no doubt. This means, however, that the question on which the ballot should be taken ought not to be whether the union should cease to be the bargaining agent, as Clause 50 at present provides, but rather whether the union should continue to be the bargaining agent for that unit. That is the main clarification in this respect which is made by these Amendments.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-08-04a.1660.1" colnum="1660" time="">
<p>The second purpose of the Amendments is to write into Clause 50 special safeguards for minorities. This point has been of some concern, as was the matter which we discussed a few Amendments ago. I think that there is now no doubt that the new subsection (5) will go a good way towards meeting any genuine fears of those minorities who felt that they might not receive proper treatment under these provisions.</p>

<p>Those are the reasons for Lords Amendments Nos. 105 and 106 but perhaps I might say a final word about them. They may appear to be more extensive than they are. We could have achieved these purposes by a string of small Amendments to the existing subsections but we thought it better to introduce new subsections rather than a long string of smaller Amendments. We hope that at


least this makes them easier to see and understand.</p>

<p>Lords Amendment No. 256 is a new Clause which comes in after Clause 15, and Lords Amendment No. 311 is an Amendment to Schedule 3. They arise because, on a number of occasions in Committee in another place, it was pointed out by Opposition spokesmen, notably by Lord Gardiner, that the provisions of the Bill which required ballots to be conducted by the C.I.R. or under the supervision of the C.I.R. did not afford any opportunity for appeal against a reported result of a ballot, nor did they give the Industrial Court any other option than to accept the result as reported even though there might be circumstances in which it was evident that a mistake had been made in the conduct or in the reporting of a ballot. It was, therefore, urged that there should be statutory procedure for rectifying mistakes made by the C.I.R. or by any other body conducting a ballot under the supervision of the C.I.R.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-08-04a.1661.1" colnum="1661" time="">
<p>The Lord Chancellor in another place accepted the argument that the prerogative writ procedure would not enable a simple error of fact to be corrected by way of an order of the Divisional Court and he accepted that it would be desirable to enable mistakes made in the conduct of statutory ballots to be challenged in the Industrial Court. The Amendments are intended to deal with that situation. I hope that the House will feel that it is right to provide this provision for supervision and appeal against ballots which may be thought to be wrong in some way or other.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-08-04a.1661.2" colnum="1661" time="">
<p>The proposed Amendments will only apply, however, to ballots under the provisions of Part II and Part III of the Bill. Thus, it is not intended that the new provisions should apply in respect of strike ballots in emergency circumstances under Clause 138. So there will be no provision for any party to complain to the Industrial Court of a mistake made in the conduct of a strike ballot, nor, as a result, can a court order a fresh ballot. Superficially this looked wrong, and I should like to explain, I hope satisfactorily, why we are taking this course.</p>

<p>We have taken this course because of the special circumstances surrounding an emergency strike ballot and the overriding

purpose of such a ballot. We have made it plain that the ballot is intended purely to assess the strength of support for the industrial action taken, or to be taken, by allowing the workers concerned to express their wishes. When the result of the ballot is reported to the court, the order is effectively discharged. Since the power to take further action, whether by the court or by the parties concerned, does not in any way depend on the result of a ballot, and the court has no further statutory powers under the strike ballot provisions, we did not think that it was necessary or even right to give the court the same statutory powers to review a ballot as in the cases about which I spoke earlier where the result of the ballot imposed a legal obligation upon one or more of the parties. There is this big distinction between these ballots. One is an opinion-testing procedure with no liability flowing from it; the other is on the substance from which obligations and liabilities might flow.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-08-04a.1662.0" colnum="1662" time="">
<p>Furthermore, in order to protect the interests of the parties, especially those of the workers concerned, and to remove any possibility of abuse of the strike ballot provisions, Clause 143(7) makes it plain that after the principal order under Clause 138 takes effect, the court shall not entertain any application relating to the same industrial dispute or any other industrial dispute which appears to fall within the scope of the original one. Nor, I should stress, does the court have any power to extend the period within which the result of the ballot must be reported. This means that the period in which people are restrained from organising a strike while the ballot takes place can similarly not be extended. An important factor to take into account is the need, when there is a strike ballot, for speed and for there to be no possibility of the period being capable of extension. Therefore, we saw no reason for giving the court power to quash a ballot when there are no powers available to it to continue restraint on organising industrial action.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State has explained how ballots will or will not be conducted in an agency or sole bargaining unit situation. My hon. Friend the Member for Norwood (Mr. John Fraser) quoted from Gilbert and Sullivan when discussing a previous Amendment. When I was in industry I worked at one time with a shop steward who when I used the term "Gilbertian"&#x2014;I do not know whether he understood what I meant&#x2014;always used to say when things got chaotic, "Send for Gilbert and Sullivan".<br/>
When we try to reduce industrial relations, the question of agency shop and recognition of a sole bargaining agent, to a ballot form within industry, we begin to realise how complicated the situation will become. This is a completely new situation. We have had no information. Some of my noble Friends in another place asked how these ballots would be conducted, who would be responsible within the plants for conducting them, how they would be counted, and what procedure would be used. We have received no satisfactory answer from the Government.<br/>
We move to a unique situation when we come to Amendments Nos. 256 and 311. My noble Friend Lord Gardiner, with his legal knowledge and feeling of justice, asked in the other place whether there should be some check on these undefined procedures which are laid down in the Bill.<br/>
I should like to ask a specific question arising from new Clause K. Subsection (2), provides:
<q>If, in accordance with Industrial Court rules made for the purposes of this section, the Industrial Court finds, in the case of a ballot for which this section applies, that the report made to the Court by the Commission as to the result of the ballot was incorrect, and that it would be just and equitable in the circumstances to amend the report so as to rectify the error without requiring a further ballot to be taken.</q>
On what precedent is this situation created whereby somebody can alter a ballot which has taken place? Will this body have to report on the altered ballot? Will the participants in the ballot have a right of access to find out who has altered it and why it has been altered?<br/>
I do not think that in the British Constitution there is anything comparable

with that subsection which gives the body to which the ballot has been referred the right contained in that subsection. Paragraph (<i>a</i>) provides:
<q>the Court may make an order amending the report accordingly, and</q>
<q>(<i>b</i>) where such an order has been made, the report shall have effect for the purposes of this Act as if it had been made as amended by the order.</q>
The Secretary of State has an obligation to tell the House exactly what is meant by this and what the precedents are.<br/>
I note that Lord Gardiner, who had asked for some form of longstop, was unfortunately not present in the other place when Lord Drumalbyn brought this proposal forward. There was an exceedingly short debate on it in the other place. This is a cardinal point. I do not know what my lawyer Friends feel about the legal aspects, but it seems an extremely ominous proposal.<br/>
We are opposed to the Industrial Court in its entirety because of the legalistic powers and functions which it will be given. We are certainly opposed to the idea that it should have these overriding powers. It is interesting to note that it will only deal with Parts II and III of the Bill; it will not deal with strike ballots of a national character. We wonder about the accuracy of these proposals in this regard. However, we are not asking for these long-stop proposals; we are opposed to ballots in their entirety.</p>

<p>I must correct the hon. Gentleman. I have no power to give orders to the Court. The Court is the


equivalent of a High Court. It is not under the thumb of any Minister.

<p>All I can say is that the Minister has power to direct the attention of the Court to certain practices. However the right hon. Gentleman puts it, this is seen in the trade union movement as a political structure. One sees the Industrial Court coming into collective bargaining with regard to the setting up of an agency shop and, in particular, deciding who is the sole bargaining agent within an establishment. For those reasons, the Opposition hope that the Minister will answer the points that have been put to him.</p>

<p>When one looks at subsection (2) of the proposed new Clause one sees there a serious defect. This is not the kind of long-stop for which Lord Gardiner was asking. Something else has been put in its place, no doubt through inadvertence rather than malevolence.<br/>
Let me put it this way. The error to be corrected is either material, or it is immaterial. If it is immaterial, there is no need for this machinery. If it is material, it can relate to only one thing, and that is the result of the ballot. If the Commission's report is so misguided that it says there is a majority for, when it should have been there is a majority against, it is almost inconceivable that this machinery will be required. If there is anything else, it is difficult to see how it will be material. I should like the Government's reaction to that.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Salford, West (Mr. Orme) is worried that the Court may change the result of a ballot. As I read the Clause, it is not to the effect at all, but relates to the report on the result of a ballot. Perhaps I may use an example from our debate a few days ago. It was my impression that the result of the miners' ballot on the strike vote was 57 per cent. If I had been in the position of the Commission, I should have reported that to the Court, but it transpired later that the correct

figure was 55 per cent. It would have been pointless to hold a second ballot for the sake of correcting the inaccuracy of my report. That is how I read the Clause, and I take it to be correct.<br/>
If strike ballots are to be left out of the new Clause in respect of all appeals to the Industrial Court, may we be told what the mechanics are for dealing with any alleged irregularities in the conduct of emergency strike ballots?</p>

<p>With the permission of the House, I should like to reply to the debate.<br/>
The hon. Member for Salford, West (Mr. Ore) said that nobody knew how the ballots were to be conducted. They are a new thing, and one has to start somewhere, at some time. The hon. Gentleman has made it clear that he is opposed to all ballots in this connection, and I shall come to that in a moment. But if one is not opposed to the possibility of ballots in circumstances of this kind, one has to make a start at some time.<br/>
Until the C.I.R. starts to operate, and to study the matter, it is not possible to lay down in legislation, or to explain in advance, how this will be done. This is one of the difficult tasks which the C.I.R. has ahead of it. We shall have to watch very carefully how it does this job. It will have to develop its techniques and expertise on this issue. When something has never been done before, one cannot easily say in advance exactly how it is to be done. But if one says that that is a debarring factor, one never starts on anything new.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman complained about the complexity of these proposals. That is something which often crops up. If we are honest, we will admit that all law is complicated when one looks at it. Even if I take the point, as I do, about the previous Administration's Bill, that it was never debated, and never amended, and therefore we cannot say that we saw the Bill in its final form, I still say that if one wants to see a complicated Bill, complicated beyond any chance of being simplified by Amendment, one has only to look at the right hon. Lady's Bill that was published just before the General Election last year. As my hon. and learned Friend said during a recent debate, it took twice the number of


Clauses to deal with unfair dismissal as the present Bill takes.<br/>
We have to accept that when dealing with a matter of this kind, or with almost any matter, the law relating to it, studied in a vacuum, always seems extremely complicated, and even when studied in practice will be complicated, but that is because it has to be fairly precise and, as far as possible, cope with all the possibilities that one can foresee.<br/>
The main point that has been raised arises on subsections (2) and (3) of the new Clause, where the Court is given power to rectify a mistake without taking a new ballot. If one says it like that, it sounds appalling, but if one reads the whole of subsections (2) and (3) the whole thing comes into somewhat clearer focus and a rather different perspective.<br/>
All that subsection (2) says is that where the Court decides that it would be just and equitable in the circumstances to amend the report so as to rectify the error without requiring a further ballot to be taken it can do so. The circumstance envisaged is that there is a genuine miscount and all parties are agreed that that is so, because for example a ballot box had been left out and was subsequently found. In those circumstances it seems totally unnecessary to go through the whole procedure again, but the parties concerned will have full rights to go before the Court, and if they do not think that what was done was equitable, and that another ballot ought to be taken, that argument can be made before the Court.<br/>
The next subsection provides that where the Court takes a different view from that taken in the circumstances to which I have just referred it has power to quash the ballot and any decisions arising out of it, and then one has to start again. I should have thought that if, in an industrial situation, all parties were satisfied, and the Court was satisfied, that the error was of the order that I have agreed, it would be sensible for the Court to take that action. We must remember that this Court has the status of a High Court. It is not some minor body. If we cannot in this country trust a body of this kind to decide whether, in the circumstances, something is just and equitable, and that the error is not one which requires a new ballot, I do not think that

we shall ever be able to trust anybody on anything.</p>

<p>Of course, I accept the hon. Gentleman's point that no Minister from this Dispatch Box can say how a court under our constitution will interpret an Act. We can only declare our intentions and try to assure the House that we think we have got words which will put our intentions into practice. If the courts interpret an Act contrary to Parliament's intentions, that, I understand, is one of the most frequent reasons why Parliament sometimes enacts amending legislation.</p>

<p>That may be true. We are starting a new type of procedure and it is of a different order of magnitude from that of elections of ourselves to this House and therefore the formation of the Government of this country.<br/>
The ballot is going to be conducted under the auspices of the C.I.R., and not by the employer or the union or anybody associated with the dispute. One should remember that. In addition, the Court has to look at complaints about the ballot having been wrong for some reason. If, and only if, the Court, having heard the case, believes that it would be just and equitable in the circumstances to amend the report without ordering a new ballot, it is given power to do so.<br/>
I should have thought that when we are dealing, as we are, with circumstances probably involving an industrial dispute, as much speed as we can achieve is necessary. This seems a sensible provision to make in a case where, for example, all the parties agree that the ballot is wrong because there has been a miscount arising from the temporary loss of a ballot


box I would have thought this was not a bad precedent to set in this very well defined field, particularly as subsection (3) makes it very clear that if the Industrial Court is not satisfied that it would be just and equitable to take into account a genuine mistake and to record it without causing everybody the trouble of having a new ballot, the Court has power to quash the ballot and start again. As I say, I think this is a reasonable provision. But the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Leith (Mr. Ronald King Murray) is right; I think this is a precedent and it is, therefore, a matter about which obviously there can be differences of opinion.<br/>
Perhaps I may say this to my hon. Friend the Member for Bosworth (Mr. Adam Butler). As I explained originally, the strike ballot in an emergency situation is of a different order&#x2014;a minor order in one sense&#x2014;because no obligations or duties or liabilities flow from that ballot. Therefore, while we want these ballots to be accurate, it is not the same as other ballots from which liabilities and obligations flow.</p>

<p>We understand the Minister's differentiation between the strike ballot and the other form of ballot. I assume that financial liability would not arise in the second place but that financial liability of some kind would arise in the first place. Are the Government handicapped by the absence of the C.I.R. and by their consequent inability to take soundings from it?</p>

<p>I mean in the sense that one pays for accounting clerks in the conduct of ballots at elections. How are these ballots to be conducted and at whose expense?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-08-04a.1669.3" hansard_membership_id="2146" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/11649" speakername="Mr. Carr" colnum="1669" time="">
<p>The cost of the C.I.R. and of its work, including the conduct of ballots, will fall on public funds. The parties will not be involved in any way.<br/>
So far as the strike ballot is concerned, I am advised that in theory the High Court could entertain an application for an order to quash the result of one ballot and order another one. I am told that that is the theoretical position. I am also advised that since no legal result

flows from a strike ballot, it is at least possible, if not probable, that the High Court might in practice decline to issue such an order. So I have to say to my hon. Friend that I cannot put my hand on my heart and say that I have a very satisfactory answer to his question.<br/>
We have to decide at any given moment on the number of safeguards that we put into a particular procedure, and we felt it was right to put the safeguards, the appeals and so forth, into this ballot procedure but we did not think it was right to do so in the case where no legal liabilities flow. In any case, in practical terms, the idea of a strike ballot is to provide an opportunity for workers to express their opinion in a serious national situation where there is evidence of different views among the workers affected in the dispute. If that opinion is challenged, it will carry less authority. It is the natural authority which a ballot of this kind will or will not carry which will have its influence. But it will not commit anybody to any liability or any action. To imagine that in an industrial dispute it would be practicable or helpful to say "Stop" and have it all over again, even if the ballot were suspect in any way, would be counter-productive rather than productive.</p>

<p>Do I understand that in the case of alleged serious misconduct there is no right of appeal? May I take an extreme example where the ballot is so close that the majority required is one or two only. If there is an allegation of misconduct, is there still no right of appeal?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-08-04a.1670.1" hansard_membership_id="2146" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/11649" speakername="Mr. Carr" colnum="1670" time="">
<p>There is the theoretical right to go to the High Court. However, I see my hon. Friend's point and I have said that I cannot properly satisfy it because we have had to make a judgment as to whether it would be right and helpful to set up the machinery in order to satisfy him. The ballots will be conducted by the C.I.R. who will become expert and professional in conducting them. I sincerely hope and believe that ballots conducted by a body such as the C.I.R. will command respect and will have integrity, and that there will not be grounds for charges of gross misconduct and so forth.<br/>
Nevertheless the authority of these ballots is only a natural authority. If it is so close as to be a matter of a few


votes one way or the other, I do not think it will help very much to resolve the dispute in question. I believe it could be helpful in resolving the dispute in question if such a ballot in those circumstances showed a pretty clear decision of opinion for or against. But if it is really narrowly poised, and since no natural rights flow from it, I doubt whether it would have much influence.<br/>
On balance, we decided that to provide machinery for questioning this sort of ballot, in view of the time delay that would be involved in that, with the possibility of holding it again&#x2014;all this happening while an industrial dispute was active&#x2014;would nullify the whole procedure. While I wish that I could satisfy my hon. Friend, we felt that there were some strong practical reasons for not providing the machinery, realising that this was a ballot which, according to the natural authority that it commanded, might be influential and might be influential for the good.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding what the right hon. Gentleman said about the other Amendments, he has done nothing to assuage my anxieties about No. 256. I am sure that if he has not satisfied me he has not satisfied my hon. Friend the Member for Salford, West (Mr. Orme), who also had some vocal support from some of my other hon. Friends. I share their view that, while the right hon. Gentleman's words are no doubt offered in good faith, it is for the Court to interpret the black and white of the Bill.<br/>
While I accept his view that common sense suggests that, if all the parties agree, there is no reason why they should not make the alteration, there is nothing about this in the Bill. What he proposes would put an extraordinary and unprecedented power in the hands of the Court. If and when we reach Amendment No. 256, we shall therefore seek to divide on it.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment.<br/>
Under the Clause as it stood, after an order had been made by the Court withdrawing a right to recognition, the Court was debarred from entertaining any subsequent application for two years from any other organisation of workers or trade union. The Government did not intend the Clause to have that effect. The Amendment is introduced to limit the bar on any subsequent application during the two years only to the organisation of workers from which the recognition has been withdrawn.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-08-04a.1672.1" colnum="1672" time="">
<p>The Amendment has the entirely benevolent effect of allowing a union which has not been displaced by reason of a withdrawal order to make application for recognition at any time thereafter, even though such an order has been made. In other words, it will limit the bar on a subsequent application simply any solely to the union from which recognition has been withdrawn. On that basis, I commend it to the House&#x2014;I hope, without fear of contradiction.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-08-04a.1677.6" colnum="1677" time="">
<p>This Amendment was moved in another place by the official Opposition and accepted by the Government. The intention of the Clause is that the employer's obligation to disclose information should start at the stage when management and unions get together to discuss definite proposals for a change in the terms and conditions of employment or a procedure agreement, but not before then. The requirement to disclose information is, therefore, limited by subsection (1) to the circumstances of collective bargaining between the employer's and trade union's representatives.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-08-04a.1677.7" colnum="1677" time="">
<p>Moreover, collective bargaining is defined in Clause 158(1) as meaning
<q>negotiations with respect to terms and conditions of employment, or with respect to the making, variation or rescission of a procedure agreement, or with respect to any matter to which in accordance with this section a procedure agreement can relate".</q>
This precise definition is needed because the Industrial Court will have to pay regard to it when failure to comply with Clause 54 results in complaints under Clause 98.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-08-04a.1677.8" colnum="1677" time="">
<p>It was always the Government's intention that the employer's obligation to disclose information should exist at all stages of collective bargaining, as defined. Indeed, we were confident that that would be the case under the Clause as drafted; but to put the matter entirely beyond doubt we are happy to recommend the House to accept the Amendment.</p>

<p>This Amendment concerns the situation when a union has received information orally from an employer but at some later stage in the same round of collective bargaining decides that it requires that information in writing. In this situation it would be anomalous to deny the union the right to written information which it could have received previously, had it wished, and the Amendment would write the union's entitlement into the Bill, which we believe is a desirable thing to do.<br/>
This right will extend only to information which the employer is obliged to disclose under Clause 54 and will not cover additional confidential information which the employer might disclose as an earnest of trust and good faith.</p>

<p>These Amendments are designed to clarify Clause 55 and also to stop one possible loophole. Although they achieve more than one object, they are so closely linked that they must be considered together. They fall into two groups. The first concerns the calculation of the number of persons referred to in subsection (1); that is, 500 as written in the Bill, but reduced to a smaller number by a later Amendment. Unlike Clause 54, this Clause applies only to employers with more than the qualifying number of employees. The present drafting leaves in some doubt the manner in which and the time at which this figure is to be calculated.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-08-04a.1680.0" colnum="1680" time="">
<p>Amendment No. 118 therefore provides that all employers who employ more than the minimum qualifying number of people at any one time in the financial year come within the scope of the Clause. Correspondingly, Amendments Nos. 120 and 123 make it clear that temporary, part-time and overseas workers are not to be included in the determination of the qualifying number. The reason is that these employees do not have the same degree of interest in the undertaking as have the normal full-time employees. It therefore seemed to us logical that they should not be taken into account in determining which undertakings should come within the scope of the Clause.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-08-04a.1680.1" colnum="1680" time="">
<p>Agriculture provides a practical example, though there are other industries. Certain agricultural enterprises may well employ, and often employ, a large number of people for a short time in the year, during the harvest, but for most of the year employ considerably smaller numbers which would not anywhere near bring them within the qualifying numbers. The hotel and catering industry provides us with another example.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-08-04a.1680.2" colnum="1680" time="">
<p>The thinking behind the Clause is that the need for statements and other forms of good communication is greatest in the largest enterprises. That is what has influenced our thinking on this question of size, and also on the question of the sort of people who should be included when calculating whether or not an undertaking qualifies under the Clause. We think that it would be anomalous to bring employers within the scope of the Clause merely because their activities required large numbers of people for a small part of the year.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-08-04a.1680.3" colnum="1680" time="">
<p>It is right that this information should be made available, and we have no sympathy with those companies which complain about the trouble caused by having to give information to their employees. But we should be careful before causing that amount of trouble to undertakings merely because for some special reason and for a very short time of the year they have a very much higher number of employees than they have for most of the year.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-08-04a.1680.4" colnum="1680" time="">
<p>Amendments Nos. 118, 121 and 122 and part of Amendment No. 125 are


intended to stop a loophole. The Clause as drafted only requires periodical statements which relate to the previous year, and it would, therefore, be technically possible, we realised, for an employer to evade the whole spirit of the Clause by issuing a statement perhaps once every seven years, so long as when he did issue the statement it applied to the previous year. The obvious intention is that the statement should be issued annually. While we did not envisage that many employers would attempt to escape the intended obligation, we felt it right to eliminate this technical loophole.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-08-04a.1681.0" colnum="1681" time="">
<p>The financial year has been chosen in preference to the calendar year because we think it more suited to the custom and accounting practice of individual employers. We expect, in any case, that much of the information in the statements will be financial, even though not all of it is, and so can be based more conveniently on the undertaking's financial year.</p>

<p>I hope to deal with this matter very briefly because we have here a clear, straightforward, simple issue. The Lords Amendment initially provided that under the disclosure requirements the number should be reduced from 500 to 350. We welcome that. Then my noble Friends sought to reduce the number to 200, but we have since had representations that revelation of information is of equal importance irrespective of the numbers in the establishment. Why should people be discriminated against just because they work in a small establishment rather than in a big place? It seems to us to be just as easy, if not easier, for a small employer to provide

the information as it is for a large employer.<br/>
In reading the OFFICIAL REPORT of the debates in another place I noted the intervention of the noble Lord who is, I think, the Leader of the Liberals there&#x2014;Lord Beaumont of Whitley&#x2014;who said that he saw no reason why the obligation should not apply to every firm. He described the obligation as the absolute basis of good industrial relationship no matter what the size of the firm.<br/>
The noble Lord having been so anxious to reduce the numbers, we had hoped on this present occasion to have the support of Liberal hon. Members. [HON. MEMBERS: "Where are they?"] It is a matter of deep regret that not only have the Liberal hon. Members not graced our debate this evening but, as far as I can recall, they have&#x2014;with the very eloquent and useful exception of the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Hooson)&#x2014;been absent almost throughout this stage of the Bill's progress. We note the absence of Liberal hon. Members who would have been able to support us in seeking to extend this beneficial provision to smaller employments. The difficulties that were once thought to exist are not, I am convinced, any longer a real obstacle.</p>

<p>With the spirit of what the hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Harold Walker) said, and with his ultimate intention, I have no reason to disagree. This is one of those maddening cases where Governments often tend to be stuffy for what they conceive, rightly or wrongly, to be sound, cautious reasons not only of administration but of feeling one's way. I have always been a very strong believer in the desirability of giving the people who work in an under taking the maximum possible information about that undertaking's affairs and its more general prospects and plans&#x2014;</p>

<p>One of the troubles there was that the employers did not themselves know what they were doing, so they were not exactly the people to tell their employees.<br/>
As I was saying, I believe in giving information. Nevertheless, this is a new concept of general practice. Many companies, large, medium-sized and small,


have done this for a long time. Unfortunately, in terms of the total number of companies, this is still the exception rather than the rule. Once the Bill becomes law, it will become increasingly the rule rather than the exception.<br/>
8.0 p.m.<br/>
There will be some need for experiment, for trial and error, in the best ways of giving the sort of information which is most meaningful to employees. One could simply say that every company, or at least every public company, should send a copy of its annual report to all its employees. That would be better than nothing; but I sometimes find annual reports difficult to understand. They vary in their comprehensibility.<br/>
There is no question of wanting to give employees less information than shareholders, far from it; but time will be needed for experiment and for trial and error about the most meaningful ways in which to give information to employees once it becomes a statutory requirement to do so rather than something which companies have developed, as I think rightly, as a matter of good practice.<br/>
We feel that we ought to start rather cautiously. As we believe that the main need for this provision is in the larger companies and as by definition the larger companies are of a relatively small number, we think it right to start with a relatively small number of larger companies and to learn by experience, but subsection (7) of the Clause empowers the Secretary of State to vary the figure when experience suggests that is desirable. It would be my intention to vary the figure downwards as quickly as possible.<br/>
My first judgment was that we should make 500 employees the minimum qualifying figure. As a result of pressure in another place, where 200 was suggested by the Opposition, as one noble Lord pointed out with great skill, we arithmetically exactly split the difference between 500 and 200 and came up with the figure of 350, which was acceptable to another place. I must advise the House that, to start with, this is as low a number as we should reasonably have and to go down in size would be greatly to increase the number of undertakings involved.<br/>
I believe that we should get the practice needed with this small number of undertakings in the first year or two and learn by trial and error before greatly increasing the number. I have to admit that this is a matter of judgment. This is our judgment, and I advise the House to stick to it. However, I can tell the hon. Member for Doncaster that I am in complete agreement with the spirit of what he says, and, for what it is worth, I assure the House that it is my intention to use the powers of subsection (7) to reduce the number sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>Did we not have an Amendment from the Government to postpone the date upon which the giving of information became obligatory in certain cases? The right hon. Gentleman then said what he has just repeated about the large number of small companies, and one understands that. But could he now be more explicit? The Lords Amendment would reduce the number of employees from 500 to 350, and my hon. Friends are asking for an even smaller number. Is 350 the kind of figure which the right hon. Gentleman has now power to postpone? He was not able to say earlier what kind of figure he had in mind, and he was able to give reasons for that, but we are now discussing figures and it is important for the House to know at what stage the employers we have in mind will be bound to give information to their employees.<br/>
At the moment, no matter what the figure is, it is apparently still the case that workers in a comparatively small factory will not get this information for some time. Until the right hon. Gentleman believes that the first stage is on course or has been accomplished, he will not make it obligatory for employers to give this information. We shall not know at what stage the giving of information by employers will be mandatory until we know what the right hon. Gentleman has in mind. For how long will he operate the power of deferment which he obtained in that earlier Amendment?<br/>
I agree with the right hon. Gentleman about the need for information, especially in small firms. The bigger firms do not have as much difficulty about getting this kind of information, but the smaller are most backward in organisation. We do not yet know at what stage the firms of


350 employees and fewer will be able to ask employers for information.</p>

<p>I assure the right hon. Member for Newton (Mr. Frederick Lee) that I intend in this instance to move straight to the figure of 350 and not to get down to it in stages. I cannot tell him precisely when, because once the Bill is law there will be many areas about which I shall have to consult, and this is clearly one where I shall have to consult closely with industry and the trade unions about the sort of regulations</p>

<p>needed to get the sort of information which is available to employers and useful to and wanted by employees. However, I can assure the right hon. Gentleman that I shall go straight to the 350 and as soon as possible thereafter use the regulating powers in subsection (7) to reduce the number still further.</p>

<p>This is a small but not unimportant Amendment. As the Bill stands, a person would be guilty of an offence if he made a statement which he knew to be false or recklessly made a statement which was false in furnishing information required by regulations made under Clause 56.<br/>
This could mean, for example, that an employer would be liable to prosecution simply because some minor and unimportant detail in his submission had gone unchecked and, therefore, was incorrect. The acceptance of this Amendment and Amendment 127 will make it clear that only if an employer submitted information which was incorrect to a significant degree would he be liable to prosecution.<br/>
Two other parts of the Bill, paragraphs 36(2) and 44(4)(<i>c</i>) of Schedule 3 also defines circumstances in which furnishing false information constitutes an offence. In both cases the offences will be committed only if the information submitted is false in a material particular. The Amendment and that associated with it will bring Clause 57 into line with these provisions.</p>

<p>These Amendments propose small changes in the wording of Clause 59 to bring it into line with the wording of Clause 84. Clause 59, as drafted, dealt only with the registration of workers' organisations as such. As a result of the establishment of the special register&#x2014;which was designed not for professional organisations but for bodies which by reason of their constitution as chartered or incorporated bodies could not qualify for registration on the ordinary register&#x2014;it has become necessary to make a small adjustment in the terms of Clause 59.<br/>
Once a body is on the special register, then, by Clause 84, it becomes an organisation of workers, but its terms of eligibility for entry on the special register are different from those set out in Clause 59 for entry on the ordinary register of organisations of workers. To make those two provisions match, there is a reference in Clause 84 to Clause 59. Corresponding cross-references from Clause 59 to Clause 84 are needed, and it is those which are inserted by the Amendments.</p>

<p>The Solicitor-General says that the Amendments make small alterations to Clause 59, but he would be


the first to recognise that they cloak a quite large point of principle and of policy. The purpose of the Amendments is to qualify the definitions of subsections (1) and (2) so as to provide that an organisation of workers whose principal object is not the regulation of the terms and conditions of employment of its members can still enjoy the benefits of the Bill by going on the special register.<br/>
An organisation of workers which does not register on the ordinary register and which is not qualified for the special register not only loses all the benefits of the Bill, but incurs severe penalties. It not only faces the risk of paying unlimited damages if it engages in an unfair industrial practice but loses certain tax privileges which it at present enjoys on its provident funds.<br/>
We all know whom the special register is designed to accommodate. The introduction of the concept of the special register here and elsewhere in the Bill is the result of urgent representations by the British Medical Association on its own behalf and on behalf of other professional bodies, like the Royal College of Nursing and the chartered engineers, which wanted the best of both worlds. They wanted to retain both their industrial relations activities as representing the interests of their members concerning their terms and conditions of employment and their educational and other purposes which were the basis on which their charters were granted or which were, they claimed, an equivalent part of their activities.<br/>
The Government had a very ready ear for the needs of professional groups of this kind, and the special register concept was introduced&#x2014;and this is why we are having to amend the Clause&#x2014;in order to give them the best of both worlds so that they did not have to give up their negotiating activities or the other activities on which their royal charters and other <i>raisons d'&#x00EA;tre</i> were based.<br/>
There is, however, a neat form of class distinction here. Other organisations of workers which also have excellent reasons for not wanting to register on the ordinary register are given no choice. They have to submit to the indignity of having to acquire a State licence to operate on the State's terms&#x2014;and those terms are embodied

in the Bill&#x2014;or become industrial outcasts.<br/>
In the Bill there is a succession of indications of the ways in which the Government intend to penalise organisations of workers which do not want to register on the ordinary register and for which the special register is not designed to cater. Not only do they lose the immunity of Section 3 of the 1906 Act on their industrial relations activities; they are given no bargaining rights under the Bill. They are even denied the privileges of the Terms and Conditions of Employment Act. If they are held to have committed an unfair industrial practice, they are liable for unlimited damages. Finally, the tax relief on their provident funds is placed in jeopardy.<br/>
There is a parallel here. Many organisations of workers which fully operate as trade unions have different facets to their activities. They are not merely bargaining units concerned wtih negotiating terms and conditions of employment for their members. They go wider. They, too, have their ideals and educational r&#x00F4;le. Above all, there is the humane aspect of the provident benefits which they provide for their members and which help to form a cohesive factor in the life of the organisation. They help to give it its morality and solidarity. They help to give their members their sense of comradeship. This has been a genuine aspect of their r&#x00F4;le in our society since the beginning of trade unionism. People banded together as brothers to protect each other in all sorts of ways, not least when it came to sickness or unemployment or in the event of other misadventures of life against which working people, in particular, are so defenceless. Therefore, these provident activities of unions have always been an integral part of their personality, and, I repeat, they are separate from and different from their industrial activities, as the educational work of the B.M.A. is different from its negotiating activities.<br/>
8.30 p.m.<br/>
Therefore, in our earlier discussion of this we advanced the proposition to the Government that they were exercising an intolerable piece of discrimination in this Bill against one type of organisation of workers, because, we argued, if an organisation of workers, if a trade union currently registered under the 1871 Act, did not register under this Government's


Bill on this Government's terms, which the unions find repugnant, then the rest of its activities would be placed at risk, because we know that the provident activities can operate successfully only with the benefit of tax relief to which they have hiherto, happily, been entitled in respect of those activities.<br/>
We got a good deal of support from the other side of the House. I remember the hon. and learned Member for Darwen (Mr. Fletcher-Cooke) getting up and saying, in a very fair and excellent speech, "Yes, of course, the provident activities of trade unions are entirely different from their industrial activities, and the unions ought not to be penalised for their provident activities because they do not wish to register for industrial relations purposes under the Bill."<br/>
This is a very basic point of principle, and so basic is it that the right hon. Gentleman himself got up and repudiated the suggestion that this was in any way the Government's intention. I remember that he did so when rejecting an Amendment which we put before him at that time to make the position of the provident funds of trade unions absolutely clear.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman, in our debate on the special register, had been arguiing that it would be quite wrong to subject the B.M.A., the lordly B.M.A., to the inconvenience of separating out its activities so as to avoid any difficulties under the Bill as it then stood. When we said to him, "Look, it is equally wrong, therefore, to ask trade unions to separate out their activities" and pressed an Amendment upon him to safeguard their tax reliefs, the right hon. Gentleman turned us down. Our proposition was that trade unions which did not want to register on the right hon. Gentleman's new register for industrial relations purposes should still be able to obtain tax relief for their provident activities provided they registered under the 1871 Act. We accepted his point that registration was a condition for that relief, but we said that for this purpose they should have their own special register, just as the B.M.A. is given one.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman turned us down on that; but he said he was not turning us down on ideological grounds. There were some hon. Gentlemen opposite who, in the usual truculent Tory

way, said, "It is quite right that if trade unions do not register they should lose tax relief". I am glad to say that the right hon. Gentleman disowned some of the more reactionary of the hon. Members behind him. "But", he said, "while I accept the principle, I am rejecting the Amendment because it is unnecessary." That was his argument. Let me quote what he said at that time:
<q>I assure the House that if it were necessary to set up a special register for trade unions which wished not to register in the industrial relations sense, so that they could continue the other half of their activities, their provident fund activities, I would propose a special register. But it is not necessary. I have gone into this most carefully. I am told that there is no technical, constitutional or legal difficulty. I am assured on technical advice that the Industrial and Provident Societies Act, 1965, or the Friendly Societies Act, 1896, is available for registering for the provident funds of unions which do not wish to register under the Bill in the industrial relations sense."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL RFPORT, 23rd March, 1971: Vol. 814, c. 335.]</q>
We pointed out to him at the time that even if his argument was correct he was still subjecting the trade unions to an inconvenience in the arrangement of their affairs that he was prepared to protect the B.M.A. against. But since he gave the House that assurance a lot of things have happened, and it is essential to examine them. I hope that he will listen carefully.<br/>
First&#x2014;I do not think that the right hon. Gentleman will deny this&#x2014;it is now admitted by his noble and learned Friend in another place that his reference to the Industrial and Provident Societies Act as being available for this purpose was wrong. He assured us that it would help. I understand that it is now accepted that the advice he had on that point was wrong. So we are left with the facilities and hopes available to the trade union movement under the Friendly Societies Act. Since our debates earlier in the House, in which the T.U.C. took a profound interest because some &#x00A3;5 million to &#x00A3;6 million of union funds are at stake here, the T.U.C. itself has taken the advice of two learned counsel as to what the position will be if the Bill goes through in its present form. The advice of learned counsel is that the right hon. Gentleman's reference to the protection of the Friendly Societies is wrong as well. As a result of this, the T.U.C. has sent out a circular


letter to its members which includes the following:
<q>The conclusion seems unavoidable that neither of these"&#x2014;</q>
neither of the Acts&#x2014;
<q>would provide a satisfactory means of securing tax exemptions. It is however possible that one or two unions might find the Friendly Societies' solution practicable in their own circumstances.</q>
<q>You will note that the Opinion of Counsel demonstrates that in his statement of March 23 Mr. Robert Carr was&#x2014;intentionally or otherwise&#x2014;giving a very misleading account of the operation of the Friendly Societies Act.</q>
It is a major interest of the T.U.C. that it should be able to assure its unions on this point, because it is official T.U.C. policy to advise its members not to register. It is hardly likely, therefore, to produce evidence of the disabilities of refusing to register unless it thought that the evidence was so sound that it should warn its members on this point.<br/>
I think that all of us will agree that every union has been led, as the result of the advice it has received, to act on the assumption that if it decides not to register it will be financially penalised through the withdrawal of this tax relief. Every article one reads in the Press as to the effect of the Bill follows the same theme. There was an article in <i>The Guardian</i> only a day or two ago about the agonising choice facing unions on the question of whether or not to register. It too assumed, totally contrary to what the right hon. Gentleman was telling the House, and as everyone assumed, that, of course, if a union did not register its tax relief would be placed at risk and almost certainly be not available.<br/>
I do not want to weary the House with the details of why the T.U.C.'s learned counsel argue that the protection afforded by the Friendly Societies Act is no protection at all. There was a complicated, complex and abstruse argument on this point in another place whether that Act applied only to organisations whose contributions were voluntary, and so on and so forth. The House over the past five days has had&#x2014;to use a vulgarism&#x2014;a belly-full of legal details and I do not want to add to them. Hon. Members can read in the Lords <i>Hansard</i> for 20th July the arguments advanced by Lord

Diamond, who quoted the T.U.C.'s learned counsel.<br/>
The point I want to make is this, and I put it moderately to the right hon. Gentleman because it is a matter of major substance. Surely he will admit that, at least, there is a legal doubt whether the advice he gave on the Friendly Societies Act is any more reliable than the advice he gave us on the Industrial and Provident Societies Act. When Lord Diamond and the Lord Chancellor debated this matter in another place, the Lord Chancellor was very frank about it. He more or less said that they should agree to disagree. He said:
<q>there is a considerable difference between the noble Lord, Lord Diamond, and myself about this matter. &#x2026; I can only leave the House to judge between us &#x2026;".</q>
He then repudiated the suggestion that the Secretary of State's honour was in any way at stake because he said that the right hon. Gentleman acted on the advice of the Solicitor-General.<br/>
The Lord Chancellor then made the moving statement:
<q>although I belong to a profession where we have to acknowledge that legal advice is not infallible, I know of no particular reason to believe that the Solicitor-General is wrong in this case."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>House of Lords,</i> 20th July, 1971; Vol. 322, c. 912 and 915.]</q>
That is the final word on this subject from the highest legal luminary in the land. It confirms in my mind that the Solicitor-General's monopoly in this Bill is now complete. He is the only one who understands it; and he is the one person whose word everybody, including the Lord Chancellor, now has to take as holy writ. If we cannot get anything more comforting than those words from the Lord Chancellor, I suggest that the right hon. Gentleman owes a duty to the House to fulfil the pledge he gave that he did not intend a trade union's provident funds to be penalised.<br/>
There are technical quite apart from legal considerations. Although the right hon. Gentleman has said that there are no technical, constitutional or legal difficulties, these have been admitted by Lord Drumalbyn during the discussions in another place. Lord Diamond quoted a letter he had received from Lord Drumalbyn on 30th June when they were exchanging a vast amount of correspondence on this matter. That letter


included the following words by Lord Drumalbyn:
<q>I would not, of course, wish to imply that it would be a simple matter for a trade union to take this step"&#x2014;</q>
that is the step of separate registration as a friendly society&#x2014;
<q>It might face problems depending on the provisions in its constitution and rules relating to the powers of its trustees, the nature of the provident benefits to be provided to members, and the method by which they are financed. At the very least it seems probable that the consent of members to major changes in union rules would be needed, and in some cases it seems quite possible that complex financial and actuarial questions might arise over the division of union funds and assets between those to be used for general purposes and those to be allocated to the friendly society taking over responsibility for provident benefits."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>House of Lords,</i> 20th July, 1971; Vol. 322, c. 909&#x2013;10.]</q>
In view of his noble Friend's letter, can the right hon. Gentleman in all honesty repeat tonight that he knows of no technical difficulty? If that is not a list of technical difficulties, I do not know what is. On the very best interpretation, this is hardly honouring the undertaking which the right hon. Gentleman gave the House.<br/>
8.45 p.m.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman showed enormous concern in protecting organisations like the B.M.A. from technical difficulties. In calling on him tonight to honour the undertaking which he gave, I suggest to him that there is a simple way out of the problem. At this stage, because of the restricted scope of the Lords Amendments and the fact that such an Amendment was never carried in the other place, we are estopped from introducing an Amendment now, but I put it to the right hon. Gentleman that he has a way out.<br/>
I understand that the Government have already recognised that there may be difficulties for unions which are on the provisional register and are not, therefore, fully registered for the purposes of tax relief. The Government have leaned over backwards to help them, no doubt because the right hon. Gentleman hopes that they will be the good boys who will register fully in due course. They have found an easy way to help them by announcing that it is proposed to bring in a Clause in next year's Finance Bill giving the same tax treatment to organisations

on the provisional register as though they were fully registered as trade unions.<br/>
A similar remedy is within the right hon. Gentleman's grasp in the present case. I believe that he gave his undertaking in good faith, but I assure him that very eminent people believe that, as the Bill stands, he is not in a position to honour the undertaking. So I ask him to give an assurance that if his advice proves to be wrong in the event and the legal and practical difficulties for trade unions are insuperable, the Government will in the next Finance Bill introduce a Clause to cover unions registered under the 1871 Act for tax relief purposes, as they are proposing to do for unions on the provisional register.<br/>
That is very little to ask if the right hon. Gentleman really meant what he told us in Committee.</p>

<p>A lot of the Government's argument springs from a complete misunderstanding of the history of the trade union movement in this matter. I cite the example of the union to which I belong, which, I believe, is more disadvantaged by the Bill than any other. Its present title is the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers. If one looks back into history, one can see how deeply inherent friendly society benefits are in that organisation.<br/>
We started as the Millwrights' Society in 1780. Friendly society benefits were inherent at that time for probably 1d. or 2d. a week. By 1825 we were part of the Steam Engine Makers' Society, by 1850 the A.S.E. and by 1920 the A.E.U. We became the A.E.F. and we are now the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers. Changes of that sort mark forward stages in the normal progression of an organisation. This is what I want the right hon. Gentleman to understand.</p>

<p>&#x2014;that when I take a section one A.U.E.W. card&#x2014;but it was the A.E.U. when I was working for a living&#x2014;into a factory, I take in not only a trade union ticket, not only a licence


to work, but a certificate of proficiency in the job. The ticket is not given unless a member is a skilled tradesman. There are still places on the Clyde where it is more important to take in the ticket than to take in indentures.<br/>
Built in throughout the years have been the friendly society benefits which were once characterised, I think, by a famous novelist as the first defence of the poor. Through the years those funds have been built up. The superannuation fund of my union is built in. No executive council, no ballot vote of the members&#x2014;nothing&#x2014;can interfere with it. It is a built-in fund which has nothing whatever to do with the industrial action of the union. And so it is with sickness benefits, funeral benefits and all sorts of other things which in the modern days of the Welfare State may seem rather small but are an essential part of the reason why people joined that union in days gone by.<br/>
I understand that the Minister said that this difficulty could be overcome if only we somehow rearranged the funds of the union. A great amount is at stake. I am being modest when I say that the penalties of the Bill would carry my union into the realm of &#x00A3;500,000 a year and that the whole trade union spectrum is disadvantaged to the tune of about &#x00A3;5 million a year. That is very considerable money.<br/>
I could understand when the Bill started&#x2014;although it was mistaken&#x2014;that we were concerned with industrial relations. We were not concerned with the disadvantaging of friendly societies, which is what the Bill does. One has only to consider what my right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mrs. Castle) has read out to know that there is considerable dubiety.<br/>
The law has always been an unknown quantity. When one considers the Taff Vale or the Osborne judgment one usually finds that one's expectation is overturned by a majority vote in the Court of Appeal or the House of Lords.<br/>
The late J. H. Thomas was absolutely sure in the Osborne case. I knew Osborne. He was a fellow townsman of mine. He was a Liberal born out of his time and not the miscreant that he was made out to be. J. H. Thomas was assured by the best lawyers in the land

that there was no case at all, but it went wrong. One has only to search one's legal memory to find the number of occasions that that sort of thing has happened in the House. A Minister assures us, "This is the law, the case is built in", but then we find that it is overturned in the Court of Appeal.<br/>
Who is the Lord Chancellor in the other place? Lord Hailsham. His father, who was also Lord Chancellor, made an expensive mistake here on the deportation of Irishmen. There was a very famous case in which Lord Hailsham was a great Parliamentary figure. He was one of those lawyers who was a natural, eloquent performer in this place. He was opposed by Sir Patrick Hastings on our side, who was not a good Parliamentary performer. When Patrick Hastings put up the case in about 1920 or 1921, he was almost laughed out of the House because his manner seemed so inept compared with Lord Hailsham. But when the court got hold of it it was Lord Hailsham who was turned over and this House had to bring in a Bill of Indemnity. I doubt whether the Solicitor-General would claim that he had the eminence of Sir Douglas Hogg, as he then was, but he was proved wrong. All that my right hon. Friend has asked is that if this is proved wrong the Minister should do no more than enter into an undertaking to right it in the Budget next year. That is a small thing to ask in a case like this.<br/>
The unions do not want a register. We understand that. They will probably have to face the penalties of the law. But we should not get over this business by twisting the necks of their sick and superannuated members. Let us make no mistake about it. If a union sacrifices &#x00A3;500,000 a year it means a reduction in investment policy. It also means that the penalty is inflicted upon the applicant seeking relief.<br/>
We say a great deal about the sturdy, self-respect of the British working class. It is no more ingrained than in the craftsman class. These people have ensured in other ways, apart from the State, for benefits which often take them beyond social security benefits. It is part of their self-respect. Yet, at the end of the day, we find that the Government have decided to treat craft unions somewhat less than the professional associations. They have


drawn a sharp line between them. But anybody who has looked at the practices of the professional associations&#x2014;the lawyers, the doctors or anybody else&#x2014;knows that they have their sanctions against members. Like the craft unions, they are just as much motivated by self-interest, if not more so. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will appreciate that he has got something to put right. He has given assurances to this House in good faith on which doubt has been cast by the law.<br/>
Every trade union, including my own, has sought the best possible legal advice. If I had been assured by my trade union that what the right hon. Gentleman wants can in fact be arranged, I should not be making this point tonight. After all, I have been a member of my trade union for 53 years.<br/>
I hope that the Minister will come clean on this matter, bearing in mind the great amount of doubt which has been cast on what he has said. I assume that he gave his undertaking in good faith. His good faith is not in doubt, but his judgment and the quality of the legal advice which has been given to him are in doubt. This is a matter where the stakes are high and mean so much to a most useful section of our society. Therefore, I suggest that the right hon. Gentleman should reconsider the position.</p>

<p>There is no doubt about the value of trade union provident funds. Many unions started their activities through their provident funds. Their membership grew because of the impact of these funds at a time when social security was not what it is today, and when the State was not involved in welfare of one sort and another.<br/>
Anyone who knows anything about the trade unions and who supports the work they have done in industry must feel a certain amount of sympathy for those who want to maintain union activity in this respect. It is true that in recent years there has been a considerable reduction of trade union activity in welfare and provident matters. I regret that somewhat, because I think there would be an advantage in trade unions getting away from concentrating on pure wage bargaining and increasing their activities in matters in which they have been involved for many years but in which they have reduced their activities recently.<br/>
In conversations that I have had with several trade union members, almost without exception they have said that this is an activity which they do not want to develop themselves because they think that the State ought to be more involved in it. They do not seek to diminish their responsibility, but they do not seek to develop it. This is unfortunate. I should prefer that it were otherwise, and it might be in due course.<br/>
I do not want to take sides in the dispute between the right hon. Lady the Member for Blackburn (Mrs. Castle) and my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General. I find it difficult to be certain whether on this issue the lawyers will not find themselves wrong in any event when a case comes before the Court. It may be that in a test case a union will find that things are much easier than it thought they would be. It may, equally, find things more difficult. Some unions may find things easier than others will. The solution, of course, is for the unions to register. If they do, there is no problem.<br/>
I think that there are great disadvantages in not registering. There will be disadvantages in another direction in any event, but I do not think that it would be worth while any Minister or Government setting out to force a union to register by getting at its funds, and I am sure that my right hon. Friend and the Government do not have that in mind. We are at the stage of the Bill where we have to take things as they are, and I support those who ask that perhaps this might be looked at in due course by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.<br/>
I say that because the issue may resolve itself over the next few months. It could resolve itself in a number of ways. First, the unions may register, although at present they say that they will not do so. But they may have a change of heart. They may decide that there are advantages in the Bill which they want which outweigh the disadvantages. Despite what has been said in this House, after a period of time the unions may want to register. If they were to do so, there would be no problem.<br/>
They may, on the other hand, go to the Court at an early stage, or at least one of them may do so, and that may resolve the problem. But, whatever action


is taken in the course of the next few months, I think that it is fair for us on this side of the House to ask my right hon. Friend to take good note of all that is said. Although he cannot anticipate the Budget&#x2014;that can be done only by the Chancellor himself&#x2014;if it so happens that in the course of the next year there is a difficulty which puts at hazard provident funds, which are out- with the normal activities of the union as an industrial bargaining organisation, the Chancellor will consider this to see whether he can assist otherwise, let us face it, the action that would be taken would not really be against the union as such, but would be against certain members of it, because only certain members gain any advantage from provident funds. They are usually those who are sick or old-age pensioners, who are not active and certainly not militant members. At this late stage in the Bill, if it is any consolation to right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite, I wish to say two things&#x2014;</p>

<p>I will give way in a minute. I want to make these points. First, it must be the aim of the Minister to get registration, and it is obviously my wish that there should be registration. Secondly, in the course of time this matter can be looked at again in the light of what I have already said&#x2014;the possibility that the unions themselves may be taking action, and secondly, in the light of what the Minister sees happening in the country arising from the effects of the Bill. If we leave the matter on that basis, I am sure that it will be concluded satisfactorily in due course.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. He said that only a given number of members of a union had an advantage from the provident fund. Is he aware that a very high proportion&#x2014;in the region of 90 per cent. plus&#x2014;pay contributions based upon the provident fund benefits? If the hon. Gentleman takes out an insurance that presupposes that he is catering for a situation that might arise. Therefore, every one of the members who pays on the basis of scales related to provident

<p>The hon. Member for Rutland and Stamford (Mr. Kenneth Lewis) has produced a number of logical points and I do not dissent from what he has urged upon the Minister. I want to make only one comment on what he has said.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman has invited the House to leave the matter in uncertainty, and that is a consequence which I cannot accept. Before the House parts with this legislation, it must be the duty of hon. Members to create reasonable certainty about the incidence of this legislation before we allow it to leave the House of Commons. That is essential. I do not comment in a carping spirit on what the hon. Gentleman has urged, but we need much more certainty than has been suggested.<br/>
As the Secretary of State well knows, we are discussing one of the two most critical areas of this legislation. It has been the contention of the Secretary of State that he has felt aware of his function as Minister of Labour in his present office, whatever the name of that office. He has said many times that he fully accepts the case when it is urged upon him that it puts him in a special position among Ministers. In fact, as Minister of Labour, he has denied that there is any attempt at vindictiveness in this legislation.<br/>
There have been two main critical areas throughout these debates. The first has been the charge that the Secretary of State and the Government are deliberately attempting to reduce the strength and power of the trade unions. The right hon. Gentleman has always rejected that charge, although he has left us unconvinced.<br/>
The second main area of criticism is that in parts of the Bill&#x2014;this is one&#x2014;the Secretary of State is trying to hit trade unionists, whether they are engaged in industrial conflict or not. He has


many times protested that that charge was unworthy&#x2014;</p>

<p>I am glad to have the agreement of the hon. Member that that is what the right hon. Gentleman said.<br/>
This is a test case. The passing reference to militants by the hon. Member for Rutland and Stamford which was taken up by my hon.

<p>That is an epithet which the hon. Gentleman will probably accept.<br/>
We are now in the second most critical area, concerning the social activities of unions. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. C. Pannell) with his profound experience of the trade union movement has said, this is part of the essence of every union&#x2014;from the Transport and General Workers Union, to which I belong, to many small unions covering only a small range of industrial activity. No one can understand the growth of the trade union movement without understanding that side of its activities.<br/>
The Secretary of State has said many times that he wants no part of any attack on the provident funds of the union, but, if he makes no further assurance, he will be convicted of two crimes&#x2014;vindictive legislation and an attempt to coerce unions to register against their democratic decisions.<br/>
We have quoted Mr. Victor Feather's reasons for opposing registration, and since Committee stage there have been many union conferences which have discussed this matter. Since it is the essence of the right hon. Gentleman's case that he is not coercing unions to register in this roundabout way, surely he should pay due regard to what was said at those conferences.<br/>
9.15 p.m.<br/>
It is the duty of the Government to accept the burden of the case we are making and agree that a way out must be found. I am not at present commenting on the proposal made by my right hon. Friend, who has been in touch with all sections of the trade union movement through the T.U.C. It is open to the Minister to consider a range of methods to deal with this problem. Either way, he must find a way out and say tonight that he accepts the general case being urged on him.<br/>
It would create far too much uncertainty for the Secretary of State to accept the case of the hon. Member for Rutland and Stamford. One cannot say in this matter that the problem may resolve itself or that there may be a test case. A responsible Government must accept the logic of the situation and show that they are prepared to provide a remedy.<br/>
On many occasions since the Bill was introduced people have said that the Government have set out, in cold blood, to weaken the trade union movement and to use all sorts of methods to bring about a weakening of the movement's industrial activities. The Government have repeatedly replied that those who make these allegations are misguided, though little impact has been made on the trade union movement by the assertions of the right hon. Gentleman and his colleagues.<br/>
We are discussing a matter that goes beyond contentions about the purpose of the Government in respect of trade union activity. We are branching out into the whole sphere of humanitarian social provision. In this instance, the Government must respond to our case and give an assurance that they accept what we are urging on them. We must also be given a clear indication of the way out the right hon. Gentleman intends to provide, and if this is not done the Government will stand convicted of the allegations that have been made about them.</p>

<p>I intend to concentrate on one issue and one section of people. I refer to the Derbyshire miners, though to be accurate I am really speaking of those who have left the industry.<br/>
In 1969, when I was their president, there were 15,000 Derbyshire miners belonging to the N.U.M. Out of their contributions of 3s. a week&#x2014;the overall


amount contributed was gradually reduced because of the loss of 23,000 jobs in the mines in 12 years&#x2014;1s. 10d. went in old-age benefits. About &#x00A3;70,000 was allocated by the N.U.M. out of its funds not to members of the mining industry but to those who had left it.<br/>
The matter did not rest there. In the 'fifties, with pits closing at a fast rate, it was found necessary in the Derbyshire area to introduce a scheme to provide concessionary coal for retired miners and their widows. To this end, the miners contributed a proportion of their own concessionary coal.<br/>
There have been a lot of misconceptions. Many people thought that Lord Robens and the Coal Board had always provided the concessionary coal, but in Derbyshire, as elsewhere, it has been provided by the miners themselves. With the closure of the pits in the late fifties and into the sixties it was found that the four tons a year of concessionary coal for miners and widows of retired miners could not be continued unless something was done, so the miners, with the solidarity that has been evident among them for more than a century, surrendered 10s. of the 11s. 9d. in the price of the coal. It was only then that Lords Robens or someone else decided as a <i>quid pro quo</i> to add 10s. to each 10s. contributed by the miners. Yet, I repeat, this was done for those who had left the industry.<br/>
Gradually, that concession proved to be not enough, and in my last year as president of the union in Derbyshire we decided to contribute &#x00A3;47,000 out of union funds. That was in addition to the &#x00A3;70,000 already contributed in old age benefits at the rate of &#x00A3;74 per member. It did not rest there. It was decided in the same year to spend another &#x00A3;30,000 on giving retired miners and widows, and in some cases families, a holiday at Skegness. Every penny piece came from the Derbyshire miners.<br/>
The people concerned are not people who will have an opportunity to decide whether they should register. They are not even members of the union. Therefore, if the Government let this wording go through as it is they will not be attacking the 13,000 miners of Derbyshire but those countless thousands of retired miners and widows of miners who have benefited from the old

age benefits scheme, the holiday scheme and the concessionary coal scheme, which they think will last for a lifetime. It is high time that the Government stopped attacking the mining industry as it has been doing during the last 15 months, and started carrying out their so-called honest policy of which the Prime Minister spoke on 18th June last year.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Bolsover (Mr. Skinner) has presented to the House a pertinent and moving description of how the trade unions deal with their provident funds. There is a long history behind these provident funds. In the early days they were built up of halfpennies and pennies, until we had accumulated thousands and then millions of pounds for the benefit of members, many of them no longer working at the trade, or perhaps suffering from industrial injury, or fallen on hard times. The trade union movement has maintained the provident funds even in the Welfare State in which the Government have made some dents. We have been told by the Secretary of State for Social Services that people must stand on their own feet more, must make their own provision. The trade unions realise that there is still a need for their provident funds.<br/>
I am proud to be a president of my own trade unions branch, and I have been for the last 21 years. Once a fortnight on a Friday evening 30 or 40 superannuated members come to the branch meeting to collect their superannuation to which they have contributed. They are the people who will be penalised by these proposals.<br/>
The trade union movement firmly believes that the Government are continuing with this proposal as a means of forcing trade unions to register. I speak not from hearsay but from having attended branch meetings and meetings of shop stewards and other trade union meetings throughout the country when I say that if the Secretary of State wants to mitigate the bitterness already created, if he does not want the trade union movement to be driven beyond being able to accept a reasonable solution from the Government&#x2014;and as things are going it will be completely impossible if the Bill goes on the Statute Book&#x2014;if he does not want even more deterioration in the situation, he must do something about this matter.<br/>
Some of my hon. Friends and I recently met the executive council of the A.E.U.W.


We were then told that the union's best legal advice, the advice not just of one adviser but of two or three, was that it would be impossible to offset the cost of this money and that the union would have to meet it, that the only way it could get round the problem would be by putting its provident funds into the hands of members over whom it would have no control; and it is impossible for my union to separate these moneys, because of the way in which it is constructed and organised.<br/>
Many of us believe that the right hon. Gentleman gave us an assurance in Committee. He has not sought to address the House on this subject in the last five days and it is only through the ingenuity of my right hon. Friend that we have been able to debate it at all. He owes the House and certainly the trade union movement an explanation. The only way out for him and his right hon. Friends is to seek some way to protect these funds so that the argument may be carried on at another level, so that the Government do not try to force the trade unions to register by threatening their sick, industrially injured and old members.</p>

<p>It would be impudent if I were to attempt to detain the House for long, because I was not present during the earlier part of the debate. My hon. Friends have discussed the Government's intentions. I have never had any allusions about the Bill or the Government. I said many times in Committee and on Report that the Bill was designed as a deliberate measure&#x2014;to use the words of right hon. Gentlemen opposite before and during the General Election&#x2014;to cut the unions down to size. That is the sum total of it.<br/>
What I cannot understand is that the Government should be prepared not merely to shackle the trade unions over industrial disputes through the legal technicalities of the Bill but to be so spiteful and vindictive as to attack the unions through those who have tried to provide additional benefit for themselves over and above that which the union provides when they are sick or unemployed. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bolsover (Mr. Skinner) so graphically put it, these men may leave the industry and seek benefit from the unions which are prepared to provide it, at some cost and sacrifice,

because of the contribution which these people have made to the industry.<br/>
The Government have only one point to answer here. They have to say why, if societies normally known as provident societies, such as the Oddfellows, the "Buffs" and the various other societies, obtain the benefits of tax concessions on the basis of benefits paid to their members because they are registered under the Provident Socities Act, trade unions providing exactly the same benefits for their members should not be treated in the same way. If they cannot answer that I can only deduce that the requirement for trade unions to register to safeguard their position as a provident society is a further sanction upon the unions.<br/>
If I were a member of a Government seeking to obtain the co-operation of the trade unions because of our financial and trading position I would want to be able to demonstrate clearly that any action of mine which differentiated between the unions and the provident societies was not based on discrimination against the unions. It would be a gloomy outlook for us without their cooperation. Maybe the right hon. Gentleman has reasonable grounds for imposing this additional requirement, but if he has not, then I charge him with discriminating against the unions in cold blood, as a method of playing on the deficiencies of an individual member, whether sick or unemployed, to dragoon the unions into registration.</p>

<p>The right hon. Lady the Member for Blackburn (Mrs. Castle) began her speech on this important matter by entering the argument through the door of the special register. She said that I was prepared to do something for the wonderful British Medical Association which I was not prepared to do for other people. Whatever may be the rights and wrongs of this case, that is certainly not one of them, because I am sure that she must know that that argument is totally irrelevant, for the following reason.<br/>
The special register, which we provided for companies and chartered bodies which also carry out industrial relations activities, carries exactly the same responsibilities as the ordinary register under the Bill. Bodies which go on the special register accept no more but equally no


less than ordinary trade unions and organisations of workers do when they register. When they go on the special register, bodies like the B.M.A. and the Royal College of Nursing accept the public accountability of registration which is the inherent principle in the concept of registration in the Bill for the conduct of industrial relations. Bodies which go on the special register accept the very degree and the kind of public accountability which some unions are at the moment saying they will refuse to accept. Therefore, whatever may be the rights and wrongs of the main issue, the special register argument is a red herring which is not concerned with it.<br/>
In the debate on 23rd March I assured the House that if it were necessary to set up a special register for trade unions which, although not wanting to register with the new Registrar of Trade Unions and Employers' Associations, nevertheless would need the benefit of an amendment to the Bill to preserve and continue their provident fund activities, I would propose such an amendment. I most certainly stand by that assurance.<br/>
I said in the earlier debate that I did not consider that a special register was necessary. Since then I have again carefully studied the position and the case which has been advanced to the contrary, and I assure the House that I remain convinced that such a register is not necessary. It is true that on 23rd March I mentioned two Acts as being possible ways by which trade unions could solve this problem if they decided not to register or to leave the provisional register when they were on it. I accept, as a result of further investigation, that the Industrial and Provident Societies Act is not helpful in this respect. But I am convinced that the other Act, the Friendly Societies Act, is helpful.<br/>
I should like to spend a few moments examining the reasons for that opinion. The legal opinion obtained by the T.U.C. not only has been dealt with in debate in another place but has been the subject of meetings and correspondence and has been looked into very carefully. I wish to deal with the major difficulties which the advice received by the T.U.C. seemed to present and to try to explain why we believe the difficulties are not of the kind which were supposed.<br/>
I gather that, according to the advice received by the T.U.C. the first major difficulty was that membership of the unregistered trade union and that of the associated friendly society which it would have to set up might diverge. But, even if that were to happen, I would regard it as no more than a disadvantage, certainly not as an insuperable difficulty. However, I cannot see that it need be so in this case on the ground which was put forward, relying on the advice which was given to the T.U.C. that the requirement of Section 8 of the Friendly Societies Act, 1896&#x2014;that membership of the friendly society must be voluntary&#x2014;must preclude the maintenance of common membership with the trade union.<br/>
We do not agree that this is so. This requirement would not prevent a friendly society from adopting a rule limiting membership to persons who were members of a particular trade union. Indeed, there are examples of registered societies with just such rules. Moreover, there is, in our view, no reason for assuming, if a trade union found it necessary in its particular circumstances, that membership of a friendly society should not be made a condition of membership of the trade union, though I am bound to say I do not clearly understand, from what I have heard so far, in what kind of circumstances a union would find it necessary to ensure that all its members were members of a linked friendly society.<br/>
I say that because I know that the majority of trade unions at present do not require their members to contribute to their provident schemes as a condition of membership. Such schemes are, I think, normally optional, and trade unions seem quite able to cope satisfactorily at the moment with two classes of members, those who contribute to the provident funds and those who do not. Be that as it may, I see no reason why a union should not have such a rule as that to which I have referred if for some reason it wanted to do so.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman is advancing the argument that unions can separate their friendly society functions now. That is true. But take the case in point, which I know best. Section one membership has to be complete membership. It has to be. The sections three, four, five membership does not carry the same prestige as that


of trade unions. I have known an admiral boast about his membership of my union&#x2014;under section one; but he could not belong under any other.</p>

<p>I have just said that I see no reason why a trade union, if it forms a separate friendly society, should not have a linking rule of the kind I have mentioned. I am sure the right hon. Gentleman would be fair enough to admit that the point he has made was not part of the assurance which I gave the House on 23rd March. Nevertheless, I see no reason why such a linking rule should not be made.<br/>
I would add the fact that the friendly society must be a separate organisation&#x2014;as it must, technically&#x2014;but that does not mean that it cannot have any link with a trade union in respect of those who govern it and in respect of control of its funds. Certainly, the trade union itself could not run the friendly society as a trade union, but if the friendly society has a substantial common membership with the trade union&#x2014;which, after all, is precisely the kind of circumstance we are envisaging&#x2014;there is no reason why persons who have been elected to the governing body of the trade union could not be elected by members of the friendly society to equivalent governing posts in the friendly society. After all, they will be the same people choosing in both cases.</p>

<p>This is a very important point which the right hon. Gentleman is now enunciating, but is it true?

<p>I do not really see that that would be shocking if that were so. No part of the assurance I gave would affect it in that way. There would be nothing in that to prevent members of a trade union from carrying on provident activities which they are at present carrying on. If they choose&#x2014;I think it unlikely, but presumably they will do it if they have good reason&#x2014;to have different numbers of their members to run the provident side of their activity, that is

something that they must be free to do. But I do not see why they should do it.</p>

<p>The leadership of the trade union is responsible for the investment of its funds and the return that it requires from its property.

<p>I made it clear on 23rd March that of course they must be separated. It is no part of our intention, and I have never suggested that it is, that in some way specially protected provident funds should all be mixed up with the industrial relations fighting funds of an unregistered organisation of workers. Nothing I have ever said could conceivably have been taken to suggest that I have anything like that in mind. The assurance which I gave, and which I stand by, is that it should be possible for a union which decides not to register under the new scheme of registration to take measures without insuperable difficulty to enable it both to protect its present provident funds and continue its provident fund activities.<br/>
As I said in March, the way to do this is by setting up a separate friendly society. That was my assurance. The argument we have had to meet is the suggestion that, contrary to the advice I was given, it would not be possible to do this, that there would be insuperable difficulties. That is the charge which has been made against me and that is the charge which I am answering, so do not let us get confused. I am not trying to deal with the general dislike of the hon. Members opposite to the whole question of registration. What I am answering, and answering categorically, is the charge that I was wrong when I assured the House in March that provident funds and provident activities could be protected by transferring to a separate friendly society. I am not saying that this is something the unions want to do, but it is something that they could do. I am defending that assurance on the ground that it is possible to do it. I am not presenting it to the House as something which these


organisations would wish to do, but I am saying, just as I said in March, that it is something they can do. I will go on to deal with the difficulties which were put up against the possibility of doing what I said.</p>

<p>This is an extremely important aspect of the whole business of registration. Can we take it, from what the right hon. Gentleman is saying, in relation to what he told us on 23rd March, that the Registrar will require the separation of friendly society funds from union funds if registration is to be allowed? The right hon. Gentleman has said that the Registrar will require a separation of these two things; at least, in the right hon. Gentleman's opinion, the Registrar could insist upon the separation of friendly society funds from the rest. On the other hand, if a union does not register, the right hon. Gentleman is now proposing that the only way possible for it to continue to receive benefit from income tax allowances or concessions is to have possibly two executives controlling its two functions.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman is putting what I said the other way round. If unions register under the new Bill they will be able to continue, as I understand it, as they are at the moment. What I was saying, repeating what I said two months ago, was that when we were talking about how we might protect the provident activities and provident funds of unions which chose not to register they would have to separate those provident funds. If any hon. Member refers to the HANSARD of 23rd March he will see that that is what I was saying.<br/>
I have now dealt with the first major difficulty put forward in the legal advice to the T.U.C. on the ground that there was an insuperable difficulty in doing what I suggested should be done on 23rd March.<br/>
The second major point of difficulty from this advice was that a friendly society set up by the members of the trade union would not be able to be financed by a transfer of funds from the trade union on the ground that Section 8 of the Friendly Societies Act, 1896, requires that the benefit paid by the society must be provided by voluntary

subscription of the members. However, what that section actually provides is that benefits should be provided
<q>by voluntary subscription of the members thereof"&#x2014;</q>
and then come the important words
<q>with or without the aid of donations.</q>
This specific reference to donations in our view would enable a friendly society to accept the funds initially transferred to it from the trade union without jeopardising its status as a friendly society. There is no doubt that thereafter the friendly society could not be financed solely by donations from the union, but provided that subscriptions to friendly societies were payable by its members the society would be able to receive further donations from the unions if this were thought necessary or desirable. That was the other major difficulty, and we are convinced that is not an insuperable one.<br/>
Another point, though less important, related to the differences in the range of benefits available to members of friendly societies compared with those for which a trade union may obtain tax relief under Section 338 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act, 1970. The only differences suggested in the advice received by the T.U.C. which might be significant is that benefits provided by a friendly society must be
<q>for the relief or maintenance of the members or of their dependants</q>
whereas trade unions may provide benefit to the sick, injured or unemployed members without any similar qualification.<br/>
The Registrar of Friendly Societies has stated that he does not share the view that the words
<q>relief or maintenance of the members</q>
imply that a claimant for benefit from the funds of a friendly society must be in poverty or need. In fact, he tells us that friendly societies have always paid benefit to their members when sick irrespective of any question of need, and in practice there will be no difference in this respect from the position adopted by trade unions.<br/>
Thus, having examined the legal submission fully and in detail, I am satisfied that it has not been shown that there are technical, legal and constitutional difficulties which would prevent a trade union continuing its provident activities by the setting-up of a friendly society.<br/>
It must be within the knowledge of many hon. Members, though it may be of interest to remind the House as a whole, that there are two well known unions, N.A.L.G.O. and the National Union of Teachers, which already have separate friendly societies, the condition of membership of which is that the would-be member of the friendly society has also to be a member of the respective union. There are at least two cases&#x2014;I believe I could find more&#x2014;of unions which have already done what I am proposing they could do if they wished.<br/>
I did not say last March that this was something which a union would want to do, but I gave an assurance that it was something which it could do, and that I genuinely believe to be so. I am convinced that it is so. The difficulties which have been put forward have been closely examined, and I believe that the answers which I have given tonight are firm and definitive answers to the difficulties which have been advanced. I stand by my assurance, and I believe that it will prove to be correct.</p>

<p>By leave of the House, I should like to comment on what the right hon. Gentleman has said.<br/>
He has not advanced the argument any further; nor has he answered the points which I raised. He has merely repeated at length the very arguments about detailed questions on the Friendly Societies Act which were put forward by the Lord Chancellor in the other place, that is, the arguments which I said I would spare the House when I spoke earlier because they were irrelevant to my main argument. Those arguments were irrelevant, first, because they represented only one legal opinon, the opinion which the Lord Chancellor was giving to the other place, and that was not even his opinion. He frankly admitted that he was basing his legal analysis on the Solicitor-General's point of view. It was in that context that the Lord Chancellor made the observation which I quoted earlier:
<q>&#x2026; although I belong to a profession where we have to acknowledge that legal advice is not infallible, I know of no particular reason to believe that the Solicitor-General is wrong in this case."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>House of Lords,</i> 20th July, 1971; Vol. 322, c. 915.]</q>
The fact that the Lord Chancellor does not know of any particular reason to

doubt the Solicitor-General's advice does not require us in the House of Commons to take the hon. and learned Gentleman's word as holy writ. When I am advised that learned counsel who have to give detailed consideration to this problem for the T.U.C. come to a view different from that of the Solicitor-General, I am, to say the least, entitled to say that the legal arguments are not proved.<br/>
The Secretary of State says that he stands by his view that there is no insuperable difficulty to the separation of the provident funds of a trade union from its other funds so as to continue to qualify for tax relief. If there really were no insuperable difficulty, why should trade unions which are determined not to register not take the steps which he says are not insuperably difficult? They stand to lose money if they do not. Why on earth should trade unions which are anxious to persuade their members to endorse their decisions not to register then say: "We are sorry, but, on careful examination of the situation, we find that if we do not register we lose this tax relief because it is impossible for us to separate our provident funds in this way"?<br/>
Who is the judge of the insuperability of the difficulties in this situation?&#x2014;not the facile and plausible Secretary of State but the trade union movement, which has its back to the wall.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman has made no attempt to answer the points which Lord Drumalbyn made in his letter to Lord Diamond about the technical difficulties. The right hon. Gentleman has repeated that he saw no technical difficulties. Let me remind him of what Lord Drumalbyn said:
<q>At the very least it seems probable that the consent of members to major changes in union rules would be needed, and in some cases it seems quite possible that complex financial and actuarial questions might arise over the division of union funds and assets</q>
in the way the right hon. Gentleman is suggesting. All I can say is that if complex financial and actuarial difficulties are not technical difficulties&#x2014;</p>

<p>Amendment No. 130 makes one change relating to a federation of workers' organisations only. The effect of that change is to allow a federation of workers' organisations to include among its membership not only workers' organisations as such but organisations which are registered on the special register. In other words, a federation can include the two different kinds of workers' organisation, whether registered on the ordinary register or on the special register.</p>

<p>The other change which is made, in respect of both federations of workers'

organisations and federations of employers' organisations, is of a slightly different kind, although technical. As Clause 59 stands, a federation of workers' organisations is something which consists wholly or mainly of organisations. Defined in that way it could include an amalgam or merger of organisations whose membership was made up of individual members. In other words, it would be not a true federation of organisations but an amalgam of organisations composed of individuals. The effect of the change, which is to substitute an organisation
<q>' whose membership consists wholly or mainly&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>(<i>a</i>) of constituent or affiliated organisations '".</li>

is to make it plain that the federation has to be a true federation of organisations made up of organisations whose membership consists of organisations rather than one whose membership consists of ordinary members. Exactly the same change is made by Amendment No. 131 which refers to a federation of employers' organisations.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment.<br/>
Perhaps it will be convenient if, with this Amendment, we take Lords Amendment No. 133, in page 51, line 36, leave out subsection (4).<br/>
I can briefly summarise the purpose of these Amendments. The Bill originally laid down that the registrars had to be legally qualified. While it is desirable that legal expertise should be available to registrars, it is not essential that the registrars themselves should be legally


qualified. Other qualifications, such as a knowledge of industrial relations and so forth, are just as important.</p>

<p>The Amendments will make it easier to make the most appropriate appointments in the future. Although the registrars will take over certain adjudicatory functions from the present registrars of friendly societies, these will henceforth be subject to the new right of appeal to the Industrial Court, and that new right of appeal over adjudicated decisions by the registrars seems to us to remove the last major obstacle of principle which prevented the registrars themselves from being other than legally qualified. Therefore, we believe it is right that the Bill should provide that the registrars, while they could be legally qualified, need not have to be.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment.<br/>
This is a drafting Amendment. It rephrases part of Clause 63(6) which establishes the right of members of an organisation of workers to vote "without interference or constraint". Although we did not think that the present drafting of the subsection would lead to serious difficulties of interpretation, we had no objection to the revised drafting which was suggested by Lord Diamond in another place. We certainly fully intend that the opportunity to vote without interference or constraint should be given whatever method of voting is used, whether by

ballot, a show of hands or by any other method. If the term "casting his vote" could be taken to refer only to voting in a ballot, we are glad to remove any doubt in this matter by replacing it with the word "voting.".</p>

<p>It is more convenient to start with an explanation of Amendments Nos. 278, 279 and 280. These are all Amendments to the definition Clause, Clause 158. They are Amendments to the definition of "a strike". Amendments Nos. 278 and 279 have the effect of removing from that definition the phrase
<q>which is concerted by them</q>
and replacing it by the simple adjective "concerted". It has to be a concerted stoppage of work by a group of workers.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-08-04a.1729.0" colnum="1729" time="">
<p>On that footing, I come back to the earlier Amendment, No. 135, which is probably the most important. It applies to Clause 63, which contains the guiding principles for workers' and ememployers' organisations. Subsection (7) provides that no member of the organisation should be subject to any unfair disciplinary action, in particular because of his refusing or failing to take any action which would constitute an unfair industrial practice. So far, the matter is unchanged. The provision would have made it unfair for an organisation to discipline a member for declining to take action which would itself be unfair, which meant declining to induce, call or procure a strike or lock-out in certain circumstances. That part is unchanged.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-08-04a.1729.1" colnum="1729" time="">
<p>Paragraph (<i>b</i>) provided that no action should be taken against a member who refused or failed to participate in an unfair practice. That probably added nothing to paragraph (<i>a</i>). Someone participating in an action would still be participating in the calling, inducing or procuring. The intention was to make it unfair for an organisation to discipline someone for refusing or failing to take part in a strike or lock-out called by the organisation if it was itself an unfair industrial practice.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-08-04a.1729.2" colnum="1729" time="">
<p>The intention is clear and is now set out in Amendment No. 135. It becomes an unfair practice for an organisation to take disciplinary action against a member who has refused or failed to take part in a strike which the organisation or any other person has called, organised, procured or financed, and which amounts to an unfair industrial practice. Similarly, it is unfair to discipline someone for refusing or failing to take part in other irregular industrial actions of the same kind. The other point which the Amendment makes clear is that it will be unfair for an organisation to discipline a member who has refused or failed to take part in a strike or irregular industrial action organised otherwise than in

contemplation or furtherance of an industrial dispute; in other words, a refusal to take part in an industrial action directed towards political or other non-industrial ends.</p>

<p>If someone declines and is thereafter disciplined, he can complain of an unfair industrial practice. It is probable that such action would be regarded as con trary to common law now in any event, but it was urged upon the Government in another place that the matter should be set beyond doubt, that it was unfair for a worker to be disciplined for re fusing to take part in a political strike. The urging in that direction came from, among others, members of the Liberal Party in another place. At least one member of the Labour Party went on record as saying that nobody on his side of the Committee supported poli tical strikes&#x2014;</p>

<p>I said the probability was that action taken against someone for not taking part in a political


strike was contrary to the common law. I do not want to go further than that on this point because I understand that there may be a case coming before the courts in which that point will be decided.<br/>
This point could be argued in many different ways. The argument has been conducted by reference to the General Strike, and the view of Lord Simon is on the record, as are the views of Professor Goodhart and Sir Stafford Cripps. As I say, I do not want to say more on this point because the matter may be coming before the courts.</p>

<p>What will be the position if the reverse happens&#x2014;for example, when dockers from the T. &#x0026; G.W.U. took part in an unofficial march in support of the right hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Powell) a couple of years ago and were reprimanded by the executive of their union? This is exactly the reverse of what the hon. and learned Gentleman has been discussing. If their union disciplined them for doing that, would that constitute an unfair industrial practice?</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman's question is in two halves. He asks, first, whether it would be an unfair industrial practice. The answer is "possibly not" in the present state of the law. As for the position under the Bill, if the union were taking or projecting disciplinary action against someone for taking part in a political strike, it would not then be disciplining someone for refusing or failing to take part in it. It would, therefore, be doing exactly the opposite of that prescribed in the Bill. So the answer to his question is that it would not be an unfair industrial practice.<br/>
I suggest that the Amendment represents the desire and wish of the overwhelming majority of fair-minded people that it is not right for someone who declines to take part in industrial action on the instructions of an organisation in pursuit of an objective to be disciplined for his failure to take part in that action. It is to make that clear in response to representations from many parties and people, in line with the Opposition in another place&#x2014;[<i>Interruption</i>.]&#x2014;with at least one member of the Labour Opposition in another place&#x2014;and with the general wish of the country, and I therefore

commend the Amendment to the House.</p>

<p>We believe this to be a curious and very dangerous Amendment. It was never introduced, or even proposed to be introduced, in this House, but was inserted on the fifth day of the Report stage in another place. On the surface, as one listens to the hon. and learned Gentleman the Solicitor-General, it appears, as does so much of the Bill, to be reasonable. Its apparent object, as he said, is to safeguard the worker from any discipline by his organisation in the event of that organisation, or a group of individuals, organising, procuring or financing a strike other than as industrial action.<br/>
The hon. and learned Gentleman has to some extent been torpedoed by my hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw (Mr. Ashton), from whose first-class question we discovered that if the dockers, or anyone else, act contrary to their union in a political action and are disciplined by their union for so doing, that is not an unfair industrial practice, but that if it goes the other way, and the organisation determines, or a group of individuals determines and the union backs them at some stage, to discipline a member who fails to become involved that is an unfair industrial practice. We all know that this hits at political strikes of any kind.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Sal-ford, West (Mr. Orme) asked why this provision was introduced on the fifth day day of the Report stage in another place, but I think that the reason is pretty clear. We had a situation where a number of unions&#x2014;some of the printing unions, the A.U.E.W., the boilermakers, and others&#x2014;called out their members not in a continuous strike but as a protest against the Bill. Contrary to what many people believe, the Transport and General Workers Union did not call out its members, but said that if those members acted it would back them. Incidentally, it is interesting to note that that day of protest did not lead to any disciplinary action by the unions against any worker who did not take part.</p>

<p>One thing is quite clear; the Prime Minister has not gone to meet the workers at U.C.S. If he had, he would not have received the support which my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition had when he met the U.C.S. workers and discussed their problems with them.<br/>
The question is whether that day of protest was an industrial or political action. There is no doubt that that is arguable, but that illustrates that it is not easy to define the line between political and industrial action. There is a good argument for saying that any legislation which directly affects the conditions of employment of workers, in addition to being a political act, is basically an industrial act. It is equally true that a struggle against legislation concerned with conditions of employment, and sometimes wages, is equally an industrial action, even though directed against the Government.<br/>
That clearly brings out the dangers of the State becoming involved in matters which should be left to voluntary agreement between employers and trade unions. Once the State begins to become involved in the regulation of conditions of employment and the rules of trade unions, saying that unions must have a licence to operate, such as registration, there is a thin dividing line between industrial and political action.<br/>
Communist and Fascist countries have experience of the regulation of the conditions of workers by the State. Strikes become illegal and, by its very nature, every strike becomes a political strike, whether intended or not. Even the smallest industrial action begins as an economic struggle and ends as a political strike. Defining the difference between political and industrial action is much more complicated than hon. Members opposite even begin to think.<br/>
The Lords Amendment does not make political strikes illegal and no one suggests that it does, but it is the thin end of the wedge&#x2014;as, indeed, is the whole Bill&#x2014;for the State regulation of trade unions. If a trade union does not register, it will suffer a series of disabilities which do not now exist.<br/>
The Government are embarking upon dangerous seas over this question of

political strikes. We have already seen that because of the Government's action in introducing the Bill workers have become involved in industrial action which the Government have immediately said was political. We shall see more of this once the Bill becomes an Act and is operating. No doubt that is what is intended. There could be a situation six months from now when a flashpoint occurs and workers take industrial action against this Measure and become involved in unfair industrial practices. The argument will be that it is political action, and the Government will seek to use this Amendment and also seek to widen the whole issue.</p>

<p>In another place my noble Friend, Lord Diamond, said of this Amendment;
<q>This is a most important Amendment which affects the liberty of the subject and goes beyond the purpose of this Bill. &#x2026;"&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>House of Lords,</i> 8th July 1971; Vol. 321, c. 1169.]</q>
I think that he is absolutely right. Democracy is something more than elections every five years, something more than elections to local authorities. It is the involvement of the mass of the people at all levels in society. We could easily reach a situation in which workers take some industrial action to press some point of view upon their elected representatives. Instead of saying that the people should be involved in the democratic process, the answer of the Government would be that it was a political move and ought not to be allowed. This Amendment is the first step in making all political strikes illegal. It is the first shot in a campaign which will grow over the years. I want to draw attention to the present situation. I do not think that many people know of this but the trade union movement has long argued that in certain circumstances it is the right of workers to withdraw their labour, to use their industrial strength to influence political decisions. That is not my statement; it is a rule of the Trades Union Congress. I will read out the applicable rule.</p>

<q>In order that the Trade Union movement may do everything which lies in its power to prevent future wars, the General Council shall, in the event of there being a danger of an outbreak of war, call a special Congress to decide on industrial action, such Congress to be called, if possible, before war is declared.</q>


That is the rule of the Trades Union Congress and it has existed for 50 years. Subsection (<i>d</i>) says:
<q>They shall promote common action by the trade union movement on general questions, such as wages and hours of labour, and any matter of general concern that may arise between trade unions and trade unions, or between employers and trade unions or between the Trade Union movement and the Government, and shall have power to assist any union which is attacked on any vital question of trade union principle.</q></p>

<p>Rules which have existed in the T.U.C. for 50 years are not lightly used. The T.U.C. like my party, is dedicated to the principles of political democracy. We believe that we should change Governments by politically democratic methods. But we recognise that in certain special circumstances the need for trade unions to act in an industrial way for political purposes can arise. There are examples of this.</p>

<p>In 1920 the dockers refused to load arms on the "Jolly George" to be used against Soviet Russia. I can bring matters nearer home. The dockers of Liverpool refused to load a ship going to Nigeria because they thought that the cargo would be used against the Biafran people. Recently, the shipyard workers in Belfast marched, quite wrongly in my opinion, from the shipyards to Unionist headquarters demanding action to put the I.R.A. behind bars, and in the process a number of people who may have sympathised with the I.R.A. or been pro-Catholic were intimidated by other sections of the workers involved.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman gave the example of dockers refusing to load a ship because of their belief in the Biafran cause. Since that was an issue on which very strong feelings were held about both sides, it is possible that some members of the union in question felt very strongly about the other side's cause. If it was perfectly right for those who believed strongly in the Biafran cause to do what they did, would it have been right to have disciplined those who believed in the opposite side's cause for refusing to join in?</p>

<p>I am glad that the right hon. Gentleman has made that point, because it refers to the point that I intended to make&#x2014;that this is a much more complex issue than it would appear to be from the black and white terms used by right hon. and hon. Members opposite, who do not even begin to understand the complexities of industrial life and political struggle in relation to industrial events. It is up to the Government to give us chapter and verse showing where the trade unions have disciplined the workers for involving themselves in political action. They cannot give chapter and verse.<br/>
The Government are proceeding along an extremely dangerous course. How would they deal with the complex situation which has developed on Upper Clyde where the workers have taken a form of political action by industrial means? We do not know the outcome. This is not a strike. The men are working. It may well be that they should have been sacked. This is a peculiar new situation. All sorts of developments can take place in the industrial and political world. Hon. Members opposite need to be very careful.</p>

<p>Yes, that is industrial action. If certain workers decided that they did not want to involve themselves in it and disobeyed the trade union, refused to be involved and were brought before a disciplinary committee, what would be the position under this Bill? One has only to look at these possibilities to see the absurdity into which the Government are getting.<br/>

<p>The Solicitor-General may recall that some time ago in these proceedings I asked him whether the political strike was outlawed under the Bill. He had to admit that as such it is not outlawed, but that is not to say that he would not like to outlaw it by means of the Bill. As my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Heffer) has said, the Bill takes a dangerous step towards that concept.<br/>
The fabric of the Bill should be seen, particularly by my hon. Friends who have not been so heavily involved in the detail of this massive, revolutionary incursion of law into industrial relations in the ludicrous situation where the right to strike is considerably diminished&#x2014;certainly the right to strike unofficially

&#x2014;which has always been regarded as a cherished freedom of trade unionists because of the cumbersome machinery, which has not been of their choosing but has been mostly arranged by employers through the passage of history and needs considerable improvement. If we had before us that kind of proposal, we would consider rationally the way in which State agencies or courts and how the idea of the C.I.R. could be used in order to assist the process of building the classless society which you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, claim you seek to belong to.<br/>
This Amendment arises from the single-day stoppages which were but veritable skirmishes compared with what is the likely outcome of the Bill, allied to the other measures the Government are taking in their attack on the people's social services which have been so carefully built up since the war. The purpose has been exploded by my hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw (Mr. Ashton) in reference to the case of the dockers who marched to Parliament. This was not the first time that matter had been raised in the House; I raised it myself on another occasion. As far as we are concerned, this is not an argument about whether it is nice or nasty to discipline workers who refuse to take part in an industrial action or a particular action which goes beyond what can be described in the Bill, without this Amendment, as an "industrial dispute". That is not what the argument is about. It is not about the morals of the situation.<br/>
As much as I detested the outbreak of racialism evidenced by the march of the Smithfield meat porters and the 200 dockers from the Royal Docks, I would not have proposed that the Transport and General Workers' Union, of which I am a member, should take disciplinary action against those workers. I preferred a more rational approach, and it is beginning to pay off because when we had another racialist outburst by the right hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Powell)&#x2014;pushed out by Tory Central Office, as most of his speeches are, whether they on this tack or any other, whether they be to a junior chamber of commerce or to the old ladies of Wolverhampton or some other meeting&#x2014;there was not another march.<br/>
The Amendment must be seen in the light of what is practicable. How is it supposed to put things right? This is the wrong way to do it. It reminds one of the old saying, "Fools rush in where angels fear to tread", because this is purely a question of the various organisations and the methods they have for disciplining their own members. The trade union movement responded to the national demonstration with mixed feelings. In some establishments, only a few stopped work; some of those who did stayed at home while others turned up for the outdoor demonstrations. At other establishments, there was complete or almost complete stoppage of work. Many workers did not join in what was hardly an official strike or national political demonstration. Many people participated at district level. One has to see the reality of this, that it is much better to leave the situation as it is.<br/>
11.0 p.m.<br/>
The characteristic of the British trade union movement is evidenced by the mighty T.U.C. peaceful demonstration, the mightiest outdoor demonstration within our memory. It was amazing in view of the tremendous number who came into the sunshine of Hyde Park and marched to Trafalgar Square.<br/>
When we go to the earlier pages of trade union history, to the 1926 General Strike and the vicious anti-trade union Measure which came out of it&#x2014;the Trade Disputes Act, 1927&#x2014;that situation was not characterised at all by the violence we have seen in other countries but it is to that that the Solicitor-General has gone for guidance in trying to make changes in industrial relations.<br/>
That is why at this eleventh hour before this Measure becomes law, we sound notes of warning. This is not just a move towards changes; it is not a cautious step, but a gigantic leap&#x2014;a leap into the darkness.<br/>
I do not relish this, but if shop stewards and shop-floor workers feel that normal and traditional means of dealing with matters of discipline of their fellow workers cannot be used and that they cannot demonstrate peacefully in the manner to which they have been accustomed about dangerous working conditions, or about a massive rise in the

cost of living and their inability to keep pace with it, many will&#x2014;whether it is correct or not and whether or not they can read this Bill, soon to be enacted&#x2014;reach for other means of struggle. Those will not be the usual industrial practices, like the go-slow or the work-to-rule. I do not know how the Government, the C.I.R., and the Industrial Court will deal with workers for obeying the rule book. That is part of the imponderable.<br/>
I fear that we might go back to the days of the Luddites when the workers feared the machines. If it is the case that one would jeopardise one's family by engaging in a short-lived unofficial strike or unfair industrial practice, it might be easier to resort to other means. There are other means of stopping the industrial machine than walking outside the gate, and that is my genuine fear.<br/>
It is not possible to take the whole tradition of conventions and the enormous build-up which has taken place through the years and turn the system upside down overnight. The industrial situation cannot suddenly be guided into the paths laid down by these provisions.<br/>
As we on this side of the House&#x2014;with our considerable fund of knowledge of industrial relations gained from our backgrounds before we came to this house&#x2014;have looked at the provisions of this Bill to reveal the many holes that exist and have pointed to the yards of legal jargon in which the Bill is shrouded, the Solicitor-General has run around trying to stop up these gaps. Indeed, this very provision is another attempt to stop up a gap in the Bill. But it will not work.<br/>
If one looks at the matter in a humorous way&#x2014;and it is difficult to do so since this is a serious subject&#x2014;one might be better advised to go back to the workers and say "If in future you want to demonstrate against your employer, do not say you are demonstrating against the employer or are striking in connection with an industrial dispute. Say that you are striking because you do not like the Government." So far the political strike has not been caught by legislation. However, I would not put it past hon. Members opposite to come forward in future with some extra legislation to cope with such a situation. But, before that happens, the people will have spoken loudly on


many other matters, and the days of the present Government are numbered anyway.<br/>
The Conservatives thought they were on a winner and could win the middle ground of politics by bringing forward a Measure of this kind. But people make up their own minds on these matters and are showing what they feel in local elections and by-elections&#x2014;as they will in the General Election, which will happen more quickly than many people expect, for a variety of reasons. The longer these debates go on, the more will the Government's failings be exposed.</p>

<p>The Solicitor-General said that an overwhelming majority of people desired to see these provisions on the Statute Book. That is an assertion, not a fact. This Government have made many political miscalculations. One outstanding miscalculation was that this Measure would mean a political bonanza in the winning of votes. But the Conservative record at the polls has clearly demonstrated how the Government have seriously miscalculated the effect of this Bill on the electorate.<br/>
This political miscalculation has spread to other matters. The right hon. Gentleman in his reply has a responsibility to explain the effect of this Amendment on the trade union movement. The unemployment figure in Scotland is now running at the disgraceful total of 134,000, a figure which has not been paralleled at this time of the year since pre-war days. The Scottish Trades Union Congress has decided to hold a special conference in August to discuss the problem of unemployment. No one can predict what that conference will decide, but, as their members are being subjected to political attack after political attack by the Government&#x2014;school meals, school milk, unemployment among school leavers, and the rest&#x2014;it may well be that the trade unions will determine that, in defence of their members and to demonstrate that the Government can no longer inflict the agony of unemployment on the Scottish people, they will take strike action.<br/>
What will be the effect of this Amendment in such circumstances? The Scottish Trades Union Congress is a very respectable body, with access to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Prime Minister of every Government. If its members

decide to take industrial action, will it be illegal, and will they as a consequence be prosecuted?</p>

<p>I know the Bill, and I have taken part in debates on many of its provisions. We had a long discussion about the closed shop provision. Does the right hon. Gentleman say that will have no effect in relation to what I am suggesting? Of course it will.<br/>
I turn to the question of financial support. We have had references to the Upper Clyde shipbuilding workers. Is what they are doing now illegal? How is it affected by the Bill? My right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition was up there today. The workers on the Clyde are conducting a sort of work-in, and one would hope that the proposals put forward by the Leader of the Opposition will not lead to serious industrial action as a result of what the Government are doing. But if it is the Government's policy to try to starve people into submission in spite of the constructive action which the Upper Clyde workers are taking, and if there were industrial action taken as a result, would the Transport and General Workers' Union and the National Union of Mineworkers be caught for financing a strike?<br/>
11.15 p.m.<br/>
The Secretary of State may not be aware that yesterday morning the Scottish Area of the National Union of Mine-workers donated &#x00A3;1,000 to the fight of the Upper Clyde shipbuilding workers. Will that be construed as the action of an organisation abetting and assisting the Upper Clyde shipbuilding workers if they should decide to come out on industrial


action? Finance is mentioned in the Clause.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman should give us an answer, because the miners in Scotland are anxiously awaiting his verdict about the implementation of the Bill. Who will be prosecuted? Who will be affected? Will it be the miners' leaders or the miners' executive in Scotland who will be affected because they have donated &#x00A3;1,000 to the fight of the Upper Clyde shipbuilding workers? Will the Transport and General Workers' Union in Scotland be placed in a similar position? It is a ridiculous situation.<br/>
The slogan of the miners&#x2014;indeed, of workers everywhere&#x2014;concerning industrial disputes has always been, "If you injure one, you injure all." The right hon. Gentleman may not be aware whether the passing of the Bill on to the Statute Book means that not only a trade union, its leaders and members will be prosecuted but that other trade unionists and their leaders who give help and sustenance to their trade union brothers will be prosecuted.<br/>
If that should happen, the right hon. Gentleman and his Government will make the biggest blunder they have ever made. Their Bill will be a prescription not for industrial peace but for industrial anarchy, and instead of its helping and assisting the country, we shall be in for a long, hard, gruelling time.</p>

<p>If the hon. Member will bear with me, I am sure that I am not misconstruing what hon. Members opposite have said during the last 10 minutes when I say that they have been arguing that it is an affront to the rights of the trade unions if they are forbidden and prohibited by law from disciplining members who refuse to take part in strikes which are avowedly political.<br/>
I merely remind hon. Gentlemen opposite of what has taken place over the last few months. It seems absolutely absurd that any hon. Member of this House should try to support the argument that a man who has joined a union in order that that union might look after his conditions of employment, his pay, and all other conditions of work should find that he is required by that union to go on strike in protest against


a political Measure, such as this Bill, of which he may be in favour.<br/>
I have mentioned in this House on many previous occasions that we know from our own experience that there are many perfectly loyal trade unionists who want to be members of and to take an active part in trade unions so that they may look after their pay and conditions of work, but find that those unions are obliging them to go on strike in protest against political measures, such as this Bill.<br/>
Some of the arguments which have been advanced by hon. Gentlemen opposite have been bizarre in the extreme. At one stage the hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Heffer), who taxed me a few minutes ago over my argument, advanced, in quite lyrical language, an argument which I think takes some sustaining in today's political climate. He said that there was a marked absence of genuine trade union activity in Russia and in Fascist States. He talked of the evils of the corporate State, as if inviting us to assume that the antagonism towards the Bill of Messrs. Jones and Scanlon was due to their antagonism towards Communism.<br/>
We should keep our feet on the ground. Where is the great antagonism to the Bill coming from? It is coming from people like Mr. Jones and Mr. Scanlon who, to the best of my knowledge, until a few moments ago were members of the Communist Party. Yet the hon. Gentleman has the nerve&#x2014;</p>

<p>Will the hon. and learned Gentleman now withdraw his allegation that two highly respected trade union leaders in this country are members of the Communist Party? Is he aware that neither of them is a member of the Communist Party? Is he further aware that the argument advanced against the Bill by people such as Lord Robens is that it plays into the hands of those who want to use the trade union movement for other purposes? Will he now withdraw that allegation?</p>

<p>But we know, as I have said, that some of the most vehement opponents of the Bill are the most vehement exponents of the corporate State. It is absurd for the hon. Member for Walton to advance as one argument against the Bill that if it becomes law we shall have taken one notable step towards the corporate State.<br/>
The Bill, to my mind, is a most remarkable advance towards greater freedom for the individual&#x2014;[<i>Interruption</i>.] I cannot see how any right-minded person can seriously say that it is not a most marked advance towards greater freedom for the individual if, by passing legislation, we say that no man shall suffer disadvantage as a result of opposing a strike which is called for an avowedly political purpose; namely, to protest against a Measure passed by the democratically-elected representatives of the people.</p>

<p>Listening to the hon. and learned Member for Nelson and Colne (Mr. Waddington), I was struck by the fact that he used the French maxim in the colonial days of "Divide and rule". May I remind him that the French lost an empire in the Far East, as his party will lose the next General Election.<br/>
I would not seek to interfere in any personal matter, but if I were associated with the legal profession my first maxim would be to check my facts before villifying members of the trade union movement. The Amendment is clearly directed against any trade union which may be involved in an industrial dispute with


political overtones. The Amendment is directed towards that end&#x2014;a so-called political strike. For a long time the trade union movement has been an estate of the realm. It is inevitable, therefore, that in industrial stoppages we shall be more and more concerned with social, economic and political overtones.<br/>
This Amendment&#x2014;I am speaking calmly but it is hard to keep emotion out of it&#x2014;indicates the hatred of this Tory Government of the trade unions and their political associations, and for the Amendment the Government clearly have no mandate. The responsibility lies with the right hon. Gentleman the Secretary of State for Employment who, despite his appearance of sweet reasonableness, is always able to follow the hard-line doctrinaire Tory political philosophy. Two cardinal points in the Amendment show that the Tory Government policy is meant to repress the trade unions and seeks to effect a divorce between them and the Labour Party. The Tory Party fears this alliance; it fears it as it fears nothing else.<br/>
In propounding this Amendment the right hon. Gentleman has forgotten that many of the great reforms in the United Kingdom have taken place as a result of strikes which have been political and industrial, and it would be foolish of the Tory Party to ignore it. Millions of trade unionists have taken part in strikes in contravention of the legislation proposed in this Amendment, and to declare as illegal the act of taking part
<q>in a strike which the organisation, or any other person, has called, organised, procured or financed otherwise than in contemplation or furtherance of an industrial dispute</q>
is to misjudge the mood of 10 million trade unionists.<br/>
The operative words on which my hon. Friend the Member for Midlothian (Mr. Eadie) was basing his argument were
<q>otherwise than in contemplation or furtherance of an industrial dispute".</q>
My hon. Friend's argument has been proved, while the right hon. Gentleman has been proved wrong. The people of the United Kingdom have no liking for regimentation or legal oppression or the minimising of the rights of free association. This is a lesson of history. This Amendment seeks close relationship with another Tory brain child of late

and unlamented memory, the Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act, 1927, which was referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Southall (Mr. Bidwell), and which in 1927 caused massive demonstrations of protest. The numbers attending those protests were only exceeded by the greatest demonstration in history, which was staged against this Bill this year. The opposition in 1927, as in 1971, was industrial and political.<br/>
What legal definition is there in the words
<q>otherwise than in contemplation or furtherance of an industrial dispute"?</q>
As I told the right hon. Gentleman last night, he is no legal theoretician. Neither is he. But it is his job to explain this. It is his brain child. Perhaps I should say that the paternity should be shared equally between him and the Solicitor-General. The United Kingdom owes much to the mass protests and strikes which have helped to change attitudes. The Amendment is designed to kill the social and political overtones and feelings with which the people are imbued. They will shortly be mocking the "defeat" of this Bill&#x2014;which will never work.<br/>
11.30 p.m.<br/>
The Amendment has been bypassed by the development in Upper Clyde Shipbuilders. That action, which is "irregular", is suported by thousands of unionists and is the opposite of a strike. It is organised and financed in terms unrelated to paragraph (<i>c</i>). It is a phenomenon of the times, supported by every section of opinion in my native land. Such an event makes nonsense of the Amendment, which reintroduces in different words the provisions of the 1927 Act, which dealt with strikes with an object other than the furtherance of a dispute or designed to coerce the Government, either directly or by inflicting hardship on the community.<br/>
This attitude towards the unions is of long standing, as one can see from the pamphlet "A Grant Strength", published in 1958 by the Conservative Society of the Inns of Court. It said:
<q>We therefore consider that the political strike should be clearly pronounced to be illegal&#x2014;and by illegal in this context we mean a criminal offence.</q>
The power to strike sympathetically, socially, politically or economically is


justified if without it employees have insufficient bargaining power. When workers have a great part to play in modern economic life, the fact that this matter has not been discussed in this House shows a regrettable lack of consideration by this Government for the democratic process.<br/>
As a result of modern conditions and the trade unions' rightful desire for a fair deal and the right to work, methods will be adopted of bypassing the Amendment. No one knows the futility of this more than the right hon. Gentleman. The Government have misjudged the mood of the times, the mood of the British people, and the resilience of the opposition of the unions to this unwanted Bill.</p>

<p>At the outset I asked the Solicitor-General why these proposals, which were not in the Bill when we spent long nights in Committee discussing the Measure, had suddenly been introduced, but he did not give a satisfactory reply.<br/>
It is clear that they arose out of the 1st and 18th March stoppages in which my union was supported by the boiler-makers and the unions in the newspaper industry. Was that political action? The unions demonstrated on those days against this Bill to defend their industrial democracy and bargaining power in British industry. In other words, they were taking industrial action against an attempt by the Tory Government to impose political solutions affecting the unions' activities.<br/>
There can be no doubt that this is the first political step towards direct interference by the Government in union affairs. It is designed not only to prevent unions from disciplining their members but to deflect those members from taking action, and so to place a complete ban on the industrial action of unions.<br/>
We have not heard much from hon. Gentlemen opposite about the action of the N.F.U. in Cardiff when some of its members jostled one of my right hon. Friends when we were in Government. Those demonstrations represented political action to bring the views of the N.F.U. to bear on the then Labour Government. We did not suggest that they should be disciplined or put into prison.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman knows that that is not the argument. [HON. MEMBERS: "Answer."] The argument goes far beyond the disciplining of members. This proposal is aimed directly at unions which take action which the right hon. Gentleman or the Government consider to be political. The Solicitor-General did not have the grace or honesty to admit that this arises out of the 1st and 18th March demonstrations against the Bill.<br/>
It is not far from here to a corporate State situation. After all, reference has been made to action taken by workers which could have political overtones. One can think of the "Jolly George" and the action of the Lancashire cotton workers. What about the American revolution&#x2014;[<i>interruption</i>.] I do not know why hon. Gentlemen opposite think this is funny.</p>

<p>No. I will not give way.<br/>
This is a very important issue for democracy. We have seen what has happened in Greece. I was in Czechoslovakia at the time of the Dubcek situation, when one of the first things demanded was a free and independent trade union movement. We have seen what has happened in South Africa, where the trade union movement has been divided into black and white, and political action or real industrial action is forbidden. We have seen what happened recently in the Sudan. We can go all over the world, and the one place where there is a real, free, independent trade union movement&#x2014;until the Bill gets the Royal Assent tomorrow&#x2014;is Great Britain.<br/>
But we are present this evening at the removal of some of our basic liberties&#x2014;liberties for which we have fought for


generations, and for which people will continue to fight. This Clause has overtones of some of the most unpleasant aspects of the Bill. Has anyone ever known of legislation being amended as it has been going through Parliament because of action outside Parliament just a matter of days away?<br/>
I warn the right hon. Gentleman that he will not get away with this sort of intimidation or threats or legislation. The trade union movement will fight, and, whether the Secretary of State calls it political action or industrial action, the freedoms we have had in the British trade union movement will continue under this Measure as before it, regardless of penalties or restrictions until the Measure itself is removed from the Statute Book.</p>

<p>It is very appropriate that we should end our debates on the Bill with this Amendment, because it has the same Alice-in-Wonderland quality as has permeated all the debates from start to finish. As I listened to the Solicitor-General explaining the purpose of the Amendment, I wondered how hon. Gentlemen opposite could retain enough enthusiasm for this legislation even to go through the Division Lobby tonight.<br/>
In the first place, the hon. and learned Gentleman admitted that the Amendment was not really necessary. He said, with disarming frankness, that it was probable that disciplinary action against a union member who refused to take part in a political strike would in any case be contrary to the common law. If that is so, what we are engaged on is pro vision of litigation for litigation's sake. The Solicitor-General could not give one reason why we needed this Amendment or one example of the sort of situation with which it is supposed to deal. There is no legal or political necessity for it. He just got&#x2014;I was about to say the seven-year itch, and it seems like seven years that we have been dealing with the Bill&#x2014;</p>

<p>I have been listening to the right hon. Lady with great care. Does she realise that, although there is an existing right of redress for someone who is disciplined by his union for not taking part in a political strike, it can cost the members a great deal of

money? It involves his getting a High Court writ. The costs may run to over &#x00A3;1,000, and this is well beyond the pocket of an ordinary trade unionist who finds himself in that position.</p>

<p>I must congratulate the hon. Member on being more ingenious than the Solicitor-General who, when we asked him why, if the right is there at common law, we needed the Amendment, replied that we might as well make it clear; and when we asked for an example or a case, all we got was silence. I repeat that with this Amendment, as during the course of a large part of the Bill, we have been engaged in the provision of litigation for litigation's sake.<br/>
11.45 p.m.<br/>
The hon. and learned Gentleman is absolutely obsessed by the idea that everything can be tied up by some neat legal formula. I tremble to think what will happen to the hon. and learned Gentleman when our discussions on the Bill come to an end. It will be like taking away his necessary drug which has inspired all his activity. He will be wandering around like a lost spirit when he does not have a Clause to draft or redraft, or another Amendment, for perhaps years and years. We may have a serious situation with the psychological collapse of the hon. and learned Gentleman, and I am anxious for his health.<br/>
We turn to the second limb&#x2014;if I may get as legalistic as we shall all have to get&#x2014;of the hon. and learned Gentleman's argument. Even if it is necessary, what does the Amendment do? My hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw (Mr. Ashton) made a telling intervention asking the hon. and learned Gentleman whether it would be an unfair industrial practice to discipline dockers who downed tools in support of the right hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Powell), and we know that his views are highly political.<br/>
Irreverent voices were heard calling out from this side of the House, "That got you, Geoffrey." But we underestimated the ingenuity and rationality of the hon. and learned Gentleman. He said, "Not at all, because dockers who demonstrated in favour of the racist views of the right hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West, were taking political action, and it is an unfair industrial practice only to


discipline them for refusing or failing to do so." If the Gilbertian essence of this situation does not strike hon. Gentlemen opposite, they are beyond redemption.<br/>
This means that it is not an unfair industrial practice for workers to take political action against the advice of their trade union; there is nothing wrong with that; all this talk about political strikes is totally irrelevant to the hon. and learned Gentleman's argument. It is not wrong to take political action against the union's advice but it is wrong&#x2014;it is this naughty thing, an unfair industrial practice&#x2014;for the union to discipline members who refuse to take part in a collective decision of the union.<br/>
I should have thought that that was turning the whole philosophy of the Bill on its head in any case, for I thought that the only thing the right hon. Gentleman wanted to do was to get at the wild cats, at the mad hats who did not obey their union. I thought that that was what the whole exercise was about and that the right hon. Gentleman so loved the trade unions that what he wanted to do was to underpin their authority. By the hon. and learned Gentleman's admission, the Government are doing exactly the opposite by this Amendment.<br/>
It is extremely appropriate that we should be having this swan song at this stage of the Bill on this Amendment. The witching hour is drawing near and at midnight the guillotine falls. Tomorrow the Government will be rushing with all speed to get the Queen's Assent to this Bill. "Look" they will be chanting, "we have done it. We have kept one election pledge. We forced the Bill through the House of Commons in the time limit we set ourselves. We did not mind what we sacrificed to get the Bill on the Statute Book before the Summer Recess." This had become the sole aim of the right hon. Gentleman's industrial relations policy, the sum total of this Government's contribution to this controversial problem. They did not mind what they sacrificed so long as they hit the deadline; they did not mind whether they sacrificed a proper examination of the Bill, they did not mind whether they sacrificed the rights of Parliament, they did not mind whether Parliament was stopped from voting, if they stopped Parliament, as they will be stopping it shortly, from saying whether it wants to

accept or reject a series of Amendments which are very different in character.<br/>
That does not matter. They say, "Our <i>gauleiter</i> gets things done." Here it is: this Government's one and only contribution to the solution of this country's economic difficulties! Unemployment may be at its highest peak for 30 years but at least they say they have outlawed the politico-sympathetic action of unemployed workers on the Upper Clyde. "That would be political action, would it not? It is that which would ruin the country." The number of working days lost through strikes during the miserable months under this Government and the loss of production may have doubled, but "Ah", says the right hon. Gentleman, "we have halved the number of those little strikes that last only three days and we always intended to 'go American, didn't we?".<br/>
The trade unionists have marched off the Commission on Industrial Relations to a man. Not only Mr. George Woodcock, but Mr. Alf Allen, and Mr. Will Paynter have walked out, and the right hon. Gentleman is incapable of finding any trade unionist in any part of the political spectrum to serve on the Commission because of the r&#x00F4;le that he has given it under this Bill.<br/>
"Yet," says the right hon. Gentleman, "there it is&#x2014;our instrument for reforming procedure agreements and improving industrial relations." It will be busy doing that in the absence of the trade unions, in the absence of half of the industrial parties concerned. If the trade unions do not like the agreements which the Commission draws up for them, then the employer can impose those agreements upon them, as if, to use the tendentious words of this Bill they were "a contract freely negotiated." This is the level of debasement we have reached in the language of industrial relations.<br/>
We talk about the sanctity of contract, about the extension of freedom. The hon. and learned Member for Nelson and Colne (Mr. Waddington) talked about the extension of freedom under the Bill&#x2014;[<i>Interruption</i>.]&#x2014;the essence of contract. Yes, words mean what hon. Gentlemen opposite decide they shall mean. A contract, if it means anything, means a bargain freely struck, and yet the right hon. Gentleman is to impose procedure


agreements and make them legally enforceable as if they were a contract. If words can lose their meaning in this way, there will be no language in which management will be able to talk to unions in industry.<br/>
Tonight, when the Guillotine falls, I have not the slightest doubt that hon. Members opposite will repair to the Smoke Room and roll out the champagne again, celebrating the most successful take-over bid in Ministerial history. The Solicitor-General has moved in on industrial relations like the cuckoo in the nest, and the Secretary of State has not so much been pushed out of the nest as jumped out of it. We have watched him during the stages of this Bill crowded out of the discussion of one Clause after another for the simple reason that the Bill was incomprehensible to anybody but the Solicitor-General. Therefore, conciliation and common sense have abdicated in favour of the court room.<br/>
As a result of this Bill we face a wave of bitterness among organised workers greater than this country has known for many a long year. What a commentary it is on this Bill that as part of its grand finale we should find it necessary for the first time in our history to be legislating about political strikes; what a commentary that is on the Government's policies; what a commentary on their unemployment policies; what a commentary on their "lame ducks" policy; what a commentary on their industrial relations policy. [<i>Interruption</i>.] Having been steam-rollered at every stage of this Bill, we on this side of the House have the</p>

<p>We leave hon. Members opposite to enjoy their pyrrhic victory. They may have won the parliamentary battle; power, they have proved, is more powerful than argument. But have they won the industrial relations battle? Does any right hon. or hon. Member opposite seriously believe that? Any body who is honest and informed will admit that the industrial relations battle will be won only in men's minds. The supreme and sublime irony of this Bill is that the Government's only hope is that no one will take the slightest bit of notice of it. That is the Secretary of State's hope. That is what he is counting on&#x2014;that the powers will not be used; that the legal paraphernalia will be ignored; that the trade union movement will forget the insults; that perhaps he will be able to retract. Perhaps eventually he will be able to win them back into consultation and to the conciliation table again. This is the net result of all these months of argument. There is not an hon. Member&#x2014;</p>

<p>I am grateful for this opportunity at this late hour to raise some of the problems of the environment in the Aberavon constituency. The word "environment" is very much an "in" word these days. It means what to ordinary people whom I have the privilege of representing are problems of bricks and mortar, the rivers, the sea, tarmacadam and noise. It is the quality of the vicinity in which one lives, works and spends one's leisure.<br/>
Every effort is made these days to improve the quality of life. We see in the County of Glamorgan, in my constituency, work being done in land reclamation, and it is a tragedy perhaps that while all this is going on the local authority has to spend &#x00A3;2,500 a year merely to refit light fittings which have been removed by acts of vandalism. That is just one of the problems.<br/>
I want to concern myself this evening with three points: first with a caravan development at Porthcawl, and indeed in Wales generally. At Porthcawl there are about 5,000 caravans already, and there is a proposal to increase the number by another 1,000 at Trecio Bay. The history of this matter is that a development plan was approved as far back as 1958 to schedule this part of Porthcawl as a holiday area, and in 1961 planning consent was given. Nothing was done about this matter until latterly, and the developers' plans have lain fallow for many a year, the developers now want to activate them. That has resulted in the whole town being up in arms, and over 6,000 people, more than 60 per

cent. of the population, have petitioned the Welsh Office and have expressed their concern about this new development.<br/>
The Minister of State has written and told me that this is a matter for the local authority. If it decides to revoke the planning permission already given, that is its affair. But the fact of the matter is that Porthcawl is an area with limited resources, a small town indeed with an above-average number of pensioners and people on fixed incomes, and it is totally out of the question for a small town of that size to consider the question of revocation.<br/>
No one knows exactly what the figures would be, but a range from &#x00A3;100,000 to &#x00A3;1 million has been mentioned. It is no good the Government wringing their hands and everyone saying that this should not happen and that there are enough caravans at Porthcawl. We are prisoners of the past, doomed to impotence.<br/>
The Government cannot wash their hands of this issue. The local authorities are deeply conscious of the situation. If our concern for our heritage and our coast line is to mean anything, the Government, the local authorities and the developers must act. Trust House-Forte has a major responsibility whether or not it carries on with the permission already given. I invite Lord Crowther to read this debate. He has the interests of his shareholders but also the good name of his company to consider. The answer may be for the developers, the local authorities and the Government to get together to work out a solution.<br/>
To underline the gravity of the situation, I quote a report by Dr. Thomas Sharp, who was commissioned by the Glamorgan County Council in 1964 to look into the problem of planning at Porthcawl. He said:
<q>I regret that I do not feel able to undertake this work. In my opinion, the future of the town has been so prejudiced by developments within the last decade that no worthwhile plan for the future can be made until the situation resulting from those developments has been corrected. Such correction will require policy decisions on a heroic scale and financial undertakings of an enormous and burdensome kind.</q>
The injurious development to which he referred was caravan development. He


ended this part of his report by saying that, where there was
<q>a great expanse of natural burrows and sand hills, there has been developed the most deplorable and civically cancerous growth that I have yet encountered in my long experience of urban diagnosis.</q>
I am not against caravans. Indeed, I spent a most pleasurable holiday last year touring in one. In many parts of Wales there is a need for adequate facilities for the touring caravan. But I am concerned that someone should consider the picture comprehensively to see whether saturation point has not been reached in Porthcawl and many other parts of Wales.<br/>
I asked the Minister of State yesterday to give me the figures for each county in Wales, detailing how many permissions had been given for how many caravans and how many had been taken up. I was taken aback to be told that the information was not readily available. When I asked another question about the policy in this matter, he said, first, rightly, that this is a matter for the local authorities and that the Welsh Office calls in such applications for its own decision in exceptional cases; for example, where the issues raised are of national importance.<br/>
But if the Welsh Office does not have the figures for each county, and if it does not have the figures showing what has been and what has not been taken up, how can it know whether these are significant matters of national importance or of great importance in the locality?<br/>
I was flabbergasted by the inadequacy of the Welsh Office and its inability to give very important figures which should have been readily available. The Minister's advisers need a thorough shaking up to ensure that they provide him with the relevant information, so that when decisions of this kind are taken a full picture is put before him.<br/>
It is time that this nettle was grasped and that we had a thorough-going inquiry into caravan development throughout Wales, to establish first what the needs are&#x2014;both for the stationary caravans and the touring caravans&#x2014;and secondly their relevance having regard to the permanent population and how much saturation can be allowed.<br/>
We need to be able to look at the whole picture, and I urge the Minister to set

up a national inquiry into the matter to ensure that all the facts are established; and in considering the Porthcawl problem he should call all the parties together in an effort to find a way out of the difficulty. The Government cannot wash their hands of this affair.<br/>
Because of the lack of time, I will refer only briefly to the development of the M4. This road is generally welcomed in South Wales, where we need a great artery to connect our industrial areas, and the whole of Wales, with the rest of the country. However, the proposed line of the motorway is causing concern, particularly to the residents of the villages of Cornelly and Groes, which are in my constituency.<br/>
If the present line of the motorway is maintained, it is likely that Cornelly will be split into three parts. At present it is a corporate unit, with the new part of the village grafted on to the old. If the road is developed according to present plans, the village will be completely split. Groes is an old village containing, among other things, a round chapel that is listed as being of particular historical importance. This village will be torn apart if the proposed line of the M4 is maintained.<br/>
I appreciate the difficulties of the Minister in attempting to comment on this matter in detail. I have written to the Secretary of State and I now ask the hon. Gentleman to make it clear that there will be a full public inquiry so that those concerned may ventilate their views. I hope that in the meantime no decision will be taken which might in any way prejudice the future of these two villages.<br/>
Another problem involving the environment is atmospheric pollution at Port Talbot. Some work has been done, and the British Steel Corporation has undertaken considerable expenditure to overcome this problem. The local authority has been a formidable watchdog to ensure that pollution is kept to the minimum, but there are emissions and break-downs, and when these occur life becomes thoroughly miserable for those living in the part of Port Talbot of which I am speaking, and particularly for housewives.<br/>
I am grateful to the Secretary of State for a Written Answer I received yesterday to a Question I had asked about


atmospheric pollution at Port Talbot. I was told:
<q>For many processes which give rise to atmospheric pollution, authorised levels of emission are not laid down but the best practicable means are required to render emissions harmless and inoffensive. Where authorised levels of emission have been laid down, the standards are being met in the Port Talbot area".&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 3rd August, 1971, Vol. 822, c. <i>282</i>.]</q>
In that Question I asked the right hon. Gentleman whether he was satisfied with the present position, but he did not answer that. I would be grateful for some comments on the whole question of atmospheric pollution at Port Talbot.<br/>
In the short time at my disposal I have dealt with some of the problems that concern my constituents. These are problems about the environment in which they live, work and enjoy their leisure. My constituents want to improve the quality of life in the area, and there is a deep awareness throughout the country that we must do our utmost to preserve and improve the environment.<br/>
At the end of the day, this is a question of bricks and mortar, of roads and of developments here and there. These are the hard facts of life, and our handling of them can either improve or spoil the quality of life in my area.</p>

<p>The right hon. Member for Aberavon (Mr. John Morris) raised three matters concerning his constituency, which is an area embracing heavy industry and great beauty. It is also on the way to somewhere and is therefore subject to road development. I will deal with each of these points and give the best possible answers I can to the questions he asked.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman referred to the proposal for an extension of the caravan development on the east side of Porthcawl, and to caravan development generally in Wales. I am aware of the anxiety of many local residents about the Porthcawl proposal. The right hon. Gentleman and I have exchanged letters on the matter, and I have also received representations from the Porthcawl Civic Trust Society. In the course of this correspondence I have explained the present statutory position, but it is sufficiently important and relevant to what

the right hon. Gentleman said to go over this again.<br/>
The Porthcawl Urban District Council, acting for the Glamorgan County Council as local planning authority, gave outline planning permission for the development of this 40-acre site as a holiday caravan camp as far back as March 1961. This permission required among other things the submission to the council of detailed plans of the layout of all buildings and structures to be erected on the site for approval before any work commenced. I am informed that the Porthcawl Urban District Council subsequently issued a site licence for 1,039 caravans. Detailed plans have not yet, I understand, been submitted.<br/>
It is for the county council to decide whether it now wishes to revoke the permission given in 1961. If it does, the revocation Order would have to be submitted to my right hon. and learned Friend for confirmation, and it would also fall to him to decide any appeal which might be made by the developers in the event of the council's failing or refusing to approve detailed plans. For these reasons, as the right hon. Gentleman very well knows, it would be most improper were I to comment on the merits of the Porthcawl proposals. I am, however, glad to know that representatives of the developers and the local authority are discussing proposals in the light of the strong local reactions to which the right hon. Gentleman refers.<br/>
On the more general proposition of holiday camp development, it might help if I were to say a few words about the Government's r&#x00F4;le and attitude.<br/>
First, it is important to bear in mind that, subject to a right of appeal to the Secretary of State, the decision on any planning application is the responsibility of the local planning authority. My right hon. and learned Friend calls in planning applications for his own decision only in exceptional cases. However, the previous Government gave general guidance on caravan sites in Development Control Policy Note No. 8, issued in 1969, which is accepted by the present Government as a fair statement of what is desirable.<br/>
This note states that planning policy is concerned to see that the touring caravanner has reasonable freedom to wander and explore and the static caravanner a reasonable choice of site to visit, but


without spoiling the countryside, the coast or amenities which other people enjoy. The note points out the need to avoid conspicuous sites, especially on the coast, and to the importance of avoiding both the wider scattering of caravan development and the possible "saturating" of places which already have large numbers of caravans.<br/>
The Government's determination to safeguard the beauty of the British countryside and seashore for the future, which are very relevant to the subject matter of this debate, was made quite explicit in the Queen's Speech a little over a year ago.<br/>
The question of "saturation" is, of course, difficult to determine. As the right hon. Gentleman will appreciate, the mere number of caravans or of planning permissions in the whole of Wales, or even in a particular county, can at best only give us part of the story. So much depends on circumstances in specific locations.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman has criticised the Welsh Office for not having precise information available about the number of caravans in each county in Wales for which there is in existence planning permission, and the number for which permission has been granted but not so far taken up. Although the precise information which he sought is not readily available, there is a great deal of other relevant information available. We know, for example, that there are some 60,000 caravans or caravan pitches in Wales, and we have fairly reliable information on a county basis. But the right hon. Gentleman will appreciate that a large number of the sites were in existence before the post-war planning legislation came into force and, therefore, pre-date the planning permission arrangements as we now know them. Hence the difficulty in giving him a precise answer.<br/>
As to the number of permitted caravan sites not already taken up or utilised, the fact is that the number varies substantially, with the seasons&#x2014;indeed, it changes from day to day and, at the height of the season, from hour to hour. To obtain this part of the information sought by the right hon. Gentleman would, therefore, require a simultaneous physical examination of every caravan site in Wales, which is clearly impossible.

I do not accept the right hon. Gentleman's suggestion that my advisers need a thorough shaking up, because what he is asking for is virtually impossible to give, but I hope that what I have said to him about the 760,000 caravans or caravan pitches in Wales gives some idea of the size of the problem.</p>

<p>I am grateful for that explanation. Whether or not the hon. Gentleman is responsible, the answer given yesterday was that the information was not available, and that was said without qualification. That reflects not only on those advising the hon. Member, but on his own responsibility.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-08-04a.1808.1" hansard_membership_id="4803" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/15232" speakername="Mr. Gibson-Watt" colnum="1808" time="">
<p>If the right hon. Gentleman studies that Question and Answer and reads my speech in HANSARD, he will find that he is not correct in that.<br/>
I appreciate his concern about the need for information to be available and I have arranged for this question to be discussed with the planning authorities to see what further information can be made available without diverting staff resources from other more urgent tasks. There is no evidence that planning authorities in Wales are relaxing their planning control on caravan development. Indeed, what evidence there is is to the contrary.<br/>
For instance, in the first 12 months of the present Administration some 47 per cent. of planning applications for caravan development were granted by the planning authorities; this compares with 56 per cent. granted in 1969. The number of caravans or pitches covered by the permissions granted in 1970&#x2013;71 was 3,762. We do not have the comparable figure for 1969, but it was probably considerably greater. I should like to assure the House that we are conscious of the widespread feeling that there is a caravan problem in some parts of Wales and we recognise that this calls for discussion between the Welsh Office and the local planning authorities.<br/>
The second subject which the right hon. Gentleman raised was that of the motorway. He asked for a public inquiry into the proposed line of the M4 motorway within his constituency. I can give him an immediate assurance on this. Shortly after draft Orders under the Highways Act were published containing my right


hon. and learned Friend's proposals for the line of this length of motorway, the Welsh Office arranged public meetings in both Groes and North Cornelly so that officials could explain the choice of routes to those affected and give the public further information to enable people if they wished to object to the proposals. At both meetings assurances were given that the objections would be the subject of a public inquiry.<br/>
I cannot yet say when this inquiry will be held. The period for the receipt of objections to the proposals ended today. The Welsh Office will now be considering all the objections and an announcement will be made as soon as possible. I understand the difficulties of the right hon. Gentleman's constituents. We live with progress, but progress does not al-always seem to be on our side and when a motorway comes to one's village, it is absolutely right that these matters should be ventilated and questions asked about them in the House.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman's third theme was that of air pollution in his constituency arising from the operation of the steelworks. May I briefly set out the statutory position on this subject and then the facts in relation to the right hon. Gentleman's constituency as I know them. The right hon. Gentleman will be aware that most of the processes at the Port Talbot Steelworks are registered under the Alkali Acts and are therefore under the direct control of the Alkali Inspectorate which reports to the Secretary of State for Wales. Companies with processes registered under the Alkali Acts are generally required to employ the best practicable means to control the emissions of noxious or offensive gases so as to render them harmless and inoffensive. There are maximum levels of emission laid down for some of the processes in steel making. Most of the processes in the steelworks are in fact registered under the Alkali Acts and therefore come under the control of the district alkali inspector for the area. So much for the statutory position.<br/>
I now turn to the situation in Port Talbot. I am aware that about the middle of last year the operation of the steelworks coke ovens gave rise to complaints about a dust nuisance and noise nuisance arising from the operation of No. 4 blast furnace.<br/>
I understand that the British Steel Corporation management at the plant made considerable efforts in the face of difficulties to improve the situation at the coke ovens and generally throughout the steel works. It is working in conjunction with the local authority and the District Alkali Inspector and I have been assured that these efforts by the Corporation will be continued.<br/>
Turning to smoke and sulphur dioxide pollution I understand that the figures provided by the Port Talbot Borough Council to the Warren Spring Laboratory of the Department of Trade and Industry show that smoke pollution in the area in many cases is below the levels in other parts of South Wales, while sulphur dioxide pollution is only slightly higher. This may seem surprising but it has to be borne in mind that domestic premises account for a considerable proportion of smoke and sulphur dioxide pollution.<br/>
As for the total emission from registered processes in the steel works I am advised by the District Alkali Inspector that there has been a steady decline in the level of emissions in recent years and where there are authorised levels of emission these are being complied with. I assure the hon. Gentleman that no one who is in any way concerned is being complacent about the situation. The District Alkali Inspector, the local authority and the British Steel Corporation will continue to pursue vigorously the possibility of further improvements.<br/>
Finally, I know the right hon. Membe is interested in atmosphere pollution in the wider context. He showed great interest, as the Government did, in a study published by Mr. G. Goodman and Mr. T. Roberts of University College, Swansea, on mosses as indicators of atmospheric pollution by heavy metals in the Swansea area. Following publication of this report a group of experts met at the Welsh Office to discuss its implications.<br/>
It was decided to set up a working party of experts to prepare proposals for further research. The first meeting was held recently and detailed consideration is now being given to the sort of research which might be undertaken, including further monitoring of the atmosphere, the possible medical effects of heavy metal pollution of the atmosphere and the possible effects on agriculture.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman will recall one of the main conclusions of the first report of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution was that there was insufficient evidence about the effects of atmospheric pollution. I am sure he will agree that our actions show that we are treating this subject with proper concern. He has raised three

important matters concerning his constituency. They affect an important part of South Wales and I hope my answers have gone some way to satisfy him on these matters.</p>
