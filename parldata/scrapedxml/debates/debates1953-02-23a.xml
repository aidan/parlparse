<p>asked the Minister of Materials what materials and commodities are still the subject of State trading by his Department; what was the aggregate value of stocks held in respect of these materials and commodities at the latest convenient date; to what extent such stocks are progressively being liquidated in favour of private traders' stocks; whether a time-table has now been established to end State trading in each of these materials and commodities and return the business to private traders; and when he estimates that his Department will be extinguished.</p>

<p>In addition to selling the output of some Government-owned plants, my Department now imports and distributes copper, aluminium, magnesium, tungsten ore, jute and imported jute goods, and sulphur and pyrites. A similar exclusive responsibility is undertaken for soft hemp. Other hemps have been in private hands for some time. The aggregate value of the public trading stocks of all these commodities held at 31st December last was approximately &#x00A3;80 million. While

public trading continues to be necessary, a general liquidation of stocks cannot be pursued as an independent operation.<br/>
It is the Government's policy to restore private trading as soon in each case as our balance of payments position and other important considerations permit. I hope that it will be possible to make further progress in this direction during the forthcoming financial year; but no precise time-table is possible.<br/>
As regards the last part of the Question, my hon. Friend will be aware that the Ministry has other important duties outside the sphere of State trading.</p>

<p>asked the Minister of Materials the annual cost of his Department; how many officials it employs including ancillary staff; and to what extent this number will be reduced during the period to 30th June, 1953, in view of his proclaimed intention to end State trading in materials and commodities as rapidly as possible.</p>

<p>The administrative cost of the Ministry of Materials during the current financial year will be approximately &#x00A3;1,100,000. A provision of &#x00A3;1,220,250 was taken in the Estimates for


the current financial year based on a total staff of 1,854 at the beginning of the year and an estimated total staff of about 1,420 at 31st March next. The actual reduction in staff has been greater than estimated with consequent savings on the Vote. The total staff on 30th June next will be about 1,050 and the further reductions will be reflected in the Estimates for the forthcoming year.</p>

<p>As I explained at the time of the Supplementary Estimates, the losses to which my hon. Friend refers&#x2014; his figure is not quite correct&#x2014;were due to the fact that after the profits had been made when prices had been going up, there had been a season of falling prices.</p>

<p>asked the Minister of Materials whether his attention has been drawn to the growing use in the United States of America of bagasse as a raw material for the production of newsprint and paper; and whether, in view of the fact that half the world's bagasse is produced within the British Commonwealth, he will take steps to save dollar expenditure on importing newsprint by encouraging the more extensive import of this new raw material.</p>

<p>I understand that experiments in the United States of America have established the technical possibility of successfully manufacturing newsprint, as well as other kinds of paper, from bagasse; but the possibility of producing them on a commercial scale has yet to be demonstrated. I am afraid, therefore, it is premature to consider saving expenditure of dollars on newsprint by using bagasse in this country for newsprint manufacture. I should add that I cannot accept my hon. Friend's statement as to the proportion of bagasse produced in the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>Is it not a fact that machinery in the British paper mills can employ this material without alteration? Is it not also a fact that paper produced by this method in America is of excellent quality? In view of the shortage of world newsprint owing to increasing literacy in Asia and Africa, is it not important to press on with this new material?</p>

<p>A very large proportion of the purchases made by my Department are covered by standing contracts. The total payments for new supplies during the period mentioned, including supplies coming forward under these contracts, are of the order of &#x00A3;30 million. The materials involved are set out in the Ministry's printed Supplementary Estimates (Class IX, Vote 6, Subhead A). If, however, the hon. and gallant Member is referring to new purchase commitments made during the period the total would be about &#x00A3;6 million, of which about half was in respect of jute and jute goods.</p>

<p>Yes, Sir. As is now usual in these incidents, the prisoners started a demonstration in deliberate defiance of orders from the camp authorities, and attacked their guards with stones. After three unsuccessful attempts to restore order by the use of what are officially termed "non-toxic irritants"&#x2014;I understand this is a form of tear gas&#x2014;United


Nations troops entered the compound, and, on orders from the Camp Commander, made use of tear gas and concussion grenades and opened fire with light weapons. Order was restored when the troops forced entry into the prisoners' huts. Casualties were one prisoner killed and 50 injured, of whom four have since died. There were no United Nations casualties. Subsequent inspection showed that the prisoners had made careful preparations for the incident, including the piling of stones inside the compound.</p>

<p>Is not the right hon.

<p>Would the right hon.

The relative contributions to all this work made by the United States, the United Kingdom and the U.S.S.R. are shown below for 1952:</q></q>

<p>The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development is a Specialised Agency whose main function is to give capital aid for development. The United States have paid up 635 million dollars on account of their subscription to the Bank's capital stock, and have agreed to the release of the whole of this amount. The United Kingdom has paid up &#x00A3;93 million on account of her subscription (including a portion in gold or dollars); and in addition to certain small sums previously released the United Kingdom has, as my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced on 3rd February, agreed to release up to &#x00A3;60 million for Commonwealth Development over a period of years. Apart from the above subscriptions the Bank has borrowed 510 million dollars and &#x00A3;5 million in the capital markets of the United States and United Kingdom respectively.

<p>asked the Minister of Food if he is aware that for the years 1946&#x2013;50 the approximate average consumption of ration quality carcase meat was 1,059,000 tons per year whereas for the years 1951&#x2013;52 the average consumption had fallen to 882,000 tons per year; what was the reason for this short fall in consumption of 177,000 tons per year during 1951 and 1952; and what steps he is taking to enable domestic consumers to take up their full ration of carcase meat.</p>

<p>Yes, Sir. The average for 1951&#x2013;52 was low mainly because 1951 consumption was abnormally low. This was due in part to reduced imports and partly to a running down of stocks in 1950. These figures have no connection with the take-up of the carcase meat ration.</p>

<p>During the 12 months to 31st December, 1951, my right hon. Friend has received reports of 46 fatalities to railway servants who were struck by engines or trains while working on the permanent way, compared with the average of 59 for the five years 1946&#x2013;50. The final figure for 1952 is not yet available, but it will be about 60. The majority of these regrettable accidents are caused by want of individual care and disregard of simple safety rules, and prevention is largely a matter of discipline. Inquiries are held by the Railway Employment

Inspectors into all the fatalities and injuries reported, and their recommendations invariably receive the close attention of the railway authorities. Educative measures include the wide circulation of the reports among the staff.</p>

<p>I will, with permisison, now answer Question No. 22.<br/>
At the beginning of this month Her Majesty's Government were informed that Argentina and Chile had established naval parties on the airstrip adjoining the British base at Port Foster, Deception Island, which is British territory, and that permanent buildings had been erected. These encroachments represented not merely an infringement of our sovereignty on the Island, but a nuisance and an obstruction to those who were maintaining our base. Instructions were accordingly given to the Acting Governor of the Falkland Islands to dismantle the buildings which had been erected and to arrest and deport under the Falkland Islands Aliens Ordinance any occupants found in them.<br/>
These instructions were carried out on the 15th February by the British Magistrate assisted by constables of the Falklands Islands Police. Royal Marines from Her Majesty's Frigate "Snipe" were available if needed in support of the civil power. Two occupants of the Argentine hut were arrested, without resistance, and the Argentine and Chilean huts were dismantled. The Chilean hut was unoccupied. The two arrested men were handed over at South Georgia on 18th February to the master of an Argentine vessel bound for Buenos Aires.<br/>
Her Majesty's Ambassadors at Buenos Aires and Santiago presented Notes on 16th February informing the two Governments of the action we have action taken and protesting against the infringement of our sovereignty by the Argentine and Chilean parties. Replies were received on 20th February asserting the Argentine and Chilean claims to the territory, protesting against our action, and calling upon us to restore the dismantled buildings and return the arrested men.<br/>
In taking the steps I have described Her Majesty's Government have been concerned to dispel any doubt about their attitude to encroachments of this type on

British territory. At the same time they have repeated the offer made to both countries by the late Government to refer the conflicting claims to territory in the Antarctic to the International Court of Justice. I am sorry to say that both countries, in their Notes, have seen fit once more to reject this offer.</p>

<p>We oppose this Clause, which is the kernel of the Bill, the purpose of which is to set up an Agency whose duty it will be to sell the publicly-owned steel industry to private shareholders.<br/>
I do not propose to argue the case against that de-nationalisation on this Clause because the principle has been contested already on Second Reading and we have to accept the fact that Parliament has agreed to sell the iron and steel industry, which is now under public ownership, to private owners. My purpose in rising to oppose this Clause is not so much to say that we object to it in principle, but to point out the clumsy way in which the Government are proposing to carry out their purpose. We maintain


that if units of this industry, whether companies as a whole or assets now belonging to the Corporation, are to be sold to private owners it should not be by setting up an independent and separate body called the Holdings and Realisation Agency under another Minister, but by a body which is already existent, either the Board or, as we would have preferred it, the Corporation, allowing the Corporation to remain in existence until their duty had been done in this respect.<br/>
But here it is suggested that a new organisation should be set up under the control of a Minister who has no responsibility whatsoever for the welfare of this industry, and, consequently, we get a fantastic diffusion of authority and responsibility over the industry. It will be the duty of these people who form the Agency&#x2014;chosen, no doubt, because of their knowledge of finance, city ways and the promotion of private companies &#x2014;not only to regroup the companies where necessary and to bargain with individuals or groups or insurance companies or the old owners of the companies on financial matters, but also to promote the efficient direction of their subsidiaries &#x2014;the companies under their control. We believe that those subsidiaries are likely to form the major part of the units in the iron and steel industry.<br/>
Here we get a body to be set up not only under the Minister of Supply, who has some knowledge of the iron and steel industry, but also under the Chancellor -&#x2014;a body consisting of people with knowledge of finance, whose duty will be to promote the efficiency of a huge section of the iron and steel industry. We do not believe that it is possible that people chosen for the main purpose of selling these companies at the best possible price will be properly equipped, if equipped at all, to promote the efficiency of such a complicated industry as the iron and steel industry.<br/>
Be it noted that the duty given to the Agency
<q>to promote the efficient direction of their subsidiaries</q>
is almost the same instruction which is given to the Board in respect of the industry as a whole. There is, therefore, bound to be here, to put it at its lowest, a substantial overlapping of authority and responsibility, and we think that that is a most undesirable thing to happen.<br/>
The splitting of responsibility and authority goes very much further than that as a result of establishing the proposed Agency. It splits the responsibility in the industry not just into two&#x2014;the Board and the Agency, as I have already mentioned&#x2014;but, over a whole range of important matters, it splits the responsibility in the industry into six.<br/>
Under the Nationalisation Act the responsibility for the welfare of the industry was divided into two; I think that was reasonable, and it is common in ordinary industrial practice. It was divided between the Board of the companies concerned, who had responsibility for the welfare of their workers and the efficient running of the works, and the Corporation which was the holding company and which had a broad responsibility for the efficiency of the whole industry&#x2014;for planning and things of that sort. That responsibility, as I say, was divided into two, with a reserve responsibility of authority in the Minister who might come in and give a general direction to the industry if he wanted to do so.<br/>
But consider what happens under this new set-up. Take one example, of which I could quote many. A certain company believes that a development scheme is desirable. It believes that it would be in the interests of the workers, the shareholders, potential shareholders and the company as a whole to undertake a substantial development scheme. First of all, the board of the company have to consider the matter and come to certain decisions. They decide that they ought to proceed with a development scheme. This will inevitably go for vetting and confirmation to the Iron and Steel Federation at Steel House, to see whether, under the authority of the planning body there, this proposal fits in or not.<br/>
I do not think that anybody will deny that under the new set-up envisaged by the Bill the authority and the powers of Steel House will be substantial and very much enhanced. Therefore, Steel House will not be able to avoid some responsibility in either approving or of disapproving the scheme. Those are two authorities who will have a say in the matter. Then it will go to the Board&#x2014;that is the third authority&#x2014; and they will have to consider the proposition. After considera-


tion, the Board may say, "No." That is not the end of it, however.<br/>
The company can then appeal to the Minister of Supply who will have responsibility. Suppose he says, "Yes, I think this is a development scheme which I ought to endorse." That is No. 4. But then if this company is still a subsidiary of the Agency, as it very likely will be, and as we believe most of them will be for a long time, the Agency may say, "It does not fit in at all with our plans for selling and with our re-grouping proposals. We do not think that this development should be put into operation. It will interfere with our main duty of selling at the best price all the subsidiaries that we own, and it does not fit in with our co-ordination or regrouping arrangements." That is No. 5.<br/>
Finally, I suppose, the Chancellor will come into it, because he can give general directions to the Agency over which he has general authority; the authority of the Chancellor will be invoked. There are, therefore, six different bodies which will have substantial responsibility for deciding an important issue of this sort.<br/>
3.45 p.m.<br/>
I quoted a development scheme because I thought it was important, but I can envisage all sorts of other situations in which up to six people will have a say in the matter. In short, that responsibility for coming to major decisions will be diffused over a large number of bodies and individuals. If there is criticism at the time about delay in coming to a decision, or if there is criticism afterwards on the grounds that the decision was wrong, everybody will blame everybody else.</p>

<p>I am not sure the Chancellor need he involved if development were envisaged. The Chancellor does not come in at the moment under the nationalisation set-up. It is a matter for the Corporation to settle and, therefore, the Chancellor does not come into it at all. I do not think there is anything in the hon. Gentleman's point.<br/>
We say that the Government, in introducing this Agency under the authority of the Chancellor, are responsible for an exceedingly messy set-up which will lead to bad consequences; organisationally it offends against every canon of good administrative practice. We object to it on those technical grounds, quite apart from the general reason that we do not want any organisation to be set up to sell this property at all. We say that this structure is bound to lead to confusion and to a large measure of irresponsibility amongst the various bodies concerned, because no one, with the possible exception of the Chancellor, would be finally responsible.<br/>
Another reason why we object to this Clause is that we think it is wholly wrong that decisions about selling these immense properties of very great value should be taken by the Agency&#x2014;with or without Treasury approval&#x2014;without any Parliamentary authority or public knowledge of what is happening until many months &#x2014;we do not know how long&#x2014;after the transaction has taken place. We say that the sale of these iron and steel units cannot be compared with the ordinary sale of property held by a Government Department. It cannot in any way be compared to the sale by the Ministry of Supply of the substantial war surplus material which they owned and which they have disposed of exceedingly well&#x2014; if I may say so with all due diffidence&#x2014; to a large number of buyers over the last five or six years.<br/>
There is a very real difference between these two types of sale. First, there is a difference in the size of the units. When the Ministry of Supply were selling war stock of various sorts they never had sales of any one particular item worth millions of pounds&#x2014;certainly not worth tens of millions of pounds. Some of the big iron and steel units are worth tens of millions of pounds. The size of the unit itself creates a difference of principle when we are considering this problem. Whereas it is quite right for a Government Department to sell goods worth a comparatively small sum of money&#x2014;such as &#x00A3;100,000&#x2014;according to normal commercial practice, and it would be perfectly correct to trust them to do so, when it comes to selling public property in units of &#x00A3;5 million or &#x00A3;10 million we say that the difference is such that Parliament should be informed before


the bargain is made, because the amount of public money involved is so substantial.<br/>
When a Government Department are selling surplus property they nearly always have a number of buyers bidding against each other, and the responsible civil servants exercise commercial intelligence and ask for tenders, or whatever is the system, and, finally, sell the property to the highest bidder. But that is not to happen when the large iron and steel units are sold off. Does anybody suggest that a large number of people will be bidding against each other for Margam or Stewarts &amp; Lloyds, or any of those units which are worth millions and millions of pounds? It will not happen in that way.<br/>
A group of people will get together&#x2014; possibly the former owners and insurance companies or other groups&#x2014;and they will say to the Agency, "We are prepared to buy back this property on such and such terms." In most cases, certainly where very valuable property is concerned, there will be no rival bidding. I do not know whether anybody thinks there will be. In fact, it is likely that there will be only one buyer in the market and that buyer will probably be associated with the old owners.<br/>
For that reason the set-up will be a quite different one; the market will not be tested at all. When the Agency is selling these properties they will not be accepting the highest of a number of bids and saying, "This is what rival groups of people have offered." There will be only one buyer in the market, and the Agency will have to judge whether or not their bid is a good one. That makes it desirable for abnormal procedure to be brought into operation to protect these large public properties, and that procedure, we suggest, should be disclosure and report to Parliament of any proposal which the Agency consider it may be desirable to accept. Parliamentary consent should be obtained in one way or another.<br/>
Our third reason for objecting to this Clause is that sales of big steel works cannot be considered as ordinary commercial matters. They are substantially political matters. There is a danger that what will happen is that a bid will be made by one of the big groups I have just mentioned for a particular big steelworks; the Treasury and, no doubt, the people on the Agency whom they have

appointed, being exceedingly able and conscientious people, will say, "We really do not think this offer is a fair and reasonable one "; but there will be only one buyer on the market, the former owners will want to buy back their property at as low a price as possible. They will be encouraged by the fact that they have no competition. They will put in a price which on many occasions the Treasury will think is well below the real value of the property. The situation may well arise where, after six months or a year have passed&#x2014;if the Government are still in power&#x2014;very few of the substantial assets held by the Agency will have been sold off.<br/>
What will happen then? The Prime Minister will say to the Minister of Supply or to the Chancellor, "What has happened to the resale of the steel industry to private owners?" The answer will be, "We have not been able to sell off much. We have still got most of it on our hands because in the view of the experts the prices offered have been too low." The Prime Minister's reply to that will probably be, "This is an impossible situation. The Government and our party have promised to sell back this industry to private owners and here we are, a year after the Act was passed, and nothing has been sold back. You must, therefore, go into the matter again and try to meet these people and accept any price they put forward which is tolerable or in any way defensible, so that we can not only claim that we have sold back substantial units of this industry to private owners but show that we have done so." Otherwise, how ridiculous it will appear if, a year after the passing of this Act, nothing has happened at all and perhaps 90 per cent. of the industry still remains public property under the aegis of the Agency.<br/>
There will be pressure, first of all, on the Chancellor and then, by the Chancellor, on the Agency, to induce them to sell back these units at prices well below what the Agency and the Treasury think are proper. I do not think that that picture of probable events will be challenged by anybody as being impossible or even improbable. That is the sort of development which I and my colleagues think is likely to arise. That is what we fear will happen, at any rate, and I think it is a very reasonable fear.<br/>
For that reason, as well as the other two which I have just mentioned. we say that it is wrong that the public sale of this property&#x2014;worth anything up to &#x00A3;50 million in the case of Margam and the Steel Company of South Wales, or even &#x00A3;5 million or &#x00A3;10 million in the case of some of these big works&#x2014;should be the sole responsibility of the Agency, without any public check on their actions and in such a way that the public and Parliament will know about it only afterwards, when the bargain has been sealed and it is too late to do anything about it.<br/>
We are opposed to the Clause, not only because of its fundamental purpose, but because the way that it proposes to achieve that purpose is, in our view, clumsy, politically dangerous, and, indeed, indefensible.</p>

<p>I should like very briefly to underline two of the points which have been made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Vauxhall (Mr. G. R. Strauss). The first is in connection with what will be the administrative structure of the industry under the Bill. Although this matter has been discussed before, it is particularly appropriate in respect of this Clause, which lays down the major powers of the Agency. I think that nobody who looks at the thing as an exercise in managerial organisation would dispute the contention of my right hon. Friend that all the diffusion of power and responsibility as between Ministers, Agency, Board, companies and the rest, represents something like an administrative nightmare.<br/>
I remind hon. and right hon. Gentlemen opposite that one of the justifications which they urged for the Bill is that the industry as at present organised is, as they put it, divided into two parts: the part which falls within the aegis of the present Iron and Steel Corporation, and the part which falls outside. In urging this, hon. Members opposite have chosen to forget that these two parts are vastly different in size; but, nevertheless, they have said that the previous Government created an impossible situation in the steel industry by dividing it into a publicly-owned and a privately-owned sector.<br/>
Let us look at the effects on the industry of the provisions of the Clause. Clearly, we are to have for as far ahead as anyone can envisage, under the terms of the Act, a publicly-owned sector of the industry and a privately-owned sector. The only change which will be made in this regard by the Bill is to make these two parts more nearly equal to one another than they otherwise would have been; in other words, to emphasise rather than diminish any ill-effects which might flow from this division in two parts.<br/>
While I do not want at the beginning of the day's Committee stage to generate any heat, it is not an unfair point to make that the very provisions of the Clause exhibit as doctrinaire and, one might almost say, dishonest nonsense the main argument which was used by the Government and their supporters in defence of the Bill.<br/>
The second point to which I want to refer is the responsibility laid upon the Agency&#x2014;as, indeed, it is also laid contradicatorily on other people as well&#x2014; to look after the efficiency of that part of the industry which at any given moment lies in their hands. My right hon. Friend has pointed out, as has been pointed out at earlier stages of the Bill, that the members of the Agency will be chosen, quite rightly, in view of their duties, for their expertese in financial matters. Their principal responsibility is a financial responsibility. Their principal function will be as commercial travellers selling shares. They will be chosen for their competence in this matter. It would be extremely surprising&#x2014;it would be an astonishing coincidence&#x2014;if gentlemen chosen for their competence in that regard, no matter how competent in that field and how worthy they were in many other aspects, also happened to be people who knew the best way to run a steel industry.<br/>
There lies here a very great danger to that part of the industry which remains at any given moment in the hands of the Holding and Realisation Agency, that in respect of that part of the industry the responsibility for efficient organisation will be placed upon people with, perhaps, no knowledge of, and expertese in, the operation of the industry.<br/>
As we all know, on both sides of the Committee, very often in the running of any industrial organisation one finds


short-term considerations and long-term considerations in conflict with one another and it is no small part of the art of industrial management to balance long-term and short-term claims when they conflict. We all know occasions when, for example, at annual general meetings, the chairman of a company and his board are often criticised by shareholders because they have refused to take action which appears to be beneficial to the company in the short-term, and have refused to take such steps because they have taken the long-term interests of the company into account.<br/>
The Holding and Realisation Agency is charged with duties which really are short-term. Their task is to get rid of their functions as quickly as possible. They will get their biggest medal from the Chancellor of the Exchequer if they work themselves out of a job in the shortest possible time&#x2014;indeed, it is their task to work themselves out of a job. It is their job to get rid of their responsibilities as quickly as they can. Therefore, they are enjoined by the duty laid upon them to be short-term thinkers and short-term planners. They are enjoined to carry out their functions only with regard to the extent to which any action which they take will or will not help them to make a sale of their shares as quickly as possible.<br/>
How, in these circumstances, can they possibly hold a balance between the short-term needs and the long-term needs &#x2014;above all, the long-term technical needs&#x2014;of the companies which lie within their jurisdiction? They cannot do so if they are doing their duty. There lies within the Clause a very grave danger that technical damage will be done to the industry, because the responsibility, at least partially, for its efficient operation, or an operation of some part of it, is in the hands of people whose incentive is not to worry about technical damage and whose incentive is only to make a sale of shares. I should have thought that if on no other grounds, and leaving aside all political considerations, one would wish to oppose the Clause on that account alone.</p>

<p>One would have thought, listening to the speech of the hon. Member for Reading, South (Mr. Mikardo), that those companies which may remain for a time as

part of the public sector would have no directors. His description of the position was that because the members of the Holding and Realisation Agency were selected primarily on financial grounds, and for that reason would be unlikely to have technical knowledge, it would follow that those companies would not be run efficiently.<br/>
In fact, the efficient running of those companies will be carried out, not by the Agency, but by the directors of those companies, following out the guidance and supervision of the Board which is set up to establish the efficiency of the industry.</p>

<p>The hon. Member is, of course, aware that the Holding and Realisation Agency are the shareholders and that, therefore, they have the last word. They can sack the directors as they wish, as can the shareholders of any other company, and, therefore, they can control the directors. Although, as the hon. Member well knows, in ordinary commercial practice shareholders do not often behave in that way <i>vis-a-vis</i> their directors, that is generally because they are a disparate body without any corporate voice. What we will have under the proposals of the Bill is shareholders with a corporate voice, and with a ready instrument for using in their power. There can be no question that they will have the final authority.</p>

<p>Of course, shareholders do have the final authority, and if they find that those who are in charge of the companies for which they are responsible are not doing their job properly, they will, no doubt, replace them by others. But the direct responsibility for making decisions along the lines of the efficiency of incoming companies will devolve upon directors and not upon the Agency.<br/>

<p>We want to get down to the roots of this matter now that we are in Committee. The hon. Member has just made a very important statement.

<p>It is only possible for directors to run companies under the nationalisation set-up satisfactorily if they are not prevented unreasonably from exercising their free judgment by those who own the shares. The complaint all along has been that under the set-up under nationalisation there has been interference with the day-to-day management by members of the Corporation&#x2014; [HON. MEMBERS: "Where?"].

<p>No. I cannot give way again. The hon. Gentleman has made his point, and I think I have answered it. I do not want to be discourteous, but this has nothing to do with Clause 16, and, if I may be permitted, I will stick to Clause 16, from which I was diverted for a moment by the point that was raised. It is as well, I am sure you will agree, Sir Charles, that I should remain in order for the rest of my speech.</p>

<p>That is what I thought you would say, Sir Charles.<br/>
The point that the right hon. Gentleman has made is that the set-up inherent in Clause 16 is undesirable in that there are two instruments affecting the industry, one financial, in the Holding and Realisation Agency, and the other primarily technical, namely, the Board. I have always felt that the process by which this industry should be handed back could be carried out satisfactorily only if there were two distinct instruments charged with two distinct fields of policy, having all the time the Minister's powers in reserve to see that neither the one nor the other had unreasonable emphasis if they came in

conflict, and that is why I think it will be demonstrated in the course of time that the decision to have two instruments for carrying out this process will be proved perfectly right.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman sought to illustrate his criticisms of that policy of two instruments by citing the instance which he thought might arise. Six different bodies, he thought, would come into the picture. Of course, there are very few pieces of organisation concerning which it is not possible to conjure up as a figment of the imagination a series of events which are not in the least typical of what it is reasonable to expect. I do not think for one moment that this mythical company of which he has thought will remain for a long time in the hands of the public sector, the Holding and Realisation Agency. Notwithstanding its ambitions and ability to develop, I should think that a very unlikely state of affairs. It is those companies with such proposals to put forward&#x2014;development plans&#x2014;to the Board that are less likely to stay long in the hands of the Agency.<br/>
4.15 p.m.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman came back to the point which was raised earlier on an Amendment&#x2014;the argument that it would be proper for the House of Commons to have a say before those major items of sale were made by the Agency. I heard nothing on that point to refute the self-evident fact that the House of Commons is not set up intelligently to comment upon a broad transaction of sales involving so many different aspects&#x2014;counter offers, future prospects, present records, and so on.<br/>
I do not believe for one moment that a proper decision in the name of the public interest could be made with the limited information which it would be possible to put before the House of Commons. To complete that point, if it were thought proper for the House of Commons to go into such matters, the argument would be equally true when the Government bought property, and not necessarily only when they sold it. The suggestion that the House is the judge whether Departmental Ministers acting in the name of the Government should or should not spend &#x00A3;30 million or &#x00A3;50 million or &#x00A3;100 million in this way or that way is, to my way of thinking, a perfect travesty of common sense.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1953-02-23a.1745.0" hansard_membership_id="12567" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29562" speakername="Mr. G. R. Strauss" colnum="1745" time="">
<p>I rise to make two points. The second is only a passing comment. The House laid down the principles, be it remembered, on which this property was to be bought. They were laid down by the House in the Act. It is not the same question, and it does not arise when the Government are selling property now, as when they bought it. But I really rose to ask a question on this point, that the hon. Gentleman says the House cannot judge whether a price is correct or not. I do not know why it should not be possible for me or my colleagues to ask the Government why, for instance, a concern which, it may be, cost &#x00A3;20 million has been sold for &#x00A3;10 million or &#x00A3;15 million, or some figure which appears to us to be wholly wrong and improper. Surely it is the function of the House to cross-examine Ministers when a sale has taken place which appears wholly wrong. If the House is satisfied, it is satisfied. If not, it can declare itself. Is that not the function of Parliament?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1953-02-23a.1745.1" hansard_membership_id="12636" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29590" speakername="Mr. Summers" colnum="1745" time="">
<p>The right hon. Gentleman says those assets were acquired by the State by prescribed methods of purchase, but I am not referring only to the acquisition of shares. I am referring to the acquisition of all sorts of property on behalf of the State. I should have thought it would have been quite impracticable to ask the House of Commons to judge whether too much or too little had been paid for it. Just because the House devised a formula, that is, the Stock Exchange values, as being the price at which those shares should be purchased, that has no bearing on the question of sale.<br/>
As to the other point, what this Agency ought, in my opinion, to be charged with is to do its level best to see that this is handed back without loss to the taxpayer. If that process is accomplished, and some units of sale fetch more than it was thought likely that they would, and some fetch less than it was thought likely that they would, and the taxpayer knows that no loss accrues to him by the process of handing back, I should think that the Agency will have carried out its job to the satisfaction of this Committee and the country.<br/>
If that is so, to come along and ask that each single transaction should be judged on its merits, irrespective of the larger picture, seems to me to lose sight

of the essential factors of the situation on quite false premises. I hope, therefore, that the reality of this will be taken into account, having regard, all the time, to the importance of trying to realise these assets without loss to the taxpayer. That should be the guiding feature of the policy of the Holding and Realisation Agency.</p>

<p>Behind the mask of the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Summers) there appeared for a brief moment the features of the man of common sense, for he thought it should be the duty of the Agency to sell these securities at an appropriate price. If he will turn to their duty&#x2014;their only duty, for they are a one-duty body&#x2014;he will find that doctrine takes the place of wisdom, and that what they have to do is to restore to private ownership the undertakings&#x2014;</p>

<p>The hon. Member has ignored, in his reference to what the Clause says, the time factor, and that it is their duty not to sell in any limited time but to obtain the best price they can secure, and that they are to discharge their duty as trustees for the public in the terms they accept.</p>

<p>All I can say to the hon. Gentleman is that in that case it is not in the Bill. It is much too sensible to be in the Bill. What appears in the Bill is the one duty of the Agency, as I read it out&#x2014;with the provision, to which he quite rightly called attention, about timing, and so on. Those are matters of method. This Agency, conceived in political prejudice out of parents into whose identity we had better not inquire, has only one duty. I am disturbed by the position into which it is being put. It seems to me like filling the shareholders' annual meeting with a collection of bull stockbrokers or stock jobbers. That, I think, is exactly the position. They are all concerned to boost up the shares as high as they can without any regard whatever to what may happen to the companies afterwards. That is the primary concern.<br/>
Meanwhile, there is tacked on to it, under the very same subsection, the in-


congruous duty of promoting the efficient direction of their subsidiaries. I thought it was a well-established principle, in some courts of law at any rate, that responsible people&#x2014;public servants in this instance&#x2014;ought not to be put in a position in which their two duties may well conflict&#x2014;indeed, in a position in which their duties may conflict at all&#x2014; and I should have thought that this was exactly that position.<br/>
The essential weakness of the position previously was that for some uncertain time and to some uncertain extent they would, on behalf of the public shareholders, promote efficiency in the companies, so far as shareholders can do these things; and, at the same time, they were told that their primary duty was to get rid of the shares, and&#x2014;as the hon. Member for Aylesbury rightly and sensibly added that must mean to get a proper price for them. I cannot see how those two duties can be reconciled.<br/>
I should have thought that, in so far as the Agency were called upon to pro- mote the efficient direction of their subsidaries, they were called upon to do something which, so far as it was not done by the Board already&#x2014;and I agree with some of what was said about that&#x2014; it could be much better done, and ought to be done by the Board, which has some degree of technical competence and a general duty to review and report upon the industry, to take action in certain circumstances, and so on. I do not understand why the Agency has been given these two somewhat inconsistent jobs.<br/>
If I may go on with my zoological metaphors, the last one will not take long. I remember that at one time there were wolves in the Saverne in France, and a worthy, distinguished and elderly member of the French nobility, a lady, was given the task of exterminating the wolves, as the Agency is given the task of exterminating what no doubt the Tory Party regard as wolves&#x2014;the publicly-owned companies. She was in a difficulty, because, obviously, the number of wolves was limited and if she killed them off too quickly she would soon lose all the honour and distinction that went with the task. If, on the other hand, she did not kill them off at all, the inhabitants&#x2014;in this case the Tory Party&#x2014;might complain.<br/>
I believe that the Agency is rather in that difficulty here. It fosters its little wolves, it keeps them going, these companies; it handles them along nicely, but all the time there are these murderous instincts in its heart. It is going to kill them as quickly as it can in the interests of political prejudice. It is really rather silly to put a body of public servants in that position.<br/>
I hope that the Financial Secretary will excuse me if I say that it is just the kind of silliness to which the Treasury are occasionally rather inclined. The Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Treasury are extraordinarily wise about some matters; on most matters they are very learned; but there are some things about which they are just silly. This, I believe, is one, and the attempt on the Workers' Educational Association is another.</p>

<p>I imagine that I shall keep within the rules of order if I reply to one of the two charges the hon. and learned Member for Kettering (Mr. Mitchison) was good enough to level in his concluding observations.<br/>
Perhaps I may begin by saying that I wholly agree with the right hon. Member for Vauxhall (Mr. G. R. Strauss) when he says that this Clause constitutes a crucial part of the Bill. As I understood, the criticisms the right hon. Gentleman himself levelled, which were supported by his hon. Friends, were really two. First of all, the right hon. Gentleman, in particular, disliked as a matter of organisation the administrative set-up of Agency and Board. As he himself said, given the purposes which we seek to achieve, in his opinion this was a bad administrative set-up. I think I have understood his argument aright. His second and quite different argument was to express doubts and apprehensions about what would be done with it, given this set-up. I will attempt, if I may, to deal mainly with those two arguments.<br/>
There was also introduced, particularly by the hon. Member for Reading, South (Mir. Mikardo), the issue as to the price at which the Agency would dispose of the companies. I hope that the Committee will forgive me if I do not deal with that issue at any length, if only for the reason that certain proposed Amendments to the next Clause appear to me to raise


that issue in a precise and definite form, and I never believe in inflicting my arguments on the Committee more than once if I can possibly avoid it. I am sure that the Committee will agree with me in at any rate that practice.<br/>
Perhaps I might deal first with the organisational arrangements. It is a technique of administration which, I think hon. Members will agree, forms an interesting arrangement. On the one hand there is the Board with its supervision in technical matters, and the like, over the whole of the industry, publicly owned and privately owned companies alike, and responsible to my right hon. Friend.<br/>
Then there is the Agency, equally with two functions the function of the disposal of publicly owned companies and the function of ownership of those companies pending disposal. That seems to me a clear-cut division of function which is wisely and properly put into the hands of two separate bodies. I thought that my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Summers) put the matter extremely well when he pointed out how different those functions are, calling for rather different qualities, and also calling for a separation of responsibility. That is the scheme as we put it to the Committee.<br/>
It is, of course, not as neat an antithesis in practice as it no doubt sounds at the Dispatch Box, for the very practical reason that there will be discussions and consultations at all levels of this organisation. just as there will be between my right hon. Friends over the practical matters in which they are both concerned. Nevertheless, it is valuable that responsibility itself should not be blurred for these different functions, and that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor should be responsible to this Committee and to the House for the disposal, whereas my right hon. Friend the Minister of Supply, with all the technical advice that he has available, should be responsible for certain activities of the Board, and for the technical side of the industry as a whole, publicly or privately owned.<br/>
4.30 p.m.<br/>
The advantage, as it seems to me, of this administrative arrangement&#x2014;what the right hon. Gentleman called this fantastic diffusion of responsibility&#x2014;is that

there is clear responsibility by my right hon. Friends for their particular sides of the matter specifically and, finally, to the House. That seems an advantage when one contemplates, as contemplate one must, the quite different nature of the functions involved.<br/>
Now let me come to certain of the practical points which arose in the course of the discussion. In the first place, the right hon. Member for Vauxhall thought that there should be required the approval of Parliament for individual sales; at any rate, for individual sales above a certain magnitude. That is a matter which, as the right hon. Gentleman will recall, we discussed on a previous Amendment to some extent.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman, I thought, mobilised some new arguments this afternoon. His first point was that the size of the unit altered the principle. I can well understand his taking that line because, as he himself rather coyly told us, he has probably been responsible for the sale of more public property than any other right hon. Member of the Committee. But if one proceeds to that argument, it is rather difficult to apply it successfully to this subject-matter. After all, what will be disposed of are shares, in a very large degree.</p>

<p>I agree that there are other matters, but the big item &#x2014;and it was the right hon. Gentleman himself who wanted to concentrate attention on the big items, so I am sure he will allow me to take the same point&#x2014; is shares. It may be that in certain cases there will be large purchases. It may equally be that in the case, possibly, of the property of big concerns there will be plenty of small, individual purchases. If the criterion of size is to be adopted, it is very difficult for the right hon. Gentleman to apply that criterion when disposing of blocks of shares, some of which may be disposed of <i>en bloc</i> and some of which may be disposed of in quite small, individual packages.<br/>
It therefore seems that the right hon. Gentleman was seeking to create a quite artificial special case in order to deal with the manifest fact that Ministers of the Crown have in the past been allowed by the House either to dispose of or to acquire enormous blocks of property


without the prior approval of the House. I stress the prior approval, because to listen to the right hon. Gentleman one would have thought that Ministers would not be responsible to the House for these transactions. That is not the case, because for the disposals the Agency must have the approval of my right hon. Friend. That clearly shows that my right hon. Friend is responsible to this House for the approval which he gives.<br/>
If any of the suggestions that have been made were, in fact, to come about, and if, as the right hon. Gentleman himself suggested, property were to be disposed of at quite unreasonably low prices, my right hon. Friend would have to stand at this Box and justify that to the House. Therefore, it seems to me that the right hon. Gentleman has been a little less realistic than he sometimes is, if he suggests that the responsibility of Ministers, in the normal way for transactions they have approved was being diminished by the proposals in the Bill.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman also founded his argument on the assumption that there would be no bidding. When we are talking of the sale of shares, that seems rather a rash assumption to make. Again and again, speakers in this debate have pointed out the valuable nature of these properties. The hon. Gentleman the Member for Rotherham (Mr. Jack Jones) did this with his accustomed vigour the other night, and I agree with him. These are attractive and valuable properties, and I do not think that it should be assumed, as the right hon. Member for Vauxhall assumes, that they are so unattractive that there would be no bidding for them.</p>

<p>I think the hon. Gentleman has got my argument wrong. I did not suggest that the properties were so unattractive that there would be no bidding for them. I said that they were so vast that there would be no competitive bidding for them. Does he suggest that there will be competitive bidding for the Margam works?</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman is not facing up to the difficulties which I put to him. What we are disposing of in a very large degree are shares, and there would be competitive bidding for particular shares or blocks of

shares in the perfectly normal way. I appreciate the right hon. Gentleman's experience, but I do not think that he had fully applied his mind to this difficulty in his criticism.</p>

<p>Would the Minister make clear what he means by the disposal of blocks of shares in relation to the ownership of particular sections of the Corporation's assets? Does he mean that the transfer of these blocks of shares, having no relation to any particular section of the Corporation's assets, will not reach, at some stage, actual control of the industry, or part of the industry, as well as the ownership of particular blocks of the shares? If so, does that mean that ownership and control of any particular part of the industry will not be reached by the disposal of any blocks of shares?</p>

<p>I am sorry, but I do not follow the hon. Gentleman's argument. What I was intending to say&#x2014;and if I did not make myself clear I apologise &#x2014;was that in the case of a great many of these companies which, under the particular type of nationalisation for which the right hon. Gentleman was responsible, still exist, what we would dispose of would be the shares in the companies. The question of control arises when a sufficient quantity of the appropriate category of shares has passed into ownership of one sort or another. I hope that I have succeeded in making myself clear.</p>

<p>I have tried to explain the matter to the hon. Gentleman twice. I think, Sir Charles, that I should be flattering my powers of exposition by trying to do it a third time.</p>

<p>I think that the Minister has a good deal to explain about the real meaning of the disposal of what he calls these blocks of shares. I take it that they relate to assets now in the control and ownership of the Iron and Steel Corporation. They must, therefore, if blocks of


shares are disposed of, have some relationship to a particular part of those assets. Therefore, I ask him to say by way of illustration, if nothing more, at what point in the disposal of these shares will any great block of these shares, such as those of the Margam works, pass into the hands of private bidders for these shares, and how does the argument of the arrangements made for the restriction of offers of these blocks of shares relate to an attempt to secure any particular block of these shares, such as those of the Margam works, by a particular part of the private interests involved.</p>

<p>I think the hon. Gentleman is under a misapprehension that we are talking of disposing of blocks of shares in the iron and steel industry as a whole. What is being disposed of are shares in the individual companies which, as I pointed out, the right hon. Gentleman, in his 1949 Act, preserved. I hope that the hon. Gentleman apprehends that, because the point I would put to him is that what is being disposed of are shares in the X steel company, and the question of control arises in the perfectly normal way when the shares of any company are dealt with. I hope that I have succeeded in explaining that to the hon. Gentleman.</p>

<p>I have been very patient, but I must now return to the main points with which the right hon. Gentleman dealt. The function of the Agency will be, of course, the function of ownership. It will not be intended normally to interfere with the daily management of the companies. It will be responsible for securing the appointment of competent people to the boards and, in the unhappy event of that confidence not being proved justified by events, of replacing them by others. While the companies remain in its ownership that will be the main job and then its main task will be to dispose of them in the way we have been discussing. No doubt we shall have an opportunity of discussing the question of prices on the next Clause.</p>

<p>I pay full attention to the considerations which the right hon. Gentleman was good enough to include in his speech. I appreciate that he has some experience of this industry as, indeed, have many of my hon. Friends, but I do think he will find that his apprehensions as to the organisational system are ill-founded. My right hon. Friend the Minister and all my right hon. Friends have been giving very close attention to the proper organisation of denationalisation, which gives rise to certain perhaps novel and interesting problems. It is so essential from our point of view that this system&#x2014;this assay in denationalisation&#x2014;should function efficiently and smoothly, that I am sure the right hon. Gentleman will take it from me that very careful thought has been given to the administrative problems involved.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1953-02-23a.1754.1" colnum="1754" time="">
<p>We have no more reason than he&#x2014; indeed, less than he&#x2014;to wish to subject this great industry to anything less than the best from the organisational point of view. We are at least as concerned as he is that it shall continue to make a great contribution to the economic wellbeing of this country. We have the incentive, which of course he has not, of desiring to see that the process of denationalisation can be effected smoothly and efficiently.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1953-02-23a.1754.2" colnum="1754" time="">
<p>I say to him with respect that although we have weighed and considered carefully the arguments that he and his hon. Friends have put forward on organisation, we are convinced as a result of very careful thought on this matter that this is in fact the most efficient way to do it. As he has said, this is crucial to the Bill. Therefore, I must ask him to accept from me that we honestly and sincerely believe that this is the best way to do it. I hope I can carry him with me in the hope that it will turn out that his apprehensions about it will prove, as I believe them to be, ill-founded.</p>

<p>Clause, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.</p>
</speech>
<minor-heading id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1953-02-23a.1757.2" colnum="1757">Clause 17.&#x2014;(POWERS OF AGENCY IN RESPECT OF SECURITIES AND COMPANIES.)</minor-heading>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1953-02-23a.1757.3" hansard_membership_id="8068" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/22212" speakername="Mr. R. E. Winterbottom" colnum="1757" time="">
<p>I beg to move, in page 13, line 36, to leave out "or otherwise dispose of."<br/>
This is an exploratory Amendment put down to get an explanation of the words we seek to delete. What does the Minister mean by "dispose of "? What other

ways are there of the Holding and Realisation Agency disposing of shares than by selling? We suggest that these words are unnecessary from two points of view. First, this Clause refers to the power of the Agency in the sale of securities of the present Corporation, and gives sufficient indication of the powers of the Agency to sell without including the suspicious words "otherwise dispose of."<br/>
The second point I want to emphasise relates to the definition. In the Inter-


pretation Clause we are told that security means
<q>any shares, stock, debentures, debenture stock, loan stock, mortgages, income notes, income stock, funding certificates and securities of a like nature.</q>
It seems to me that all these types of security can be disposed of only by selling. I do not think that the Government intended to set up an Agency through which the present shares owned by the Corporation would either be lost or stolen, and I do not think that the Minister wishes to create a filing cabinet in which he could conveniently file them all for further reference. We want a clear explanation of what the Government have in mind in including these words, for to us they seem to be nebulous and obscure. In view of what is contained in this Clause about securities, we should be told something further about the whole subject.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Brightside (Mr. R. E. Winterbottom) was good enough to say that the Amendment was exploratory, and I will endeavour to be of assistance to him in his explorations. If the Clause were amended as this Amendment suggests, the only power given to the Holding and Realisation Agency would be to sell. In other words, we would be limited to outright sale. That would prevent a number of possible ways of making certain disposals of assets, temporarily or permanently. For example, it would completely rule out the exchange of the shares for Iron and Steel Stock which, the hon. Member will remember, was included in the White Paper.<br/>
Then we are dealing here, of course, also with property other than shares. We are dealing, for example, with a terrace of houses, the former property of a steel company. If this Amendment were accepted all that the Agency could do would be to sell those houses over the heads of the tenants and the possibility of granting leases would be excluded. That is another complication which would arise, and which of course, did arise&#x2014;</p>

<p>It seems to me that we are at cross-purposes here. We are talking about the new Agency disposing of assets and securities which they have. If, for instance, they have a row of houses and they intend still to collect the rents, they are not disposing of those houses nor would the question of disposal arise if they were talking in terms of sale. That is the position that is causing confusion at the moment when related to these words.</p>

<p>The confusion that has arisen between the hon. Member and myself is that I understand that we are discussing, at the same time, the Amendment, in page 14, line 8, to leave out from "sale" to "of". If we are not discussing that Amendment now, clearly the answer to the hon. Gentleman's argument will have to wait until we reach that Amendment. I am in the hands of the Committee.</p>

<p>Might I try to help the Financial Secretary and you, Sir Charles? It was our proposal. The words of the two Amendments are similar, but we are not moving the second Amendment. We are moving only the first one, dealing with the question of the sale or disposal of securities.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1953-02-23a.1760.7" hansard_membership_id="1538" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/12674" speakername="Mr. Boyd-Carpenter" colnum="1760" time="">
<p>I am much obliged. I would not discourage the taking of these two Amendments together and I hope that nothing I have said indicates a contrary attitude.<br/>
Acceptance of this Amendment would exclude other methods of disposal of the securities including that which, hon. Members will remember, was forecast as long ago as the White Paper. That would be an important defect. I am not


going to say to what extent it may be desirable or desired that that method should be used. That is a matter which must await the event. It would be unfortunate, and so far as I can see would serve no useful purpose, to exclude it from the powers of the Agency. It would, obviously, be a convenient method in some cases.<br/>
Then there is the question whether, more broadly, it will turn out to be reasonable to make an immediate sale or whether some intermediate stage might fall to be made. We must obviously deal with each case as it arises. If we want to make, as we do, the best disposal of these securities it will be wrong deliberately to limit ourselves to one method of doing so. I cannot see the sense of it. I will reassure the hon. Gentleman with this consideration: until, as the words of the Clause themselves say, the industry has been returned to private ownership, the duty of the Agency in this respect has not been discharged. "Private ownership" is defined in the definition Clause of the Bill Clause 31 if my memory serves me&#x2014;and, therefore, any intermediate stage that may arise could only be on a temporary basis, because private ownership, as defined in the definition Clause, is the state which it is the duty of the Agency, in the very words of the Clause, to seek to achieve.<br/>
All we are concerned with here, apart from the special point of exchange of stock, is a question of what intermediate arrangements might, in any particular case, be convenient. I come back to what I would have thought to be the wish of hon. Members that there should be no unnecessary rigidity, and certainly no artificial difficulties, put in the way of those who are charged with the duty of dealing with the disposal of this industry.<br/>
As I said last week and repeat now, the Agency would have to bear in mind both the consideration of obtaining a fair price for the taxpayer for his very valuable property, and the equally important point of securing that the disposal leaves the industry in good shape and able, as far as possible, to carry out its heavy duties. Both those objectives will have to be borne very carefully in mind. I should have thought it was abundantly clear that we should be very foolish to limit to outright sale the things which the Agency might do. I see no useful purpose in

imposing such a restriction. On the other hand, we should be in some degree prejudicing their capacity to carry out the true objective.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1953-02-23a.1762.0" hansard_membership_id="6950" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/11654" speakername="Mr. Roy Jenkins" colnum="1762" time="">
<p>Surely the Financial Secretary is not going to sit down without telling us what he has in mind under this heading of "intermediate arrangement." It holds out a very wide prospect which I find it difficult to grasp. Surely he would like to tell us what the Government have in mind.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1953-02-23a.1762.1" hansard_membership_id="8068" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/22212" speakername="Mr. R. E. Winterbottom" colnum="1762" time="">
<p>While to a certain extent the Government desire to avoid rigidity, nevertheless I think the Financial Secretary will also agree that it is equally undesirable to have ambiguous flexibility. The Clause is very flexible. There may be behind these words "otherwise dispose of" many possibilities that are not quite in line with the Government's own views. As we have a certain measure of agreement on terms of disposal&#x2014;the Financial Secretary has agreed that we cannot finally dispose of them until the Agency has sold them&#x2014;and as the word "dispose" is part of the subsection that we are discussing, the Government should seriously consider drafting into the Clause what they mean by "otherwise dispose of," or freeing the Clause from abiguity by withdrawing those words.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1953-02-23a.1762.2" hansard_membership_id="1538" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/12674" speakername="Mr. Boyd-Carpenter" colnum="1762" time="">
<p>I gladly respond to the hon. Gentleman, but I do not know that I can help him very much. What is obviously desired in a case of this sort&#x2014; the ultimate objective being settled by the Bill, namely, the return to private ownership&#x2014;is to secure that during the period before that is completely achieved the Agency shall be as little handicapped in its sensible carrying out of its job as possible. It would be quite wrong for the Government to lay down in advance what particular alternatives, temporary expedients, interim measures&#x2014;call them what you like&#x2014;should be adopted.<br/>
It would not only be wrong but it would be very unwise, because anything said in this Committee is said ultimately in the hearing of those who may be concerned to purchase. We do not in any way wish to weaken the hands of the Agency in dealing with these transactions. It is much the best way to leave the


freedom which the Clause gives the Agency, and, at the same time, to recall to hon. Gentlemen that these disposals will be subject ultimately to the responsibility which Ministers have to the House of Commons. If any of the methods which may be used may seem in any particular case to be inappropriate, a Minister will have to answer for them. I am sure that that is the wise way to tackle the matter rather than to try to inhibit the Agency even before they start their business.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1953-02-23a.1763.0" hansard_membership_id="9373" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/18428" speakername="Mr. Mitchison" colnum="1763" time="">
<p>Whenever I listen to the Financial Secretary to the Treasury I am not able quite to decide whether I am reading Gibbon or Samuel Johnson or listening to&#x2014;no, not Mr. Gladstone; I would not put that on him&#x2014;but another Conservative orator of the past. I sympathise with him today. It is very difficult to say, in that sort of language, "We want to 'pop' them."<br/>
He could only give us one instance of what he wanted to do with these securities. He said, "If you want to exchange them for Iron and Steel Stock, you can only do it if you have these words in the Bill." Yet all we have to do is to sell the one and buy the other, and as we do not pay any Stamp Duty, the effect of the transaction is exactly the same. If that is what he is after, I should think he ought to accept the Amendment. The views expressed by the hon. Gentleman might have some relevancy when we come to the Finance Act, but I doubt if they make much difference here. The hon. Gentleman would not say that he might want to "pop" them or that he was going to "give them to the boys." I cannot see why these words are required.<br/>
However, I do not think it is a matter of great importance and I hope that we shall not take long over it. Since this is supposed to be the place where the public, whose property this is, is represented, I feel that the Government might have told us what they meant to do with these shares if they were not going to sell them. I am disappointed with the reply we have received.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Brightside (Mr. R. E. Winterbottom) said that this Amendment was an exploratory one. We realise that there are other things to be done besides

selling the industry, and if we were asked to state what appropriate words we would introduce, it might lead to protracted discussions. We are afraid that the use of these words may lead to ambiguity.<br/>
For instance, there has been a suggestion that when the Agency became tired of trying to dispose of the industry&#x2014; or parts of it which we could mention&#x2014; they might put the shares into a national lottery or raffle. That was perhaps facetious, but my hon. Friend is afraid that some part of our national assets might be dealt with in a manner detrimental to the public interest. On the understanding that what we have said will be borne in mind by the Government, namely, that even the least valuable assets should not be wasted, we shall not press this Amendment to a Division, and I suggest to my hon. Friend that his Amendment might be withdrawn.</p>

<p>I gladly give that assurance. Indeed, I think I have already done so. It is certainly not our intention to give away, with the proverbial half-pound of tea, valuable assets of this kind. I said previously that one of the main duties of the Agency will be to obtain a fair price for the taxpayer.</p>

<p>Clause 17 has the limited objective of dealing with the disposal of securities. We have spent a great deal of time voicing our criticisms of the arrangements which the Government envisage are to obtain between the Agency, the Board and the Minister, but when we come to Clause 17 we are dealing with something narrower in scope and on which it is easier for the Government to accept the proposals contained in this Amendment and in the next one also, in line 37.<br/>
The standpoint from which we start in making these proposals is identical with the standpoint from which the Government start, namely, that the public is to get its full money's worth of what it parts with. Unless something has escaped my notice, there is nothing in the Bill to provide that not less than a certain minimum is to be obtained as the sale price of these securities. The only thing I have been able to discover is that Clause 16 (1) enables the Agency, instead of selling at once to postpone its sales, presumably in order to get the best price possible. Yet there is no provision for a lower limit below which that price must not fall. That is left entirely to the Agency which, in terms of the provisions of this Clause, is in that regard to act under the direction of the Treasury.<br/>
We seek to provide such a lower limit by two separate and independent provisions. We have embodied in our first Amendment what we conceive to be a simple test. In our proposal securities are not to be sold back at less than what was paid for them under Part II of the Iron and Steel Act when they were taken over. In the first place, I would remind the Committee that the Iron and Steel Act imposes as the compensation test, broadly speaking, the Stock Exchange price. When we were discussing that Act the present Government were in Opposition and they said that the Stock Exchange price was much too low. Well, let us assume for the purpose of argument that it was. If we take that price, which <i>ex hypothesi</i> was too low, as the price below which the assets should not now be returned, surely we should not be setting an unduly rigid test in putting that as the minimum price for which those securities are to be sold.<br/>
I am sure that the Financial Secretary and the Minister will agree about the justice of that, though they may not agree with everything I say. If the compensation had been much too high, perhaps the test which we are now seeking to impose would be too exacting, but if the Financial Secretary and the Minister have both complained of that amount as being too low&#x2014;as I am sure they have and certainly their associates were loud in their outcries in that regard they cannot now say that we, in saying that the compensation amount is to be the lower limit, are arguing for any unreasonably exacting test in formulating the price below which these securities should not be sold.<br/>
Secondly, in replying to my right hon. Friend the Member for Vauxhall (Mr. G. R. Strauss), the Financial Secretary said not so long ago that all the public could expect for the securities as a whole would be to obtain what was given for them when they were taken over. He said that some might be sold below what they should fetch whereas some might be sold above that figure, but that the only concern which the public might legitimately have was that, taking all in all and adding the whole aggregate together, as much should be obtained on the sale as was given when they were taken over.<br/>
I am saying, let us provide an objective low-level test. As the Bill stands, there is not the slightest guarantee that what


the hon. Gentleman said was the public's legitimate concern will be safeguarded. When the many years have rolled by which are to roll by during the disposal, it may be found that the securities have been sold at a price which was, in fact, much too low. If that is the case, nobody can make a complaint under the terms of the Bill, because the Bill sets no lower limit. It seems to us that if the Bill is passed without such a safeguard, then it will be quite outrageous, because public assets will be in risk of being disposed of at a price far below what they ought to fetch.<br/>
The Agency is not bound to dispose of them at once. In the case of the Transport Bill, the Minister of Transport said he wanted to get rid of the lorries and to hand them back to private ownership by the end of 1954, and when we proposed a similar test in the case of the disposal of road transport, the Government objected, presumably largely upon the basis that they wanted to get rid of the lorries very quickly. That is not the case under this Bill. The Agency can take its time. It is expressly empowered to create delays and to postpone individual sales. If it can take its time, then the Agency should be enjoined by the Bill not to sell at less than a minimum price; and that is what we propose.<br/>
I call attention to some of the features of our proposals. Dealing first with securities which vested under Part II of the Iron and Steel Act, we say that the Agency should see what was the Stock Exchange compensation price paid for those securities. That is easy to ascertain; there is no practical administrative difficulty about it, for it is simply a matter of looking up the records. We then recognise that, since those securities were taken over, there may have been structural alterations in the capital build up of the company which may make it necessary to provide some adjustment upwards or downwards. To deal with that, we make what we consider to be an eminently practical proposal&#x2014;that it should be for the Treasury to determine what the upward or downward alteration should be.<br/>
There should be no difficulty about that. I hope the Minister will not give an answer on the basis that there is some administrative difficulty in carrying out

this proposal, because I put it to both the Minister and to the Financial Secretary that there can be no such difficulty. It is for the Treasury to make a computation and to do their best to fix the upward or downward adjustment. That is what we propose in the first Amendment&#x2014;a simple, objective test which is to have for its purpose the supremely important aim that the public should not be deprived of what ought to belong to it; and what ought to belong to the public is the full value of these shares, which ought to be obtained when they are sold.<br/>
Our second proposal falls in line with the first and is designed to achieve the same end. Many of these companies which were taken over under the Iron and Steel Act, 1949, have shown very great improvement in their earning capacity. As earning assets, they are now far more valuable than when they were taken over. I cannot give details of individual records of individual companies, for it would not be right to do so, but I think it is right to point out that the total aggregate of the earnings of the companies concerned last year was very greatly in excess of their total aggregate for the previous year.<br/>
It therefore stands to reason that when some of these companies are sold, they will have a much stronger financial standing than when they were taken over; they are earning more, they have expanded and they are much more valuable assets than when they were acquired under the Act of 1949. It therefore seems to hon. Members on this side of the Committee&#x2014;and I can speak for all my hon. Friends&#x2014;that there is no conceivable reason why those who dispose of these assets should not be enjoined by the terms of the Bill to have full regard to the effect of any change in the earning capacity of a company and in its financial strength. I can see no answer to that proposition.<br/>
It may be that the Financial Secretary or the Minister will leap to their feet and say they are only too glad to accept the proposal, but having regard to the attitude which the Government have previously adopted I suspect that they may not be quite as forthcoming as that. In framing our proposals, we have carefully thought the matter out and have endeavoured to fall directly in line with


what the Government are already proposing in the structure of Clauses 16 and 17. We say that the Treasury should be given the responsibility of saying whether or not they approve or disapprove of a disposal price and that they should not approve of a disposal price unless due regard has been paid to any improvement in the asset value of a company and its earning capacity.<br/>
We are asking for only a very modest and limited extension to the provisions of Clauses 16 and 17. Already, under Clause 16, the Treasury are empowered to approve of or withhold approval of postponements and disposals under subsection (1). Equally, under Clause 17, the Treasury are empowered to give general directions to the Agency. We do not like the relationship between the Agency and the Treasury or the relationship between the Minister and the Board as at present formulated in the Bill, and we have voiced our criticisms; but if that relationship is to remain in its present form we say that we should fall in line to the extent that we couple our present proposals with the structure which the Government propose. All we say, therefore, is that as the Treasury already have the duty of approving or not approving the sales, then they shall not give their approval unless it is perfectly clear to the Treasury that due regard has been paid to the improvement in the asset value of the company concerned.<br/>
Perhaps the Government will accept this proposal, although neither Minister has been particularly forthcoming. I see a very encouraging smile from the Financial Secretary, but I do not know what it presages. Perhaps I am unduly pessimistic in my attitude; certainly I hope I am. We feel that if the Ministers cannot accept the proposal, then they cannot base their refusal on any other ground than that they are oblivious to the public interest in this crucially important matter. How can they refuse to accept these objective tests unless they are prepared to say, "We do not mind whether what is obtained for these shares is less than what ought to be obtained"?<br/>
I cannot impute any such motive to them. I am quite sure that no Minister harbours such a motive. Nevertheless, it is difficult in logic to reconcile any refusal to accept these proposals except with such an imputation&#x2014;which I do not for

one second make against either Minister. It may be that those experts who advise them&#x2014;as they always advise Ministers who are hard pressed&#x2014;have said that in this case, if the Amendments are dissected, the Minister can find something in the drafting which is wrong or some inconsistency or some anomaly which would result from the terms of the Amendment. May we say at once that we on this side of the Committee are not wedded to the terms of the Amendment. We have made the proposals in order to assert and emphasise the principle that the assets should not be disposed of at less than they ought to fetch.<br/>
With that explanation, I commend the two Amendments to the Committee. I urgently ask the Government to think very closely before they say there is some difficulty in the way of accepting them, for, if there is a difficulty, they should remove it by altering the terms of the Amendments. I urgently press upon the Ministers that they should say that in principle they agree that these proposals are necessary to supplement an otherwise extremely defective Bill.</p>

<p>The right hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Neepsend (Sir F. Soskice) was quite right when he said that his standpoint on this matter was identical with ours. Indeed, the only criticism I have to make of his speech is that he paid me the compliment of attributing to me certain words spoken at an earlier stage by my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Summers). To have my hon. Friend's words about steel attributed to one is a very subtle compliment which I appreciate.<br/>
The attitude of the Government on this matter has been set out as long ago as the White Paper which was laid last July. It says, in paragraph 34:
<q>In deciding the price to be asked, regard will be had to all relevant factors at the time of sale. Account will have to be taken of the important changes which have taken place since nationalisation in the physical assets, capital structure, reserves and trading prospects of many of the iron and steel companies, together with other considerations such as the monetary and market conditions prevailing at the time.</q>
It is against that background that I wish to look at the two Amendments,


the first of which the right hon. and learned Gentleman has moved in his usual persuasive and effective manner. They differ appreciably, as he recognises. The first seeks, subject to a qualification where the capital structure of the company has been varied, to tie the sales to the level of compensation. The difficulty of that as a test is that there have been changes upwards and downwards in the position and value of at any rate some of the companies since nationalisation. If we were to accept as the criterion the amount of compensation paid on nationalisation, we should be inclined to get into difficulties both ways.<br/>
Some companies have had the advantage of recent modernisation showing itself in their going ahead and prospering. There is another category&#x2014;here I reply to a whispered interjection by the hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. Jack Jones)&#x2014; that of the company which has made a large use of scrap and, owing to recent difficulties in getting scrap, of which the hon. Gentleman is well aware, has found that its position has worsened. Those are the sort of problems&#x2014;</p>

<p>Is the hon. Gentleman telling the House that, arising from these technical difficulties, there has been a downward trend in capital valuation and capital structure? My whispered interjection was that we should like some evidence of a downward trend arising from the difficulties which the hon. Gentleman has mentioned.</p>

<p>I am sure the hon. Gentleman will accept that, during the intervening period, some companies have done better than others, quite independent of changes in capital structure, which is the only qualification in the Amendment.</p>

<p>I hope that the hon. Gentleman is right, but I do not think he is. It does not matter whether he is or is not right; what is important is that their relative position compared with one another has changed since nationalisation, quite apart from the capital structure. A test which might 'well impose too high a value for one would impose too ludicrously low a value for

another and that is the great difficulty of the first Amendment.</p>

<p>Our Amendment proposes only a lower limit. It does not advance the argument in the least to point out what the hon. Gentleman has been saying. We are proposing that there should be a lower limit below which we should not go.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1953-02-23a.1772.1" hansard_membership_id="1538" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/12674" speakername="Mr. Boyd-Carpenter" colnum="1772" time="">
<p>What the right hon. and learned Gentleman does not appear to have appreciated is that if we put so precise a lower limit into a statute it often works out as something very near an upper limit too. The difficulty is that a potential buyer is able to point in the Act of Parliament to what was apparently considered as a reasonable level of price. [HON. MEMBERS: "No."] Indeed, that is the danger, and we should weaken considerably the bargaining position of the Agency, and that is precisely what the right hon. and learned Gentleman and all of us wish to avoid. The first Amendment seems to have very real difficulties because it takes insufficient account of the relative changes which have followed nationalisation.<br/>
The second Amendment is less unattractive from that point of view because it does not seek to tie the conception of what is a fair price to the compensation value. The difficulty of the Clause with the Amendment would be that it would give undue prominence to the question of price compared with the other considerations which we have all so far been treating as similar in their importance. Indeed, it would do exactly what the hon. Member for Rotherham in a speech a little time ago accused the Government of wanting to do, of concentrating on the "brass" It would be a little objectionable to insert here the question of price as the only consideration to which statutory force is given while ignoring the other considerations, to which I attach considerable value, of the general overall national interest&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."]&#x2014;most certainly&#x2014;and of the overall capital resources for further development which purchasers may have available, another very important consideration in an industry the development of which we all want to see going on unchecked.<br/>
Also, it does not make adequate allowance for the other consideration of &#x2014;I hate the phrase, but it is the only


one&#x2014;re-integration, the shape of the industry or the arrangement of the industry in the most efficient form. We all know that that will be borne in mind &#x2014;it has been said from this Box again and again, and I am sure all hon. Members accept it as so&#x2014;but it seems to me that we should be running some risk of appearing to attribute excessive, indeed, unique importance to the consideration of price if we were to lay the price consideration by statute upon the Agency while leaving all the other equally important considerations outside.<br/>
This is the way I have been looking at the matter. I am anxious, and so is my right hon. Friend, to reassure hon. Gentlemen opposite that there is no intention of any sort or kind to dispose of the assets at an unduly low price. Indeed, it is somewhat remarkable to have it suggested that that sort of thing is a habit of Her Majesty's Treasury, which is the Department of State responsible for the disposals. It is certainly a new line of attack upon the Treasury.</p>

<p>Our experience of attacks made upon the Treasury by the Opposition has made us attach excessive importance to this consideration. It really seems a fantastic suggestion to make. I am, however, anxious to reassure hon. Gentlemen opposite, even though their apprehensions strike me as fantastic. I appreciate there can be different views upon this matter; and, so far as possible, my right hon. Friend and I wish to meet genuine apprehensions which, although ill-founded, are sincerely and honestly held.<br/>
If the right hon. and learned Gentleman will not press these Amendments, I should like, on Report stage, to introduce an Amendment to cover this point, that is, to lay down that a reasonable price must be one of the considerations

before the Agency, and to meet the right hon. and learned Gentleman by putting that into the Bill. As has been said again and again, a provision in a statute is better than any Ministerial assurance. [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] I have certainly said that when I was on the other side of the Committee, and I think I was right, and so I do not deny that the right hon. and learned Gentleman may be right as well.<br/>
We are prepared to table an Amendment which while covering that point, would also not exclude, expressly or by implication, consideration of the other matters to which I have referred. I hope that, as it seems to me, unnecessary assurance&#x2014;given squarely and fairly to meet genuine, if ill-founded apprehensions&#x2014;will be satisfactory to the Committee. For reasons I have explained, it does not seem to me that either of these Amendments can be accepted as they stand. But, if hon. Members opposite can attain what seems to them the important objective of having this safeguard put in the Bill, I do not suppose they will care very much about that. In any event I am not in a position to give the proposed wording of my Amendment, because I have only very recently made arrangements to have the drafting commenced.<br/>
I am assured that a possible form of words, not subject to the difficulties arising on these Amendments, can be evolved. Having met the right hon. and learned Gentleman in that spirit, I hope he is satisfied that we, just as much as himself, are determined to get a fair price for these assets.</p>

<p>We on this side of the Committee can agree with the Financial Secretary on one of his statements, if with no other, that a provision in a statute is better than any number of Ministerial assurances. We certainly feel very strongly about that. But I am afraid his assurance about a provision in this statute did not go very far to meet the case put by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Neepsend (Sir F. Soskice). As I understand it, we are to have some rather vague provision, ensuring that a reasonable price shall be paid for securities sold under this Clause, but there is to be nothing relating that in any way to the 1949 prices, and nothing taking


into account the specific points put forward by my right hon. and learned Friend.<br/>
Therefore, there will still be loopholes for sales to take place at prices which we should regard as thoroughly inadequate. I consider these two Amendments are absolutely crucial from the point of view of endeavouring to bind the Government. As the hon. Gentleman himself said, assurances are not enough. That is our view, and during this afternoon the hon. Gentleman has made me feel not less apprehensive, but more so, about the possible way in which these securities may be disposed of.<br/>
5.45 p.m.<br/>
When discussing the Amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Brightside (Mr. R. E. Winterbottom), the hon. Gentleman suddenly introduced the most frightening concept that temporary arrangements might be made by which it would be possible for the Government to lease securities to a possible buyer, on very favourable terms, and allow that buyer eventually to buy the securities out of the profits accruing from the companies in which he held the securities. That would be a very easy way for someone to get the industry back, but not necessarily a very desirable way.<br/>
The Financial Secretary said that, in selling these securities, we should take into account, not merely the prices offered, but also the capital resources of the people who made the offers. That opens up another whole new field. The hon. Gentleman cannot complain if we wish to tie up this matter a little more than by Ministerial assurances and a little more than will be achieved by his proposed Amendment on Report stage.<br/>
My right hon. and learned Friend deployed a very powerful case. I do not want to go over it at great length, but merely to touch on one or two further points. Let us consider the first Amendment and relate this matter to the 1949 take-over prices. As I understood the argument of the hon. Gentleman, it was directed, not so much to any suggestion that this Amendment was impracticable as to the fact that it was undesirable, largely because of the changes in circumstances which have taken place since 1949, and which have affected different companies

in different ways. I understood that to be his point, and not that it was impracticable to go back and uncover a few layers and get back to the 1949 position; it was not desirable to do so, because some companies have done much better than others during the intervening period I hope I understood the hon. Gentleman aright.<br/>
I think, however, that we must turn our minds back to 1949 and realise that all we are asking here is that these 1949 prices should be a minimum. The hon. Gentleman's argument, that because a minimum was put in the Bill it would automatically become a maximum, was one of the weakest I have ever heard him deploy in this House. He paints a different picture of the way in which these securities will be sold according to the Amendment with which he is dealing. Sometimes he says, "Of course, what is going to happen is that we shall have a very competitive market, with a great number of buyers bidding against each other." He said that during our discussion on Clause 16 because it then suited him.<br/>
Now the hon. Gentleman postulates a position in which we shall have only one possible buyer, and that he will point a pistol at the Government, because a certain sum is stipulated in the Bill, and will say that that is what Parliament thought to be not only the minimum but the maximum as well. It really is one of the weakest arguments I have heard. We must remember how strongly right hon. and hon. Gentlemen in the Conservative Party expressed themselves about these compensation terms in 1949. We must realise how very reasonable it is to put in those figures as being a minimum.<br/>
I wish to weary the Committee with two quotations from the Second Reading debate. The Secretary of State for the Colonies (Mr. Lyttelton) said:
<q>The Government have artificially depressed the shares and have relied on the co-operation of the industry not to increase its dividends and then bought the shares at the rigged market price. I consider the Government"&#x2014;</q>
and here we have a little of the rather elephantine humour which we sometimes associate with the Colonial Secretary&#x2014;
<q>should consider altering the title of the Bill to the Iron and Steal Bill. So much for compensation."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 15th November, 1948; Vol. 458, c. 92.]</q>


Then we had the Prime Minister saying:
<q>&#x2026; in the case of steel, the conduct of the Government in buying compulsorily at the market value is not only unfair, but it seems actually dishonest. We assert, and it is our sincere belief, that by their threats of steel nationalisation they have artificially depressed the value of steel shares."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 16th November, 1948; Vol. 458, c. 229&#x2013;30.]</q>
We had the party opposite taking the view at that time that these were grossly inadequate prices. If they have changed their view I think they should tell us. That would be a very interesting consideration to have in mind in discussing this Amendment. But, if they have not changed their mind, in view of the strong language then used it is not good enough to say that because there have been a few relative changes it is impossible to put in these prices which were regarded as so disgracefully inadequate three years ago.<br/>
In the four years since that debate we have not had any general fall in Stock Exchange values. They went down a bit first, then up substantially, then down and now they have gone up again. The "Financial Times" index of industrial ordinary shares is two points higher than it was when these very strong statements were made in November, 1948. There is no reason to suspect that general market conditions would have made unreasonable a minimum based on those prices.<br/>
I should have thought that it would be accepted that the general prospects for the steel industry were, if anything, brighter now than in 1948. There has come to be more general agreement that we need to carry through a substantial increase in the size of the industry as quickly as we can. Therefore, the minimum we propose is very low indeed. Unless the Government have the most sinister intentions about the disposal of these shares, I should have thought that our suggestion could have been accepted. There are no great practical difficulties. Somebody has to make a reasonable valuation from time to time, and we are asking that the Treasury should do it.<br/>
We were told by the hon. and learned Member for Middlesbrough, West (Mr. Simon) that Parliament could not pronounce judgment. I think the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Summers) said the same this afternoon. But somebody

must do it if the Bill is to be made to work, unless everything is to operate in the dark, with great possibilities for private gain and public loss. Therefore, from the point of view of both the desirable and the practical, I should have thought that it was eminently reasonable to ask at any rate for the 1949 minimum to be put in. It is difficult to imagine a lower minimum. The Government's little concession to us, if it means anything at all, ought not to be confined to rather nebulous points about a reasonable price. It ought to bring in the 1949 minimum.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1953-02-23a.1778.0" hansard_membership_id="6684" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29185" speakername="The Minister of Supply (Mr. Duncan Sandys):" colnum="1778" time="">
<p>There must have been some misunderstanding. Hon. Gentlemen opposite have always responded most generously to any sincere concession to their point of view from the Government benches. My hon. Friend the Financial Secretary went a long way toward meeting the point of the second Amendment. That was our intention. The first Amendment links the amount to be paid for the securities to the compensation paid under nationalisation. My hon. Friend explained why we did not feel that it was possible to accept that approach.<br/>
He addressed himself to the other Amendment, which, I assume, is an alternative. It was our intention to go a long way toward meeting the principle. That Amendment asks that the Treasury should be;
<q>&#x2026; satisfied that the price or other consideration to be received upon such sale or other disposal is adequate, regard being had in particular in the case of such securities to any improvement in the assets, financial position and earning power and record of the Company in which such securities are held since they vested in the Iron and Steel Corporation of Great Britain &#x2026;</q>
That is in close accord with paragraph 34 of the White Paper, which says:
<q>In deciding the price to be asked, regard will be had to all relevant factors at the time of sale. Account will have to be taken of the important changes which have taken place since nationalisation&#x2026;</q>
That touches the same point as that of the Amendment:
<q>&#x2026; in the physical assets, capital structure, reserves and trading prospects &#x2026;.</q>
Earning power is mentioned in the Amendment:
<q>.&#x2026;of many of the iron and steel companies, together with other considerations such as the monetary and market conditions prevailing at the time</q>


This is a genuine point. We should not like it to be thought that we had any intention of selling the industry for a song. We went out of our way in the White Paper to say that it might take some years before the work of the Agency was completed. That showed that we intended to insist upon an adequate price. If we intended to sell the industry for a song there would be no difficulty in disposing of it overnight.<br/>
We propose to introduce an Amendment on Report to incorporate the substance of paragraph 34. The only difference between that paragraph and the second of the two Amendments is that it recognises that there are other considerations which must be taken into account by the Agency. The Amendment recognises that this is not a comprehensive list. It uses the words, "in particular." There is not much between us in this matter. We are not linking up with compensation payments, but we are prepared to introduce an Amendment to give effect to paragraph 34 of the White Paper. I hope that I have removed any misunderstanding. What was said by the hon. Member for Stechford (Mr. Roy Jenkins) showed that he had not recognised how far we were prepared to go.</p>

<p>The Amendments are not alternative: they are cumulative. The Minister made a most helpful intervention in which he regretted that there should have been a misunderstanding. If there was a misunderstanding, I venture to lay responsibility at the door of the Financial Secretary. He, in his usual persuasive way, tried to get us to accept an undertaking that the Government would put down an Amendment on Report stage which would provide&#x2014;I think I quote his words accurately&#x2014;that a reasonable price would be a consideration. Anything less than that under-taking it is difficult to conceive. We do not expect the Government to embody in the Bill a proposal that an unreasonable price should be a consideration.<br/>
We thought that it was the minimum that anybody could contemplate that a reasonable price should be considered. We were far from satisfied with the proposal of the Financial Secretary. But the Minister has pointed out that the second Amendment incorporates what

the White Paper specified. Therefore, the Amendment cannot be very far off the mark. I recommend to my hon. Friends that on the second Amendment we should wait to see what the Government do by way of implementing the undertaking given by the Minister. It may well be that the undertaking now amplified and illuminated by the Minister's intervention and extended from the jejune form in which it fell from the lips of the Financial Secretary may satisfy my hon. Friends.<br/>
6.0 p.m.<br/>
So far as the first proposal is concerned, my hon. Friends and I were in great difficulty in anticipating what answer we were to be given. We have heard of administrative difficulties being put forward, but the Minister, in trying to answer what we have put forward, was in a difficult situation and was looking up feelingly from a woefully inadequate brief, and hoping to get away with some sweet words, and nobody is a greater adept at that than the Financial Secretary. I used to try it myself before him, and I know the agonies of mind which he must have been going through.<br/>
I think that the hon. Gentleman's brief, having regard to his very great intellectual equipment for the purpose, must have been unusually inadequate. All he said to us was that if we impose a reserve price, we shall never get more than the reserve price. That is really the substance of his argument, but it is not an argument that appeals to anybody on this side of the Committee, nor will it, I think, appeal to many hon. Gentlemen opposite.<br/>
I therefore advise my hon. Friends, and I certainly desire myself, to signify our very severe disapproval of the answer which has been given to our first proposal. We think it is of great importance. We have not put down this Amendment for purposes of debate. We think the first proposal an important one, and, in these circumstances, I hope my hon. Friends will agree to the course I have suggested with regard to the first Amendment. With regard to the second Amendment, I hope they will agree with me that I should not press it, in anticipation of what the Government may do to implement the undertaking which the Financial Secretary and the Minister has just given.</p>

<p>We really ought to weigh very carefully the results which will flow from the attitude which the Minister has taken up on these two Amendments. By accepting one Amendment which will put into the Bill the provision that an adequate price shall be sought, and, at the same time, refusing another Amendment which proposes that the 1949 compensation take-over price should be incorporated as a reserve, he has, in effect, admitted that an adequate price may very well be below the compensation price of the 1949 take-over. That is a point which I am sure will be regarded as of very great interest to those who may be thinking of buying their way back into the industry.<br/>
The only thing which could prevent sectors of the old industry from taking advantage of the Minister's admission is if there were likely to be Teal and genuine competition for the shares of the establishments in the iron and steel industry. That, indeed, was indicated by the Financial Secretary when speaking on the previous Clause. He said that we must envisage that there will be competition for these shares. I suggest that that is an entirely mistaken appreciation. In fact, there will be no competitive bidding for these shares unless there are 105 people bidding for 100 shares; if there are only 99 bidding, there will be no effective competitive bidding increasing the value of the shares.<br/>
I think we can rule out straight away the idea that the small investor is going to be falling over himself in his eagerness to buy his way back into the iron and steel industry. There will be those who are well satisfied with the compensation terms which were granted. They now, at least, have a long-term security for their assets, under the compensation granted in 1949, which they certainly would not have in an industry which is as susceptible to cyclical fluctuations as the iron and steel industry would be in private hands. The small man who is</p>

<p>concerned in investing wisely will not be over-eager to buy his way back into the industry; the people who will be anxious will be those groups who still regard steelmaking plant and assets as one part of a vertical trust organisation and who will prepare their long-term policy on the assumption that losses on steel-making plants will be recouped elsewhere.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1953-02-23a.1782.1" colnum="1782" time="">
<p>Is there any likelihood that the larger groups concerned with buying their way back into the industry will be competing with one another to secure the assets of one particular plant or group? I suggest that there is not the faintest likelihood of that at all. Before nationalisation, they were very closely integrated by interlocking directorships, and they had working machinery through the conferences of the Federation. Their attitude will surely be, "I am interested in buying back part of plant A; if you, B, will lay off plant A and concentrate on plant B, all will be well." There is absolutely no likelihood that a big combine which was previously interested in Margam will suddenly start bidding to buy back the assets of a steel works in Scunthorpe or somewhere else. The whole thing will be very carefully apportioned and shared out beforehand.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1953-02-23a.1782.2" colnum="1782" time="">
<p>In the light of the statement which the Minister has made, and of his attitude to these two Amendments, we can rid our minds of the conception that these people will compete. They will decide what uncompetitive bids they are to make for these assets, and that, in the words of the Minister's definition, will mean an "adequate price," despite the increase in profitability, despite the additional investment and the new development which has taken place, and that "adequate price" in the Minister's own mind may well be below the price at which these assets were taken over three or four years ago.</p>

<p>The next Amendment selected is that in page 14, line 7, and I think it would be to the convenience of the Committee if we also dealt with the Amendment in page 14, line 20, at the end, to insert:
<q>(5) In exercising the powers vested in them by subsection (1) of this section, the Agency shall not sell or otherwise dispose of to any purchaser or other person any securities of a company vested in them of a class carrying voting rights unless at the same time such

<p>I beg to move, in page 14, line 7, at the end, to insert:
<q>so, however, that they shall not so exercise their powers as to produce the result that the nominal value of the shares in any such subsidiary other than the loan capital therein


and the shares therein carrying preferential rights to a fixed dividend shall be less than fifty-one per cent. of the aggregate of the nominal values of such loan capital and of such shares carrying preferential rights as aforesaid.</q>
As this raises a fairly complicated point, I will begin by trying to explain the danger we are trying to meet in these two associated Amendments and will then go on to what we actually propose in them. Under the Clause, the Agency is given power to carry out any reorganisation of the capital structure of any of its subsidiary companies. The purpose of that reorganisation would be, presumably, to make the shares of the companies more readily saleable when the reorganisation had been carried out.<br/>
My hon. Friends and I see a certain danger in that. It is our view&#x2014;and we have consistently expressed it throughout the discussions on this Bill&#x2014;that it may be very difficult to get great sums of private money back into the steel industry; but, none the less, there may be certain people who will be very anxious to come along with fairly limited sums of money with which to buy both the equity capital and the control of certain steel companies.<br/>
We visualise the danger that, confronted with this situation, the Agency may carry through some rather surprising reorganisations which might take the form of a very highly geared capital structure <i>in</i> which there is a great deal of debenture capital, unsecured loan capital, preference capital, and only a very limited amount of ordinary share capital. As I understand it, there certainly would be nothing in the Bill as drafted to prevent the most extremely highly geared structures from being imposed upon certain companies for the simple reason that private firms without very large resources would be able to get hold of control and equity capital in the industry.<br/>
I am sure that one of the arguments which the Financial Secretary will advance will be to say, "The people who will be in charge of this, and even more the Treasury officials, are reasonably minded people who will have the interests of the taxpayer and the public welfare in mind and will not dream of doing any such thing." I beg the Financial Secretary to realise that in all these

matters he and those associated with him might be placed in a difficult position in which they might have a very sharp conflict of loyalty. That has worried us on this side of the Committee all through the passage of this Bill.<br/>
The conflict will be this&#x2014;no doubt, all things being equal, the Financial Secretary and the other Treasury people will desire to get a very good deal for the taxpayer and will desire not to do anything that will be regarded as unreasonable. But they want to sell off the industry into private hands. That is the meaning of this Bill. If they cannot do that, then this Bill will stand as one of the most unnecessary Bills to have taken up a great deal of Parliamentary time.<br/>
There is, therefore, a possible conflict of loyalties which the Financial Secretary and others will have to face. It is no good the Financial Secretary saying, "You can trust me to look after this thing properly because I want a decent deal for the taxpayer." He does; but he may also want something which would conflict with the reasonable interests of the taxpayer. I am sure that the Financial Secretary and other hon. Members will agree that in the ordinary way it is undesirable that one should have a very highly geared capital structure of companies.<br/>
That is the danger against which we seek to guard in this Amendment. The effect of the Amendment would be that those private buyers who want to get control and hold control of the company and want the equity must put into the company an amount of money going at least some substantial part of the way towards the real value of the company, and not an amount of money which is a very small fraction of the real value of the company. I must tell the Financial Secretary that in drafting the first of these two Amendments some certain amount of error crept in. I am sure that he will be sympathetic, because I remember that on the Finance Bill last year, even with the great resources behind the hon. Gentleman, there were drafting errors in some Government Amendments.<br/>
As it now stands, the Amendment provides that when capital reorganisation has been completed, the ordinary share capital should be not less than 51 per


cent. of the capital, other than ordinary share capital, including the debenture capital, whereas the intention which was more in our mind was that it should be 51 per cent. of the total capital, including the ordinary share capital. I naturally regret that this has arisen, but it is not a point of great importance because we are not so much wedded to a particular figure as to the principle that there should be inserted in the Bill some limitation upon the right of the Agency to secure a very highly geared capital structure. As the Amendment stands, it means that a third or a little more than a third of the capital structure, including the loan capital, of any company which was a subsidiary of the industry would have to be ordinary share capital after the reorganisation had been carried through.<br/>
That is not an unreasonable position. I took the opportunity earlier this afternoon of looking at the existing capital structures of some of the most prominent subsidiary companies of the present Iron and Steel Corporation. In most of those cases the ordinary share capital amounted to substantially more than a half of the total issued capital and&#x2014;though I do not suggest that it is true over the whole range in all of those at which I looked it was substantially over one-third. In the case of the Lancashire Steel Corporation Ltd. it is over 65 per cent. of the issued capital and I include the debenture capital here&#x2014;in the United Steel Companies Ltd. it is also over 65 per cent., Richard, Thomas and Baldwins Ltd., over 45 per cent., Colvilles Ltd., over 65 per cent., John Summers and Sons Ltd., about 48 per cent., Stewarts and Lloyds Ltd., over 65 per cent., and Dorman, Long and Co., Ltd., over 45 per cent. Therefore, what we are pressing for is not in any way broadly out of accord with the present state of affairs in the industry.<br/>
I hope, therefore, that the Financial Secretary will be able to go a very substantial way towards meeting us on this point. I hope that he will not say, "Of course, we will not carry through an unreasonable reorganisation," but that he will put a figure which will give us a specific guarantee that rather fantastic capital structures will not be worked out to make it easier to get rid of the industry into private hands.<br/>
The second Amendment to which I have referred includes a provision by

which a buyer when he buys equity capital, which for this purpose is defined as a class carrying voting rights, must also take at the same time an equivalent proportion of the shares or capital of other categories in the same company. This is an Amendment which, if our first Amendment were not accepted, would become even more necessary, because it would be a kind of second line of defence against the position in which one could have a very highly geared capital structure and control and equity interest passing over for a comparatively small sum of money.<br/>
Even if our first Amendment were accepted, the second Amendment could still stand. Perhaps it would not be so necessary in those circumstances but it would be still workable and useful, because it would help to prevent a position in which the equity interest goes out to private buyers whereas the Government are left holding the fixed interest securities, which in certain cases may represent the most substantial part of the value of the company.</p>

<p>These two Amendments we are taking together raise, as the hon. Member for Stechford (Mr. Roy Jenkins) has properly said, different but inter-connected points. They both relate to restrictions which it is sought to impose upon the Agency in the disposal of the companies. The first one prevents what is described as a highly geared structure, and it is certain that in general it is unlikely that it would be thought either desirable or necessary to arrange so highly geared a structure as the hon. Member for Stechford seemed to contemplate.<br/>
On the general issues which the hon. Member raised, I would not wish to join issue with him, but the Amendment raises two points of some importance. I leave aside the drafting error of which I am only too glad to acquit the hon. Member. I have had some experience of committing them myself, and I would certainly never seek to make a debating point about them. There is, however, an issue of some substance, namely whether it is right and proper to put into the Bill a restriction even against a fairly improbable event of this sort.<br/>
We are anxious, as I have said more than once, to secure that the Agency has


the greatest possible freedom. It is being called upon to do an important job, and the general principle, which I should have thought would have commended itself to all hon. Members, is that, having been given the job, it ought not to be inhibited by statutory restrictions of one sort or another. It ought to be allowed to do the job, and if mistakes are made my right hon. Friend is answerable to Parliament. But it is a very different thing to lay down in advance arbitrary things which in no conceivable circumstances may be done.<br/>
We are here disposing of a large and complex industry. Probably no pair of these companies are precisely the same. It would be quite wrong&#x2014;and this seems to me to be the right reply not only to this Amendment but to one or two others &#x2014;to lay down these meticulous restrictions which would forbid the Agency to do in the odd case&#x2014;perhaps the hundredth case&#x2014;what might be right in that case. It is far better to leave it free to do it and let my right hon. Friend be answerable to Parliament for it having been done.<br/>
A curious use is made of "nominal values" in this context. As the Committee are aware, nominal values may very well vary widely and, indeed, may bear no relation at all to the real value. Therefore, the precise degree of restriction which this Amendment would impose would vary from case to case, simply dependent on the extent to which the nominal value of the share differed from the real value.<br/>
There is a wide variety of value between different cases, and indeed when compensation was assessed&#x2014;and on a previous Amendment hon. Members showed enthusiasm for the basis upon which compensation was assessed&#x2014;it was assessed relative to the nominal value over all the industry at 102 per cent. for debentures and 214 per cent. for ordinary stock&#x2014;a difference of over 100 per cent. I think that indicates that if it were desirable&#x2014;I do not think it is&#x2014;to put a restriction of this sort upon the Agency, to tie it to the nominal value of the shares would be to tie it to a singularly elusive and unstable connection.<br/>
The other Amendment imposes an even more damaging restriction upon the

Agency in disposing of the shares. As I understand it, it would compel a purchaser to take something which he did not want in order to be allowed to buy something that he did&#x2014;precisely that practice of ill-behaved traders in times of scarcity which I have heard denounced time and again in the House. It is another example of "If you want tomatoes you must buy potatoes." It seems to me a wholly unreasonable thing to do, whether as a trader or in disposing of shares.<br/>
There is a certain type of investor who, for very good and proper reasons, wants debentures. Why should he be compelled, if he wants debentures, to take equities; and if he wants equities, to take debentures? There is a different type of investor. Whether they know their own business best I do not know, but they are inclined to think they do. They want one particular kind of security. I really cannot see how we could justify compelling them to take one because they want the other.<br/>
I do not think any useful public purpose is served by this Amendment. Indeed, I think some public detriment would follow, because if there were anything calculated to diminish the price which we could get for the shares, it would be a provision of this sort. Hon. Members opposite have recently gone into the Lobby because they wanted something put into the Bill which they thought would secure that we should be able to get a better price for these shares than we otherwise would. They have just voted on that. It is inconsistent on this next Amendment to impose one of these restrictions which must diminish to some extent the attractiveness of these shares and, therefore, the price which they will fetch.<br/>
The second Amendment seems to be subject to the criticism not merely that it would hamper the disposal of the shares but that it would be a restriction of a peculiarly damaging nature from the point of view of doing what we want and getting a reasonable price for the shares. Therefore, while I fully appreciate the spirit in which these proposals have been put forward, I am afraid they are quite unacceptable because they would work so directly against the objects of which hon. Members on both sides


have expressed themselves in favour from time to time.</p>

<p>I do not think that the Financial Secretary did justice to the industry which we are discussing. His argument seemed to me to be directed towards what I might call normal Stock Exchange transactions, normal investment transactions which take place from day to day, whereas we are discussing the first transaction which will take place when the Agency starts to sell what I presume will be a substantial proportion of the industry&#x2014;whole companies, I presume, with practically all the shares in a given company. This is a very different sort of operation from the normal day-to-day investment activities which the Financial Secretary was talking about.<br/>
I think the Financial Secretary missed the whole point of my hon. Friend's Amendment when he referred to it as imposing meticulous restrictions. My hon. Friend was quite clear that there was a slight error in the drafting, although the principle was more important than the actual figures. The principle here is to safeguard ourselves against an operation of which we have all heard rumours, if we have not actually read it in the financial Press, namely, the proposal to turn this industry back to private enterprise. It has been suggested that a very small number of equity shares might be sold to a buyer who would then have complete control of the company and that this would then satisfy the Government's Election pledges that the industry was to be returned to private enterprise. I do not think that this would satisfy those pledges at all.<br/>
As to the second Amendment, it has been suggested that this would be a conditional sale and that the acceptance of the Amendment might affect the view of investors. Surely the same point arises. If the Financial Secretary is thinking of a relatively small number of investors putting their money into normal Stock Exchange transactions there may be something in the argument. The object of the Agency, I presume, is to refrain from carrying out any sales until they are satisfied that a substantial part of the shares in a company will be taken up or, at any rate, that the shares they sell will give control over the company.

In that case, the investor is not likely to be a private person or a group of private persons; it is more likely to be a large public body, another private company, an insurance company or something of that sort. Therefore, I cannot see that the Financial Secretary's argument about a conditional sale is of much importance.<br/>
As to the question of the nominal or present quoted value of the shares, I would remind the Financial Secretary that the first Amendment deals with those cases in which the Agency are making a reorganisation or alteration of the share capital of a company by which a completely new share structure may come into being. The Amendment is directed to ensuring that in that new structure the relation between the nominal value of the ordinary shares and of other shares is of some relatively controlled order&#x2014;not necessarily meticulously controlled, but not of such a nature that the control of a company could be sold for a mere bagatelle. I do not think my hon. Friend would say that that control would not be necessary if there were to be no alteration in the share structure; but when the structure is completely changed and when a new nominal value is given to the shares, surely the purpose of the Amendment is made completely clear.</p>

<p>The Amendment specifically refers to the cases where there is a reorganisation, and the Financial Secretary's point is, therefore, quite invalid.</p>

<p>The Financial Secretary did not suggest that he accepted the view that these companies should not be sold for a mere bagatelle&#x2014;for a very small equity shareholding. It would not do any good for hon. Gentlemen to say that when one has a highly-geared capital structure the risk is very great. It is perfectly true that if this were a case where a little man was putting a little money into the purchase of the equity capital and the number of ordinary shares issued was very small, the risk would be very great, but the chances are that the companies who will buy these steel companies will be very substantial ones and for them to put up a few thousand or a million pounds in order to acquire the equity capital would mean for them very little risk. Under these conditions some other large undertaking would be able to


acquire control of a large steel company at a very small risk to themselves.<br/>
This does not seem to be anything like private enterprise. But then, throughout this Bill, we have had some extraordinary anomalies. I have very much welcomed the contributions we have had in other debates in Committee of the hon. Member for Hall Green (Mr. Aubrey Jones). He does not really seem to believe in private enterprise in the steel industry. I do not know quite what we shall get out of this Bill in the end; but we must be quite certain that we do not sell off cheaply the right to control some of the major companies in the industry to other large private companies or City groups.<br/>
This is only one of the Amendments which we have moved which might safeguard the position in that respect. The Financial Secretary did not address himself to that point. He made some interesting observations, but they were not directed towards the essential points of this Amendment. We say that it should not be possible to sell the control of a large and substantial company for a very small number of ordinary shares which, for the purchasing company, would be only a very small risk.</p>

<p>I shall start by being completely out of order and congratulating you, Mr. Hynd, upon your first appearance in the Chair. I hope that we shall in future see eye to eye on the range of debate and points of order as we do politically.<br/>
I want to refer to two points which were made by the Financial Secretary. First, he argued that there is adequate political and Parliamentary control over the Holding and Realisation Agency to ensure that the bad effects we feel may follow from the Clause as drafted shall not ensue. He says that the Agency should have a reasonable degree of latitude so that it may go ahead with its job, and if it makes mistakes the Minister is responsible to the House and the House can exercise some control.<br/>
But once a mistake of this nature has been made it is, in effect, beyond control. We may very well raise a complaint. We may very well&#x2014;although this is doubtful&#x2014;so carry hon. Members opposite with the content of our complaint that they fell like following us into the Lobby in defiance of their Whips: but

even if that happened what could we do to correct a mistake which had been made because originally this Clause was too loosely drafted? Are we to pass another Act of Parliament repurchasing on the original terms the assets which have been sold in a mistaken way? We have no sanction, other than that which we are seeking to exercise here and now, which is to put into the Bill and the Clause a provision which might prevent undesirable mistakes from being made.<br/>
My second point is in connection with the Financial Secretary's remarks about conditional sales. He had a smile on his face at the time, so I assume that he was making a joke; but his smile is so constant, because of his natural charm, that it is a little difficult to know whether it is to be regarded as the signal for a joke. He said we should abhor the conditional sale because we always grumbled when a greengrocer sought to force the sale of potatoes upon purchasers who wanted only tomatoes.<br/>
That is a silly analogy and that is why I am being charitable in assuming that he meant it as a joke. When one buys tomatoes one does not buy control of the greengrocer's shop, not even when one buys all the potatoes or all the stock available on the shelves of the shop. But when one buys the majority of the equity holdings in a public company one does, in effect, buy control of that company, and in those circumstances we suggest that a conditional sale is a right and proper thing.<br/>
6.45 p.m.<br/>
We want a conditional sale which lays it down that if a person wishes to buy his way into control of a section of this industry he must also take a share of the debt burden and the loan capital of the industry. If he does not he is buying his way in on the cheap and, what is much more serious, the Agency and, through the Agency the taxpayer, are left shouldering most of the debt burden at a fixed rate of interest and with no semblance of control over the particular firms and concerns in which the agency may happen, in terms of capital to be the majority shareholders.<br/>
That is why we reject entirely the Financial Secretary's amusing analogy of tomatoes and potatoes and insist that it will not be possible for the House of Commons to rectify a mistake which has


been made, other than the ultimate rectification which will come when we wipe this particular Measure off the Statute Book when we return to power. In the terms of the Bill the House has no power to rectify these mistakes and, therefore, we must insist on using what power we have to make sure that these mistakes do not happen.</p>

<p>We have not had a satisfactory answer to the case which has been made by my three hon. Friends. It is a perfectly simple and plain case. We do not want it to be possible under the Bill for a large body to buy control of these companies cheaply and without taking their appropriate share of the loan capital. That is the short case, and it has been made very clearly by my hon. Friends.<br/>
The answer which we received was, in the first place, that it was not a good idea to bind the Agency by meticulous prohibitions. There is little I can add to what has been said, beyond this: we are not putting a whole host of prohibitions upon the Agency. Clause 17 is a crucial Clause, dealing with the disposal of securities, and the Financial Secretary will see, if he looks at the Order Paper, that there is a minimum of essential Amendments down to it. The Government have already rejected one. They have said that they will try to do something about a second. What is left is the minimum.<br/>
The Financial Secretary says, "We have not encumbered the Agency with a whole host of prohibitions; we have simply left in the Clause a few things which we believe are absolutely indispensable." That is the first point which the Financial Secretary makes. The second point he makes is simply this: why should it not be possible to buy the equity capital without taking a fair proportion of the loan capital?<br/>
That has been dealt with by my three hon. Friends, who made it quite clear that they are contemplating a case in which a large corporation buys its way to control on the cheap and without paying a fair price to the public. That is a complete answer to the question which the Financial Secretary put. The answer having been given, we are convinced that this, again, is a proposal by the Opposi-

tion which is being cavalierly brushed aside with no possible reason.<br/>
I hope that my hon. Friends will think it necessary to carry the Amendment to a Division, if only to ensure that we make clear to the Government and to the country at large the gross defects in the Bill and call attention to the way in which the Government are simply sweeping aside, without giving it fair consideration, the demand which we make to provide some modest safeguards to protect the public purse.</p>

<p>I hope that the right hon. and learned Gentleman will not think that, although I may disagree with him, I am brushing aside cavalierly anything which he or his hon. Friends say. That has not been the practice of either my right hon. Friend or myself in these discussions. Nevertheless, we must differ as to the desirability of putting what I described in my earlier speech, I think accurately, as meticulous prohibitions of this sort upon the Agency. I fully accept the concern expressed by the right hon. and learned Gentleman and the hon. Member for Islington, North (Mr. Fienburgh) about the possibility of a large business buying control of one of the companies on the cheap. I do not think they need be much concerned about that because, as has been said again and again, there is no intention to dispose of any of these assets on the cheap, and if a transaction in which control is involved is under consideration, then, quite clearly, that factor of control will be reflected in the price.<br/>
I said before, and I say again, that in general there is no intention of disposing of small but controlling packets of equity capital, leaving the Agency with a large block of loan capital. There is no such intention. On the other hand, it is quite another thing to say that it is right to put prohibitions of this sort into the Bill to cover every conceivable case which could arise. Even if a restriction of this sort were desirable, it seems to me that it is framed in such a way, perhaps inevitably, as to have a serious effect upon the price we shall get for the shares.<br/>
The right hon. and learned Gentleman brushed that aside. I would not say that he brushed it aside cavalierly, but, nevertheless, he brushed it aside, even though it is fundamental to the point with which


we are all concerned. Would a restriction of this sort interfere with the disposal of the shares and adversely affect the price of the ordinary shares? The right hon. and learned Gentleman made no attempt to deal with that aspect.</p>

<p>Perhaps the hon. and learned Gentleman would not mind if I do not give way at this point. The hon. Member for Stechford said that the point of choice of nominal value did not matter. With great respect, it matters a great deal. It matters sufficiently to vitiate a large part of the control which it is sought to impose, because, presumably, during the rearrangement the nominal value could be anything which the Agency liked. It therefore seemed to me that his criticism showed that if a statutory safeguard is intended this is an inadequate safeguard.<br/>
The hon. Member for Edmonton (Mr. Albu) said no small investors would</p>

<p>invest in the shares of the companies. It is not given either to the hon. Member for Edmonton or myself precisely to foresee the future in all its complexities, but it is certainly highly probable that small investors will invest in these shares and, indeed, it is a little odd, when restrictions of one sort or another are being suggested on the Order Paper against big investors, that anything should be done which would have the effect of deterring the small investor.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 14, line 20, at the end, to insert:
<q>(5) In exercising their powers under this section to sell or otherwise dispose of securities vested in them the Agency shall use their best endeavours to prevent the control of any company in which such securities are held from passing to any person or persons resident outside the United Kingdom and any sale or other disposal of any such securities to any person or persons resident outside the United Kingdom shall unless such person or persons shall before the contract by or in pursuance of which such sale or other disposal is effected have disclosed to the Agency that he or they as the case may be is or are resident outside the United Kingdom be wholly void for all purposes.</q>
This subsection has the advantage over some of the other ones that, first of all, it reads like English, and second, it is a subject of which no technical knowledge is necessary to enable hon. Members to pass an opinion on it. It means what it says. Its intention is that when the Agency start to carry out their duty of disposing of the stocks and shares which they hold in the steel industry they should use their best endeavours to prevent the control of any company in which such securities are held from passing to any person or persons who are resident outside the United Kingdom; and the second half of the subsection demands that anybody applying to make such purchase should declare whether or not he is resident outside this country.<br/>
It may strike the Committee that this Amendment is somewhat chauvinistic in its temper, that it runs somewhat contrary to those Amendments urging that the Board should set up close links with the international authority established abroad, and that, in fact, it is inspired by a narrow nationalism. I wish to assure the Committee that that is not the intention of myself or my right hon. and hon. Friends. We wish that at a rather critical and difficult time in the history of the industry, when the stock is being transferred from public to private ownership. a period which, I think, everyone will agree, will be politically charged, no unnecessary complication should be introduced by permitting substantial control of a section of the steel industry to pass abroad.<br/>
I think this is important, for the following reasons. I am convinced the Minister hopes that this Bill, when it becomes law, will produce a final solution for the steel industry; that it will stabilise the position of the industry. In many ways that is a highly desirable state of affairs, but we on this side of the Committee feel that that state has not been reached yet. There has been a very remarkable evolution in Conservative thought on this subject, and the concept of public supervision of this great industry is now common philosophy on both sides of the Committee. We have argued that we expect the Minister will find, once he


has brought this Board into supervision, that the powers he has given it in this Bill are too limited to enable the Board to carry out its functions of supervision, and that in due course we shall have to reinforce the powers it now possesses with the powers of ownership.<br/>
As a result of this decision, the ownership of various steel companies may change hands once or twice more in the future. The transfer from private to public ownership under the Act of 1949 went off extremely smoothly. Parliamentary control is accepted by both sides of the industry. If, however, a small section of the industry passes into foreign ownership, two considerable complications may arise. The first complication may arise during the period of transfer from public to private ownership. The workers in the industry, prompted by a proper sense of national pride, might take exception to such a transfer. However, I am convinced that my hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham (Mr. Jack Jones) can speak with greater authority for the workers in the industry.<br/>
On the other hand, in the second period, should there be a transfer back from private to public ownership, considerable complications may arise if a significant section of the industry has passed into foreign ownership. It is conceivable&#x2014;though I think possibly a little far-fetched&#x2014;that foreign capital might be attracted to this country to stabilise the position of the steel industry in private ownership because of the complications which might arise from large foreign investment in the British steel industry.<br/>
Let me say in advance that I am not about to compare the British steelmaster with his German counterpart. I think they are very different kinds of animals. On the other hand, it is rather instructive to look at what has been happening in Germany during the last 18 months or two years. The future of the German steel industry is still not certain. It is conceivable that the German steel industry, as well as the British, may pass into public ownership.<br/>
Some German steelmasters are very conscious of this possibility and they have been attempting to attract considerable American investment into the German steel industry. It is rather interesting to note that they employed a very wellknown American corporation lawyer,

who was a member of the American Administration, to act on their behalf. There is no doubt that if there were substantial American investment in the German steel industry it would cause complications for the German Government when the time came for them to nationalise the German steel industry.<br/>
Quite frankly, whatever hon. Members opposite may think of nationalisation in this country, I am sure they will agree that the activities we have observed of one of the German steelmasters in financing one of the more neo-National Socialist movements would have been avoided if this rather reactionary German industry were under public supervision.<br/>
7.15 p.m.<br/>
Whatever may be the case in Germany, it is desirable that any unnecessary complication in the transitional period of the steel industry should be avoided, if possible. It is conceivable that large capital investment might be made by, say, an international consortium of the European Iron and Steel Community, who may consider that a large shareholding in the British steel industry would give them an insight into the workings of various aspects of the steel industry over here which would be useful to them in their business on the Continent, and I think that this risk should be avoided if possible.<br/>
I am sure that the Minister wants, just as much as we do, to avoid any unnecessary disturbance during the period of transfer from public to private ownership and back, and we advise him that the risks which heavy foreign investment in the British steel industry would bring are real and should be avoided. For this reason, we urge him to consider the safeguards contained in this Amendment.</p>

<p>I rise to support the plea made so eloquently and ably by my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, Central (Mr. Ian Winterbottom), and to take a rather different line from the one he took. This industry of ours is a proud heritage. It is not only a matter of bricks and mortar, girders, rolling mills and furnaces. It is a matter of a "belonging to"; an ownership of something that has grown up with the people of our country, and particularly the steel workers in it. I make no bones about saying that we are the best people in the world at making steel. Individually, man for


man, there is none to beat us, and what we must do is see to it that no action of this or any subsequent Government alters that.<br/>
We are gravely concerned about the disposal of our assets. This industry was built up over the centuries by extremely able people&#x2014;not altogether the men on the shop floor, much as they took part in it. The inventive genius of individuals, subsequent discoveries and the carrying out of various methods of producing steel of all types, qualities, grades and prices has been something of which this country can be really proud. That might sound a little bit conservative; it might sound a little bit pro-British; but we on this side of the Committee are just as pro-British and just as proud of our achievements as anybody else in the country.<br/>
I am very disturbed about, not the actual material affected but the psychological effect upon the workers of our industry were it to be known that some part of it had come under the control of a foreign agency or foreign speculators. This Bill provides not only for people to buy the industry, but also for people to hire it, to lease it; in other words, to be able to come along and. if it is not avoided, to use this great industry of ours, or parts of it, as a "guinea-pig"<br/>
I could visualise a situation&#x2014;and it may seem that I am being extreme&#x2014;in which Germans, Japanese, Russians, may be, and certainly Americans, envying us the knowledge which we have in this great industry, would give a lot, and be prepared to sacrifice an enormous amount of wealth on a short-term policy to gain the long-term benefit that could accrue to them if they could come into possession of the "know-how" that we have in this country of steel-making. I know that it will be said from the Govment benches that the Germans are not too bad at making steel. That is true. The Germans are good workers. That is also true. They are some of the hardest workers in the world. When it comes to the actual individual knowledge of the making of advanced forms of steel and the higher grades of steel, however, we are still pre-eminent, in my opinion, in the world.<br/>
We have to avoid at all costs unnecessary opportunities&#x2014;and I say unnecessary opportunities&#x2014;being given to the foreigner to take advantage of this Bill. I am an internationalist, and I claim to be a good Socialist. It may be claimed that we are now being a little parochial and a little isolationist, but in an industry of this kind which has done so much and made such sacrifices and such strides we ought not to be put into an uncompetitive situation in the world's markets.<br/>
I have mentioned the question of Germany before, and it may sound to some people as if I have been rather overdoing it, but I have been seeking some advice. I have as yet no assurance that the money which is going to Herr Krupp, as a sort of incentive bonus for the destruction of his fellow men, cannot be used for this purpose. I do not know if that is so, but I hope not. Nothing worse could happen under this Bill than for the British steel workers to be told that as a result of it they will be working under a foreign boss, especially a boss of that type.<br/>
It would not be so bad if it were American capital coming in, although that in itself would be bad enough. I beg the Government to take careful note. This is the Iron and Steel Bill of Britain and the Iron and Steel Corporation is to be disposed of. As Britishers who have a fundamental love of their country, we want to see this industry stay as it is. This nation is beset with enough troubles. I hope that we shall get an assurance from the Minister on this point. I say with emphasis to the Minister that there could be nothing worse than to allow a situation such as I have visualised to happen.<br/>
I know something of the relationship that exists within the industry. I have been connected with it all my life, as was my father before me. I know something of the American attitude towards the trade union side of the industry. I also know something of American methods. I have been one of the most privileged workpeople in this country because I have seen every steel works in the world worth seeing, and that is saying a lot. I have seen the steel works in Russia, Germany, America, Luxembourg, France, and elsewhere. It has been my proud privilege to lead our workers in this country.<br/>
We are asking the Government to say that so far as possible foreign capital shall


not be brought into this country of ours. It will not be so much an effort made by outsiders to buy a part of this industry. It would pay them a handsome dividend to lease or hire parts of our industry and to take them over as a long-term or short-term policy. The knowledge and information of the industry that they would get would pay them handsome dividends in the years that lie ahead.<br/>
This would not affect me at my time of life&#x2014;although I am not an old man yet&#x2014;but it would have a serious effect on the rising generation and a psychological effect on Britishers proud of their industry and proud of their heritage; and let us remember that they are the people who make steel second to none in the world. I know what the effect would be on myself if I had to go to work under those conditions next week. We may differ in this Committee politically, but I say to the Government, with all the strength of my convictions, that to allow this Bill to be used in the way I have described and as it may possibly be used, would have a serious effect on the industry.<br/>
It may not have an overnight effect, but it would have a long-term effect. We want to keep the capital structure of the industry as we have it. We were told that good will, fellowship and the team spirit would be destroyed by nationalisation. They have not been destroyed at all. We have never had one word of evidence to prove that since the industry was nationalised they have suffered. I say that they have not, and I hope that this Amendment will be accepted and that they will not suffer.</p>

<p>I find myself in complete agreement with the sentiments expressed by the hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. Jack Jones) in his own very effective way. The hon. Member for Nottingham, Central (Mr. Ian Winterbottom), in moving the Amendment, pleaded in its favour that it read like English. I can agree with him that far, although if I were to stretch that argument much further I might seem to be casting reflection on Amendments tabled by his hon. Friends, and I will therefore desist.<br/>
He referred to the Amendment as setting up safeguards. The more one looks

at it, the more illusory seem the safeguards. I have read it with great care and, as I see it, it does two things. First, it tells the Agency to use their best endeavours to prevent control passing to non-residents&#x2014;not in itself a very easy thing to put into the statute, although comprehensible and it then proceeds to render void sales to non-residents if the fact that the purchaser is a non-resident is not disclosed. But there is nothing in it, the Agency having sold to residents, to prevent those residents selling next day to the foreigner. Therefore, it seems to me that as a safeguard the Amendment does not take us very far. Indeed it does not take us any distance at all.<br/>
The point behind it is a serious one. I do not need the speech of the hon. Member for Rotherham to appreciate that but it certainly reinforces it. Quite apart from this Amendment, which I do not honestly think would help, there are fortunately other sources available to prevent the kind of state of affairs which he contemplates coming into being. Most important is Section 9 of the Exchange Control Act. Under this no security registered in the United Kingdom can be transferred to a transferee outside the sterling area without the permission of the Treasury. That is a general protection covering not merely steel but all quoted securities.<br/>
There seems to me to be no particular reason to assume that the steel industry would be any more vulnerable to the risk of foreign control than any other of our major industries. Indeed, our experience up to nationalisation was that when the United Kingdom steel industry was in private hands foreign interests were extremely small, even though they could have dated back long before. There does not seem to be any particular reason to pick out steel as being particularly vulnerable and needing protection over and above that given to British industry in general.<br/>
On the contrary, the British steel industry is to be subject to the supervision of the Board, under my right hon. Friend, and will, therefore, be subject to more skilled supervision than the majority of industries in this country. Accordingly it will, I think one can safely assume, be less vulnerable to the sort of risk which has been envisaged than many of our other industries. It


seems to me that the case for providing special and peculiar safeguards for steel over and above those provided for British industry in general is not a particularly strong one. However, I can say that it is not our intention to see the industry fall under foreign control, and it appears to me that we have powers adequate to that purpose for the industry and other industries.</p>

<p>I am not saying that there will not be an odd share under foreign control&#x2014;that might be a good thing&#x2014;but I was referring to any substantial part of the industry. The hon. Gentleman is thinking in terms of the whole industry while I am thinking in terms of the major elements in it. I do not think he and I are very far apart.<br/>
Quite apart from that, there is in any event nothing to be said for putting into the Bill what looks like a safeguard but is not one, for that would merely mislead people into believing that the position was safeguarded when it was not. For that reason alone the Amendment is unacceptable, although the point behind it is a real one. I hope that what I have said shows that on this point the Government do not find themselves at any great distance from the hon. Member.</p>

<p>The Financial Secretary's speech has been a very disappointing one. As to his point that the position is safeguarded by exchange control legislation, that is only partially true. As he clearly pointed out, those regulations deal only with transactions outside the sterling area and do not in any way act as any preventive against sales inside the sterling area. The sterling area is a substantial area and it comprises a large number of countries, including Iceland, for a strange reason which I have never been able to discover. My hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham (Mr. Jack Jones) was worried about other countries obtaining substantial control of the steel industry, and I am sure that in that he would include Iceland. We are all hoping that the sterling area will be a dynamic,

expanding institution and that more and more countries will join it. Consequently, a safeguard which does not cover the sterling area is incomplete.<br/>
The Financial Secretary pointed out that the safeguard is not complete. It has not been put forward as a complete safeguard. The hon. Gentleman will agree that if we wanted a complete safeguard we should need a very long and involved Amendment and should need to set up enforcement machinery to ensure that it was carried out. While it is true that the Agency can sell to a British subject who can, the following day, sell to a foreign national, all we are seeking to ensure is that the Agency itself shall not give the cover and authority of its official existence to the beginnings of an action which transfers control of some part of our steel industry outside the country.<br/>
It is not represented that the effect of the Amendment can be any more than a psychological one, but I put it to the hon. Gentleman that there really is a difference between a private individual exercising his right to sell shares to anyone he wishes within the framework of the law and an official body, set up by a Government under a highly controversial Bill, itself engaging in transactions which directly, and of its own volition, result in some part of the industry coming under the control of a foreign Government.<br/>
While the Financial Secretary, with his usual logic and force, made out a completely convincing case for saying that this cannot be an effective safeguard, he could equally have made out a case for saying that it cannot possibly do any harm. I should have thought that he would be the first to say that it would exercise no more than a ha'porth of moral suasion in deterring anybody who was glibly rushing into transferring the securities of the steel industry to foreign hands, and I should have thought that he would he glad to accept this innocuous Amendment. He may find some fault with its wording but we should be happy to fall in with his wishes if he desired some alteration. The Amendment really cannot do any harm.<br/>
What I have so far said has been 'rather unpretentious and conciliatory; what I now have to say may be less so. I address the Committee from a back bench and can, therefore, claim to speak for nobody


but myself, but I think I know enough of the reactions of my hon. Friends to be able to say this without being really individual and fatuous. If there is any substantial transfer of the assets of the industry to foreign nationals that fact will not deter us, on returning to office as the Government, from carrying out our expressly stated intention and pledge to reconvert the industry to public ownership and to do that without further charges upon the taxpayer. I felt I ought to say this although it may disturb the harmony of the Committee a little and may sound pretentious coming from the back benches. I want to impress on the Committee that I have not said it just "off the cuff"; I have said it knowing the strong feelings of my hon. Friends.</p>

<p>I have not considered it; I am not competent to consider it. I am no authority on international law, as the hon. and learned Gentleman is, and I profoundly hope that I have not been breaking the law. What I have said is certainly not a breach of the feelings which I hold deeply and sincerely and which I know are held by many of my hon. Friends. If I get "run in" for that tomorrow morning, I shall rely upon the Solicitor-General, who is now listening with interest, to get me out of trouble.<br/>

<p>The intervention of the hon. and learned Member for Middlesbrough, West (Mr. Simon) gives substance to our intentions. There are complications in international law in any system of nationalising assets owned by a foreign national, and that is what we are trying to avoid. I will say no worse than that the Financial Secretary's reply was legalistic. I agree with what has been said by my hon. Friend the Member for Reading, South (Mr. Mikardo). The point about the currency control is only a temporary safeguard, and I am afraid that the supervision by

the Board of the Holding and Realisation Agency is not a satisfactory guarantee that the Agency will act in the way that the Opposition would like.<br/>
The point is valid that a group of individuals or a large firm could go through the whole business of negotiating with the State and purchasing an undertaking and subsequently sell the undertaking to a foreign concern, but there is no doubt that if this intermediate stage had to be gone through it would be a hindrance and a deterrent to foreign capital coming to this country with the express intention of making a major investment in the British steel industry.<br/>
If the Financial Secretary does not think that our Amendment is a good one, he might give an undertaking that his Department will give a directive to the Agency that they should watch purchasers and make full inquiries into their backgrounds to ensure that no section of the steel industry passes directly under foreign control as a result of an act by the Agency. I hope that he will be able to give the Committee that undertaking and will at least give the Agency a directive to that effect.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Nottingham, Central (Mr. Ian Winterbottom) referred to the Exchange Control Act as only a temporary safeguard. It is not for me to speculate on its duration, but it is perhaps a less temporary safeguard than the one in this Amendment, which refers only to the moment of disposal and not to the subsequent transactions in shares. It is a much more temporary test for a particular point in time.<br/>
In reply to the hon. Member for Reading, South (Mr. Mikardo), I should say that I am somewhat suspicious of psychological Clauses. I do not think it is a good thing in principle or in practice to put into an Act of Parliament something through which coaches and horses can be driven merely for a psychological reason. That creates in people's minds an illusion of security which is not there, and that is a bad thing to do. We have no intention of seeing parts of this industry pass into foreign control, nor have we any apprehensions that that will happen, but under the machinery set up in this Bill we have particular facilities for keeping the matter closely in view, and if it were seriously to develop then


we should not hesitate, if the powers we have at present prove inadequate, to ask for more. That should really satisfy the apprehensions of hon. Members. At the moment, instead of the admittedly illusive safeguards of this Amendment, there is Section 9 of the Exchange Control Act.<br/>
The hon. Member spoke in this context about the sterling area, and on that subject I should like to say a word. The greater part of the sterling area is the Commonwealth. This Amendment, if it were effective, would prevent Commonwealth citizens, as non-residents, from investing in British industry, and I am not sure that we want to put into a statute something which would have that effect. I do not think there will be very much of that because, generally speaking, the flow of capital tends to be in the opposite direction, but it would be a little offensive to the feelings of our fellow citizens under the Crown if there were an express prohibition put upon them holding shares or controlling interests in any section of the British steel industry.<br/>
We are as conscious as the hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. Jack Jones) of the unfortunate effect if this thing were allowed to develop, and it would be the responsibility of the Government, if any such serious threat developed, to prevent it happening. I do not anticipate it happening. It did not occur in all the years when the industry was quite free, and I do not see any particular reason to apprehend it now.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 14, line 20, at the end, to insert:
<q>(5) Notwithstanding anything hereinbefore <i>in</i> this section contained, the Agency shall not in selling or otherwise disposing of any such securities, sell or dispose of more than one-fifth of the shares of any one class in any one company to the same person and if any person purchases or otherwise acquires from the Agency any such shares as an agent or nominee for any other person in such circumstances as to produce the result that such other person would become the owner at law or in equity of more than one-fifth of any one class of the securities in any such company, such sale or acquisition shall be wholly void for all purposes.</q>
I commend this Amendment to hon. and right hon. Gentlemen opposite with a good deal of confidence, because it is an Amendment which should prove acceptable to the Conservative Party.

Its purpose is simply to ensure that when the companies which are at present subsidiaries of the Iron and Steel Corporation pass under private ownership, their ownership should be reasonably diffused. We should not have one, two or three shareholders controlling very large sections of the industry; but the shareholding should be spread over a rather larger number. This Amendment is our contribution towards helping this Bill to make a property-owning democracy, and I hope that as such it will be accepted by hon. Members on the other side of the Committee.<br/>
7.45 p.m.<br/>
I hope that when the Financial Secretary replies to the debate he will not tell us that this is an unduly onerous restriction&#x2014;a meticulous restriction as I think he called the last safeguard that we proposed. All that we are pressing in this Amendment is that no one shareholder should hold directly or through nominees more than 20 per cent. of the total shareholding of a particular iron and steel company. That is not an undue restriction. It means that there can be five owners of the biggest iron and steel company that there is, and even that would amount to quite a degree of concentrated ownership. What we are proposing in this direction is not anything at all extreme.<br/>
What are we afraid of? What is the danger that we are here trying to safeguard against? I know of two considerations which one can put forward in this connection. First, it might be that this industry or large parts of it would pass into the control of insurance companies or of investing trusts. It would be a question of a big deal between the Agency and some large insurance companies or similar organisation, and I do not think that any hon. Member opposite would be ready to get up and argue that that sort of ownership was what the Government had in mind when they talked about private enterprise being in control of the industry, because that is not the kind of ownership for which we are going through the trouble of considering this Bill.<br/>
The other possible development is what I might call vertical trusts, by which the ownership of steel companies passed, as was the case before nationalisation, into the hands of engineering companies which


are to quite a substantial extent consumers of the products of that particular section of the steel industry. I am sure that the Financial Secretary is not a strong advocate of vertical trusts. Indeed, that form of control has certain disadvantages. It means that the holding company which owns shares in the iron and steel industry naturally buys its products from the company which it owns, and that is a great deterrent to competitive conditions in the industry. When hon. Members also talk about their desire to encourage as much competition as possible in this industry, they should bear that point in mind.<br/>
It should also be borne in mind that the sort of ownership set up in the iron and steel industry will be very much a test of the good faith of the Government when they talk about widespread participation in ownership and all the rest of it. After all, in the case of other industries they have to accept the situation as its exists. There may be forms of ownership which may not be at all desirable to the Government, but here to a certain extent the Government are not dealing with a situation which exists. They are deliberately creating a new form of ownership for a large and very important industry, and it is, therefore, incumbent upon them to take what steps they can to ensure that ownership is in accordance with their expressed wish about the sort of ownership which they desire in private industry.<br/>
From our experience earlier today, it is possible to imagine the sort of reply we will receive from the Financial Secretary. He courteously makes two speeches on these Amendments. In his first speech he will tell us that one really must not impose restrictions; he will also say that the Amendment complained of would be very unreasonable, and that a great many false points have been made in support of it. Then he will sit down and one or two other speeches will be made, after which he will make his second speech. He will tell us that the arguments advanced in support of the Amendment are most unreasonable, that of course the Agency and the Government would not think of doing anything of the sort, and even if they did then the House would have the Minister of Supply or the Chancellor of the Exchequer with whom to deal.<br/>
I do not think that that is a very adequate safeguard. Even if we could be assured of that, I do not think we are prepared to accept a bargain by which the Agency would sell off this industry on very undesirable terms, in exchange for which we are offered the political help of the Minister of Supply. It is a bad bargain, because one is worth a good deal more than the other. Therefore, we cannot accept that sort of argument. Obviously this Amendment, if it were accepted, would not be a severe restriction on the sale.<br/>
The point which the Financial Secretary made in reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton (Mr. Albu) on the last Amendment but one, that it would keep out a lot of small people whom it was hoped to get <i>in,</i> certainly cannot apply in this case. I hope that the Financial Secretary will not repeat his general point that it is incompatible for us, if we want to get a good price for the shares and assets of this industry, to put restrictions on the way in which they are sold, and indeed upon the price. If he thinks in those terms, it means that he accepts the alternatives that if the shares cannot be sold at a good price they have to be sold at a bad price, whereas we want the alternatives to be sale at a good price or no sale at all.<br/>
This is a reasonable Amendment. It tries to stop up a loophole. I very much hope that the Financial Secretary will consider it in the same spirit as that in which he has considered previous Amendments this afternoon.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Stechford (Mr. Roy Jenkins) was good enough not only to make his own very agreeable speech but also to make mine for me. I suppose that is a kind of dialectical vertical trust. The Amendment would impose a rather peculiar restriction upon the disposal of shares in the steel industry because it would be a restriction not found in other industries. Though his speech was as agreeable as usual, the hon. Gentleman did not advance any solid argument showing why this restriction should be imposed. So far as I can recall, his main argument was that it would appeal to the Comservative Party, which, in his mouth, had rather less weight than if it had come from one of my hon. Friends.<br/>
He did not establish what terrible evil he was guarding against by restricting to one-fifth of the total the holding of any particular shares. He did not indicate what terrible evils would flow, or what horrors of monopoly could arise. He merely said that it was a good thing to have lots of small investors. Of course it is, and in many cases we shall no doubt have them. What is being argued is whether a restriction of that sort should be imposed on first sale.</p>

<p>Before the Financial Secretary leaves that point, he will no doubt remember that I did deal with the system known as the "vertical trust" and with the disadvantages which flow from it, and with the disadvantage of large insurance companies dominating private companies. It is not strictly accurate to say that I merely advanced the argument that the Amendment would appeal to the Conservative Party.</p>

<p>I was dealing with the hon. Member's most weighty argument first, and was proceeding in descending order of magnitude.<br/>
His second argument was that the Bill would be a good thing for the insurance companies. I do not know how sound that argument is. It may be that the money available today for investment is in the hands of insurance companies, but I do not know of any particular reason why steps should be taken to divert its flow from the steel industry while it continues to flow in the direction of other and competing industries. The same argument applies to the question of vertical trusts. If that is a matter which ought to be dealt with by legislation, such legislation should be general. Advantage ought not to be taken of a denationalisation Bill to impose this limitation upon one industry.<br/>
Picking out the steel industry for this restriction is of importance to those concerned with the well-being of the industry. There are occasions from time to time of scarcity of capital. Industries that have imposed upon them peculiar restrictions on investment will surely be handicapped at such times in comparison with industries that have not. What the hon. Gentleman does not appear to realise, even now, is that whatever may be his dislike of

vertical trusts it is not a conclusive reason for putting special limitation upon an industry which, I think we all agree, will require a good deal of capital investment in the future.<br/>
This limitation would have another disadvantage to which I must draw the attention of the Committee. I refer to the question of capital and investment, which I think most hon. Members know is extremely important. At an earlier stage of our debate I mentioned that one of the factors which would be important in the selection of possible buyers for particular parts of the industry would be the likelihood that the buyer would have sufficient capital available for future investment. That is a point which anyone concerned with the real future of the industry ought to bear in mind. It may be that such a buyer will want to buy more than one-fifth of the shares and I cannot see that the interests of the industry will be served by preventing him from so doing.<br/>
Then there is the case which may arise&#x2014;it depends upon the offers made&#x2014;of the return of former subsidiary companies to their parent companies. It may be that that is the right solution for the future of those companies. It may be that there were sound economic reasons for their previous relationship and integration. I do not see why we should rule out in advance any possibilities of that happening. We must be free&#x2014;the Agency must be free and the Chancellor of the Exchequer must be free&#x2014;to consider what is the best transaction in each case, bearing in mind the future of the industry. The Amendment would prevent re-integration, it would prevent or discourage investment in steel companies by large concerns and it would impose&#x2014;I would stress this point again&#x2014;restrictions upon investment peculiar to the steel industry, restrictions not imposed upon other industries in the country.<br/>
For all these reasons, although I appreciate what the hon. Gentleman has in mind, it would be very unfortunate to put into the Bill a limitation of the kind proposed. I hope that I have satisfied the hon. Gentleman about the unfortunate nature of his Amendment and about the inaccuracy of his forecast of my speech.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 14, line 20, at the end. to insert:
<q>(5) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in the Articles of Association of any such company as aforesaid, so long as there remain vested in the Agency securities in any such company of a nominal value of not less than ten per cent. of the nominal value of the total authorised capital of such company, the Agency shall be entitled to appoint one director to the Board of such company unless they are already so entitled, in addition to any other directors the appointment of whom is already provided for in the Articles of Association of such company.</q>
Unlike some of the Amendments we have considered this afternoon, this proposal is simple and clear. It entitles the Agency to appoint a director to the Board of any steel company so long as the Agency retains not less than 10 per cent. of the capital of that company. The Amendment is designed to facilitate the work of the Agency, and to provide for the proper control by the Agency of companies for which it is responsible in whole or in part during the interim period of realisation, which I think we all agree is likely to be a long period. Unless there are to be large capital losses in the sale of these companies, it seems inevitable to us that this will take rather a long time. I believe that the Minister admitted that at an early stage of the Bill.<br/>
The Agency has the duty of realising 290 companies and, as we see it, has complete freedom to sell &#x00A3;250 million of securities with power under a later Clause to lend a further &#x00A3;150 million. It is laid down in this Clause that it is a holding company for as long as it appears to the Treasury that its duties under Clause 16 have not been substantially discharged, and it must exercise its powers to promote the efficient direction of the subsidiaries. It is to that point I want to direct the attention of the Financial Secretary.<br/>
8.0 p.m.<br/>
The Agency must have the power to direct efficiently the action of the subsidiaries. There are three possibilities in this sale. First, it may be so arranged that all the securities of a particular company are sold outright. In that case, the Agency has no further responsibility for the conduct of the company which has reverted completely to private ownership.<br/>
The second possibility is that there may be no sale at all, in which case the Agency

retains full control and direction of that company. But in the vast majority of cases there may be a partial sale in which the Agency will be able to dispose of a considerable number of securities, but will also retain in its own hands for an indefinite time a substantial holding. The principle is quite clear that where there is a partial sale public money is involved, and it is necessary that it is properly used and safeguarded. The Agency will be in the position of a substantial shareholder and should have in those circumstances the right of representation on the board of the company.<br/>
The Financial Secretary may say that this imposes a restriction on the liberty of the shareholders of that company to say what their board shall be, but it is common practice for a bank or an insurance company when it provides money for a company, as frequently happened in the 'thirties, to appoint a director to the board of the company. Indeed, if that had not been so, we might have been deprived of some of the most outstanding leaders of the iron and steel industry at this time because many of them came into the industry in the first place in the 1930s as nominees of the banks and the insurance companies to protect their interests. So there is no inconsistency in this argument.<br/>
Another point which should appeal to the hon. Gentleman is an example from his own Department. Where the Development Areas Treasury Aid Committee lends money to a company in difficulties in a Development Area, it insists that it has the power and right to appoint a director to a board of that company specifically to safeguard the interests of the Treasury in that matter. That seems to be a perfect analogy. Here we have the Treasury, acting through the Agency, advancing money to what is in the main a private company to pursue certain clearly defined ends and retaining the duty of seeing that there is efficient direction of that company.<br/>
Therefore, we ask that this sensible provision should be inserted into the Bill because it will protect the rights of the Agency and the Treasury and the taxpayer without any undue restrictions upon the rights of the public company or body of shareholders.</p>

<p>The purpose of this Amendment is excellent and, indeed,


it refers to a practice which we have every intention of following in appropriate cases. However, it is unnecessary because not only have we all the powers that this would give us, but we have further powers which acceptance of this Amendment might be deemed to restrict. The matter is a little technical and if I do not succeed in making it as clear as I should, I hope that the hon. Member will be good enough to indicate that to me.<br/>
Where the position is that public ownership in any substantial proportion of the shares remains, it will be necessary to consider protecting the public interest in the way we do in the D.A.T.A.C. cases, by having a Treasury-appointed director. It is not, of course, the only way as the hon. Gentleman will appreciate. Where it is desired to use the expedient of appointing a director, it is perfectly simple, before the transfer takes place, to use the simplified procedure for holding meetings of the company for altering the articles of association appropriately. As the right hon. Member for Vauxhall (Mr. G. R. Strauss) will no doubt recall, this was provided by the Ninth Schedule to his 1949 Act and it is continued by paragraph 15 of the First Schedule to this Bill.<br/>
Where it is desired that on transfer of some part of the shares a director appointed by the Government is thought desirable, there is power to appoint one or, for that matter, to appoint two or three. The difficulty about this Amendment is that it might be thought, if these words were in the Bill, that our power to safeguard in these cases was limited to appointing one director. That is why I have come to the view that the purpose we all want to secure, that public money is properly protected, would be hindered by this provision. It is possible that as a matter of law it could be construed that we were limited to appointing the one director specified in this paragraph whereas, in its absence, our powers under the somewhat complicated chain of events which I have endeavoured to describe would remain.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman was kind enough to say, when he began his explanation, that he hoped we would question him if he did not make himself entirely clear. I am

looking as hard as I can at the Schedule which carries on the Schedule to the 1949 Act. I am not clear, however, what proportion of holding in a company the Agency must have before his words become true. While the Corporation exists, the Agency has a 100 per cent. holding, but as partial sales take place at what percentage do the words of the hon. Gentleman hold good? The Amendment of my hon. Friend is specific in bringing it down to 10 per cent.</p>

<p>Quite the contrary. I must have failed to make it clear. As the sole shareholders before disposal the Agency carries out the simplified procedure and it can fix what percentage they desire. Therefore, it could be 10 per cent. or 9&#x00BD; per cent. as I understand the position.</p>

<p>I wish to raise a small point which occurs to me and which I would respectfully invite the Financial Secretary to consider between now and the Report stage. I appreciate myself, and no doubt my right hon. Friends do, the force of what he says, but it seems to me that this Amendment might provide for a case which would not be quite covered by the provisions of the 1949 Act.<br/>
What I have in mind is this. Supposing the Agency starts to sell the shares of a


company without having made any alteration in the articles, and let us suppose that they thereby deprive themselves of the requisite majority under its articles and under the Companies Acts, which, I imagine, still regulate these matters, to change the articles. Suppose the shareholders object, as they well may, without any change having been made, we might then get circumstances in which the Agency would hold a substantial shareholding and be unable to appoint a director.<br/>
I merely put the point for consideration, because I quite appreciate the difficulty about this Amendment in its present form. Perhaps the Financial Secretary would consider that matter, and see whether that particular loophole could be stopped up, which, I am sure, as an enabling matter, he would like to do, and whether it could be dealt with by the insertion of a suitable form of words on the Report stage.</p>

<p>I will gladly look into that point. It may well be that, at the point at which disposal had started, the difficulty which the hon. and learned Member has pointed out may arise, but it is not a point upon which I should like to give a snap answer now, and, for that reason, I will take advantage of his invitation to consider it.</p>

<p>I want to raise one consideration which has not been touched upon, and that is the question of employee shareholders. Though I raise it on this Clause, I do not want to put the emphasis in the wrong place. I would have brought it up before if there had been a discussion on Clause III stand part. This is a matter which may concern the Agency, but will certainly concern the Board, because the primary responsibility in furthering this matter on a long-term basis rests with the Board. If hon. Gentlemen opposite are right in saying that the Agency will be left with a considerable section of the industry for a considerable time then it will benefit by the experience gained and will be able to apply that benefit to the handling of further shares.<br/>
I do not want to give the impression that I am advocating that they should

take this course immediately, because this is a process of evolution. I also appreciate the difficulty in writing it into the Bill, because one wants to be encouraging rather than mandatory. In questions like that of joint consultation, the pattern is already there, and everybody knows what it is. In this case, a satisfactory pattern is still to be worked out, and what we want to do is to ensure that encouragement is given to doing this. There are two issues; desirability and practicability.<br/>
On the first point, I think that, in practice, there is very little difference between us. I am sure that hon. Gentlemen opposite agree that the pattern of human relations in industry changed just as much though less obviously than mechanical processes in industry. That is inevitable. We are all looking for outlets for the ever-increasing aspirations and interests of people in industry. Joint consultation is one means. I believe that employee shareholding may be another method of achieving it. On the practical side, though I do not under-estimate such difficulties of cyclical fluctuations in the industry mentioned by the hon. Member for North Islington, I believe a pattern can be found which will give adequate benefit and make it worth while, and, at the same time, safeguard the small investor against undue risk. I do not believe that it is impossible to achieve, and I believe that hon. Members, like my hon. Friend the Member for Esher (Mr. Robson Brown), who knows a great deal about these things, are of a like opinion.<br/>
8.15 p.m.<br/>
The reason I wish to emphasise the point is that I realise that, in moving in this direction, there is no great impetus behind management or behind the trade unions, who are satisfied with the existing arrangements. If we agree that this objective is generally desirable and that it is possible to work out a satisfactory method of achieving it, as has been done already in certain other industries and fairly successfully at various times in the steel industry, the speed with which we move towards that aim will depend on the energy and ingenuity directed towards solving these particular difficulties. I very much hope that, even if it is not practicable to write anything into the Bill, the Minister will have another look at the point and will give us an assurance


that he will use his influence to encourage the Board, and when occasion offers, the Agency, to see what can be done in this direction.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Rutherglen (Mr. Brooman-White) has made a rather strange speech. It seems to me to be a remarkable thing that an hon. Member on the Conservative benches is prepared to go into the Lobby to chase this Bill to its final stage and take away from the existing shareholders&#x2014;all of us, including himself&#x2014;and from the steel workers, the right to be shareholders and hand over their shares to private enterprise, and who then goes on to ask that, under the new ownership, the steel workers should become shareholders again. It seems to me to be a remarkable state of affairs.<br/>
Here is an industry being worked and managed primarily by the workers, and in which the result of their labours puts 3&#x00BD; per cent. on national steel stock. Nobody will buy any of this stock until that percentage can be increased to x percentage more than that, and the first thing the steel workers will have to do when this Bill is through is to earn that additional percentage. Yet here is the hon. Member for Rutherglen suggesting that, having earned an additional percentage for people whom they do not like, the workers will then begin to invest some of their savings which will be less rather than more, because their wages will be governed by the profits of the industry.<br/>
It is a strange position which the hon. Member is taking up. The steel workers are quite happy to have the opportunity of investing in National Savings arising out of their own earnings and good conditions when working for John Bull, Unlimited, under nationalisation, and I cannot hold out much hope to the hon. Gentleman that he will get them to invest money from restricted purses in order to help to offset the results of this Bill by taking up shares, which we believe people will have great difficulty in doing.</p>

<p>Before we part with this Clause, which I regard as one of the most important in the Bill, and certainly one of the most wrecking Clauses, because it establishes ways and means by which the Agency is to dispose of the nationalised undertaking, I must say that

we have had surprisingly few guarantees to guard against our worst fears, which were expressed on Second Reading. Our fears were that the best part of this industry was to be creamed off by private individuals, and the worst part left in the hands of the State.<br/>
In the discussions which we have had on the Amendments, so far no specific undertaking has come from the Government indicating that they are opposed to that policy. How are we to guard against picking off the best pieces in this case? We have had no answer from the Treasury: indeed, we could hardly expect it from them, because their job is to see that the industry is sold and to act as a kind of holding company pending the final sale. In any event, considerable pressure will be brought to bear upon the Government both by their own back benchers and by people outside to sell the industry back to private enterprise regardless of the consequences.<br/>
We really ought to know upon what kind of principles the Treasury will ask the Agency to act in the sale of this undertaking. How are they to set about it? Are they going to parcel up the companies in their pre-nationalisation packages and sell them as such, or are they going to adopt the policy which the Corporation would have adopted of getting the best grouping possible and setting a pattern for the better running of the industry in the future?<br/>
The Annual Report of the Iron and Steel Corporation stated that they had clear, definite proposals for a re-grouping of the companies under their control with a view to getting a better organisation of the iron and steel industry. It would be a tragedy at a time when the Government are, perhaps, setting the stage for a long time ahead if those plans were pigeon-holed and not proceeded with. They should not turn away from that to a proposal which would get a quick and easy sale.<br/>
How much do the Government anticipate they are going to sell of this industry in the first year, in the second year, or, assuming they go as far, in the third year? When one talks about the third year, one is getting a little hypothetical, but we want to know what are their intentions for the first year. How much investment capital do they think will be available after the most attractive part of


the industry has been sold? It is my opinion that when the more profitable and more modern parts of the industry have been sold there will be precious little money forthcoming with which to purchase the rest.<br/>
The Financial Secretary dropped a hint which rather disturbed me, because it seemed to point to the fact that where a company was to be sold and where the would-be purchasers would have to spend a considerable amount, not only on the actual purchase. but in future development, he was thinking of giving them some preferential right&#x2014;a lower purchase price to offset the large amount they would have to spend on modernisation. I would have thought that a great deterrent against purchasing parts of this industry would be the very fact that the purchaser, as well as having to pay a substantial amount to buy the company, would have to commit himself or the company to long-term expenditure to put it into proper order.<br/>
This supports our argument that we should like to see the powers of the holding company strengthened to deal with a situation like that because such companies will form the major part of the industry that is left. I think we ought to be told by the Financial Secretary what the Government propose to do to protect the State and the taxpayer against loss when disposing of these businesses.</p>

<p>I wish to raise what is perhaps a minor point, and I invite the Financial Secretary to give us his opinion, or that of the Government, upon it. According to paragraph 35 the White Paper issued by the Government a little time ago:
<q>In allocating securities offered for sale, the Agency will, notwithstanding the serious technical difficulties involved, give priority where practicable to applications from former shareholders.</q>
I do not know by what means the Government can give instructions to the Agency, but I assume that will be done under Clause 17 (5). If I am mistaken I should like to be informed. I should also like to know where exactly under that subsection the Government have power to give instructions to the Agency. What thought, if any, have the Government given to this very interesting subject, and what are the difficulties they have in mind?<br/>
I should particularly like to know whether, where big company A was previously in the possession of big company B, or where big company B was a major shareholder in it, company B will be given priority in purchasing company A over any other competitor, and whether, even if company B offers a substantially less sum of money than other competitors, it will still be given possession of and control over company A. Or does it mean&#x2014;this is not an alternative; it may mean this as well&#x2014;that the ordinary shareholder who had 100 shares in an iron and steel works will be given some form of priority when the time comes for issuing shares to the public, as no doubt shares will be issued? Is it contemplated that he will be told that if he puts in an application, such application will be given priority?<br/>
What has been the thinking of the Government on this matter? How is it to work out? Is it a propaganda point in order to satisfy the previous owners of the iron and steel industry, either the shareholders or those who controlled an iron and steel company through virtue of a majority holding? I should be very grateful if the Government would tell us this.<br/>
I agree that this is a minor point compared with the huge issues raised in this Clause, a Clause which we think is as bad as Clause 16 and which does all sorts of things which in our view are undesirable in the public interest. We have had no explanation about the point I am now putting to the Financial Secretary. As it arises on this Clause, I shall be glad to be given any available information on the subject.</p>

<p>I do not think there is very much I can add in reply to the right hon. Member for Vauxhall (Mr. G. R. Strauss) or to the hon. Member for Stockton-on-Tees (Mr. Chetwynd) on the points they have raised. The right hon. Gentleman is quite right in saying that instructions to the Agency are covered under Clause 17 (5). As to whether priority is to be given to applications from previous shareholders, to which reference is made, as the right hon. Gentleman pointed out, in paragraph 35 of the White Paper, I would draw attention to the fact that in the same paragraph it is pointed out that serious


technical difficulties are involved. I think the right hon. Gentleman will appreciate some of them. But it must be borne in mind that those who have previously operated the companies, and perhaps particularly in the case where they have previously operated them as subsidiaries of some other un-nationalised concern, may well have some special practical experience in their operation which would make them useful and valuable people to operate them again.<br/>
8.30 p.m.<br/>
That is the sort of consideration which arises and which perhaps may arise in the case to which I have just referred&#x2014;that is of the subsidiary which the parent company desires to have rejoin it. I must make it clear that, for obvious reasons, that will not be the only factor in deciding whether the sale to that particular prospective purchaser is to take place. Then, of course, there is the question of the tendering of compensation stock in payment, to which reference is also made in one of the paragraphs of the White Paper which we have discussed before. It is true that compensation stock may have changed hands in the interval, but the tendering of compensation stock by previous owners will no doubt occur in a number of cases.<br/>
As the White Paper says, it is a matter of serious technical difficulties, and there is nothing in the suggestion of the right hon. Member for Vauxhall that the previous owners would be given a bargain when other and substantially better offers were tendered. Previous ownership will be one of the factors which will be considered, though express warning is given that there are serious difficulties.</p>

<p>May I ask the Financial Secretary about one thing which has puzzled me? By "technical difficulties" do the Government mean financial difficulties&#x2014;difficulties in the form of handling the matter as an issue, or whatever it may be, or technical difficulties with regard to the industry?</p>
</speech>

<p>It means, I think, mainly technical difficulties with respect to the handling of the operation. I do not think that there is very much in the point raised by the hon. Member for Stockton-on-Tees, though the point has

been made several times in the course of this debate. I might sum up by saying that there are two important considerations which the Agency will have to bear in mind. The first is that there must be a price which is fair and reasonable to the taxpayer. It has been urged from the benches opposite that all sorts of provisions should be put into the Bill to compel it. That is certainly our intention, and from the fact that suggestions have been made from the benches opposite I take it that hon. Members opposite agree with us.<br/>
The other consideration is that the industry shall assume an efficient new form, that the grouping and arrangement of it shall be such as to enable it to render the greatest service to the community in the highly competitive condition of the world in which we now live. Those will be the major considerations which the Agency and my right hon. Friend will bear in mind, and I do not think that I can reply to the hon. Member for Stockton-on-Tees better than by reminding him of those considerations.</p>

<p>I am afraid that I do not regard this point as quite as unimportant as has been suggested. It seems to me to involve a matter of principle of considerable importance. The Government White Paper declared that the Agency
<q>will, notwithstanding the serious technical difficulties involved, give priority where practicable to applications from former shareholders.</q>
There is one perfectly obvious point. Suppose two offers are received, one bigger than another, one from a former shareholder and the other not from a former shareholder. Which will be accepted? What does priority mean? Does it simply mean that if a number of precisely similar offers are received, then, to some extent at any rate, priority will be given to former shareholders?</p>

<p>I am sorry if the hon. and learned Member did not fully appreciate my answer. I am sure that it was my fault. There is no intention to give to the former shareholders in this way the advantage of having better terms; but, as the hon. and learned Member knows perfectly well, in the allocation of stocks it is possible, as is often done by companies, to provide for the use of different coloured forms. The share is


bought at the same price, but of the "competing" bids that on a certain coloured form gets priority. It is no more complicated than that. I hoped that I had put it clearly, but as I see that the hon. and learned Member for Kettering (Mr. Mitchison) is about to rise again, apparently I have not done so even now.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1953-02-23a.1833.0" hansard_membership_id="9373" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/18428" speakername="Mr. Mitchison" colnum="1833" time="">
<p>I am very glad to hear what the Financial Secretary has said, so far as it goes. What it comes to is this, as I understand it: we have an undertaking from the Government that the priority is not to involve any form of preference either in price or conditions. It is simply that wherever all other circumstances are equal, it is proposed to give a measure of priority to the former shareholders. If I misunderstood that, it is undoubtedly my fault and I shall be glad to be corrected now because I am going to make a comment.<br/>
The practice to which the hon. Gentleman refers prevails in very different circumstances. That practice prevails where an offer is being made either to existing shareholders in respect of their shareholdings or to existing shareholders in respect of a public issue, and it is known or anticipated beforehand that that public offer will be highly acceptable to the market. Priority is, therefore, given as a privilege to existing shareholders or whoever the group may be; it may and often should, include employees and customers. They are given a privilege of having a better chance of getting the advantage which is offered.<br/>
I regard it as a somewhat ominous parallel because when we are dealing with these stocks and shares and they are being sold by and on behalf of the public we do not want to contemplate circumstances in which they will be offered at prices so advantageous to the purchasers that there will be a positive scramble to get them and the former shareholder will be glad indeed to avail himself of his priority. I am at a loss to understand what an ordinary person, described by Macaulay as "the traveller in the Clapham omnibus." would consider this sentence in the White Paper to mean. Let us look at it.<br/>
Cutting out the verbiage it says:
<q>The Agency will give priority to applications from former shareholders.</q>
The man would think "I am going to get some advantage out of this. This is a kind Government. I have been robbed by the Socialist bandits. Lo and behold, the Tory Party are coming along and distributing justice. generosity and a finely assorted collection of the Christian virtues and Christmas presents all at once. That is very nice." That is the sort of conclusion that I myself would draw.<br/>
But when we come down to the plain English of the matter, it is this: priority does not mean any advantage whatever in the terms upon which one purchases as distinct from anybody else, unless the price which is asked or which is to be accepted is too low. If the price asked is fair and reasonable, then the priority as interpreted now has no meaning whatever. Perhaps that is a serious technical difficulty. I should have thought it was a very serious difficulty, but not quite a technical one. I see no technical difficulty whatever in working almost any of these arrangements. They are not as uncommon as all that.<br/>
But the fundamental ethical difficulty remains: If one sells at the right price&#x2014;that is the best price which the public can get for their property&#x2014;these words mean nothing whatever and they ought never to have been put into the White Paper. They certainly deluded a number of innocent people into believing that they were going to get something which they are not going to get. Indeed, I do not think they ought to get it. I believe that one ought to sell at the highest possible price.<br/>
Going over the history of this matter a good many years means wandering into an area of confusion between past shareholders, intermediate shareholders and stockholders, and all the rest of it. It is quite meaningless and impracticable. I am sorry that these words were put in. I suppose this is another of those quasi-Election promises which have just been dropped rather quietly overboard.</p>

<p>I am very grateful to you. Colonel Gomme-Duncan. I am sure that that will meet the wishes of the Committee and will facilitate our discussion. The effect of these two Amendments, taken together, would be to make the beginning of paragraph (<i>a</i>) read as follows:
<q>make loans to any company the majority of whose securities carrying full voting rights are held by the Agency &#x2026;</q>
It will be seen that the object of the Amendments is to limit the power of the Agency to make loans to the companies and subsidiaries so that those loans can be made only to those companies in which the Agency themselves hold control.<br/>
I do not wish&#x2014;indeed, I should be out of order if I did so&#x2014;to anticipate some of the provisions of the next one or two following Clauses, but perhaps I may be allowed to say that by some of their provisions, about which we shall doubtless have some discussion in the near future, it would be possible for the Agency, having sold some assets and obtained some money on that account, then to proceed under this subsection to lend some or all of that money to some companies in which they have an interest. Clearly, there are very grave dangers in that procedure.<br/>
The function of the Agency, as we said earlier today, will be ideally fulfilled if they work themselves out of their job at the earliest possible moment. The very word "Realisation" in their title, the Iron and Steel Holding and Realisation Agency, suggests an early finalisation, and it is not desirable&#x2014;and I should think, quite possibly, from the drafting of the Bill, it is not desired by the Government&#x2014;that the Agency shall go on dragging out timelessly their somewhat miserable existence.<br/>
What is desired is that they should carry out the operation of realisation as far as they can in the shortest possible time. We on this side of the Committee have some views, and I suspect that right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite have some grave fears, that it will not be able to do much of its realising away before the next General Election blights the hopes of the party opposite and raises the hopes of those who have the interests of this industry at heart, but, at any rate, the intention is that they should get on with the job and get out.<br/>
One of the dangers that lie within this provision is that they will maintain a continuing interest by the action that, so soon as they have got shot of one company, they will take the money and use it to get themselves involved in another company. That, clearly, is not the intention at all. For one thing, it carries with it the possibility that assets realised on a capital basis, the proceeds of the realisation, could be used for revenue purposes, and that clearly would be very bad financially.<br/>
It certainly could be argued that where the Agency have control over a company they would be justified in lending that company money for an approved purpose which could be executed with the safeguard that it was under the control of the Agency in their execution. The Agency might, for example, argue that their task of selling the shares of that company would be facilitated if that company were able to undertake some development, and it might well be that that development could be undertaken only if the Agency came along and lent it the money to do so. That, I think, would be a weak case, but at least it would be a comprehensible case and I do not propose to argue that case again because it is not the purpose of the Amendment.<br/>
That case could not be applied where the Agency have a minority holding. The Agency here is disposing of public money&#x2014;and, moreover, public money obtained by the sale of public capital assets&#x2014;and it would be the height of improvidence if it were able to, even subject to the authority of the Treasury&#x2014;no doubt we shall revert to that later&#x2014;and we should be happier if that authority were less general than is envisaged in line 42. Even subject to the same general authority of


the Treasury it seems to me somewhat doubtful whether the Agency ought to be able to take public money obtained from a capital sale and pass it over to a company which may use it in ways and for purposes which lie outside the control of the Agency themselves.<br/>
It is not the function of this Agency to become a general money-lending institution. It is not even their function to become a general money-lending institution for the steel industry. There are other organisations which have the means and are capable of providing finance for any of these companies, and there is no reason why the Agency should trench on the functions of these other organisations, at least one of which has, in the past, lent large sums of money to companies in the steel industry. What we propose is, in a sense, half a loaf; or perhaps it would be more accurate to say something like two-thirds of a loaf.<br/>
We say that, while it is open to us to object to any of this lending of public money obtained on capital account for purposes which may be revenue purposes, we have confined our objections to those cases where the ultimate disposition of that money is outside the control of the lending body. I should have thought the Government would consider these two Amendments as reasonable, and that they would not wish the Agency to become a general money-lending authority and a general finance institution for the whole of the steel industry, including companies in which they have only a minority, and perhaps in some cases a very small minority, holding.<br/>
I limit my remarks, not because I think this subject is unimportant, but because I think that little, if anything, further need be said to convince the Government that these are Amendments which they ought reasonably to accept.</p>

<p>The provision in this Clause in respect of loans to companies in which the Agency holds some of the shares is necessary to secure that the development of those companies is not held up while they are at that stage. It might well be that physical development of some importance fitted into the development plan at that time. It is equally not the intention, as the hon. Gentleman has indicated, that the Agency should be a general money-lending

Agency. Indeed, the limit of &#x00A3;10 million in the Clause is sufficient confirmation of that.<br/>
The question, therefore, which is raised on these Amendments is; Should it be possible, as under the Clause at present, for this money to be lent while the Agency have any holding in the companies, or should it be only possible, as suggested in these two Amendments, for these loans to be made while the Agency retain the majority shareholding? I appreciate that there is some force in the suggestion that where the shareholding by the Agency has fallen to a very small proportion of the total, it would not be the proper function of the Agency to go on lending money. That would be getting the Agency rather into the general money-lending organisation to which the hon. Member referred, and which I indicated it was not our intention it should be.<br/>
9.0 p.m.<br/>
I think that there is something to be said for imposing a quantity limit. I do not think that we can go as far as suggested and confine the lending policy to the case in which the Agency has a majority of the shares. There may be cases where the Agency has a big minority shareholding in which it would be desirable to lend the money. The fact, for example, that 40 per cent. of the shares of a company were held by the Agency might involve the company in difficulties in obtaining finances from other sources. We must be careful to make sure that the development of companies which are at this stage of disposal should not be interfered with. I am sure that everyone who wants to see the industry properly developed will agree with that.</p>

<p>I know that the hon. Gentleman is always very clear and we nearly always understand his arguments, but I could not understand the last one at all. Why should it be difficult for a company to borrow money because the Agency own 40 per cent. of the shareholdings? I should have thought that if there was Government interest in the company, they would not handicap that company in seeking loans and might help it. His argument was that the company might be handicapped, and I cannot understand that argument.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman used the word "might." We are to some extent in the realm of uncertainty. I hope that it is no more than a possibility. I think that it is a real possibility. Even if it is only a possibility it is necessary to provide for it.<br/>
As I was about to say, I think that we can, up to a point, meet the hon. Member for Reading, South (Mr. Mikardo). I think it would be possible at the next stage of this Bill to introduce a provision limiting the lending power to cases in which the Agency hold a substantial proportion of the shares. That does not go the full way. The hon. Member wanted us to go as far as the holding of a majority of the shares, but it goes some way to meeting his point that it would not be a proper function of the Agency for loans to be made where the Agency holding in the company was trivial.<br/>
I would, therefore, suggest to the Committee that the substance of the hon. Member's Amendment could be met in that way, and if it met with the pleasure of the Committee I would be prepared to give an undertaking to introduce such an Amendment on Report.</p>

<p>Can the hon. Gentleman satisfy me, and possibly other hon. Members, on one very simple point? Is there any real reason why the Government should not say what "substantial" means?

The Government have to make up their mind some day and they might perhaps make it up now, or when drafting the Clause, as to what they mean by the word "substantial."</p>

<p>I am willing to consider the hon. and learned Member's suggestion. My first reaction would be that there would be disadvantages in the insertion of a precise figure which, unless it was put rather lower than the hon. and learned Gentleman would like, might occasionally disable us from doing what quite clearly we ought to do to help the development of a company. My own feeling is that "substantial" would meet the point, but I am prepared to consider the suggestion of the hon. and learned Gentleman, although I believe it is improbable that on consideration a precise figure would appear to be more suitable than "substantial."</p>

<p>I must press the Financial Secretary again. He did not answer my question. He said the fact that the Agency own 40 per cent. of certain shares and have Government money to that extent might handicap the company in raising money outside. The question I asked there may be a good answer, but I cannot think of it&#x2014;was in what circumstances that could be detrimental to the company if it was seeking money from the F.C.I. or the money market. How would it be more difficult for the company to raise money through ordinary commercial channels just because the Government or the Agency still own 40 per cent. of the shares and will, no doubt, later on, be trying to sell the 40 per cent.? Unless we can get an answer to the question there seems to be no reason why the hon. Gentleman should reject the Amendment. He put that forward as his only argument for saying that our proposal was unreasonable. I cannot see his argument, and I ask him to give us any circumstances in which his argument could apply.</p>

<p>I am delighted to help the right hon. Gentleman. It is the known policy of the Measure to dispose of Government holdings&#x2014;the Agency's holdings, as they will be&#x2014;of the stocks of the companies. The knowledge that a large proportion of the stocks of a certain company is likely to be disposed of in the near future could obviously tend to have a depressing effect upon the market for the stocks of that company and might make it extraordinarily difficult at that moment to raise further funds, for example by a new issue. Surely the right hon. Gentleman is not so naive as he suggests. He must realise that the likelihood of a considerable block of the shares of a company coming on the market in the near future can very often make it extremely difficult to raise further funds by means of a new issue. If the right hon. Gentleman does not appreciate that, he might consult one or two of his hon. Friends, for I am sure they could help him.</p>

substantial point arises and when we come to Clause 20, which really sets out the financial machinery for this Agency and their accounts, I may have something more to say.

This is a small technical Amendment in order to make it quite clear that the Redemption Fund set up under the Seventh Schedule of the 1949 Act is not imported into the provisions of the Bill.

<p>This is not quite such a small Amendment as might appear from the Financial Secretary's remarks. We do not intend at this stage to oppose the Amendment or to deal at great length with this Clause, because to some extent the same considerations are involved in the Amendment of my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr. Mitchison). The Iron and Steel Corporation have the duty of redeeming their stock. This stock is apparently to be turned into Treasury stock of the same identity and
<q>subject to the same powers, privileges, charges, restraints and liabilities as before.</q>
It is not to be subject to redemption except in so far as there is a general redemption of the National Debt. In


other words, by this Clause and particularly by this Amendment the Government propose to lose iron and steel stock in general Government funds.<br/>
We are aware that in other parts of the Bill&#x2014;and we shall move Amendments to strengthen them&#x2014;there are provisions for accounting for what takes place when the companies are sold, but it would have been very much more easy to see what takes place if the proceeds of the sales of the companies were applied directly to the redemption of the iron and steel stock. This Amendment, of course, prevents that taking place.<br/>
9.15 p.m.<br/>
Some of our anxieties about the general intentions of the Government on all these Clauses are considerably strengthened by the Amendment. They arise out of the things that are said here and in the financial Press. The Financial Secretary must have seen a very extraordinary article in the "Financial Times" of last Wednesday, 18th February, which suggested that the revenue from the sale of these assets might be applied to reduction of taxation. I would be out of order if I attempted to develop that theme, but the argument was extraordinarily muddled. Examining the Clauses, I think that on the whole the Bill safeguards us against direct reduction of taxation in that way; nevertheless there are such extraordinary ideas about.<br/>
I think it is right that we should say at once to the Government that on the next Clause we intend to examine very closely indeed how these funds, which will arise from the sale of the companies, are to be used and what Parliamentary control there will be over them, and to make quite certain that the actual facts of the sale of the companies, and the loss or gain to the Government, shall be made quite clear. I do not intend to go any further on that point now, but we must not allow the Financial Secretary, who can be very charming sometimes, and sometimes slightly disingenuous in the way he puts these matters to the Committee, to pass on without a warning that we have not overlooked what is being done in this Amendment and in the Clause; and that we hope to have a much more detailed discussion on the way in which the Government intend to use the

funds they will get from the sale of these companies.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 15, line 28, to leave out subsection (2).<br/>
I am not going to take up much time on this matter because I think the Financial Secretary will agree that the subsection which I move to leave out has no meaning whatever. It merely changes the name of the stock. The reasons for the change are completely obscure. The security remains completely identical. Ten lines are taken up by this subsection in order to say: "We will call this stock by a new name."<br/>
I do not know why the Government want to do it. Is the name of the Chancellor to be glorified by being attached to an issue of Government stock in the way in which the names of previous Chancellors of the Exchequer have from time to time been attached, beginning with Hicks Beach and going down to Daltons, which is the most recent one? Perhaps that is the reason the Government are doing this. Perhaps they do not want anybody to remember that iron and steel have been nationalised, but we will see to that. We will see that people remember, and that iron and steel are nationalised again.<br/>
Apart from all that, I hope that the Financial Secretary will agree that this subsection is one of the silly efforts of the Treasury and that it has no meaning whatever, no purpose, and no object, and might as well be dropped as left in.</p>

<p>I am sure that the hon. and learned Gentleman enjoyed himself. The purpose of the subsection is to substitute for "British Iron and Steel Three and a half per cent. Guaranteed Stock, 1979&#x2013;1981," the words "Three and a half per cent. Treasury Stock, 1979&#x2013;1981," to bring the stock into line with reality. The stock ceases to be an iron and steel stock and becomes an ordinary Treasury stock. Therefore, surely, it is a good thing that it should be named accurately. We believe that British Government stocks guaranteed by the Treasury should be described accurately, and as this subsection provides for that accuracy, it seems to me to be fully justified.</p>

It is the habit of a certain foreign country at the moment to wipe out history by expunging from the history books all those things which are disliked by the powers that be. I thought that may be the Government were doing the same thing here and, not liking the iron and steel nationalisation or the iron and steel stock, they thought it would be a nice thing to expunge it from history by eliminating the name altogether and giving it some other.

<p>I beg to move, in page 16, line 20, to leave out "fifty," and to insert "forty."<br/>
The purpose of this Amendment is not to substitute "forty" for "fifty," but to seek information. It is quite clear from our debates on Clauses 18 and 19 that on Clause 20 we hope to have a proper discussion of the meaning of these financial Clauses. To begin with, we understand that a large part of the nationalised steel companies will remain in the hands of the Holding and Realisation Agency for a considerable time and, as the Financial Secretary has said, while those sections of the industry remain in the hands of the Agency, the Agency will have to do something to see that proper development goes on. That proper development will call for financial expenditure and, if that happens, it is proper that the Agency should have adequate finance at its disposal to look after the development charge.<br/>
We are not quite sure how this will be done, particularly as regards the accounting. Clause 21, which purports to deal with the accounting side of the business, is not clear as to the kind of information that will be given publicly and the

manner in which it will be given publicly. We are also perplexed about the amount of &#x00A3;150 million mentioned in the Clause. It will be remembered that the first development plan of the iron and steel industry was to cost about &#x00A3;170 million which, I suppose, is about &#x00A3;300 million at present prices. We do not know how the Government hit upon the figure of &#x00A3;150 million, unless they took the cost of development plans and divided it into halves, because half of the industry will go into private hands and half remain in public hands, and, therefore, &#x00A3;150 million seemed a nice figure to put in the Bill. We should like to know what the Government have in mind in putting this figure forward, and we want the fullest information that we can get about the way in which the Agency will finance the developments of companies that remain in the hands of the Agency.<br/>
In Clause 18, which we have already passed, although we shall come back to it on Report stage in a big way, the Agency could make loans to companies, give financial guarantees and buy securities and assets of the steel companies, which does not look as if the Agency will be pursuing their one-way line&#x2014;the line of disposing of the assets of publicly-owned iron and steel companies. Quite a lot of the industry will be left in the hands of the Agency, and, from our own point of view, we would prefer the raising of money by the Agency from the companies that remain in its hands from ordinary commercial earnings, but, if the Agency are to be the medium of the Treasury in raising a fund to a limit of &#x00A3;150 million, and the cash is to go through the Agency, we should like to know precisely how the accounting is to be done.<br/>
Will the accounts of all these transactions be presented to Parliament or will they be buried in general accounts? Will the accounting also include details of income obtained by the Agency from the sale of companies, from shares, and so on? Clause 21 is rather vague, and the new Amendments to Clause 19, in regard to not having the redemption business, make it all the more important that we should get a clear statement from the Financial Secretary as to the purpose, and particularly the accounting, that will be followed in carrying out the provisions of Clause 20.</p>

<p>The Amendment would have the effect of reducing the amount available for development from &#x00A3;150 million to &#x00A3;140 million. I do not propose to go into the accounting side in any detail, because the question of the accounts is raised on the next Clause, and I do not think it would be appropriate, or indeed in order, to anticipate any discussion that may then take place.<br/>
The question which is raised is why we have thought it necessary to make provision for as high a figure as &#x00A3;150 million. I may be able to help the hon. Member for Hillsborough (Mr. G. Darling) by drawing his attention to one or two facts. In the first place, when the companies are transferred under Clause 1, there will be substantial liabilities for the Agency to pay off, including the F.C.I. loans and loans from the publicly-owned companies to the Corporation, and the liabilities to be paid off will be of the order of &#x00A3;85 million. Therefore, that makes a substantial subtraction from the amount of &#x00A3;150 million which will be available for development.</p>

<p>No, loans which it would be advisable to clear. I can say that the figure of &#x00A3;150 million is calculated with that liability in mind. That being so, a certain amount has to be allowed for perhaps the next couple of years for the development of such of the companies as remain in public ownership. Naturally, the amount required will depend on the speed with which disposal takes place.<br/>
9.30 p.m.<br/>
We have deliberately fixed the figure rather high so as to allow a margin in case disposal goes slower than it would be reasonable to anticipate. As I said on the previous Amendment, it is not desirable that the process of development in this industry should be handicapped because other matters move faster or slower than could reasonably be expected. It seems to us that when allowance is made for repayments it gives a reasonable cover, so far as it is possible to foresee the future. It is for that reason that after some thought we felt that the figure of &#x00A3;150 million with which to cover the necessary developments would be adequate. and for that reason also I must

resist the hon. Member's proposal to reduce the amount by &#x00A3;10 million.</p>

<p>Do I understand the Financial Secretary to say that before the Agency attempt to sell some of these companies it is the intention of the Treasury to take over such commercial loans as may still be outstanding, that it is intended out of the figure which the Treasury may pay into the realisation account&#x2014;the figure of &#x00A3;150 million&#x2014;to pay off something like &#x00A3;85 million?</p>

<p>This is a very complicated matter and I am trying to follow what the hon. Gentleman really meant by that. It means there is a liability because some of the companies had very substantial loans from the Finance Corporation for Industry and so on. Is it the intention of the Treasury to take over the liability for such loans and to pay them off? If so, I really cannot see the purpose of that, and I should not have thought it was desirable.</p>

<p>That is perfectly true, but I am not sure what the figure is. It is not a very large figure so far, but we have not, of course, seen the second year's accounts, so we do not know what it is. Perhaps the Financial Secretary knows the figure of loans made by the Corporation to the separate companies. One of the great advantages of the Iron and Steel Corporation was that it could make these loans at a very low rate of interest. We know that there are other sums amounting to &#x00A3;60 million or so outstanding to other bodies, but I do not quite see the point of the Treasury taking over this liability.<br/>
That leaves a figure of about &#x00A3;65 million. Is it intended to go on developing the industry in public hands on the basis of Treasury loans out of the Consolidated Fund? I should have thought it would have been better to do that on the basis of Government stock, and therefore I cannot see that such a large figure is needed. It seems a thoroughly unsatisfactory way of financing the industry and


one over which there will be very little control, and I think we require a good deal more information than we have at the moment.<br/>
The whole thing is very confused, and I cannot, of course, deal with the rest of the Clause, which describes how the realisation account is to be operated. We are very uneasy about the whole thing, but I should particularly like further information about taking over the Corporation's loans. Would it not be better to develop the industry on a much more substantial and permanent basis?</p>

<p>I should like to emphasise the importance of the questions asked by my right hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton (Mr. Albu). We really ought to have more information about this matter. After all, &#x00A3;150 million is a substantial figure and this will be public money, loaned in one form or another, to go to industry for either development purposes or to pay off existing loans.<br/>
Conservative Members in the days when Labour were in office maintained that they were the watchdogs of public money and that they must not allow a penny to leave the Treasury without ample opportunity being provided to examine where it went and how it was going to be paid out. All of us ought to be insistent that in this case we should have more detailed information than we have had so far about the use which is expected to be made of this &#x00A3;150 million.<br/>
The Financial Secretary spoke about &#x00A3;85 million liabilities. These presumably are partly liabilities of the Corporation, which of course would have to be taken over by the Treasury because the Corporation are going out of existence. We should like to know how much of this &#x00A3;85 million is Corporation liability. There is a great deal of other money&#x2014;for example money lent by F.C.I. to the industry. There was a substantial sum outstanding&#x2014;I think about &#x00A3;30 million&#x2014;in connection with Margam when I was in control of the Ministry. Is it proposed to pay that off? If that is so, what is the difference between the situation now, when the industry is presumably going back to private enterprise, and the situation in the days when the loan was negotiated, because the industry was under private enterprise then. The F.C.I.

loan was negotiated before the days of nationalisation. If there is a further explanation for the balance of &#x00A3;85 million I think we are entitled to have it. We do not necessarily take objection to it, but we ought to know what is happening.<br/>
Is it in the mind of the Government, with regard to the balance of the &#x00A3;150 million, that all development schemes of companies remaining in the hands of the Agency should be paid for out of the sum of &#x00A3;65 million? If so, I do not think that sum is anything like enough. Ordinary development schemes will cost about &#x00A3;60 million a year for the next five years, a total of &#x00A3;65 million for that purpose is no use at all unless the Government contemplate&#x2014;and I do not think anybody in their senses would contemplate&#x2014;that they will sell all these companies in a month or two into private ownership.<br/>
There may be differences of opinion as to how long it will take to sell out, but is generally agreed that it will take many years, and in our view a substantial part of the industry will remain in the hands of the Agency for a long time, if not for ever&#x2014;or at least until there is a change of Government. If that is so, &#x00A3;65 million is a wholly insufficient sum. Is it suggested, on the other hand, that private resources will be used? Will F.C.I. be asked for further loans? If that is so, why do the Government want &#x00A3;65 million at all'?<br/>
In that case, they would not want anything like that sum. Or is it suggested that these things will be financed partly from private sources and partly from this fund? All these things must have been in the minds of the Minister of Supply and the Treasury when this sum was put into the Bill. We know that there is a division between &#x00A3;85 million and &#x00A3;65 million. We cannot understand how either sum was arrived at, and we should like some pretty detailed idea&#x2014;not necessarily down to the last half million&#x2014;of how the figure was made up. We should also like a broad answer to the questions which I have put, and which we consider are important.</p>

<p>I will do my best to answer the questions. The right hon. Gentleman referred. first of all, to the liabilities of &#x00A3;85 million. Of those, &#x00A3;45 million consists of the F.C.I. loans


which, I understand, in accordance with the Act of 1949, the F.C.I. could withdraw. Provision, therefore, has to be made to cover that. The sum of &#x00A3;20 million is in respect of loans from publicly owned companies to the Corporation which is now being extinguished, and a further &#x00A3;20 million may be required as a result of anticipated overdrawing by the Corporation. It is, therefore, necessary to make provision for the liability of &#x00A3;85 million, and that leaves the balance of &#x00A3;65 million available for development purposes.<br/>
It is intended to use two sources for development of such companies as remain in public ownership. One source will be part of the ploughed back profits made from the operations of the company. The other will be the &#x00A3;65 million. I agree it is a matter of calculation depending both on the speed of disposal and on the amount of development which it is possible to undertake. We have fixed the amount at a figure which seems, taking into account all the considerations I have mentioned, reasonable to cover the amount of development which will probably be undertaken in the next two years by companies remaining in public ownership. That is the best calculation we can make, bearing in mind two conflicting considerations.</p>

<p>No, the profits of the operations of the campanies which have not been sold. <i>Ex hypothesi</i> there are no profits of sale yet; they are simply the profits of the operations. We have calculated this figure on two conflicting considerations. On the one hand, we want to provide all that looks like being reasonably necessary for development because we want development to go on. On the other hand, we think it is wrong to ask Parliament for more than looks reasonably like being needed. As a matter of constitutional propriety and Parliamentary decency, it is wrong to ask for wildly exaggerated sums because of an outside chance of their being wanted. It is because of those two conflicting considerations that we have arrived at this sum, and we commend it to the Committee as being reasonable.</p>

<p>We have available all the resources of the Government, including the resources of the Ministry of Supply, to which Department great knowledge of the industry is available. As I have said three times already&#x2014;and I do not mind the hon.

<p>The Committee are now being told that instead of the amount of money to be provided having some relation to the number of companies and the technical development that will be decided upon, an amount of money&#x2014;&#x00A3;x&#x2014;has now been decided upon and that is the amount to be made available to an unknown number of people desiring to use it. We want to get this clear; this is a matter of vital importance. We are told that an amount of money&#x2014;and the figure has been stated&#x2014;will be available for the technical development of companies remaining in the possession of the Government, through the Agency; but we cannot be told what the number of companies will be.<br/>
It may be that 30 per cent. will require this money and will have to divide it among themselves, or that 60 per cent. of the present industry will require it. It will mean that those companies requiring 100 per cent. technical development will not get it and, because of their inefficiency, they will not be sold. The effect will be that because the amount of money is insufficient the companies left


in the hands of the Agency will not be as efficient as they should be.</p>

<p>I beg to move in page 17, line 6, at the end, to insert:
<q>Such account shall be prepared so as to show, so far as practicable, in relation to the transactions of the Iron and Steel Realisation Account, whether and to what extent assets or securities sold or disposed of by the Agency under the provisions of sections sixteen and seventeen of this Act are so sold or disposed of for a consideration which is greater or less in value than such an amount of the compensation, satisfied by the issue of British Iron and Steel Stock in respect of securities which, under the provisions of Part II of the Iron and Steel Act, 1949, are vested in the Iron and Steel Corporation of Great Britain, as is fairly attributable, all necessary adjustments and allowances being made, to such assets or securities sold or disposed of as aforesaid by the Agency.</q>
This is an Amendment to Clause 20 (8). The object of that subsection is to lay a duty upon the Treasury to state annually precisely what is happening about the assets in the nationalised steel industry of which it is having to dispose. This Amendment is really a test of the Government's straightforwardness. I do not think anybody on this side of the Committee would question for one minute the courtesy with which the right hon. Gentleman and his two hon. Friends have treated us throughout the debates on this Bill. They have done a great deal to minimise the discomfort of the rather more turbulent stretches of the river down which this Bill must pass on its somewhat hurried course to the sea of the Statute Book. But there cannot be much doubt in the minds of hon. and right hon. Gentlemen opposite about the suspicion which hon. Members on this side of the Committee have with regard to the whole question of denationalisation.<br/>
We think it is a surrender to sectional interests, and it would be proper to describe that surrender as abject if it were not for the extraordinarily gleeful expression with which the Financial Secretary embarked upon it. We think it is the antithesis of a national policy, giving to the Government's friends pecuniary advantages and opportunities to exploit the community, no doubt for a political <i>quid pro quo</i> in i the form of support for their party. It s a policy of directorships for the boys and plums for

the spivs, with whatever rake-offs there may be for the party opposite.<br/>
I have not said this just for the pleasure of saying it in public. I may no longer be young but at any rate I am innocent enough to be hurt by having to think such things about the party opposite. But these things are only too likely to be proved true. If I have gone one bit too far; if I have been in the slightest degree unfair in what I have said about the party opposite in its approach to these problems, here is their opportunity to show how wrong I am. We shall all be extremely pleased if they do anything like that.<br/>
The object of the Amendment is to see that full particulars are published in this account of the disposal of these assets. In particular, we are anxious to see a clear statement in this account, published annually by the Treasury, showing whether there has been a profit or a loss on the transactions&#x2014;that is to say, on each disposal of assets which may occur. By that, I mean whether there has been a sale for more or for less than the amount paid when the industry was taken over by the nation. I want that statement to be published for each asset or group of assets.<br/>
Already, under the subsection, the Treasury has to make an account annually of the disposal. All we are asking is that it shall show in the account, beyond any doubt, whether or not the sum obtained for an asset or group of assets, now that the assets are being sold back to the privateers, is more or less than the sum which the nation paid when it bought these assets. That is a very good way of being able to tell whether or not the price is reasonable, and that is why we want this information supplied.<br/>
If the Government are as straightforward as they would have us believe, and as we should like to believe them to be, surely this is the chance for which they have been waiting, because any honest-minded Government would at once leap at this opportunity to show quite openly and in public whether or not these transactions result in profits only for a section of the community or whether they result in a profit for the State. The Government may say that what we ask will be too difficult to achieve. We have


already heard about some of the changes which have taken place&#x2014;such changes, for instance, as those in the capital structure of some companies which were taken over when the industry was nationalised. The Government may say that, as a result of these changes, it is impossible to compare the price received for what is left of the changed article with that which was paid originally by the nation. They may say that some of the assets may not exist, that there may have been regrouping.<br/>
I submit that that is the sort of little sum which the backroom boys of the Treasury are paid to work out. There should be no difficulty whatever, if they set their minds to the task, in working out a comparable figure&#x2014;a comparison between the figure received now and the figure paid in the past. For instance, if a group of assets was bought for &#x00A3;x under the 1949 reckoning, and a certain asset has been hived off or grouped with other assets and is no longer in the original group; and if the value of the asset hived off is one-seventh of &#x00A3;x; then the comparison would obviously be with the six-sevenths which remain. That would be a perfectly simple sum.<br/>
I put it to the Parliamentary Secretary in all earnestness that, having in mind the suspicion which he knows to exist on this side of the Committee, he should be very willing to try to meet us on this point. After all, we represent a half of the electorate; we are deeply suspicious; and we want those suspicions to be allayed. This is the Government's chance to do that. Will they accept the Amendment and make an arrangement whereby the Treasury will state in public whether or not the sum being paid for the assets distributed by the Agency is as great in each individual case as was the sum paid for those assets originally? I ask the Financial Secretary to give a favourable reply. I ask him to say that this will not be a hole-and-corner business but an honest-to-God affair with regard to which everybody shall be able to form his own judgment in good conscience.</p>

<p>This will be neither a hole nor a corner affair, and, indeed, study of the Bill, I think, impresses one more with the plenitude and

amplitude of the accounts that will be available to hon. Members than any indication of shortage in that respect. But the objections to the peculiar type of accounts which the hon. and learned Member for Brigg (Mr. E. E. Mallalieu) has with some ingenuity evolved for himself are several. In the first place they are tied for purposes of comparison with the compensation stock.<br/>
I do not want to go over the ground which we have traversed&#x2014;I think, at least, twice&#x2014;today, but I am bound to remind the hon. and learned Member that there are very good reasons for saying that changes that have taken place since nationalisation have thrown comparison with the compensation stock as a yardstick completely out of date, sometimes one way, sometimes the other. Therefore, his particular form of accounts being based on that inaccurate yardstick must inevitably in what they show be inaccurate.<br/>
It is not particularly clear from reading the Amendment whether the loss or the profit which is to be shown is to be shown separately for each security sold or for the whole body of securities disposed of during the accounting period of a year. It is not at all clear what obligation is so imposed. But in any event, even if it be in its simpler form, as taking a lump together for a year. to be set for the purposes of comparison against the amount of compensation paid in respect of those particular securities, that must, in the nature of things, be not particularly helpful, because it may well be that those that are sold in one year raise a better price than those sold in another. Indeed, as markets tend to fluctuate, it is extremely likely that they would.<br/>
Then again, it is the object that all the information which can be got together on this subject shall be available in the report and accounts of the Agency, which, when we come to the next Clause, we shall provide shall be laid before Parliament. In particular, information as to the proceeds received for the sale of securities and other assets will be included in those accounts.<br/>
I really cannot see what more the hon. and learned Member can want, and, indeed, if I may go back to it, the peculiar form of presentation of accounts which he has evolved, though, undoubtedly, it would involve a great deal of difficulty


in getting them together, would really, for the reasons I have stated, give a most misleading impression, and would be far less helpful than the statement of the actual facts in the normal form of accounts which the Agency will lay, and for that reason alone it would seem to me quite wrong to present this rather peculiar form of balance sheet.</p>

<p>I do hope that the hon. Gentleman will reconsider the matter. I hope he will consider this Amendment in the way he was kind enough to consider another, which was not accepted, that was proposed to Clause 16 on the membership of the Agency. He will remember that he said that, although he could not accept our Amendment on that occasion, he did take the point of view that it would be desirable to try to avoid and to prevent any collusion about disposal. It seems to me that this Amendment would be an aid in judging whether there had been any collusion in the disposal of the assets.<br/>
This is a matter which does not crop up only in this country. I have only to remind the hon. Gentleman of the remark made by the aspiring candidate to high office in another friendly country who delivered himself of the dictum that what was good for General Motors was good enough for the country. This is a matter to which we must give very serious consideration when these assets are disposed of, and I suggest that, even if the form of accounts&#x2014;almost an <i>aidememoire</i>&#x2014;suggested by my hon. and learned Friend is unacceptable, a more explanatory form of accounts giving the value of these assets would be highly desirable.</p>

<p>We are most dissatisfied with the reply of the Financial Secretary. He tells us that the information to be given to us by the Agency of the outcome of their activities will be sufficient to satisfy our reasonable curiosity. We do not know that: there is no reason why it should be. We do not know in what form the Agency will inform the House about the sales they have been managing to get of their assets or securities. It will all be subject to Treasury ruling, and we do not know what the Treasury ruling will be. We therefore say that we think it reasonable and proper that there should be such

publication by the Agency of their sales activity as will enable us to make some comparison of their success and achievement. We want to know how they have been doing, if they have been doing well, and the sort of price they have been getting compared with the compensation prices originally paid for the various securities which were bought by the Corporation. Is that an unreasonable request?<br/>
I do not want to go over all the arguments put forward earlier in the day, but I am afraid I must touch on them. I repeat that we are exceedingly suspicious about not the desire but the ability of the Agency to sell the securities which it will hold at a price which can he considered by anybody as satisfactory from the public point of view. When the industry was bought by the Corporation it was paid what we thought was a fair price. We thought that the Stock Exchange valuation was a reasonable one. There was a loud cry of indignation by the Conservative Party, voiced particularly by the Front Bench spokesmen, that the price was wholly unreasonable and that the industry was being bought at well below the proper and true value.<br/>
We do not think that that was so. Surely, when the industry is being bought back by private owners, the profits of the industry having meanwhile risen substantially, it is reasonable for us to want to know whether the private owners, when buying back those companies which they had to sell to the Corporation, will pay, as we think they will, less for the companies than they received when they sold them to the Corporation. That, I should think, is a reasonable and proper matter for us to raise, and it is right for us to demand that the accounts of the Agency show whether this is so or not. We have a deep suspicion that in the very nature of the set-up here the public will not be able to get the money which it ought to get when it sells this public property.<br/>
As I said on an earlier Amendment, there will not be competitive buying. There will be one buyer for all the major assets, the big securities which are being sold. Some combination of interests&#x2014;iron and steel industry interests, banking interests and insurance interests&#x2014;will come along and put to the Agency


a proposition, "We are willing to take over this particular show for this figure and to have this financial structure. We propose to issue certain shares to the public and to pay you so much."<br/>
I am sure&#x2014;and I do not think anybody denied it when I put it to the Committee in the form of a question before&#x2014;that when it comes to selling these important companies, the take over price of which may be &#x00A3;10 million, &#x00A3;20 million or &#x00A3;30 million, there will not be any competitive buying or tendering for that industry. There will be one buyer only. On the other side of the picture, there will be the Agency under the control of the Government, and there will be the strongest possible pressure on the Agency and on the Treasury to sell in order to get rid of the stuff. That is the intention of the Government. They were elected for that purpose, and they are going to try to carry it out&#x2014;get rid of the stuff, and hand it over from public ownership to private ownership.<br/>
I am sorry to repeat myself but I must. The Government will be in an impossible and, indeed, in a ridiculous situation politically if, having passed this Iron and Steel Bill, they are forced to say, six months or a year later, "We are very sorry but we have not been able to sell more than one or two of the iron and steel companies. They are still in public ownership, and the Bill is just a bit of paper, because we cannot sell the companies except at prices which we are advised by the Treasury and the Agency are too low and unjustifiable in view of past history."<br/>
Then the pressure will come on the Treasury and on the Agency to sell these companies if they possibly can, and not let it be said that, in spite of the Bill, the property still remains in public hands. The companies who want to buy these assets know that perfectly well. They know that they have only to wait a bit. Most of them will not be eager to buy back these companies for a number of reasons.<br/>
One reason, no doubt, is that they do not want to hold these companies temporarily and then go through all the difficulties and trouble of having them bought up again by the State, when the next Labour Government is returned, in such a way that they will not be able to

make any profit out of holding these companies meanwhile. That will be the natural reaction of a number of people. They know that the permanent solution of this problem will be one of national ownership, and many people will, for that reason, be unwilling and reluctant to buy these companies back.<br/>
There may be many other reasons. There is the fear in the industry today and in financial circles&#x2014;I do not think it is justified; I think it is exaggerated&#x2014;that the prospects for the world iron and steel industry are not so rosy as they were two or three years ago; and that the growing capacity of the industry, not in this country but in the world, is outgrowing world demands. They believe that as a result of lack of sufficient action in developing the under-developed parts of the world, there will not be sufficient world demand for the production of the iron and steel companies as there would have been if there had been effective action by international authorities to develop parts of Asia and other parts of the world which require developing, and that there is going to be over-production.<br/>
I do not hold that view myself, but it is a view widely held. My point is that for this and other reasons many people will be reluctant to bring these companies again under private ownership. On the other hand, the Government and the State will be most anxious to make substantial sales. For that reason, I think the probability is that the law of supply and demand will apply, and the pressure to sell will be greater in many cases than the demand to buy. The result will be, in our belief, that the companies will be sold back to private owners, if they are sold back at all, at disgracefully low prices, much lower than the prices which were paid to the old shareholders by the Corporation.</p>

<p>Has the right hon. Gentleman forgotten that 20 minutes ago, on an earlier Amendment, he was arguing that the Treasury would be so interested in the financial side that the Agency would then be put under the Board. That is exactly the reverse of what he is now saying.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1953-02-23a.1864.1" hansard_membership_id="12567" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29562" speakername="Mr. Strauss" colnum="1864" time="">
<p>I do not think that it is the reverse. Let us be accurate when we are referring to previous statements. I was


putting forward the same argument then. I was arguing that the Treasury, in their anxiety to sell almost at all costs because of the pressure put upon it by the Government, might sacrifice the efficiency of the industry and sell assets because they happened to get a good offer for them when it was obviously desirable that the assets should not be taken out of some integrated group but should remain under their control.<br/>
It was because of the possibility of pressure on the Agency to sell wherever they were able to do so at almost any price that I said that the Agency should be put under the control of the Board so that the Board could ensure that the assets owned and controlled by the Agency would not be broken up indiscriminately for financial purposes at the cost of sacrificing the efficiency of the industry. My argument on that occasion was completely consistent. That argument was consistent with the one I am putting forward today. [<i>Laughter.</i>] I do not know whether hon. Gentlemen opposite do not see the point or do not want to see it. The point is, simply, that the Agency will be trying hard all the time to sell perhaps irrespective of whether they are sacrificing the interests of the efficiency and co-ordination of the industry, and their efforts to sell are likely to be greater than the desires of potential buyers to purchase.<br/>
The result will be that, if it is sold back at all, a great portion of the industry will be sold at a rotten price. The steel owners will get their industry back at a price which will be very beneficial to them but will be exceedingly disadvantageous to the public. That is our belief and fear, and the only way in which we can find out whether our belief and fear is correct or not&#x2014;I cannot prophesy for certain&#x2014;is by the Agency publishing figures which will either prove or disprove our fears, and that is what we are asking at the moment.<br/>
We ask that the Agency shall produce figures which will enable us to compare the selling price they are able to obtain for the securities which they hold with the price originally paid by the Corporation to the companies for similar securities. We know that exact comparison is not possible in all cases, that there have been changes and that a number of companies may have to be grouped together,

but we also know that the ingenuity of the Treasury or a group of chartered accountants will make possible the preparation of comparable accounts.<br/>
The fact that the Government are unwilling to accede to our request that such figures should be published to enable a comparison to be made convinces us that they know that what we say is probably correct. If the Government had nothing to fear and were convinced that our fear was incorrect, they would allow the figures to be published in the form that we require. We do not ask for detail, but there is information which Parliament and the country ought to hear. There has never before been anything like this sale of &#x00A3;240 million worth of public assets to private persons; the conditions and amounts are without precedent.<br/>
The House ought to have the fullest report and it should be in a form to enable us to make comparisons to prove or disprove our fear. If the Government are unwilling to produce figures in such a form, we can only come to the conclusion that they know our fear is correct.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman has deployed a considerable part of his argument very fully and I am sure he has enjoyed himself very much in the process. The only point concerned here is the point of accounting. The particular proposal contained in the Amendment is, for the reasons I gave, quite unacceptable. I notice that the right hon. Gentleman, during his speech of some length, did not attempt to say it was. We are as anxious as he is that if this can be brought out it will be brought out.<br/>
I said a few moments ago that the amount received for the sale will, in any event, appear in the accounts of the Agency which are dealt with under the following Clause. There is no intention whatever to conceal any relevant fact, and the right hon. Gentleman knows perfectly well that accounts of this sort are generally extremely full and detailed. We have no intention whatever of concealing any relevant facts particularly because I think that those facts, when deployed, as well as informing the public, will also show how wrong the right hon. Gentleman has been in a number of prophecies in which he has indulged tonight.</p>

<p>I shall not keep the Committee for more than a minute, but I was fascinated by the mental processes of the Financial Secretary. He swallows camel after camel and then he strains at a little gnat like this. He arrived at &#x00A3;150 million by a process of calculation which I can only describe as rather inspired and detailed, and now apparently he end his Department are so old-fashioned that they find it impossible to prepare accounts which will compare the previous prices of these companies or other assets with the necessary adjustments and alterations in the intervening years. I simply cannot see any difficulty&#x2014;[<i>Interruption</i>.] I think the hon. Member for Heeley (Mr. P. Roberts) has something valuable to say.</p>

<p>The hon. Member is a trifle literally-minded. He seems to consider that minutes have a certain relativity.<br/>
All I want to say is that the Financial Secretary has given his reasons and most hon. Members of the Committee themselves see good and sufficient reasons for something of this sort being done. Surely the hon. Gentleman or his Department are underrating themselves if they say that they cannot do anything of the sort</p>

<p>All that the hon. Gentleman has to do is compare, over a comparatively short period of years, the capital account of one year and the capital account of the next year, which is a matter of course year by year for any company. He has got to make a proper allowance in each year for increased liabilities, assets and the like. He has, in fact, to make the necessary adjustments and alterations, and at the end of it he will be able to present his accounts in a form which will give the ordinary member of the public the answer to the question that he is asking, namely. are the Government selling public property at a loss or are they not?</p>

<p>The Financial Secretary ought not to take refuge behind the usual excuse of administrative or, in this case accounting impossibility in order to defend himself from answering that question.

<p>There can be no doubt that the fuller development of the resources of the British Commonwealth would bring untold benefits to the whole world. Many of these resources have already been recognised and developed.<br/>
In India and Pakistan, we have all the world's jute, in Canada four-fifths of the world's nickel, in the sterling area of the Commonwealth three-quarters of the world's tea, half its wool, half its chrome, cocoa, one-third of hard hemps, quarter of the coal and copper, and one-fifth of the wheat, bauxite, woodpulp and lead. All of these are now being produced, but, in addition to that, there are so many other resources of which we have not got full information and into which a fuller and proper investigation should be made. We already know of copper in Northern Rhodesia, the extra zinc and lead in Australia and Nigeria, extra bauxite for aluminium in the Gold Coast and Malaya, iron ore deposits in Canada, oil prospecting in Trinidad and North Borneo, and we all know of the timber resources of Canada.<br/>
Lengthy as this list is, so far it is only scratching the surface of Commonwealth resources, but these materials and many others are very important in these days of extended civilisation, if one could use that term. At a time when these resources are so badly wanted, the question must arise in all our minds why the development of these primary products does not proceed more rapidly, and we know that there are several factors which stand in the way when answering this question.<br/>
The first is the cost. If we are to develop them, these products must be developed at an economic price, and not at prices which are above the world price. The second point we have to consider is politics. The Dominions today are independent countries, and the Colonial Territories themselves almost every day are becoming more and more independent. We cannot tell them, as we

did in the past, that they have got to develop. They must accept it as a natural economic domestic policy as well, because we shall need their co-operation. It is not now just a matter of arranging royalties. We must have local support for such matters as public services, schools and roads, which today run alongside such development. Of course, the other part that has to be considered is that there must be no threat of nationalisation as soon as the projects show that they are likely to pay.<br/>
The third point is the question of markets, the fixing of long-term markets, and the fourth that of capital. We all received with great joy the announcement by the Chancellor a few weeks ago that we are considering spending a good deal of money in getting some of these developments on the way.<br/>
Those are four factors which we must keep in mind when we consider opening up greater developments, each of which could occupy many hours of thoughtful investigation. But the fifth factor&#x2014;the one to which I wish to refer tonight&#x2014;is the question of manpower, the human factor and the outstanding factor as far as the Dominions are concerned.<br/>
There have been many arguments about which came first, the chicken or the egg. But on this subject there is no argument at all; if we want these projects brought to fruition for the use of the world, we must first have the manpower in the right place.<br/>
I emphasise emigration to the Dominions because in the self-governing Dominions the labour force is far from adequate and the normal increase in population does not keep pace with the development potentialities. In the Colonies we know that the labour exists, but that the people need education and training. In other Eastern parts of the Commonwealth they have more manpower than they want; indeed, they are thinking of asking parts of their populations to leave their countries.<br/>
The difficulty is tied up with the immigration laws of the Dominions, which show preference for white immigrants, and these laws, as they affect part of the Empire countries, form one of the domestic irritations that we have to face inside the Dominions. But there can be no doubt that the development of the British Commonwealth will


be of great benefit to the whole world, and it is no mere British self-interest when we say that we want these resources made quickly available during this period of conflict between Russian Communism, on the one hand, and Western democracy on the other.<br/>
As far as the Empire countries are concerned, it will result in a higher standard of life, and I believe it will make a great contribution if we can get these resources in hand quickly and can let the dictators of the Left see that we have the strength and the power to resist their trends for world dictatorship.<br/>
As far as the Dominions are concerned, we can only approach this problem by at once recognising that we have to face a more worth-while scale of transference of population from the older civilisations and older industrial areas of Europe and this country, where we have not the same primary potentialities, to the new areas, where they have all the potentialities but are short of manpower.<br/>
On the one side, we have Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and the Rhodesias which have vast resources and low white populations, whereas on the other we have the Commonwealth countries without these resources and with abundant manpower. We have to face the fact that we can only consider the transference of populations within the framework of the existing immigration policies of the various countries. It is a fact that the self-governing Dominions prefer the white immigrant. They will take some of the others in a lesser proportion, but their need is for people from the white countries rather from any of the others.<br/>
I think we should be wasting our time if we tried to persuade the Dominions&#x2014;and it would be wrong to try to the detriment of quick action&#x2014;to alter this policy which is ingrained in their local reactions and is an integral part of their local laws. That means that if we are to move populations within the framework of these immigration laws, the immigrants can only come either from Europe or this country. This country is still the head of this great Commonwealth, and we should have a special interest in seeing to it that there is a steady flow of people from this country who understand the Commonwealth and

its traditions and whose roots are in the beginnings of the Commonwealth which we all want to keep intact as far as we can.<br/>
We must remember also that today we have it from the Immigration Minister of Australia that it is much more expensive to have immigrants from this country than from some European countries. Taking Australia as an example, it is six times more expensive to have immigrants from this country than it is to have trained artisans from Germany, and more than four times more expensive to have immigrants from this country than to have trained farmers from Holland. If we recognise that, we must see that the economic pull to the Dominions to take their immigrants from Europe is very strong.<br/>
We must face that by starting in this country a more energetic emigration policy. We must bring some inspiration into it. We must put over some really worth-while sales propaganda, and the policy must have worth-while support from whatever Government is in office here. The bare minimum of immigration within the Commonwealth should never fall below 250,000 a year. I am not saying that that is a satisfactory figure. It should be more, but it should never be less. At least 150,000 of those 250,000 should go out from this country and, whatever the eventual total attained, the immigration should be in that proportion. We should see that 150,000 of the 250,000 people going out to our great British Dominions are people from this country who are part of the Commonwealth, who understand it and have a feeling for the traditions that went to build it.<br/>
I believe that of necessity the Government must play the biggest part in bringing this about. I appeal to the Under-Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations to get on as speedily as possible with putting the Empire Settlement Scheme in good trim. We should have on the board of that scheme people who are virile, who feel keenly on the problem and who will not just meet regularly and receive reports and pass innocuous resolutions on them, but will get together and frame a policy and try to work out an answer to the problem.<br/>
We should see whether the Dominions will accept the various social service


schemes of this country and whether we can export prefabricated houses to house our people when they go overseas. We should see whether we can bring vision and inspiration into the arrangement of transport as we did in wartime. All these things can flow from the board of the Empire Settlement Scheme if we get the right people on it and they are assured of the support of the Government in being allowed to spend appropriate sums of money to bring the scheme into action.<br/>
We have little time to do all this. Unless in the next 15 years we secure a proportion of 150,000 emigrants out of a total of 250,000 yearly, we shall find that a balance of thought and of citizenship will grow up in the Dominions which will not be British in the sense that we know it today. If that happens it will not be a case of the British Commonwealth falling apart, but, if we do not do these things, of the British Empire simply fading away.<br/>
I ask the Under-Secretary to make every effort to ensure that we show good sense, inspiration and virility in seeing that the British emigrant is accepted in countries which have a long British tradition. If we do that now, I believe that in that peaceful way, which is a normal way, we shall be able to keep within the Commonwealth countries the sort of cooperation which we must have if we are to get these resources and, having got them, to keep them for the peaceful uses which we in this country have always had as the background of our civilisation.</p>

<p>I should like to congratulate the hon. Member for Peterborough (Mr. H. Nicholls) on keeping the eyes of the Under-Secretary of State on the subject of this debate. In certain quarters it is a somewhat uncomfortable subject, and the tendency has been to put it in a pigeon-hole and forget it. The hon. Member can draw upon his experience at last year's Commonwealth Conference at Ottawa, at which he made a contribution to the debate on migration. I should like, in general, to support what he has said, and the figures he has given for over-all migration from this country and Europe to the Commonwealth.<br/>
He has said all that is necessary about British migration. I think it must be preponderant, if possible; but we must not

forget the contribution which Europeans can make, for it is important. They have certain gifts which we may not possess. They may stand a hot climate better than we do. The Maltese and Italians have made a considerable contribution to the development of Queensland. I am disappointed that the Government will not associate themselves with the work of the Inter-Governmental Committee for European Migration. We have withdrawn the pean Migration. We have withdrawn our support of the I.R.O., although it is doing very fine work, mainly financed by American capital. I feel that we ought to be associated with that organisation.<br/>
I should like to support the hon. Member's request that an Overseas Settlement Board, or Empire Settlement Board, shall be set up as soon as possible. There is work for it to do now. Migration from this country to the Commonwealth, particularly to Australia, has not been negligible since the war. Large numbers have gone there, and Australia has strained her resources to the utmost to receive them. As a result there have been, in certain cases, problems for the migrants and for the Australian Government. I feel that such a body, which could study problems on the ground, and at home, would have a valuable part to play in ironing out the difficulties of a major migration scheme.</p>

<p>I should like to add a few words in support of what has been said. I wish we could impress on the Government the importance of this subject. It seems to me that we have been asking far too long for an Empire Settlement Board to be set up. I hope that when the Under-Secretary replies he will be able to tell us that he is on the way to setting up a board. We are not facing up to the position in this country. The world was not made for us to maintain so many empty spaces as part of the British Commonwealth. If we do not fill up some of these empty spaces, which will stand a white population, then they will be filled up by someone else. I think that others are entitled to go to those places if we do not make the best of our opportunity.<br/>
I look upon the matter from the point of view of defence. In two world wars we have exhausted a great deal of


strength in keeping open a life-line. We ought to do away with the need to do that by spreading our population across the world, particularly in Central Africa and Australia. There we have two great countries which have not been scratched so far as development is concerned, and which are clamouring for development. If we do not develop them we cannot maintain that we can hold them against the Asiatic over-spill which is taking place at present.<br/>
This country is living in a fool's paradise in imagining that it is maintaining the Welfare State by itself. In fact, we are keeping up the Welfare State because we are exploiting the mineral wealth of our Empire. I want to see not only our population but our industries go out into those spaces and develop the mineral wealth that exists there. It is not fair that we should take from Central Africa so much of its wealth when we have a vast number of people who could form the labour force in Africa. We should like to see not only some of our people but some of our industries going out to help in developing our Commonwealth.<br/>
I hope the Government will have talks with our great Commonwealth nations to find out what they want from us, so that we can fit in their requirements, and I hope that when the Empire Settlement Board is set up it will be composed, as my hon. Friend said, of really live members who will not just meet once or twice a year and issue a report but will take active steps.</p>

<p>The subject of emigration is always one on which the Members of the House in the different parties show a very welcome degree of unanimity. I am very glad that my hon. Friends and the hon. Member for Nottingham, Central (Mr. Ian Winterbottom) have not brought up the case for emigration on the ground that large transfers of population will be necessary in order to reduce the total population of these islands so that there will be less overcrowding. They have put it entirely on the right ground, I think, that the spaces in the independent Commonwealth countries are, compared with other parts

of this world, under-developed and under-populated, and that it is very desirable that, so to speak, a blood transfusion should take place from this country to those independent countries.<br/>
Having said that, of course one has to bear in mind the limitations which must necessarily be put upon the rate at which this is done. That is one of those debatable matters&#x2014;exactly where the line is; but we have seen in the last few months the difficulties which Australia has encountered when migration out-steps the capital development which must accompany this rate of migration. That sort of problem is one which can eminently well be put before the Migration Board, when it is set up, for it to discuss in all its aspects.<br/>
I am very glad to be able to say the Government have definitely decided to set up a migration board&#x2014;I am not giving it its official title; it may turn out to have a different title when officially set up&#x2014;but to set up a board dealing with migration which will have wide terms of reference, and which will, I am sure, be composed of virile, imaginative members. The stage we have reached is that we are deciding on the terms of reference, and letters are going out to persons we think would be suitable to sit on this board to see if they would accept this task. I very much hope they will. As my hon. Friend the Member for Peterborough (Mr. H. Nicholls) said, it is a subject which is very inspiring and of which the problems are very difficult, and concerning which the Government, I feel would be very much assisted by a board which has the leisure and expert knowledge to study those problems.</p>

<p>Yes. If I guess rightly the right hon. Gentleman's unspoken thought in his question, I think he will be satisfied that we shall draw them from all sections and classes of the community, having regard, for example, to a particular subject with which the board is intended to deal. We also think that this board should have the fullest assistance from Her Majesty's Government in the way of access to figures and statistics and also advice or representation as to fact from officials of the Departments concerned. The Ministry of Labour will, I think, supply one of the secretaries and the Commonwealth Relations Office the other. We think that would be a good division, because the Minister of Labour has a special responsibility in acting so to speak as an agency for Commonwealth countries.</p>

<p>It is a very important statement that the Under-Secretary is making. Are we now to understand that there is to be a board set up with full Government backing, composed of experts subject to Government approval, on all matters relating to migration, whose terms of reference will be the organisation and encouragement of migration, and that board will be entitled to enter into informal negotiations with Commonwealth Governments on this subject? This is one of the most important announcements we have had in this House for weeks.</p>

<p>I do not think what the hon. Member said is correct as an implication which could be drawn from my statement. It has not been said what the exact terms of reference would be. In my own personal opinion I do not think such a board could act in more than an advisory capacity. It would not be possible to empower a board to enter into negotiations with the Commonwealth countries.</p>

<p>No, not even informal. Again expressing my own private opinion, I think the board should have access to anything it desires. It is an advisory board and it is common sense that if it wants some information, an official should

come forward and give it. We must assume that the board will be composed of people of common sense and also that the Government will act in common sense the other way. I do not anticipate the board asking for information the Government do not wish to give.<br/>
I agree with the hon. Member for Bilston (Mr. Nally) that this is an important statement. I think it is an important step forward, reviving the Migration Board which existed before 1939, and which I think, from its report, did do an important piece of work in advising the Government of the day. It is due to the representations of hon. Members of the House on both sides that the subject was examined, and the Government came to the conclusion that this method should be adopted and that it was worth while re-establishing the board. I hope it will be set up fairly soon with wide terms of reference, but not terms of reference which would entitle it to enter into negotiations, either formally or informally.<br/>
In regard to the statement about Mr. Holt, the Commonwealth countries are meeting the demand of many of the Governments of Europe for outlets for their population, and we should respect them for that. I agree with the hon. Member for Nottingham, Central that this should be so. At the same time we agree that there should be a large proportion of British migration and, in the years since the war, there have been 700,000 migrations altogether of which about half&#x2014;about 350,000&#x2014;were from British ports. As the hon. Member for Peterborough said, the British migration costs are six times as high as the European costs, because in the case of European workers the larger proportion is paid by the European country. This is understandable because their particular problem about migration is over-population, and it does not mean that in British migration there has been an obstacle because of cost. The extra cost has been taken up by the Australian Government.</p>
