<p>When the Secretary of State meets the general council, will he concede that, from the evidence of the local election results and the results of the System 3 opinion poll that have been made available to us today, the people of Scotland want no part of this Government's policies? Will the right hon. and learned Gentleman align himself with members of the Cabinet and some of the senior Conservative Back Benchers who are asking for a change in policy? Is he aware that in Motherwell there is 22 per cent. unemployment? Will he show some compassion for the unemployed in Scotland, and in Motherwell in particular?</p>

<p>I doubt whether the STUC will wish to discuss local elections or the System 3 opinion polls. As to unemployment, since the Conservative Government came into office the regional seletive assistance provided by the Government has helped to create 2,977 new jobs in Motherwell, and the Motherwell project, to which the Government-funded Scottish Development Agency contributes, has helped to create a further 2,000 new jobs. The hon. Gentleman will be fair enough to acknowledge that the Government, both directly and indirectly, have made an important contribution towards job creation in his constituency.</p>

<p>In his discussions with the STUC, will my right hon. and learned Friend bear in mind the problems facing the oil rig construction yards in Scotland? In particular, will he do what he can to ensure an even and fair distribution of work among the yards in Scotland at this anxious time?</p>

<p>My hon. Friend is right to draw attention to the concern that we feel about the possible implications for oil rig construction of the oil companies' plans. I use

every opportunity to press on them the fact that any investment made now will be for a return over the next 10 to 15 years, and so they should base their plans on what is likely to happen to oil prices over that time and not indulge in a panic reaction to current short-term fluctuations in the price of oil.</p>

<p>Further to the question from the hon. Member for Moray (Mr. Pollock), when the Secretary of State meets the STUC, will he, thinking of my constituency interest and that of the hon. Member's, pay attention to the responsible and constructive efforts that the STUC has been making? Will he ensure that whichever yard, be it Ardersier of Nigg, wins the. Shell Eider contract, the Government will do everything humanly possible to ensure that as much as possible of the subcontracted work associated with the contract goes to the unsuccessful yard? Is he aware that the social impact for the yard that loses will be devastating, given the levels of unemployment in our respective constituencies?</p>

<p>I share the hon. Gentleman's concern to ensure the maximum work for both yards, and the whole House would wish to see that. There are major constraints on any Government in terms of directing individual items of work to a particular yard, but one hopes that the end result will involve a suitable work load for both yards.</p>

<p>Does my right hon. and learned Friend agree that one of the most significant economic trends is that Scotland has moved from being one of the lowest paid to one of the wealthiest areas in the United Kingdom, during which period the United Kingdom has enjoyed five years of continuous economic growth?</p>

<p>My hon. Friend is correct. Outside the south-east of England and East Anglia, Scotland has a higher income and gross domestic product per capita than almost any other part of the United Kingdom, and that is not a claim that could have been made in 1979.</p>

<p>When the right hon. and learned Gentleman meets the STUC, the general council will be able to tell him that coal production at some Scottish pits will cease. Will the right hon. and learned Gentleman tell us when his Department authorised the South of Scotland Electricity Board to place the Scottish mining industry in this peril?</p>

<p>At no time. The South of Scotland Electricity Board acts under statutory powers and determines what is appropriate in the interests of the consumers whom it is designed to serve. At no time does it either seek or require authorisation from the Scottish Office for any such decisions.</p>

<p>When my right hon. and learned Friend next meets the STUC, will he draw to its attention the fact that inflation is now at its lowest level for many decades and that with inflation standing at 3 per cent. wage increases and demands in excess of that are likely to put more jobs at risk and in peril if we are to remain competitive? Will my right hon. and learned Friend also draw its attention to how popular he personally is north Tayside and to the fact that we are looking forward to his visit on 21 June and that his popularity was probably reflected in the good results that we had in the regional elections?</p>

<p>I am certainly looking forward to my visit to my hon. Friend's constituency on 21 June. I can


think of no better way of spending my birthday than in my hon. Friend's constituency. With regard to my forthcoming meeting with the STUC, one of the points that I shall certainly be mentioning to them, in addition to the comments made by my hon. Friend, is that over 50,000 more people are in employment in Scotland today than there were in 1983 at the time of the last general election.</p>

<p>If the Minister is so confident about employment, what does he intend to do about Springburn? The railway works have suffered a terrible blow during the last week. To add insult to injury, there is an apprentice training school on those premises which has machinery and equipment to cater for 110 apprentices. Not one apprentice has been trained there during the past 18 months. The padlock has been put on the door. That is a ridiculous situation in the engineering capital of Scotland. The west of Scotland should be training young engineers if the economy is to take a turn for the better.</p>

<p>I share the hon. Gentleman's concern about the implications for the Springburn employees. He will be aware that that arises out of decisions that affected a number of similar establishments in various parts of the United Kingdom. With regard to his particular question about the training of the young, he will be aware of the enormous resources that the Government are pouring into youth training. Over &#x00A3;1 billion is being spent on youth training. This is helping to provide very appropriate training, which is enabling more than 60 per cent. of the youngsters who get this training to go immediately into full-time employment at the end of their training period. That is something which no previous Government have done.</p>

<p>On the wider economic aspects, I can assure the hon. Gentleman that there is no question of any university facing closure. My right hon. Friend the then Secretary of State for Education and Science made it clear that the Government were prepared to consider further resources for the university sector. That is a matter that the universities will wish to take into account.</p>

<p>When my right hon. and learned Friend meets the STUC, will he take the opportunity to ask it to condemn the unilateral action taken by the new Socialist administration on the Lothian regional council in reducing dramatically expenditure on Scottish infrastructure by cancelling the Lothian relief road and thus destroying jobs in Scotland?</p>

<p>It is certainly of interest that the first significant decision of the new controlling group on the Lothian regional council was to announce a major cut in public expenditure, which therefore removed the prospect of many jobs being created.</p>

<p>If the Secretary of State is so concerned about levels of public spending, is he in a position to give the STUC a guarantee that the Scottish Office budget will not be affected by the rather primitive and much advertised approach to housing finance of the new Secretary of State for the Environment? Will he also recognise that, despite the somewhat comic opera loyalty of those on the Benches behind him, there is a growing fear in Scotland about the level of unemployment and that the Scottish economy has reached a point of no return? Will he recall that he has had an approach from the Strathclyde regional council, and I think also from the STUC, which supports the initiative, arguing the case for an economic summit where all parts of Scottish life&#x2014;academic, industrial, and, no doubt, political&#x2014;can discuss the need for a change of direction to recover the situation? May we have a positive response to that appeal and, if so, when will it come?</p>

<p>I frankly doubt whether proposals for a summit are likely to prove a sensible way forward, but I am always interested to hear any constructive suggestions either from the regional council or the STUC, which will be coming to see me on 20 June, or any other bodies. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that the allocation of resources to the Scottish Office stems directly from a formula system. Indeed, if I recall correctly, that formula system was introduced under the previous Labour Government.</p>

<p>Does the Minister agree that the most important thing that the Secretary of State could discuss with the chairmen of the new towns is employment, particularly the protection of employment, and job creation in new towns? Does he also agree that the urgency for that is underlined by recent events in my constituency where the largest departmental store, Woolco, is now to close with a loss of 181 jobs?

<p>Obviously the provision of jobs is an important matter, and my right hon. and learned Friend will be discussing that issue. However, the hon. Gentleman is less than fair in suggesting that the new towns have done badly. Between May 1979 and April 1986, &#x00A3;110 million has been invested in the new towns, leading to 23,747 new jobs. In Cumbernauld in the hon. Gentleman's constituency over the past year 43 new companies have come about, 19 local firms have expanded and there are 800 new jobs there, with a promise of 800 more to come. I hope that the hon.

<p>Is my hon. Friend prepared to follow the excellent example given in England, where there has been a process of winding up the development corporations and

<p>I understand what my hon. Friend says. The present policy envisages new towns in Scotland being wound up when their populations reach a certain figure, but no corporation will begin to wind up before 1 April, 1990 and the position will be reviewed in 1989. Our current policy is that the new towns' remaining housing stock should on wind up be transferred to district councils, but if the new towns come forward with proposals for disposing of that in other ways, we would give those consideration.</p>

<p>I am advised by the Scottish electricity boards that, excluding oil-fired capacity held in reserve, the maximum available sent-out capacity of the Scottish generation system is 8,839 MW. The maximum simultaneous demand ever recorded was 6,341 MW during the severe winter of 1981&#x2013;82.</p>

<p>The Government are in no haste to do anything &#x2014; <i>[Interruption.]</i> A well-known phrase or saying is "act in haste and repent at leisure", which I am happy to confirm. The hon. Gentleman should realise that the British nuclear industry has a superb safety record. He should appreciate that in the past 30 years there has not been one significant incident anywhere in the United Kingdom involving danger to the health or life of the public.

<p>Does my right hon. and learned Friend agree that Scotland has a great deal of knowledge and practical experience of nuclear energy &#x2014; indeed, as much as anyone&#x2014;and that it has been put to very good use by the South of Scotland Electricity Board in the construction of the station at Torness, not least with regard to public safety? However, will my right hon. and learned Friend take steps to counter the current unease about nuclear power, following the disaster in Russia, by tapping that knowledge and experience in Scotland, not just in the SSEB, but among industrialists and academics, so that they may better inform the public and put aside some of the fears that people feel at this time?</p>

<p>Of course, my hon. Friend is absolutely correct. Understandable concern has arisen out of the Chernobyl incident. I believe that the correct policy to pursue, which the Scottish Office and the Government as a whole pursue, is the maximum disclosure of all information and the maximum utilisation of any new information that is available, which will enhance even further the extremely high safety standards that we already have. That is an ongoing process. It is right and proper that everything possible should be done to ensure that the public are aware that the maximum safety standards are available, and that all information which is relevant is always disclosed, so that the public can come to a considered judgment on those matters.</p>

<p>Does the Secretary of State accept that Chernobyl has changed matters and that there is an overwhelming view in Scotland that we should reduce our dependence on civil nuclear power? If the Government are not prepared to do that, will the right hon. and learned Gentleman give an assurance that the Government will not prevent the next Government from doing so, by closing down coal production capacity?

<p>The hon. Gentleman will be aware that the level of coal production will depend on several factors, including demand. The SSEB may have a requirement for increased coal consumption over the years to come, irrespective of what happens to the existing nuclear power stations. The hon. Gentleman and his colleagues often press upon the Government the need to help industry. He must be aware that if we ceased to use civil nuclear power in Scotland, the electricity tariffs for industry in Scotland,

as well as for consumers, would go up dramatically. It has been suggested that increases of between 25 and 30 per cent. in the electricity tariffs would be required if we ceased to use all civil nuclear power in Scotland.</p>

<p>Does the right hon. and learned Gentleman accept that that gross overcapacity of electricity in Scotland, arising partly from nuclear power, might cause further embarrassment shortly if the French dump cheap electricity in England, which would do away with 1,000 MW currently being exported from Scotland to England? Does the right hon. and learned Gentleman accept the consequences for Scottish mining, where demand has been cut almost to one quarter in recent years?

<p>If the right hon. Gentleman is concerned about the capacity of the French to export their electicity on a competitive basis, he might like to reflect that France has a higher level of civil nuclear power than almost any other European country.

<p>Will my right hon. and learned Friend make every effort to make it clear to the people of Scotland that the Opposition's policies on nuclear power would result in higher electricity bills for consumers, making it more difficult for pensioners to heat their homes?

<p>Not only are there double standards, but there appears to be a deep gulf between the representations that have been made today and the reported comments of the leader of the Labour party, who indicated an assumption that Torness would go ahead, and that it would be unwise or unreasonable to assume anything to the contrary.

<p>Like the Minister, I accept that the first and overriding priority in this matter must be public safety. Does the Secretary of State recognise that there are fears about the implications of the expansion of nuclear power in Scotland? That point has been made by a number of his own Back Benchers during Question Time. Will he consider making available a document setting out the Government's best estimate of the impact on other forms of energy and on the industries that produce them, especially the impact on coal and the SSEB coal burn? Will he also consider whether he should at rather more length deploy the arguments which support the figure of an increase of 25 or 30 per cent. in electricity costs if we were to reduce our dependency on nuclear power, which some of us think is a surprisingly high figure? In such a paper, will he deal with the arguments that many people will take from the figures that he gave at the beginning of this exchange about capacity, the peak of demand last winter and the apparent sufficiency of the present levels of nuclear generating capacity in Scotland?</p>

<p>The results of the surveys will be made known as soon as they are available. The hon. Gentleman knows perfectly well that one of the difficulties especially relevant in the Lothian region about the maintenance of certain buildings is that the local authorities have insisted on retaining far more surplus school capacity than is justified by the number of pupils. If local authorities insist on maintaining half empty school buildings, not only does that mean that resources have to be diverted to the heating and maintenance of these half empty buildings, but it denies proper educational opportunities to pupils in some of these schools. Such opportunities cannot be made available in a school that is only half full. Local authorities throughout Scotland have to bear in mind that resources are much better utilised on school books and on facilities of that kind than on the maintenance of more buildings than they need.</p>

We require a fundamental review&#x2014;part of which my right hon. and learned Friend will agree is under way at the moment regarding teachers' pay and conditions&#x2014;of how we practise education in all its different ways in Scotland in order to get rid of the genuine anxiety that is felt by many people.

<p>In view of the answer that the Secretary of State gave to my hon.

<p>That was a rather predictable question. The hon.

The hon. Gentleman is intelligent enough to be aware that if there is a surplus of 230,000 places&#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i> This is arithmetic, which I am sure the hon. Gentleman will appreciate. If there is a surplus of 230,000 places and the number of school buildings is not reduced by a proportionate amount, a lot of resources will be wasted when they could be better used to provide good education for children.

<p>I appreciate the anxiety on this matter. The hon. Gentleman knows that there are different points of view in Fife about the board's future building programme.

That is not helped by the higher rating of new premises that have come on stream since 1979. I am aware of the need to make a decision, but I am equally aware of the need to make the correct decision and to consider the position in Kirkcaldy before making a final decision.</p>

In view of the Chernobyl incident and the fact that, once commissioned, the plant will at some stage have to be decommissioned, with all that that entails in relation to the production of nuclear waste, and in view of current oil prices, would it not be better to bring Inverkip out of mothballs and keep Torness in mothballs?</p>

There are still local authorities in Scotland which intend to spend more in real terms than they were spending in 1979.

<p>Yes, I can confirm that matters have not changed and that the policy has not been altered since my hon. and learned Friend had these responsibilities. Not everyone is involved if it is only a matter of a possible breach of disciplinary code within the police. Furthermore, if it is a complaint which clearly has no substance, it is not reported to Crown counsel or

to one of the Law Officers. Otherwise, as I said, a considerable number of complaints are personally examined by me or by my noble and learned Friend the Lord Advocate.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman has me at a loss. I am not able to tell hum immediately what the Greenock and Port Glasgow figures are, and I cannot tell him how many of them resulted in disciplinary proceedings, because the pursuit of disciplinary proceedings would be a matter for the assistant chief constable and the chief constable rather than my self.

<p>Does my hon. and learned Friend accept that while one wants to see complaints made against the police properly and fully investigated, it is equally important, when frivolous or malicious complaints are made, that the full rigour of the law is taken against people who distract the police and other officers of justice from their proper duties?</p>

<p>Yes, indeed. The policy is clear. If at some stage it is identified that the complaint is in any way malicious or is a wilful effort to waste the time of the police, often to secure a balance, proceedings are taken against those who make the malicious complaints.</p>

<p>In October 1983 I announced that the Government accepted the recommendations of the NHS management inquiry, under the chairmanship of Sir Roy Griffiths, that general management should be introduced into the NHS, and that a board should be set up within my Department to be responsible to Ministers for the Department's functions in relation to the management of the NHS.<br/>
Mr. Victor Paige took up appointment as chairman of the board, and as second permanent secretary within my Department, on 2 January 1985. His contract was for three years. The board was established in April 1985 and contains members drawn from business, the National Health Service and the Civil Service. Mr. Paige has paid tribute to the abilities of the Board and the progress the board has already made. I should like to express my thanks to Mr. Paige for his part in that progress.<br/>
I confirm that substantial improvements have already been made in the efficient management of the NHS. Those achievements reflect great credit on the Health Service itself, including authorities, managers and staff, and on the direction and leadership which the service has had from my Department.<br/>
As the House will be aware, Mr. Paige has resigned his position as chairman of the management board. He discussed his intention with me, and we agreed that it would be right for him to stand down. I have published in full the exchange of letters between us in which Mr. Paige explained his reasons. There is nothing that I can add to what he has said and my reply. I have therefore appointed Mr. Len Peach, who is the board's director of personnel on secondment from IBM, as acting chairman of the board. I shall make a substantive appointment as soon as possible.<br/>
The Government remain fully committed to better management of the National Health Service. I have every confidence that, under the leadership of the management board, health authorities and their general managers will continue to ensure that more and better care is provided for patients and that the best value for money is obtained.</p>

<p>The statement raises more questions than it answers.<br/>
Will the Secretary of State tell the House precisely why Mr. Paige gave up his &#x00A3;70,000 a year job in mid-contract? Did he jump, or was he pushed? Was he pressed for too many or too few cuts? Does his departure leave in tatters the policy of bringing private bosses into the National Health Service? Is it true that, in the past two months, three similar appointees have resigned as district managers &#x2014; three out of the 25 outsiders? Is it true that the business genius who was appointed to head an audit into value for money in the NHS has just gone bankrupt to the tune of &#x00A3;300,000?<br/>
Does the Secretary of State agree that his policy is wrong, or is it just that he is a bad judge of people? Will


he now appoint someone from the thousands who have made the NHS their life's work and not appoint another rank outsider with no staying power? Will he ensure that the new person uses the National Health Service instead of relying on the private sector?</p>

<p>I do not accept what the hon. Gentleman has said. Mr. Paige set out the reasons in his letter. I do not think that there would be much point in my trying to interpret further what he said. There was no question of disagreement about resources. We have 750 general managers in post, and two or three have left. That shows the confidence in the concept of general management. I think that the hon. Gentleman will concede that Mr. Paige himself endorsed the concept of general management.<br/>
Substantial achievements have already been made. Indeed, &#x00A3;150 million of cost improvements have been made. The concept of identifying one person as being responsible and accountable for ensuring that decisions are made and that action is taken can only be right. We have no intention whatever of turning our backs on the general management concept. That concept is in the interest of the Health Service, and it is about time that the hon. Gentleman supported it.</p>

<p>Although one regrets Mr. Paige's departure, is not the important point that the concept of general management is now sufficiently well established &#x2014; notwithstanding Mr. Paige's decision to go&#x2014;and that very few people, other than one or two Opposition Members, would want to return to the old idea of a bloated bureaucracy? Does my right hon. Friend concede that, if any lesson is to be learnt, it is perhaps that Mr. Paige's successor should be given even more support, if that is possible, in standing up to the vested interests in the NHS, who have no interest in the NHS running on a commercial basis?</p>

<p>There is much truth in that, and particularly in my hon. Friend's opening remarks. The general management concept is accepted in the NHS. As the Institute of Health Service Management has said in a statement made during the past 24 hours, general management is beginning to work very well, and the NHS will provide better quality care and value for money as a result. That is why general management is important, and that is why it will and should continue.</p>

<p>Irrespective of one's view about the principles of general management, is there not widespread concern about the way that it is being implemented?

<p>No, I do not think that that is necessary. The managment board is carrying out an important job. It continues in post, although obviously with the exception of Mr. Paige. and it will continue to do its work. Mr. Len Peach, the acting chairman, comes from outside industry, and is a man of enormous experience. I believe that the management board will establish itself and will continue to achieve great things for the NHS.</p>

<p>Does my right hon. Friend agree that management by committee cannot

be very effective? Does he further agree that trying to manage by consensus must lead to inefficiency? Surely it is high time that we returned to a system of one person in a hospital being responsible for all management.

The Griffiths report recognised that complexity, and Mr. Paige's achievement has been that he has taken the management process to stage one and, in particular, to the stage when general managers have been appointed almost entirely throughout the country.</p>

<p>Is the Secretary of State aware that, while people may not care too much either way about Mr. Paige, they are aware that there is insufficient funding of the National Health Service resulting in continued cuts, lengthy waiting lists and closures? Is he also aware that there is no lack of understanding on the part of the public regarding the Conservative party's attitude to the NHS? It has no genuine commitment to the NHS, and it would not stay in power for five minutes were it not for electoral reasons.</p>

<p>There is nothing in the resignation of Mr. Paige to do with the question of more resources. The attitude of the Conservative Government to the Health Service is shown by the fact that we are spending &#x00A3;18&#x00B7;75 billion on the Health Service, which is a 24 per cent. real increase on what the last Labour Government spent.</p>

<p>Will my right hon. Friend take on board Mr. Paige's two comments about improving employees' commitment and the importance of management education?

<p>Do not the terms of Mr. Victor Paige's resignation letter to the Secretary of State make abundantly clear the Government's absolute folly when they decided to implement the Griffiths report wholesale and appoint 750 general managers throughout the country, creating this new edifice of which Mr. Victor Paige was the top point, without bothering to test the Griffiths report in pilot schemes in different health authorities throughout the country?<br/>
As the Secretary of State has laid such emphasis on the need for general management and lines of responsibility, does he not feel that what comes through loud and clear from this resignation is that, instead of decisions being taken in the front line, they were being referred more and more up the line to the Elephant and Castle and that they were falling victim to personalities and politics there?</p>

<p>No, I do not think that that is the case. The concept of general management is that decisions should go down the line to the hospital and to the districts, and that is what is taking place. I have heard before what the hon. Gentleman has said about pilot schemes, but I do not think that that is a very sensible way of introducing the concept of general management into the Health Service. I certainly do not think that if we had done it that way we should have secured anything like the cost improvements that we have managed to secure under the plans and policies that we have implemented.</p>

<speech hansard_id="414239" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1986-06-04a.903.1" hansard_membership_id="5622" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/15930" speakername="The Minister for Health (Mr. Barney Hayhoe)" colnum="903" time="15:52:00">
<p>With permission, Mr. Speaker, I will make a statement about the first report of the Badenoch committee of inquiry into the outbreak of legionnaire's disease in Stafford.<br/>
The outbreak at Stafford district general hospital occurred in April 1985: 101 patients caught the disease and there were 28 deaths. This was the second most serious incident ever recorded, surpassed only by the outbreak in Pennsylvania in 1976 from which the disease was first recognised. The source of infection was traced to the air conditioning system. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Services appointed a statutory public inquiry on 7 June 1985, chaired by Sir John Badenoch.<br/>
The inquiry has produced a first report covering the Stafford outbreak and has also made recommendations more generally about hospital air conditioning systems. The inquiry will now consider and make recommendations on action to reduce the possibility of future outbreaks, whether in hospitals, other buildings or elsewhere, and the Government expect to receive this second report around the turn of the year. The first report concludes that, on present knowledge, the outbreak at Stafford cannot be attributed to any single factor, nor does it hold any individual or group directly responsible. It points out that legionnaire's disease has only recently been identified and is not well understood. The report refers to a combination of circumstances which appear to have contributed to this outbreak.<br/>
These circumstances include defects in the design and construction of engineering services, problems during the commissioning of the air conditioning plant, lack of knowledge and understanding of the sophisticated engineering plant, shortcomings in maintenance, including chlorination, and the weather conditions. The report also points to the inherent difficulty on present knowledge of eliminating the legionella bacillus in water spray cooling towers used for air conditioning.<br/>
The report praises those who cared for the infected patients and I gladly endorse this tribute. The report makes recommendations specific to the circumstances surrounding the outbreak and requiring local action. In particular, it calls for a review of the health authority's microbiological services in Stafford. I am asking the West Midlands regional health authority and the Mid-Staffordshire district health authority to report within three months on the follow-up action they have taken or intend to take.<br/>
Revised guidance on the maintenance of cooling towers was issued to health authorities in January 1986 following consultation with Sir John Badenoch. This reflects the lessons learned at that stage from the inquiry. In the light of the completed report, the Department has today issued a further circular to health authorities asking them to check for features similar to those found at Stafford and to take appropriate action. They are also being asked to ensure that existing guidance on maintenance is being followed and that operational engineering staff have access to detailed guidance on the operation of individual water spray cooling systems.<br/>
The recommended code of practice for hospital engineers should be available by about the end of the year. In the meantime, discussions are in hand with the Public Health Laboratory Service to establish a register of engineers so that relevant expertise can be available if needed by the Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre and health authorities.<br/>
The inquiry recommended that a committee of experts should be convened urgently to consider all aspects of the use of biocides as a means of minimising build up of legionella. This committee will be chaired by Dr. A. E. Wright, director of the Public Health Laboratory Service Newcastle laboratory, and will begin its work shortly.<br/>
Other recommendations dealt with reducing reliance on air conditioning in general and water spray cooling towers in particular. Current hospital building policy, with its emphasis on smaller hospitals, means that new hospitals generally use less air conditioning than before. Preliminary inquiries indicate that no new water spray cooling towers will be incorporated in hospitals currently being planned. The inquiry's conclusions will reinforce the commitment to air-cooled systems for new hospital building.<br/>
As regards existing hospitals, health authorities have been asked to give details about the type and number of water spray systems now in use, as a first step to carrying out the recommendation that urgent consideration should be given to their replacement. Only a minority of hospitals are thought to have such systems, but the inquiry will establish an accurate national picture. I understand that the inquiry team did not envisage immediate replacement of such systems; it was concerned to ensure that existing systems operate as safely as possible and those which have reached the end of their natural life or present particular maintenance problems should have priority for replacement.<br/>
Early action was taken with the two health notices in July 1985 and January 1986 and further instructions, based upon this first report, have now been issued to health authorities. These steps will reduce the risk of any repetition of the outbreak. Production of a code of practice and setting up the register of engineers experienced in this field will also contribute to that end. In the longer term, the new committee on biocides should help to clarify how these chemicals can best be used to reduce risks further. Information is being collected about existing hospital water spray cooling systems as a first step in the consideration of their longer-term future.<br/>
We owe a great deal to Sir John Badenoch and his fellow inquiry members for the energy and application they have brought to producing this report. For the broader questions about what may need to be done to reduce any risk from the disease in other circumstances in hospitals, other buildings and elsewhere, the Government look forward to the second report, which is expected around the turn of the year.</p>

<p>I join the Minister in thanking Sir John Badenoch and his colleagues for the work that t hey have done in the inquiry. As the Minister has said, the findings of the committee have revealed a considerable number of shortcomings. There are many uncertainties surrounding even that which happened at Stafford, and there are even more uncertainties about the knowledge, development and spread of legionnaire's disease generally.<br/>
Even the first report has implications for other hospitals in other areas, and it is not entirely clear from the Minister's statement whether the Government fully accept all the recommendations within it. I should like the Minister to be specific about that. Will he tell us whether the Government intend to find the extra staff and money that will be necessary for the investigation of the cooling systems at other hospitals and for any adaptations and replacements that may be necessary?<br/>
Does the Minister accept the committee's recommendation that there should be further research into legionnaire's disease? If he does, is he satisfied that there are presently only two Government-funded research projects into legionnaire's disease? Given the tribute that has been paid to the Public Health Laboratory Service and the Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre in the report, will he reaffirm that the Government have abandoned any intention of interfering with the Public Health Laboratory Service, or to abolish it or the Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre, which were around at the time of the outbreak.<br/>
Although this is not covered by the report, I should like to know whether the final report will cover the action taken by the Minister's Department? To be fair to the Minister, that was action taken before he became the Minister for Health. Is the right hon. Gentleman satisfied that no fewer than five days elapsed between his office at the Elephant and Castle being informed that the Stafford hospital people believed that legionnaire's disease was caused by their water cooling system and the Department informing other health authorities with hospitals with identical cooling systems of what had happened at Stafford?</p>

<p>I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's comments about Sir John and his colleagues. As a first step towards achieving urgent consideration about whether to replace existing spray systems, we have called for the establishment of the precise situation throughout the country. I understand that there are about 400 water spray cooling towers now in place, and we shall need to consider the details of the installations.<br/>
The assessment of where we stand can be undertaken notwithstanding resource implications within existing budgets. The immediate priority for health authorities must be to ensure that the existing equipment is correctly and safely maintained. These instructions have already gone out and they will be reinforced by the publication of the report and by the further health notice which is being issued.<br/>
Legionnaire's disease is affecting countries throughout the world and I am not aware of any research projects that are not being followed through. I would be prepared to give consideration to any suggestions that come forward and to pass them on to those responsible for medical research.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman made some rather exaggerated comments about the Public Health Laboratory Service and a report which was produced earlier this year. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State made it clear quickly that he did not accept the proposals in the report and that he wished the service to continue in its existing form. My right hon. Friend's clear undertaking remains.<br/>
The content of Sir John's final report will be a matter for him and his colleagues and not for me.</p>

Will he join me in extending sympathy to those who were bereaved during the course of the outbreak of legionnaire's disease in my constituency?

<p>Yes, I join my hon. Friend in his expressions of sympathy, which have been made in the House before and which, I am sure, will be reiterated in all parts of it, to the relatives and friends of those who suffered. I endorse the tribute which was paid in the report and paid previously by my predecessor and by the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) to the staff. Anyone who reads the report of the inquiry will see that tribute is paid in unstinted fashion to those who had the care of the patients who, alas, suffered from this serious infection. I congratulate my hon. Friend, whose assiduous attention to detail as the constituency Member has rightly won admiration and praise in all parts of the House.</p>

<p>I associate my right hon. and hon. Friends with the comments that have been made about the sympathy that we should extend to the relatives of those who died in this tragic incident and the tribute that we should pay to the heroic efforts of the staff who put it right. We owe a debt to Sir John Badenoch for the expedition with which he has produced the report.<br/>
Can the Minister confirm that DHSS maintenance standards for the cooling towers are upheld and that the proper recommended procedures are followed? I understand from his statement that he found that there were maintenance defects. Has he considered the use of biocides such as Hatacide LP5 as a replacement for chlorination, as chlorination has been found to be defective, and certainly in the conditions found in modern water spray cooling systems?<br/>
Secondly, the Minister will know from the expert advice that he has been receiving that old people are especially vulnerable to legionnaire's disease. He has said that 400 institutions have water spray cooling systems, and I ask him to give especial attention and priority to those that accommodate elderly people, who are particularly at risk. If he finds that there are still suspect systems, will he ensure that no expense is spared in replacing equipment?</p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for what he has said about extending sympathy to the relatives of those who died. He has addressed himself to the maintenance of the air conditioning plant at Stafford and, as I said earlier, the report reveals a number of defects in design, installation, maintenance and chlorination which appear to have contributed to the outbreak of the disease. The inquiry was not able to point the finger precisely at any one specific failure or cause. The infection appeared to start on 9 April and appeared to cease on 19 April. The


cessation may have been contributed to by a change in weather conditions, but there is still no absolutely clear reason why the outbreak started and why it ended.<br/>
The way in which infections of this particular organism have been found to operate in different parts of the world at different times makes it extremely difficult to be precise and specific about the causes. The hon. Gentleman has referred to the use of biocides and he will have heard me say that we have accepted the recommendation that an expert committee should consider the issue. I have said that Dr. Wright, who is a distinguished expert in this area, will be chairing the committee. I hope that the membership of it will be established pretty soon and that it will get to work without delay.<br/>
The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) was right to draw attention to the vulnerability of old people to infection. People who have suffered from chronic infections and, indeed, those who have been heavy smokers also appear to be vulnerable. They all appear to be more liable to be adversely affected by the infection. The hon. Gentleman's point about the water spray cooling towers, and their relationship to institutions where there are people with particular vulnerability, such as the old, will be taken into account.</p>

<p>May I associate myself with my right hon. Friend's kind and generous remarks about the care bestowed by the staff at Stafford hospital, particularly the care for my constituents, who are just five miles away from Stafford hospital? Will my right hon. Friend confirm that also about five miles away is Meaford power station? Have he and the inquiry completely eliminated the possibility of a correlation between the water cooling system of Meaford power station and legionnaire's disease? Has my right hon. Friend satisfied himself that the committee has ensured, through any consultations that it may have had with the Central Electricity Generating Board and others, that there was no connection? Will he confirm that the most rigorous inquiry has taken place as to the efficacy of the water cooling system at Stafford general hospital and, indeed, the quality of maintenance of the water cooling system?</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his comments and his endorsement of the tribute to the staff concerned. He will have personal knowledge of that because some of his constituents were affected. A connection with the water cooling systems in nearby power stations has not been established, nor, I suggest&#x2014;although I do so subject to correction&#x2014;has it been totally eliminated. As far as I can judge from the scientific and engineering evidence that is coming forward, it is extremely difficult to be absolutely positive either for or against any proposition in this area. It has become clear that the organism that led to the deaths and illness of those affected in the outbreak was identified as being in the air conditioning system. Cooling tower No. 4 had a connection with the outpatients' department where, as far as one can judge, the majority of those who were affected picked up the infection.</p>

Secondly, will the right hon. Gentleman assure the House that any changes that have to be made to NHS equipment in any hospital as a result of the report will be paid for out of central funds, not out of local district health authority funds, so that they will not be set against the costs of existing services and staff?<br/>
When the final report is ready, and if any changes are required in building control regulations for any other building or installation, will the right hon.

We should take pride in the fact that NHS staff have been out in the front and leading internationally in dealing with this difficult infection.<br/>
With regard to passing on information, the report is going to all health authorities. No doubt, in their own circumstances, they will let all those concerned know. There are recommendations in the report about the wed for further training and, of course, it will be carried through.</p>

The guidance that my Department will issue to all health authorities will also be made available to anyone else outside who has an interest and who asks for it.</p>

<p>Is not the Minister aware that it was precisely because it was impossible to isolate the true origin of the epidemic at Stafford that there was considerable disquiet in the area? Will he please understand that what is required now is urgent action in relation to the other hospitals with comparable systems? That requires central funding. It is not enough to send out a circular. Those hospitals must be given money immediately so that they can do something about their existing systems.</p>

<p>The hon. Lady slightly misunderstands the position. Guidance about existing systems has been available since 1980, and it was reinforced in July 1985 and January 1986. The hon.

<p>The Minister has talked about specific recommendations for hospitals, but I suggest that an outbreak could occur in air conditioning systems in other public buildings, unless proper maintenance of the systems is carried out.

<p>The hon. Lady must have misunderstood what I said. She will understand when she reads the report. Sir John Badenock's committee has produced a first report dealing with the Stafford incident in particular. I said that there would be a second report, which would look at what could be done to reduce any risk from the disease in other circumstances, in hospitals or other buildings, whether in the public or private sector, and elsewhere. Even the possibility of the infection on ships has already been identified. Sir John and his colleagues are going ahead with that wider work and their report can be expected towards the end of the year.</p>

<p>Has the Minister considered paragraph 52 of the report? It says that one of the ways in which the dissemination of this disease is known to occur is
<q>via shower heads or spray taps (which are used intermittently, and where the organism may multiply if the water is warm) &#x2026;</q>
Bearing in mind that the Select Committee on Employment, on which I have the privilege to serve, looked into the problems of this disease and considered evidence to the effect that it also arises from whirlpools and Jacuzzis and in other precise systems where water goes into the air, will the Minister direct the inquiry specifically to those problems? Apparently no prosecutions are to arise from the current disasters. Can the Minister tell the House

whether as a result of this inquiry and the miseries which gave rise to it steps will be taken to remove Crown immunity in respect of any such further incidents which may involve liability by hospitals or prisons or any other public institution? That immunity should have been removed long ago.</p>

<p>Crown immunity has absolutely nothing to do with this.

I can give the hon. and learned Member the assurance that Crown immunity will not come into that.<br/>
The hon. and learned Gentleman directed my attention to a paragraph in the report and seemed to be suggesting that I should draw Sir John's attention to that paragraph so that he and his colleagues could carry out further work. Sir John and his colleagues hardly need me to draw their attention to what they have written so that they can decide upon their further work. As I have said, that work will be wide ranging and Sir John and his colleagues will look at the action that will be required to reduce the possibility of this infection arising in hospitals, in other buildings or elsewhere.

<p>The report says that urgent consideration should be given to those matters and as a first step towards giving that consideration we have called for information about the systems in use. That information will need to be considered. As I have said, the immediate priority must be to ensure tha the existing equipment is correctly and safely maintained. Of course it will cost money to replace water spray cooling towers. It is clear that the inquiry did not recommend immediate replacement of such systems, and in any case the replacement of towers that are at the end of their lives will cost money.<br/>
In planned hospital building for the future we have, fortunately, turned to air cooling rather than water spray cooling and we will look into the problems identified by the survey that has been initiated about dealing with


existing water spray cooling towers. If that involves significant cost, then, of course, the matter will be looked at. Changing circumstances are always looked at in the context of the ways in which we fund the National Health Service.</p>

<p>I beg to move,
<q>That leave be given to bring in a Bill to provide compensation for victims of road traffic accidents without proof of fault and for related purposes.</q><br/>
The casualty toll on our roads is horrific, and from figures supplied to me last week in a written answer it appears that in the last four years for which records were available 1,251,000 of our citizens were injured in road accidents. Of those, 682,000 were men, 380,000 were women and 189,000 were children. We know from the researches carried out by the Royal Commission on civil liability and compensation for personal injury, chaired by Lord Pearson, and known as the Pearson commission, that only a fraction of those who are injured on our roads receive any compensation through the ordinary provisions of the law on tort, a law which requires those who seek damages to prove negligence against the defendant. The report said:
<q>only about a quarter of those who are injured by motor vehicles actually succeed in recovering tort compensation".</q><br/>
The manner in which it is decided whether someone who is injured on the road is to get compensation is archaic, ridiculous and does not work. It is a form of legal lottery, or, as the Pearson commission said:
<q>the fault principle operates with particular capriciousness. The `forensic lottery' had become 'a lunatic lottery and an absurd system for providing compensation for anyone."'</q>
The system denies compensation to most people and ensures that in most cases those who obtain compensation are kept waiting for a long time for the money that they so desperately need.<br/>
It is the purpose of this Bill to introduce into our law the concept of no-fault liability in respect of road traffic accidents. It would ensure that when a case comes to court years after an accident people are not called upon to give evidence about what happened in a split second. which, even immediately afterwards, they cannot remember with any certainty, that they are not cross-examined in court about matters which occurred when they were suffering from shock, and even if they are trying to tell the truth&#x2014;most are&#x2014;will fail to do so, that matters which rely on personal recollection and not upon documentation but upon which people's entire financial futures depend, will not be matters for courts, and that people who are entitled to be compensated will obtain that compensation without having to prove negligence.<br/>
The concept is not new in our law. Under the Employers Liability (Defective Equipment) Act 1969, when an employee is injured or killed at work because of defective equipment, and in a subsequent action the employer is deemed to have been negligent, liability is imposed without fault. The House has accepted and approved a directive of the European Economic Community regarding product liability, and the Government are therefore committed to introducing legislation that will bring no-fault liability into our law in respect of defective products. If a product is manufactured in or imported into Britain after the summer of 1988 and it is defective and the defect causes death or personal injury, the sufferer will not have to prove negligence against the defendant &#x2014; it will be presumed. The Bill would introduce precisely the same concept into the much


larger, broader, more anguished and common area of road traffic accidents, in respect of which 250,000 families are affected each year by the nonsense and lack of sense and compassion of the law as it stands.<br/>
Strangely enough, matters are getting steadily worse. In Leicestershire, for example, the number of people killed on the county's roads during the first three months of this year was almost double that for the same period in 1985. Seat belts have done some good, but they have not removed the miseries of the road casualty. The Bill would provide for no-fault liability.<br/>
The question that would then arise is, who would pay for the reform? Part of the problem is that a private Member's Bill cannot involve public expenditure, because that is contrary to the rules. Part of the answer lies in the removal from lawyers and courts of cases which could properly be dealt with through a different and much less expensive system. Money would therefore be saved. Part of the answer may lie in the system which exists in New Zealand and which, I am told, is to be introduced in Australia. The state operates a scheme with or without insurance companies. The answer may lie in the insurers bearing the cost, as part of the cost would be saved by their not being forced into litigation, courts and unworthy and unnecessary costs. Part of the cost might be added to insurance premiums. I reckon that most motorists would be pleased to pay that price if it meant that, in the event of an accident, they would stand a chance of getting compensation such as is denied to them at present.<br/>
I wish to pay tribute to the memory of Lord Pearson, a man for whom I had enormous affection and respect. I wish that his report in this respect had not been hidden away since 1979&#x2013;80. At least this Bill will bring to the attention of the House, the Government and the public the fact that the forensic lottery must end. That was the Pearson commission's description of this unduly slow and expensive to administer system. One day, some 45 per cent. of the cost of tort compensation will cease to be swallowed in administration costs and people will get the compensation to which they are entitled.<br/>
If the House accepts the Bill, it will add to people's prospects of getting justice. As the Pearson commission said in respect of product liability, there is no justice in our courts for most of our citizens. Those who are poor enough to get legal aid can bring a case to court, those who are rich enough not to need it may sue or defend, but for those who, like most of us, come somewhere in between, there is no hope of fighting a case. That is why some three quarters of accident victims who deserve compensation get none.<br/>
In those circumstances, I hope that the House will give me leave to introduce the Bill as the start of a campaign which I trust will end as did the product liability campaign&#x2014;with a change in the law.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br/>
The new clause provides that if in future changes are made to the law relating to companies such as are also appropriate for building societies, comparable provisions can be made by statutory instrument to apply those changes to building societies.<br/>
By way of example, I should mention clauses 57 to 60, which deal with loans to directors and cover matters which were enacted for companies in 1980 but which had to wait for several years for primary legislation to extend them to building societies. The power proposed in new clause 3 would enable building societies to be brought into line and to avoid that problem in future.</p>

<p>The Opposition have nothing of substance to argue with in the new clause. If company legislation is amended and the Government want

to amend building society legislation accordingly, the new clause empowers them to do that without too much fuss. We believe that that is quite logical.<br/>
As building societies are to have more commercial purposes and as large sections of the Bill are derived or borrowed from company legislation, it seems logical to empower the Treasury to relate new and amended company legislation to building societies without primary legislation.<br/>
Only one matter has occurred to the Opposition upon which we would like assurance. In the first place, the legislation would be thoroughly scrutinised by the House if the House wished to take that opportunity. Will the Minister explain why such alterations were contemplated? Under subsection (5), that must be done by affirmative resolution. There will be ample opportunity for scrutiny and questioning about its purpose and relevance.

In politics nothing is quite what it seems. We are discussing a great batch of amendments, starting with new clause 4. We believe that the Bill contains certain matters of principle and the remainder is administrative superstructure. While we accept that the superstructure must be correct&#x2014;and that is important&#x2014;we intend as a matter of tactics and strategy to confine our main lines of argument to what is controversial, not to these administrative matters which form part of the superstructure of the Bill.<br/>
The amendments largely cover technical matters, but we must be assured that the procedures are logical, watertight and, if challenged, accord with principles of natural justice. We have examined all the amendments and are satisfied that these steps meet the criteria needed. Provided that the Government are satisfied that they meet the needs of potential problems that might arise, we give the amendments our approval.

<p>In fairness to the amendments that we have just dealt with, I said not that they were "totally unexciting", but that they were "relatively unexciting". The totally unexciting amendments will be dealt with in a moment.<br/>
New clause 6 honours a commitment that my hon. Friend gave in Committee. New clauses 7 and 23 deal with mobile homes. The Government believe that it is important to provide more help for the mobile home sector. These days, mobile homes are a far cry from the caravans whose image they share. Mobile homes are prefabricated units built to a high specification conforming to BSI requirements and they have a life of at least 25 years. The fittings are of a high quality and all main services are laid on. They are mobile in the sense that they can be dismantled and moved to a new site.<br/>
It is appropriate that building societies should be given greater powers to lend on security of a mobile home than other class 2 lending powers. After considering the position, the Government have decided to make an exception on mobile homes to the &#x00A3;5,000 limit on class 3 loans to individuals. Societies with a qualifying assets holding will be able to lend up to &#x00A3;10,000 on the security of a mobile home.</p>

<p>I should like to introduce my brief remarks by declaring an interest. I have the honour and privilege to he a vice-president of the Building Societies Association.<br/>
I support the remarks made by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment. I am sure that one way in which building societies can help is to lend money at realistic and responsible rates of interest to people who want to exercise their right to buy but who, through dint of circumstance, are unable to do so through normal and traditional methods. The only way these people can achieve that is to acquire a mobile home.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State introduced legislation which brought security of tenure to those who had previously found that, although they owned a home, they did not own the land on which their home was situated. The Government have secured for them the right to ownership through the Mobile Homes Act 1983. Building societies have a responsibility to ensure that these vulnerable people who own and occupy mobile homes on mobile parks are protected. Hon. Members on both sides of the House who have mobile home parks in their constituencies know that these people do not consider themselves as owner-occupiers or council tenants in the first place. They consider themselves to be home owners in the last resort. Such people could fall prey to consumer credit organisations which charge rates of interest far in excess of those charged by responsible and prudent building societies.<br/>
I commend the new clause. I issue a challenge to building societies to allocate significant funds to extend to a large section of the mobile home community the opportunity to exercise the right to buy and the right to home ownership.</p>

<p>I declare an interest as the parliamentary adviser to the Midshires Building Society.<br/>
New clause 6, when exercised, will give building societies the power to lend on property overseas. Does my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State intend to ensure that building societies will be given early powers to lend on land in Great Britain, for example, in the Channel Islands and on the Isle of Man?<br/>
It is an anomaly that building societies are not able to lend on the security of land in these islands. Other financial institutions in the United Kingdom with which building societies compete&#x2014;the banks and the trustee savings banks, for which my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary to the Treasury has responsibility&#x2014;are able to do business on the Isle of Man and in the Channel Islands. Will my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary ensure that building societies are given powers to carry out business in those territories, even though the House understands that there are many overseas territories in which he would not wish to authorise building societies to act as that might be detrimental to the interests of lenders?</p>

<p>I do not wish to anticipate what the Minister might say, but I believe that the points that have been raised in relation to the Channel Islands and Gibraltar have been dealt with satisfactorily by the Government in other new clauses.<br/>
I also declare an interest, although this is not a financial interest. I am also a vice-president of the Building Societies Association for which I am not paid. That is a great honour.<br/>
The hon. Member for Mid-Staffordshire (Mr. Heddle) raised the important matter of mobile homes. Increasing numbers of people live in very satisfactory accommodation in mobile homes. There is no reason why building societies should not advance money on a mobile home provided that it is a permanent home on a mobile home site and not a touring caravan or something of the kind that we have read about recently in the newspapers. This is particularly important because nowadays one marriage in three ends in separation or divorce, resulting in great economic difficulties. It is all very well in Hollywood or on the screen among very rich families, but most ordinary families in this country cannot afford divorce and the cost of supporting an ex-wife as well as a current one. Often the husband or the wife&#x2014;usually the husband&#x2014;gives or is forced to give the matrimonial home to the spouse and family and would himself be homeless if he could not occupy a mobile home.<br/>
It is extremely sensible to provide that building societies may lend on mobile homes, and the Building Societies Association entirely agrees with what the Government are doing, but the association has just one query about the wording of the new clause. It seems not to deal with joint loans in relation to mobile homes. The association believes that the Bill should provide that a joint loan to two or more persons should be treated as though it were a loan to one of those persons for the purposes of the relevant limits. As this will not be a class 1 loan, the overall limit for class 2 or class 3 loans could be affected. Perhaps the Government could make it clear susequently, either here or in another place, that a joint loan will be treated as one loan.</p>

<p>We are going through the Bill at exhilarating speed, but the Government's luck cannot last. Nevertheless, the Opposition support the new clauses and the amendments.<br/>
It was pointed out in Committee that it made more sense for building societies to lend directly overseas rather than through a clutter of subsidiaries, but one or two questions arise in relation to the new clause. I appreciate the distinction between the negative resolution procedure in relation to designated British overseas territories and the affirmative resolution procedure in relation to other overseas territories. These presumably correspond to the possible degrees of risk on categories of secured investments, the firmer security of the affirmative procedure being required as a check by the House.<br/>
Subsection (5)<i>(a)</i> of new clause 6 provides for the commission to act with the consent of the Treasury, but under subsection (5)<i>(b)</i> the Treasury will act on its own. Perhaps the Minister will explain why in one case the Treasury will advise the commission whereas in the other the Treasury will act alone.<br/>
In new clause 7 it makes a great deal of sense to separate the two principles originally contained within the framework of clause 14.<br/>
By and large, all these provisions make a great deal of sense, and the provisions with regard to mobile homes are to be welcomed. I shall therefore say no more on that subject as I am most encouraged by all that has been said already.</p>

<p>A number of points have been raised in this short debate. I can assure my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow (Mr. Cockeram) that it is indeed our intention to lay orders at an early stage providing the relevant powers in relation to relevant overseas territories.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Halton (Mr. Oakes) made a fair point about joint loans. The Government will look again at the point and if we are convinced of the logic of the case we shall take appropriate steps in another place.<br/>
With regard to new clause 6, the Government agreed in Committee to consider an order-making power to allow societies to act directly overseas rather than through subsidiaries, thus allowing flexibility to reconsider arrangements for overseas operations if circumstances&#x2014;for example, in the EEC&#x2014;should change. Although the provisions in the Bill already go beyond what is available in most other states and are entirely consistent with our treaty obligations and with the draft directive, the Government have looked at the matter again and in the interests of flexibility we have decided to include an order-making power for direct operations.<br/>
On the rather technical question about the Treasury acting on its own volition or giving advice, I should like to reflect on what the right hon. Gentleman has said and write to him or see that his representative in another place gives him the answer.</p>

The purpose of imposing obligations on individuals is nullified if the society of which they are directors or by which they are employed is unable to undertake to pay any damages or fine due from it in the event of non-compliance with any obligation. The provisions of section 92 of the Building Societies Act 1962 therefore remain appropriate and the new clause re-enacts them.</p>

<p>This is a straightforward matter, merely repeating the safeguards contained in the 1962 Act. Perhaps the Economic Secretary will refresh my memory. Has this provision been separated from another part of the Bill which came before the Standing Committee, or was it an omission that is now being rectified?</p>

<p>The new clause and the amendments deal with the system of appeals. The clauses provide for a new system whereby building societies may appeal to an independent tribunal against decisions of the commission regarding matters of authorisation. Under existing legislation, the chief registrar's use of discretionary powers on prudential matters is subject to Treasury consent and, ultimately, of course, to judicial review in court.<br/>
Under the new building society regime, we have concluded that- societies should have available a formal system of appeal which is designed to take account of the new system of authorisation to be established by the Bill and which can be brought into operation as rapidly as possible in cases of dispute. The clauses have been discussed extensively with interested parties, and particularly with the Building Societies Association, which has welcomed their inclusion. I hope that they will also be welcomed by the House.</p>

<speech hansard_id="414350" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1986-06-04a.923.8" hansard_membership_id="10009" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/21977" speakername="Mr. Weetch" colnum="923" time="16:37:00">
<p>The commission that was set up earlier in the Bill will have considerable powers. It is right that there should be comprehensive rights of appeal. The Opposition accept that fully in principle. We have scrutinised the new clauses and the amendments. The clauses cover rights of appeal, the determination of appeals, costs and related conditions, and appeals on points of law. They appear to be comprehensive, which we welcome.<br/>
I have one question on the detailed text of new clause 9. Similar points arise later on other new clauses and on some of the amendments. The imposition of conditions, as well as the impositions themselves in terms of the subject matter, is now to be subject to appeal. An appeal

may be mounted on both aspects&#x2014;the principle as to whether conditions will be imposed and the factual content of the conditions themselves.<br/>
As I understand it, a building society can appeal against the principle of conditions being imposed and against the subject matter of the conditions. In new clause 10(6)<i>(c),</i> the tribunal will have power to direct the commission to determine conditions. Therefore, do I understand correctly that if a building society loses the day on the imposition of conditions, the tribunal can say what the conditions are to be? Subsequently, could another appeal be mounted against the factual contents of the conditions that were declared as a result of the request of the tribunal ?</p>

<speech hansard_id="414351" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1986-06-04a.924.0" hansard_membership_id="7437" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/28841" speakername="Mr. Ian Stewart" colnum="924" time="16:37:00">
<p>The hon. Gentleman has rightly drawn attention to the technical operation of the provisions. We decided that appeal should be available across the range of decisions which the commission can make, that is to say, not only on the granting or on the revoking of authorisation but on the imposition of conditions. The hon. Gentleman has put his finger on a difficulty; a society can appeal against conditions absolutely but it can also appeal against the conditions themselves.<br/>
If the commission is clear that the society should be able to continue with authorisation only provided that conditions are attached, an appeal against any conditions being applied would in effect be a challenge to the commission on its assessment of the position. The commission might well respond by suggesting revocation. It is more likely in practice that the appeal will be on the nature of the conditions rather than on the imposition of conditions. That means that it is more likely to be a single exercise of the appeal procedure than a to-ing and fro-ing. I shall read later what the hon. Gentleman has said and if I have anything to add I shall write to him.<br/>
The matter was considered for its practical implications during the consultation period. I am advised that the points which the hon. Gentleman has raised have been dealt with in the proposed system and that that system is the one most likely to operate cleanly and quickly. One of the most important requirements for any appeal procedure in relation to a society is to deal with the appeal with as little fuss and bother as possible so that the affairs of the society are not held up to public view and its dirty linen is not washed in public, which might cause anxiety to members and depositors and therefore damage the credibility of the society in the market. We want to avoid that. Therefore, we want as direct and rapid a system as possible. We think that we have achieved it. That is what the amendments are designed to do.</p>

<p>This is an important new clause which imposes an obligation on societies to belong to an ombudsman scheme in relation to certain of their activities and to enable the commission to recognise schemes for that purpose. The provisions give effect to an undertaking that we gave in Committee to oblige building societies to

belong to an approved ombudsman scheme. While voluntary ombudsman arrangements have become more widespread in recent years, and while the Building Societies Association had been planning a scheme for building societies, this is the first compulsory scheme outside the public service.<br/>
Before coming to the provisions, I want to pay a tribute to my hon. Friends the Members for York (Mr. Gregory) and High Peak (Mr. Hawkins) for the energy and diligence with which they argued the case for a statutory ombudsman. The introduction of the new clauses is due in no small measure to their efforts.<br/>
New clause 13 contains the obligation for societies to belong to a scheme in respect of the relevant activities and provides for recognition of schemes by the commission. It also gives effect to a new schedule which sets out the criteria that a scheme must satisfy if it is to obtain recognition. Firstly, the scheme must cover some or all of the activities on which there must be recourses to an ombudsman: broadly speaking, savings accounts, whether shares or deposits, services relating to the handling of money and all lending, whether classes 1, 2 or 3.<br/>
Secondly, the schedule sets out the powers wind' the ombudsman must have to investigate complaints. It makes it clear, however, that his writ does not run to questions purely about a society's commercial judgment about the creditworthiness of a customer, for example, in deciding whether or not to make an advance or to make available a cheque guarantee card or other facilities. It is a fundamental point of principle to the prudent operation of its business that a building society must ultimately reserve the right to make such decisions without the possibility of their being overturned by an outsider. Where there has been maladministration, the ombudsman will be able to ask the society to take the decision again but he will not be able to take the decision for the society.<br/>
Thirdly, the schedule deals with the powers of the ombudsman to offer redress to complainants. He may require a society to take steps to remedy its actions or to pay compensation up to a maximum of &#x00A3;100,000, as in the voluntary insurance ombudsman scheme. The scheme need not oblige societies to comply, so long as their reasons are spelt out in the annual directors' report and made public in a way laid down by the ombudsman. That is to avoid derogation by statute from the normal rights of a building society before the courts. However, it would be open to the societies voluntarily to join a scheme which offered no such let-out.<br/>
New clause 14 deals with some supplementary points. It sets out the criteria which the ombudsman must use in determining complaints; provides for his decision to be final if accepted by the complainant, although the society may always seek leave to appeal to the High Court on a point of law arising from his decision; and provides a penalty for non-compliance with the statutory obligation to belong to a scheme.<br/>
The related new schedule sets out the procedure for recognition of schemes by the commission and for the registry to record their membership. The statutory obligations will be enforced primarily by the criminal penalty for non-compliance, but, as a last resort, the commission may assist in the establishment of a scheme.<br/>
Those provisions mark a major step forward in the protection of consumers and will help to ensure that


building societies continue to observe the high standards in dealing with their customers for which they are justly renowned. I commend them to the House.<br/>
Amendment No. 253 gives effect to arrangements for the reference of disputes to an arbitrator of the High Court or the commission. They replace part IV of schedule 2 and, if required, I can give a more detailed explanation.</p>

<p>I congratulate the Government on carrying out the express wish of both sides of the Committee. I agree that two Conservative Members suggested establishing an ombudsman for building societies, and that was fully supported by the Opposition.<br/>
I have one minor query. Some societies are uneasy about new clause 14 and about paragraph 4 of the new schedule listed as amendment No. 251. At first sight it seems that the adjudicator can override contractual agreements between a building society and a complainant. That may well be right in some cases, especially exceptional ones where the society had clearly acted unreasonably, but the clauses seem to be far more complex than ever we imagined they would be in Committee. We imagined the establishment of an ombudsman to be a simple matter. The clauses are legalistic and complex. This may be necessary &#x2014; I am not complaining&#x2014;but they seem to be long winded.<br/>
Societies believe that an adjudicator should intervene if a building society's act is overridingly and clearly unreasonable. However, it is hoped that the ombudsman will not use his powers under the schedule to intervene in minor matters where there is a clear contractual agreement between a complainant and a building society.</p>

<p>I support the Government's new clauses. I heard my hon. Friend the Minister say that this is the first compulsory scheme outside the public sector, and I deplore the fact that he had to make that statement. I am not criticising him, but I am criticising the Building Societies Association, the banks, the insurance companies and a host of other industries concerned with consumers. The furniture industry, for example, has set up a complaints procedure under the Office of Fair Trading. I deeply regret the fact that the building societies have had to be forced into a statutory scheme.<br/>
As the right hon. Member for Halton (Mr. Oakes) said, the clauses are much more legalistic and lengthy than we expected when we tabled the amendments in Committee, requiring the establishment of an ombudsman for consumer complaints. I regret and deplore the fact that the scheme is so rigid and inflexible, and I hope that other industries in the financial sector and elsewhere which deal with consumers will learn a lesson from this, namely, that it is much better for them to set up their own scheme than to have one imposed upon them.</p>

<p>As a vice-president of the Building Societies Association, I must say that the building societies in no way oppose the estabishment of an ombudsman. For years the association knew that there was to be a Building Societies Bill. The Government wisely listened to the points made in Committee and inserted this clause in the Bill. It has not been forced on the Building Societies Association. The association happily acquiesces in it.</p>

<p>I do not dispute that the building societies accept this need. My point is that other industries, including those in the financial sector, have recognised both the need for an ombudsman and the pressure from consumers for an independent adjudicator to whom they can take complaints, and have set up their own ombudsman scheme. It would have been better if the BSA had recognised that pressure and done something similar, thereby avoiding this long and inflexible scheme, which is not in the interests of consumers to the extent that it could have been had the building societies set up their own scheme at the outset.<br/>
I congratulate the Minister on having acted in this way, following pressure in Committee.</p>

<p>I echo the remarks of my right hon. Friend the Member for Halton (Mr. Oakes) and the hon. Member for Ludlow (Mr. Cockeram) in welcoming the new clause. The proposal had all-party support in Committee, which may be why the Government agreed to take it up, although it may be that we had an unusually relaxed and friendly Committee. I pay tribute to the Government for being so accommodating.<br/>
The new clause puts into law an important principle, and I accept my right hon. Friend's point that it is not being forced on the building societies, but that they welcome it. It has been inserted in the Bill because this is the most convenient way of providing for an ombudsman. The Government listened to the arguments and seized this opportunity. The building societies are pioneering a development which should be universal and have enforceable provisions. It should exist for the whole of the banking sector more strongly and effectively than it does, for financial institutions, for insurance companies and, indeed, for newspapers. I know that the <i>Daily Mirror</i> has its ombudsman, probably in Liechtenstein, or somewhere equally convenient, for adjudication purposes. I should like this development to spread over a wide range of industries.<br/>
Some suspicions have been voiced, especially by solicitors, who are afraid of building societies doing conveyancing, but we shall come to that later. They attempt to give the impression that building societies are huge domineering monopolistic organisations of which people should be afraid. That is not their nature. I do not expect an overwhelming rush of complaints. It is right that building societies should show themselves whiter than white by acceding to the scheme, and I hope that they will accede to a compulsory, binding scheme, not one that allows them to dismiss adjudications in their annual report. It should not be like the local government scheme, which enables local government to reject the ombudsman's recommendations too easily.<br/>
Consumers need some help and protection. They need a body to identify with and an agency which will protect them with clear, simple, straightforward procedures so that they have confidence to operate in a system which is often intimidating and frightening.</p>

<p>On behalf of the Opposition, I warmly welcome the principle of an ombudsman for building societies. From experience. I know that disputes between building societies and their members have caused much dissatisfaction. I have been involved in several disputes on a constituency basis, and I have followed some others


through the newspapers. Some celebrated disputes with building society boards of management reached the press some years ago and obtained publicity. To put it no higher, there was a feeling among some ordinary members of building societies that when a dispute occurred and had to be adjudicated upon, the cards were stacked against the ordinary membership. That being so, it was high time that there was an alteration.<br/>
I shall keep my remarks about the clauses to a minimum because most of the substantial issues have been discussed. The fact that we have a scheme will give much confidence to the public and will probably underline the increased confidence which investors and members have in building societies. I am pleased that the promise given to the Standing Committee by the Economic Secretary to the Treasury to set up a scheme was fulfilled. He should be personally commended on it. In principle, it covers almost everything; indeed, perhaps it covers too much and a little more should have been left to discretion. However, one can never get these matters right. The scheme covers the fact that an individual has a right to make a complaint on stipulated matters and that a building society must be a member of an approved scheme.<br/>
The Government have said that a scheme must be compulsory. They lay down basic principles that must be followed and leave the building society movement to construct a scheme. That is as good a way forward as any.<br/>
The ombudsman principle is well founded in public life. It is a success. There are good precedents in the insurance industry and in banks, and it is a sound way of adjudicating in disputes. I underline the fact that, although the clause was the responsibility of the hon. Member for York (Mr. Gregory), it had substantial all-party support. The hon. Member for High Peak (Mr. Hawkins) was also involved. Such all-party support is the clause's political strength. It has been put firmly on the political map, which is a good thing.<br/>
The provisions for an ombudsman to adjudicate in disputes are lengthy, detailed and complicated. Could we not have set up a scheme which occupied less print? In the brief which it sent to hon. Members who were interested in arguing the Bill, the Building Societies Association said that the amount of print is such that it may create some awkward legal precedents. Is that the case? What legal scrutiny has it received? Will there be more scrutiny when it reaches the other place so that any rough bits can be made smooth?<br/>
Although I make those comments, I do not wish to detract from anything that I said at the beginning of my speech. The House welcomes this considerable step forward for the building society movement.</p>

<p>I am grateful for the kind words from hon. Members on both sides of the House about the new clause and the Government's initiative to set up an ombudsman scheme. I shall deal briefly with the points that were raised.<br/>
On the complexity and length of the schedule, no one is more anxious to keep down the volume of print than my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary and myself, but the complexity is an inevitable result of trying to codify in statute what is a voluntary arrangement. Once the decision is taken to specify that in statute, it becomes unfortunately necessary to do so in some detail, given the criminal sanctions against non-compliance.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Halton (Mr. Oakes) was worried about the adjudicator overriding the contractual arrangements between the society and the complainant. Clause 14(4) is the let-out clause that I mentioned in my opening remarks. The adjudicator's finding is legally binding if accepted by the complainant, but is subject to the let-out in subsection (4) whereby the society is not obliged to accept the findings so long as it gives the reasons for so doing in the way specified in the new clause and the amendments. We felt obliged to include the let-out clause by which a society may decide not to comply with the ombudsman's decision as long as it explains its reasons publicly, because we did not want to remove the legal rights of a society before the courts.<br/>
The hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) expressed the hope, with which I agree, that the occasions on which a society would take advantage of the let-out clause would be exceptional. Nothing in the provisions would prevent a society from voluntarily giving up the let-out clause. But there is a point of principle. In requiring societies to belong to a scheme under which they must accept the directions of a third party, we should be depriving them of their rights of law before the courts. Parliament would not wish to do that. It is one thing voluntarily to contract to give up those rights, which is an option, but another to remove them. That is why that clause was included. I hope that the building societies will not seek to abuse the clause or use it lightly. They can expand the scope of the scheme beyond the basic minimun that is already in the Bill.<br/>
The hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) asked whether the Government would have any further thoughts on the Bill. The Government tabled several hundred amendments between Committee stage and Report, arid I doubt whether the ingenuity and investigative powers of the draftsmen are as yet exhausted, so there may be another opportunity to improve and refine the Bill.<br/>
In the secure knowledge of all-party support for this fresh initiative, the Government are happy to leave the matter as it is for the time being.</p>

<p>New clause 16 relates to the conversion of building societies into limited companies. Our principles in approaching the matter have been clear. First, any such decision by the members of a building society must be made with clear support from investing and borrowing members and from a significant proportion of the entire membership. It is an important change in the nature of the business of a building society to move from mutual to incorporated status, and it would be wrong for such a change to be made without the strong support of the society's members.<br/>
Secondly, we have been anxious to ensure that the process protects the rights and interests of members in. such a way that it does not, at the same time, encourage members of the public to switch their funds around in the market on a speculative basis hoping to make a quick profit, which has happened in the United States.<br/>
5.30 pm<br/>
Thirdly, we felt that limits should be placed on the compensation payable to outgoing directors so that conversion is not a course of action promoted by management in its own interests. I think that those principles are supported not only by the Building Societies Association, but by both sides of the House.<br/>
The details of the clauses have been carefully worked out, but the main question is one of principle. The Bill sets out a regime for all societies, large and small, local and national. It may be that as financial markets develop some societies will want to develop more rapidly than the Bill allows. I see no reason to prevent that, provided they have the overwhelming support of their members. It seems to be the essence of mutuality that members should take the crucial decisions. That is what we are providing in this procedure.</p>

<p>I hope that my hon. Friend will contribute to the debate, but I would just like to finish this passage.<br/>
It may also be useful if there is a degree of diversity in the movement as to whether all building societies remain as mutual institutions. However, the possibility of converting into incorporated status would add to the range of types of society or mortgage-providing institutions.<br/>
I should like to listen to the debate and, if I am fortunate enough to catch Mr. Speaker's eye at the end, I could then respond to the points raised. At this stage I should like to say that I have taken careful note of the arguments put forward during the passage of the Bill so far, but they have not convinced me that conversion is wrong in principle. I am now more than ever sure that it is an option which should be available, subject to the necessary safeguards and principles that I have described. Therefore, I should like to respond more fully when I have heard the views of my hon. Friend the Member for High Peak (Mr. Hawkins) and other hon. Members.</p>

<p>So far the debate on the new clauses has proceeded amicably, with agreement between the two sides of the House, but I tear that at this point the two sides will differ.<br/>
I understand that the Minister has carefully considered what safeguards can be built into the process of conversion from a mutual organisation to a plc, and I appreciate that he has resisted pressures to, for example, decrease the percentage of members who would necessarily have to vote for such a conversion. One must be grateful for small mercies. It is a small mercy, because for a variety of reasons we do not see the necessity for building societies to convert from mutual organisations into plcs. I know that the Minister is aware of some of the reasons that have been presented by the Opposition, but I hope that even at this late stage he will reconsider his decision.<br/>
Several points need to be made in connection with the process of conversion. First, during the progress of the Bill the Minister has considered in great detail what sort of


legislation is necessary for building societies and just how he can ensure that the legislation is correct and will not cause undue difficulties. However, he has not attended sufficiently to the fact that changes in the nature of the building societies are being proposed and will take effect shortly after other aspects of the financial markets will have undergone major changes. If nothing else, conversion to plcs ought to be postponed until one sees what the effects of the so-called big bang, due to take place at the end of October, will be. Therefore, I would recommend even more caution than the Minister has proposed.<br/>
Secondly, the proposal to allow the conversion to company status, taken together with the proposal to allow for contested mergers, can speed up the concentration of the number of building societies. Indeed, even without the provisions in the Bill, mergers are taking place, leading, for example, the chief executive of the Abbey National building society, Mr. Peter Birch, to say recently that he expected that over a period of 10 years there would be only five mega-building societies and possibly a number of smaller building societies.</p>

<p>I wonder whether the hon. Lady is aware that it is not only conversion that is the threat. New clause 16(3), which was not in the original Bill discussed in Committee, says that the successor company may be an existing company. In other words, an existing company, such as a foreign bank, may take over a building society even though it has not converted to plc status.</p>

<p>I thank the hon. Gentleman for making that point. I was about to move on to the problems that I consider are caused by takeovers. The two provisions in the Bill that I have mentioned can speed up the process that the hon. Gentleman has in mind, although, as he rightly says, it can happen without conversion to company status. That is a matter of concern.<br/>
I am concerned because I believe that over a period of time, though obviously not immediately after the Bill takes effect &#x2014; probably in April next year &#x2014; we will find ourselves with a small number of large financial institutions. Because of the possibility of the takeover of existing building societies by foreign banks&#x2014;we know that some foreign banks, such as Citicorp and Standard Chartered have already shown their interest in this matter &#x2014; we shall have a small number of financial institutions, large in size, but without any particular commitment to the provision of finance for housing. They will obviously continue to offer mortgages, because I think that the mortgage market will continue to grow for the rest of this century, but they will have no prime commitment to housing.</p>

<p>It is true that other organisations also offer mortgages. For many years we have had the benefit of a range of institutions primarily concerned with financing housing. As we know, the Bill allows building societies to provide other financial services. The building

societies have enormous assets&#x2014;&#x00A3;100 billion. This is an important source of finance to be concentrated on the provision of housing, either through mortgages, or through the provision of something which we in the Labour party strongly favour&#x2014;housing provided through part equity and part rent. This enables young couples especially to purchase their first house more easily than by raising the deposit for a mortgage or by facing the prospect of a 100 per cent. mortgage.</p>

<p>The hon. Lady has obviously studied the matter more thoroughly than I have, but my understanding is that under subsection (3) it would be possible for Citibank to buy the Halifax building society in its present form. There seems to be a real threat, which must be considered carefully.</p>

<p>I think the hon. Gentleman is unaware that that point was made earlier and that I accepted it. I am trying to develop the argument that conversion to plc status will also facilitate the process. That is why I have argued against that point of view. I have argued the possibility that large financial institutions may not have the commitment to housing that building societies have.<br/>
The point has been made that building societies need the possibility of such conversion to provide themselves with adequate capital funds, despite the fact that the Building Societies Association, in its bulletin of October 1985, stressed that owing to the mutual nature of the building societies they were readily able to raise funds, and had successfully done so, on the wholesale market. The argument that conversion to plc status is necessary to provide building societies with adequate funds is one that we need not take too seriously.<br/>
I cannot understand the Government's prejudice against the continued existence of mutual organisations. It is a perfectly proper, respectable and successful alternative to company status. Why not encourage its continued existence? It is true that criticisms can be made of the nature of the mutuality of building societies. Perhaps that was not the case in years gone by when building societies were smaller. Nevertheless, building societies have been able to concern themselves to a greater extent with social objectives, with concerns and needs, of which housing is a fundamental aspect. Conversion of building societies to plc status and being swallowed up by banks which are concerned, not with the social need of housing but with all kinds of financial provision, and so on, is a step backwards, and not a step forwards.<br/>
For the reasons that I have outlined briefly &#x2014; the argument was put both on Second Reading and in Committee &#x2014; the Opposition are firmly convinced that the provisions in the new clauses are wrong. Therefore, we shall reject and vote against them.</p>

<p>I shall not approach the subject as analytically and with the same economic expertise as the hon. Member for Thurrock (Dr. McDonald), but I agree with much of what she said. I think that on a point of detail the hon. Lady was wrong to advise the House that the Standard Chartered bank was a foreign bank. I am reliably informed by my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow (Mr. Cockeram) that the Standard Chartered bank is British, is proud to be British and hopefully will remain British. I agree with some of the hon. Lady's sentiments. I approach the matter from the point of view of sentiment.<br/>
Although the Bill, in broad terms, will enable building societies to extend into a much broader field, way beyond the definition of mutuality &#x2014; with which I have no quarrel whatsoever&#x2014;I am concerned that new clause 16 could, in certain circumstances, enable our much-loved building societies, which many of us associate with our towns, counties and regions, to become multinationals. It might be fine for certain large building societies to become part of the First National Bank of Chicago, but it would not necessarily be right for the Staffordshire building society to do so, because it might become a nameless and faceless subsidiary of a nameless and faceless multinational which breaks the link between the borrower and the lender. I believe that the link between the borrower and the lender is a fundamental, vital and almost unquantifiable benefit of the building society movement as we know it today.<br/>
5.45 pm<br/>
Perhaps I can illustrate the point by narrating a story that was told to me by the chairman of one of the major building societies at the recent annual conference of the Building Societies Association held in Bournemouth. He reminded me of a lady who went into her local branch of his building society wanting to withdraw &#x00A3;1,000 from her savings account. She had only about &#x00A3;1,000 in her account. She said to the counter clerk, "Do not worry, young man. I only want that money to buy clothes and books for my daughter who is going to university in September. I promise you that I shall put the money back as soon as I can." The lady had a direct relationship with, and a direct loyalty and obligation to, her building society. If she had been the customer of a bank, she would not have cared a tuppenny damn about putting back the money. There is not the same loyalty between a bank and its customers as there is between a building society and its customers. If that sense of mutality is broken, which the new clause will enable financial institutions to do, that link of loyalty, which is inestimable, will be broken.<br/>
What worries me about the clause is that it is not only another lending institution, another savings institution, or another bank that will be enabled to take over a building society. As I understand it, any company&#x2014;national, international or multinational&#x2014;could do so. Therein lies a real cause for concern.<br/>
In my constituency of Mid-Staffordshire, the much-loved and very British 200-year-old company of Wedgwood is under threat of takeover by the London International Group, formerly known as the London Rubber Company. No doubt it is well known and much respected for producing certain rubber goods to meet the everyday requirements of some people, but what expertise and qualifications does that American-owned company have for taking over a ceramics company that manufactures tableware that hon. Members in this and another place use every day? The company has no real understanding of the highly specialised, top-market sector of the industry.<br/>
What about job security? What undertaking would the company give to the shareholders and employees of Wedgwood if other parts of that conglomerate play-pen based in the United States or elsewhere were to fall prey to the international economic recession? What job and economic security would the shareholders of that company have? Let us suppose that the London International Group, formerly known as the London Rubber Company, took

over the Goldhawk building society, the Staffordshire building society or the Abbey National building society. Let us assume that there was a down-turn in the market for rubber gloves in Ohio or elsewhere and the company was forced into liquidation. In what position would that leave the borrowers of mortgages from the Goldhawk building society, the Staffordshire building society or the Abbey National building society?<br/>
Let us take the example of a constituent of mine who falls, through no fault of his or her own, into arrears. He or she does not have the same relationship with the local manager, because the local manager does not have the same relationship with head office, because head office is not situated in Stafford, Birkenhead or Burgess Hill. It is probably somewhere in Baltimore or Boston, and so there is not the same link, loyalty or understanding between lender and borrower as was highlighted in the case of the lady who wanted to borrow &#x00A3;1,000 to provide books and clothes for her undergraduate daughter.<br/>
I am concerned about the new clause. I did not serve on the Committee, and so I did not have an opportunity to express these views. However, I expressed them to members of the BSA at the annual conference of the Metropolitan Association of Building Societies. I hope that my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary will consider those points and will withdraw the new clause to allow further debate within the building society movement and to allow wider debate, as the hon. Member for Thurrock said, after the big bang. Incidentally, that big bang may well turn out to be a little whimper. The new clause could then be reintroduced, in the light of experience, in the other place.</p>

<p>I agree with what my hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock (Dr. McDonald) and the hon. Member for Mid-Staffordshire (Mr. Heddle) have said. The hon. Gentleman was absolutely right about the building societies. People invest their savings in building societies rather than in banks partly because, as the hon. Gentleman said, there is a mutuality of trust and understanding between the society and its customer. That mutuality is never felt between a bank, even a small bank, and its customer. The investor in the building society knows that his money is not only safe but will be used to provide a mortgage to give someone a home. The investor can feel quite proud of his investment.<br/>
I imagine that the new clause was initiated by the Treasury rather than by the BSA or individual building societies. I do not know who asked for it, but it can only be the Treasury that wants to convert building societies into plcs. Apart from the Treasury, I do not know of anyone who wants the new clause. But perhaps we are worrying unduly. After all, the new clause requires that 20 per cent. of the building society's subscribers must vote and that 75 per cent. of them must agree before the society can be converted into a limited company. It takes some doing to persuade 20 per cent. of borrowers to vote. Big societies have run major campaigns but have not managed to get even 10 per cent. to vote.</p>

<p>I do not know about that, but I agree with the hon. Member for Mid-Staffordshire that those who vote will do so out of loyalty to their society, and so will not want it to be turned into a limited company.<br/>
Moreover, the new clause gives the Treasury power, by negative resolution of the House, to alter that 20 per cent. figure. If building societies could not get 20 per cent. of their members to vote, or anything like that number, would the Treasury reduce the figure to 10 per cent. or 5 per cent.? If so, there is a grave danger of that mutuality disappearing. We want building societies to be brought into the modern world. That is what the Bill is about. We want to transform the 1871 Act into a 1986 Act in order to allow building societies to compete in the modern world, but we also want to preserve the peculiarly British nature of building societies and to retain that mutuality. I fear that the new clause, which has been introduced solely at the whim of the Government, could destroy that mutuality.</p>

<p>I merely wish to ask my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary two questions which I would have asked during his speech if he had given way. First, why do we want to allow companies which are not building societies to buy building societies, including those which have not converted? It would be interesting to know the reasons for that. Secondly, there is a technical problem with new clause 19. Subsection (4) specifies the bribes that may be paid to people voting for or against converting a building society into a plc. I have been over this issue with people in the BSA and in building societies, and none of us can make head nor tail of it.<br/>
Half the time the new clause appears to say that bribes can be paid only to people who have less than &#x00A3;100 in the building society, and thus to people who do not qualify to vote. I refer to subsection (2)<i>(b),</i> which is qualified by subsection (4). In other parts, the new clause seems to suggest that payments could be made to people with more than &#x00A3;100 in the building society. Clearly it is important that building societies should know exactly what the new clause means. I should be grateful if my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary would explain it to me now. If he has as much difficulty as the rest of us in understanding its drafting, perhaps he will drop a line to me and to the BSA.</p>

<p>I did not like the idea of a building society converting to plc status when it was discussed in Committee. I think that the provision has been reintroduced because several Conservative Back Benchers did not like the idea either. Treasury Ministers felt that they had to assuage in some way their Back Benchers' feelings. Indeed, the hon. Member for Mid-Staffordshire (Mr. Heddle) has outlined some of the concerns.<br/>
I found the Economic Secretary's reasoning rather faulty &#x2014; and I am being generous to him. He had already made up his mind. Yet he came to the House and told us that he did not have much to say today, but that he would listen, as though he might be converted at the end of the debate. Judging by his actions and statements, and by the way that he dealt with the subject today, it is obvious that his mind is made up.<br/>
Like my right hon. Friend the Member for Halton (Mr. Oakes), I just wonder what has generated this great desire for conversion. That word conversion makes people think immediately of some religious connotation, as though conversion would be a bracing experience for everybody. But it will be nothing of the kind. We are really talking about immersion, whereby the whole character of the building society movement will be changed. I suspect that

the building society movement will be led away from its original purpose, which was to finance house purchase and home improvements. There is a danger that following the helter skelter towards conversion, as the Treasury puts it, we shall end up with more banks than the economy requires.<br/>
The Economic Secretary has never fully dealt with how he thinks that the building society movement will benefit from this proposed change. He has not really answered the points that have been made, not only today but in Committee, about whether, in the long run, this will strengthen the building society movement or, as many of us believe, will weaken and divert the building society movement from its purpose.<br/>
6 pm<br/>
Like my right hon. Friend the Member for Halton, I have a non-pecuniary interest as an honorary vice-president of the Building Societies Association, but that does not mean that I cannot say what I think, and I think that the United Kingdom does not need any more clearing banks. The Economic Secretary has somewhat fogged the issue of principle by the way that he has tried to impose his ideas on conversion of building societies to company status, and even by the way in which the consultative paper came up out of the blue. People were told that it will be a great thing if the Government allow building societies to become companies, when, for many years, they have been functioning satisfactorily as mutualities.<br/>
Like my right hon. Friend the Member for Halton, I agree that there is a need for improvement, but there is great danger that if the Government have their way in the new clause this will reduce the potential that is available to the ordinary man or woman to acquire housing finance either for home purchase or improvement. I fully support the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock (Dr. McDonald).</p>

<p>It is important that the Labour party adds its voice to the doubts that have been expressed by Conservative Members. Given that the Minister heard so many hostile speeches. and that so many critical doubts were raised on this matter, I would find it surprising if he persevered with this new clause, for which there is no great need. He said that he was open to argument and would listen to it, but as he has not listened to the serious doubts raised in Committee, he will not be listening to the arguments now. He will not be accommodating himself to the views of the House and his party but will be steamrolling the clause through with the backing of the Government's majority. That is wrong.<br/>
It is important that the Labour party emphasises its opposition to the nature of this proposal. If the Minister perseveres with it, we shall vote against the new clause. I hope that he will make some accommodation to the doubts that have been expressed. We are talking about a substantial change in the nature of building societies for which no good reason has been given.<br/>
I do not see pressure from the building societies for this. I know that some would like to spread out into the financial services sector, but they wish to do so always on the basis of the organisation and principle from which they sprang, the good, sound and extremely important basis of mutual principles. That differentiates them from other predatory financial institutions which are much more the embodiment of organised greed.<br/>
Why are the Government allowing this important principle to be undermined? The Minister has given no adequate reason for taking an axe to the whole trunk of the building society movement. That movement involves people who have a habit of thinking in terms of their building society and feeling some participation in it, even if they do not attend meetings and take but little interest. That is important to maintain because it conditions the thinking of the people who run the building societies. We should not like to see their transformation into just another predatory financial institution, working for their own interests and those of organised greed.<br/>
In Committee, we argued about whether building societies were Socialism in action or capitalism in action at the level of the ordinary man. The mutual principle means that they are at the level of ordinary man, and we want to keep them there and keep their unique nature. That is a strong reason for voting against the new clause.</p>

<p>I am disturbed by what I have heard in the debate. I did not serve on the Committee and I came into the Chamber to listen to the debate and speak later. However, I now have some questions to ask my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary to which I would like a reply.<br/>
Can my hon. Friend give reasons for the policy contained in this new clause? Is it a fact that building societies, on conversion, can he taken over not only by banks and other companies in the United Kingdom but by banks in other countries? If that is so, would we not possibly face, in some years' time, the situation in which the major building societies were owned by a number of dominant banking groups, and the ownership of the societies, taken together with the business that such companies already transact in the market, might produce an even more dominant position?<br/>
I am concerned about the possibility that our building societies might be owned by consortia of American or Community banks. The unique feel that the building societies have for most people might then be diminished. What are the reasons for that policy? I was not aware of its inclusion in the Bill when it was originally published, and so I am rather surprised to find ourselves debating it now.<br/>
I should also like my hon. Friend to comment on the approval that needs to be given for such transfer by the members. As I understand it, the conversion requires a 20 per cent. vote of which 15 per cent. must be in the affirmative. In many cases, borrowing members of building societies will take the lead from the chairman of that society and from others who recommend a particular course of action. Many of them will cast their votes in accordance with advice, while others will take advice from their professional advisers, whether banks, solicitors, accountants or whoever may advise them. Is my hon. Friend satisfied that, in the event of such a major step being contemplated by a society, the ordinary members of the building societies who not only support them with their savings but depend upon them for their mortgages will be fully informed and able to play an active role in making decisions of this magnitude?</p>

<p>I begin by saying in self-defence to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Craigen) that it seemed to me proper to introduce the new clause briefly so that the House could have an opportunity to

debate it properly before I attempted to respond to the questions. I am not sure whether he would have been any happier if I had tried to respond to the questions before hon. Members had had a chance to put them. However, my attempt at courtesy to the House has been misunderstood, so I hope that it will accept that that is what I had in mind.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Shersby) said that he had recently come into the Chamber and was disturbed by what he had heard. He has every right to be disturbed because the case has been overstated. I recognise the anxieties that have been expressed on both sides of the House, as I recognised them in Committee. The Government have been mindful of the controversial nature of conversion, not only back to the original introduction of the Bill, when we published the discussion document about these proposals, but back to the earlier Green Paper and the earlier stages of the discussion, We need to measure the likely developments of the building society movement against the actual impact of the proposals that are included in the new clauses.<br/>
I thought that the right hon. Member for Halton (Mr. Oakes) was fair minded when he said that in practice these would be difficult criteria to meet. One has to accept that the whole debate should be in the context of the fact that these proposals are not meant to be an easy option. They are not proposals that can be lightly nodded through by a few members without the general support of the membership of the societies.<br/>
However, I must put the right hon. Gentleman right about one point. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Craigen) raised the same point. They said that nobody wants these proposals, that they have been cooked up by the Treasury and that the Government do not have many supporters for them. These proposals were first put forward by the Building Societies Association, of which the right hon. Member for Halton is a distinguished vice-president, in its 1983 discussion paper. In its brief for the Report stage of the Bill, the Building Societies Association says:
<q>The Association considers that it is necessary to have a procedure by which a building society can convert to another corporate form with the agreement of its members, although it doubts whether many societies will wish to consider this option.</q>
That is probably a fair and balanced assessment of what is likely to happen. The Government's proposals&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>In a moment, when I have finished my sentence.<br/>
The Government's proposals have been designed to strike exactly this balance between not making this process impossible and at the same time imposing quite significant requirements. In her opening remarks the hon. Lady was good enough to say that she accepted the fact that I had been under some pressure to make the requirements less stringent but that I had resisted that pressure.</p>

<p>The Minister referred to the BSA report. I think I am correct in saying that in mentioning the 1983 report the Minister was referring to the extremely ambitious Spalding report, which was much modified in later reports by the BSA as to how it viewed the future. The Spalding report was over-ambitious and was very much watered down in later BSA reports. Therefore, it is not fair to take the BSA's Spalding report as a guide. To my knowledge, it has been primarily the Abbey National


building society that has favoured conversion status. Belatedly, possibly feeling that it must follow in the footsteps of the Abbey National building society, the Halifax building society has come round that point of view.</p>

<p>I do not want to spend too long on the history of this matter. However, I have been told that it was dreamt up by the Treasury. I have pointed out that it has a longer history and that originally this idea was initiated by the Building Societies Association. I accept the hon. Lady's point that in its latest form the association is not quite so enthusiastic about the idea as it was originally, but that does not mean that the BSA believes that this route should not be open at all. I find myself very much in agreement with the Building Societies Association about this.<br/>
I do not think that our proposals are likely to lead to any great rush to conversion. Indeed, I should not have wanted them to be formulated in the way in which they are formulated if that had been the likely consequence. However, I agree with the right hon. Member for Halton and with the Building Societies Association in its note to hon. Members that this is not an option that many societies will want to consider.<br/>
In some quarters I have been strongly criticised for making the requirements far too difficult. In other quarters I have been criticised for apparently making it possible for a mad rush to take place by the whole of the building society movement towards conversion. My view is that the truth, as is so often the case, lies in between the two, and that the proposals that we have put forward are realistic. They are not permissive, in the sense that they make it easy for members of building societies to take the decision to convert. At the same time, they are not unattainable.<br/>
The hon. Member for Thurrock (Dr. McDonald) suggested that I might have some prejudice against mutual status. That is certainly not the case. The hon. Member for Maryhill asked how these proposals would strengthen the building society movement. I have the same respect for the building society movement as he has. I appreciate the qualities of loyalty and the traditions that have given the building society movement its strength. I do not wish to dismantle all that. Certainly I do not want an Act that I have taken through this House to be on the statute book which would lead to such a consequence. There are many provisions in the Bill which strengthen the concept of mutuality. I do not intend to rehearse them now, but they give members a greater opportunity to take part in the affairs of building societies. They also give members better opportunities to vote on issues than they have ever had under the existing legislation. Therefore, I do not think that I can fairly be accused of doing anything to dismantle the mutual principle. Indeed, I hope that we have given it a new strength and a new lease of life.</p>

<p>I still do not follow the argument on the central point of why the mutuality principle should be weakened in any way.

<p>I think that I ought to resist following too far the imagery that the hon. Gentleman has conjured up, particularly in view of the nature of the bidder for Wedgwood, and various other matters that have been brought into the debate.<br/>
However, let me reflect for a moment on the point that the hon. Gentleman has raised, because it is important. We have had to face a problem in trying to legislate for the building society movement. I am sure that it is necessary at this stage to have a single legislative framework for building societies. Building societies can be very large, national institutions, or they can be small local or regional societies. Their needs are diverging.<br/>
If the option of conversion under certain circumstances had not been available, it would probably have been necessary to draft a Bill that went wider as to the business that can be conducted by building societies as mutual institutions in order to take account of the realities of the situation and of the way in which the financial markets are developing. The building societies must continue to compete in that market. It is no good saying, on grounds of sentimentality, or whatever it may be, that all building societies have been lovely in the form in which they have existed for more than 100 years and that we want them to stay that way, regardless of whether they will be able to attract the necessary funds for future mortgage lending if they stay exactly as they have been for all that time.<br/>
We came to the conclusion that it would be right to allow a degree of flexibility within the Bill so that further stages of relaxation and gradual evolution could be permitted over the years and that it would also be right to allow the small and very limited number of societies that might feel they are too much constrained by the legislation &#x2014;perhaps because they need further capital to compete on the scale on which they are conducting their business &#x2014; to convert themselves into limited companies and therefore to be able to step outside the framework of building society legislation. That enables us to maintain one regime for all societies. It is a better solution than either constricting societies too much or widening the provisions of the Bill in such a way that many other societies that do not want to convert might then lose their identity and change their nature very much more rapidly than any right hon. or hon. Member would like them to do.</p>

<p>What my hon. Friend has just said does not put my mind at rest. I have listened very carefully to what he said. He says that he respects, but does not believe that he can be persuaded by, the views expressed by hon. Members and me on this aspect, because the Building Societies Association says that if this new clause is carried tonight it will relate only to one or two societies. I do not believe that to be a particularly valid argument. It was Adam who is reputed to have said to Eve, "You know, my dear, we are living in changing times." What may be true today may not be true this time next month. The permission that the House might give to the building societies industry if it passes this new clause this evening is not simply, as I understand it. to allow building societies to change from being mutual societies to public liability companies. That I can live with. I can understand why building societies might wish to do that for the reasons that my hon. Friend has just given. It will enable them to raise capital and meet much more easily the requirements of those who want to buy houses. I stand corrected if my hon.


Friend can persuade me, but I believe that the clause goes much further. It will enable building societies, having become plcs, then to become subsidiaries of multinational conglomerates whose prime function may have nothing whatever to do with the provision of&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

I now come to the next general point which was raised in the debate and which my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Staffordshire has now underlined, and that is the terms on which building societies could convert to companies and the safeguards and requirements for support from members to enable them to do so.<br/>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Shersby) reminded the House, it is necessary in order to pass the resolution for conversion that 75 per cent. of those investing members of a society who vote should vote in favour of it. That is a prime requirement. It is also a prime requirement that more than 50 per cent. of borrowing members should also support such a resolution. That is an innovation in this legislation. Borrowing members have never before had significant rights in building societies, certainly not statutory rights which must apply to all societies. We have carefully introduced this because we

think that it is important when considering the possibility of changing the nature of a society from mutual status to incorporation that the borrowers should be happy with what is proposed. In many ways they are much more locked into the society than investing members. That provision has been generally welcomed.<br/>
In addition to that, we have a requirement that at least 20 per cent. of the members should vote and take part. The reason for that is that we do not believe that a significant change of the kind that is involved in moving from mutual status to a company should be taken without the active participation of a considerable proportion of members. There has been a lot of dispute about the 20 per cent. As the hon. Member for Thurrock reminded the House, there has been considerable pressure from certain quarters to reduce that figure because it has been described as an impossible hurdle. One should not necessarily go on the basis of experience. I hope that under the provisions of the Bill when enacted building societies will be encouraged to communicate much more frequently with their members. The relationship between the societies and their members will be strengthened by the very fact that societies will be able to offer more services and it will therefore be in their own commercial interests to communicate with members. That is one of the fundamental purposes of the Bill.<br/>
The climate in which building societies encourage members to take a greater interest in their affairs means that the threshold of 20 per cent. should be at a level which is higher than that which has been generally achieved in certain merger resolutions in the past. The cultural change which will follow from the implementation of the Act w ill move in that direction and therefore it is right that the hurdle should be at a level that is not prohibitive but certainly demanding.</p>

<p>Will my hon. Friend explain the apparent inconsistency in his argument? On the one hand he is putting forward the argument that this fundamental change is desirable and on the other hand he is going on to explain how difficult it will be to bring about that so-called desirable change. If he believes that this is so desirable, surely he should be making it easier. If, on the other hand, he is seeking to make it difficult, why is he introducing it at all?</p>

<p>With great respect, my hon. Friend is putting words into my mouth. I never said that the change itself was desirable. I said it was desirable that there should be an option for that change to take place if members of a particular society wished it to happen. That is a different matter. The level of approval should not be prohibitive and I do not believe that the level of 20 per cent. is prohibitive. Equally, the possibility should not be excluded, and in that I agree with the Building Societies Association.<br/>
I must deal briefly with the question of takeover by public companies. That matter has caused a good deal of concern on both sides of the House.</p>

<p>What sort of criteria does the Minister have in mind for a future Government, in co-operation with the commission, varying that 20 per cent. to possibly a much lower figure by negative resolution of either House, which would seriously undermine what we are talking about today?</p>

<p>I can speak only for myself. We have no expectation of altering that figure. I have been under some


pressure to say that we would do so and to list the terms and conditions which would encourage us to do so. I do not want anyone, inside or outside the House, to get the impression that that figure is just a cockshy which we expect to change in a few months' time. It is not that at all. We believe that that is the right figure. If in the fullness of time the figure appeared to be wrong, it could be changed, but I do not think that the only factor to take into account would be the percentages achieved in particular cases. In addition to that, we would have to take into consideration the development of the building society movement and whether we wanted to change and make easier this particular form of conversion. As I say, in the foreseeable future we have no intention of doing that.<br/>
6.30 pm<br/>
Some rather worrying comments have been made by a number of hon. Members about takeovers. They have said that there might be takeovers by unsuitable bodies such as large foreign banks. I draw their attention to the practical provisions that are set out in the clauses and the demanding nature of the figures which are included in them. If there were to be a takeover by a limited company, 50 per cent. of members of a society would be required to vote in favour and not 75 per cent. of members with a threshold of 20 per cent. If I am told that 20 per cent. is unobtainable by those in some quarters, 50 per cent. would be a much more difficult hurdle to surmount. As an alternative, a takeover would have to be approved by the holders of 90 per cent. of the shares of a society, which again is an extremely high figure. It is the same figure as is required to trigger the special resolution procedure for the acquisition of an outstanding minority in the Companies Act in a takeover. As there are so many more shareholders in a building society than in a limited company, the percentage is very much more difficult to meet.<br/>
As the Government share the anxieties that have been expressed by some hon. Members and those of the building society movement that predators could move in on them, we have provided that takeovers may take place only in extreme circumstances where the overwhelming body of the members of a society want it to happen, and in practical terms I cannot see any likely prospect of that happening for a long time. Meanwhile, there will be a 15 per cent. minimum on any shareholding for the first five years of a building society's existence as a public company.<br/>
Taken together, I think that the proposals strike the right balance. The fact that the Government have been criticised from opposite directions for the measures that we are bringing forward reassures me that we have taken into account all the conflicting views which have been expressed on this difficult and contentious issue. Accordingly, I commend the clause to the House.</p>

<p>I listened carefully to the Minister's reply and he revealed even more greatly his uncertainties about the measure that he is proposing. It has been rightly said by a Conservative Member that, on the one hand, the Minister is committed to allowing this process of change to take place while, on the other, he is uncertain about its usefulness and rightness and is trying to put as many obstacles in its way as possible. I hope that the House will

put a proper obstacle in the way of conversion to plc status because the Opposition intend to vote against all the new clauses that will allow that process to take place.</p>

<speech hansard_id="414470" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1986-06-04a.950.0" hansard_membership_id="5728" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/32929" speakername="Mr. Christopher Hawkins" colnum="950" time="18:15:00">
<p>I remind my hon. Friend the Minister that, on behalf of a number of building societies, I asked whether he would explain the meaning of subsection (4) of new clause 19. When can bribes be paid to people to vote for conversion? Can a bribe be paid only to those with less than &#x00A3;100 in a society? Can it be paid only to those who have been in the society for more than two years? Before we vote on the new clause, we should understand what lies behind it.<br/>
When the hon. Member for Thurrock (Dr. McDonald) said that the new clause had been bounced in by the Treasury, I did not think that she was referring to conversion, which has been mentioned at times with support by the BSA. Who asked whether a company should be allowed to buy a building society which is mutual? The issue did not come before those who considered the Bill in Committee. That is the answer to those who say that it is a pity they were not members of the Committee. We are faced with a new clause on Report. In Committee, we understood that companies did not have the ability to buy building societies that had not converted. The position in Committee was that once conversion had taken place there could be a takeover. That was because the society had plc status. The position now is that a company can take over a building society, even if it has not converted.</p>

<p>I apologise to my hon. Friend for not responding to his question on new clause 19. I had intended to do so, but I was somewhat diverted by those of my hon. Friends who intervened in my reply. I shall write to the building societies, the BSA and to my hon. Friend on that issue. His other question was fully explained in the consultation document that we put forward in December.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br/>
The text and scope of this clause make its aims and intentions clear and straightfoward. I hope that the broad aims of the clause will be supported by the House.<br/>
The clause makes provision for at least one director on the board of directors to be elected by the employees of a building society, provided that society has more than 50 employees. We are talking about the principle of employee directors.<br/>
Once that principle is grasped, the rest is administrative apparatus. Thus the new clause makes separate provision for this to be done outside clause 34 which lays down the main framework for elections to boards of directors.<br/>
I should like to come to the brass tacks of the case. On many occasions hon. Members have paid tribute to the success of building societies in the cause of owner occupation and in terms of service to the public. I am certain that the Opposition will be supported by hon. Members in all parts of the House. A great deal of the success of building societies is due to the dedicated, efficient and conscientious service that their employees give to the public. Such service is to be found from the counter staff to the most senior levels of management.<br/>
The skills and enormous experience of the people who work for the building societies would be invaluable in making the societies' services more available to the public. These are the people who do the day-to-day work and take the day-to-day decisions. They come face to face with the public every day, and they have a feeling for the local communities that they serve. It would be quite in character for building societies to be warmly receptive to the basic idea of this new clause.<br/>
Building societies grew up as part of the self-help movement in Britain, and they still adhere to that principle. They are still described as mutual institutions. There was a great deal of reassurance in Committee that the building society movement, although there are changes taking place, still remains firmly part of the mutal framework of Britain. There could be no better demonstration of mutuality than the acceptance of the principle that employees should be elected to and serve the boards of directors of building societies.<br/>
It has been said that building societies are entering a rougher and more competitive world. That is certainly true. But one thing is even more certain: that when the changes come the employees of building societies will be the first to take the flak. The new clause will enable employees to face those changes with a great deal more confidence. If takeovers occur and if opposed mergers are successful, there will be redundancies and unemployment, and those things will take place in the name of rationalisation. There will be difficulties, but if employees are directly represented on boards of directors they will be more confident in being able to face those problems and protect themselves. The best way to do that is to ensure that they have a say in strategic and policy decisions at director level.<br/>
I move the new clause with some optimism but rather doubtful experience, because when I moved a similar clause on the Trustee Savings Bank Bill some years ago I lost. I hope for better luck this time. The case for the clause is strong. As I have said, building societies are mutual institutions, and I am seeking to establish a democratic and mutual principle. I have read briefs advancing the argument that there is no demand for employee participation at director level. The argument is that, because there is no demand, we ought not to do anything about it. If everything had to be created by demand, few political speeches would ever be made. The argument about demand is not one that politicians can accept.<br/>
The idea of employee directors is good in principle, and I hope that the Government will accept it. The Opposition

will certainly go into the Lobby in support of the clause because changes of this kind are long overdue, especially in mutual institutions. The staff of building societies have a fundamental interest in the future of their societies, and that should be recognised in the legislation. New clause 1 goes a substantial part of the way towards bringing that about. It is said that if building society employees are elected to boards of directors they will inevitably take a sectional view of the business of building societies. My answer to that is that building society employees, with their record of service to the public, are just as capable as anyone else of taking a broad rather than a sectional view.<br/>
There is great strength in this clause. I hope that the House will accept it.</p>

<p>I support what has been so ably said by the hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch). I am glad that the Government are paying much more attention to worker participation, profit sharing and employee share ownership. Surely the natural response to the new clause should be to accept it and agree that in future building societies should make provision for an employee director where the society directly employs more than 50 people. The arguments for that have already been advanced. We discussed it briefly in Committee, although we did not make much progress. I hope that today this proposal will be accepted, and that some thought has been given to it in the interim.<br/>
A great change is coming to all building society operations, especially housing financing. Professions, of one of which I am proud to be a member, will have to take a rather different role. Much more commerce will be involved in professions such as chartered surveying and the law. There will be greater competition. Banks and building societies will vie with one another. Building societies can now set up commercial institutions and businesses.<br/>
I entirely agree with the hon. Member for Ipswich that the employees of building societies, which may get very big&#x2014;we shall have much bigger ones yet and probably very few of them&#x2014;should have a firm stake in their company, with a director on the board. I hope that we shall have a positive response to the new clause. The time for such a move has long since passed.</p>

<p>The arguments have been extremely well and ably made by my hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch), who has taken a close and active interest in the Bill and in the principle of worker representation on the board. I remember the discussions on the Trustee Savings Banks Bill, which he mentioned.<br/>
It is important to put the principle into legislation. It is good to see the Government coming round to accepting some of the principles that we have argued for consistently, such as the ombudsman, which they have now accepted. I hope that this is another. It is right that there should be representation. Employees should have a channel of influence and the feeling of involvement that comes from it. They should be able to influence the organisation their way and advance their views. A legacy such as this has been conferred on much of West German industry, and it has worked extremely well. The form is peculiarly appropriate to building societies.<br/>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich said, the new clause would extend the principle of mutuality. There


has been a dramatic change in the nature of building societies from the small, intimate, almost paternalistic locally-based organisations at the beginning of the 1960s. There has been an enormous increase in the number of branches, but a rapid shrinkage in the number of building societies. Societies are now much bigger and employ far more people. There are problems of impersonality, remoteness and lack of contact which simply did not exist a couple of decades ago. In view of that change, we should provide the principle of employee representation in legislation. I should like it to be done voluntarily, but that has not happened.<br/>
As building societies are becoming much larger financial institutions, employing large numbers of people, we should provide, through legislation, a channel which will ultimately be accepted enthusiastically. I hope that the Government will accommodate themselves to the arguments. It would be rather a shame if the Minister merely played a straight bat, which the smile lingering around his face shows he might be intending to play. I hope that he will accept the force of the arguments&#x2014; building society employees do.</p>

<p>I have quickly removed the smile from my face, as I must advise the House not to accept the new clause. It is not that we have anything against the principle of employee involvement. We favour it and have taken several steps to encourage it, but I see no logic in applying the obligation just to building societies and not to companies and other organisations, and I am not convinced that the best way in which to promote employee involvement is to impose statutory obligations such as are suggested.<br/>
The hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) rightly said that one of the strengths of the building society movement is its staff. They have strong roots in the local community and are popular. They have achieved that status without the benefit of the new clause. I did not follow the hon. Gentleman's logic which led him to believe that we must now impose a statutory obligation on building societies if that high reputation and commitment are to be maintained.<br/>
We have heard no explanation of why such a requirement should be put on building societies but not on companies generally. If we make such provision, it should apply equally across the corporate sector. It is illogical to single out the building societies.</p>

<p>There are ombudsman arrangements for other services. One of the reasons why we introduced an ombudsman service in the Bill was the feeling on both sides of the Committee that there should be a statutory ombudsman service. Such provision is unnecessary in other sectors, as there is already a voluntary service. If other parts of the private sector want to implement the ombudsman principle, the Government would be delighted and would not stand in the way of that being done. We do not accept, however, that the nature of building societies is so different from the rest of the corporate sector that we must single them out and impose on them a statutory obligation of an employee director.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend knows that I am a vice-president of the Building Societies Association. Can he confirm that there is another matter that ought to be considered? Not everybody accepts that the best way for the interests of employees to be considered is for one of them to be on the hoard of directors. The idea is not accepted unanimously by the trades union movement, for example.</p>

<p>Indeed. As I said earlier, there are two objections. The first is the somewhat narrow one that there is no reason to single out the building societies, and the second, more general one is whether, if one believes in employee involvement&#x2014;which the Government do&#x2014; this is the right way in which to proceed. Provisions consolidated in schedule 7 to the Companies Act 1985 require companies with more than 250 employees to report annually on the development of their arrangements for providing regular information to employees, for consulting them and for involving them in the company's affairs. Parallel provisions for building societies could be introduced by the commission's regulation-making powers. I am aware that the present chief registrar, as first commissioner, intends to recommend to the commission that similar provision should be made. Parity of treatment in that way seems entirely desirable.<br/>
The Government do not believe that imposing statutory obligations on organisations to have employee representatives is the right way forward. As my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton (Mr. Latham) said, some trade union representatives do not believe that that is the best way in which to proceed. Employees and employers should work out between them arrangements which suit them best. We want to encourage that type of co-operation rather than impose a rigid statutory obligation which may not be appropriate.<br/>
Building society employees can always put themselves up for election to the board. A retired employee of the Abbey National got himself elected to the society's board at its annual general meeting earlier this year. That is a perfectly legitimate avenue, which is open to building society employees, to secure representation on the board. The policy of encouragement will be applied as much to societies as to companies&#x2014;the reporting requirement is evidence of that. For the reasons that I have given, the Government cannot support the case for the new clause.</p>

<p>I am completely unconvinced by the Minister's reply. Although I am saddened by his answer, I am not especially surprised by it. We are meeting the same stone wall on the Floor of the House as we met in Committee.<br/>
The Opposition are not singling out building societies in this respect. By adopting this approach we did not intend to saddle all other corporate organisations with the same obligations. When I put this case, I tried to argue that building societies purport to be mutual institutions and that one of the definitions of a mutual institution is that the affairs of the society are under the control of its members at all times. We believe that new clause 1 is the most effective way to bring that to pass.<br/>
We hope that the principle of industrial democracy, which we recommend in the clause, will become more widespread as the years pass. We believe that the building societies are a good place in which to make a start to achieve that industrial democracy.</p>

<p>It is nice to see the Solicitor-General in his place. We have crossed swords on this matter before. There was a cold wind of conflict in Committee, but with the new clause I seek to bring a warm breeze of conciliation in an attempt to find a way through some of the difficulties. I hope that when the Solicitor-General replies in the euphemistic prose of the Law Officers he will express some sympathy for what we have to say.<br/>
One of the great issues of contention in the Bill has been whether building societies should be able to offer

conveyancing services to borrowers. To put it simply, is it safe to obtain a mortgage and a conveyancing service from the same society? The main lines of argument have been debated a number of times both in the Chamber and in Committee. I do not intend to cover the ground in detail again, as the main lines of the disagreement are well marked out.<br/>
It remains our view that it is in the consumer's interest that building societies should be able to offer conveyancing services to borrowers. That is the principle of the argument and it is supported by the Consumers Association, the National Consumer Council and the Building Societies Association. In a Consumers Association survey in 1984, 81 per cent. of those interviewed said that they would be pleased to have building societies offering conveyancing services. Many thousands of owner-occupiers throughout the country would like to benefit from such services. It is not a matter of whether the Government or the Opposition want it. The consumer wants it. From the point of view of a consumer or free market society, the consumer is king, and if he or she wants the service that should be the deciding argument.<br/>
I will lay out briefly the basic framework of the case. First, there is considerable consumer demand for such a service. Many owner-occupiers would welcome a conveyancing service as part of a one-stop shopping package for housing services.<br/>
Secondly, there would be more freedom of choice for the consumer. That argument should appeal directly to the Government. At present, the consumer can choose an independent firm of solicitors. Shortly, he will be able to choose a firm of licensed conveyancers. The choice would be widened considerably if the consumer could use the same people through the medium of his building society.<br/>
Thirdly, such a change could lead to lower costs. The conveyancing industry in this country has long resembled the putting out system in the 18th century. Year after year, thousands of documents asking ritual questions are shuffled out from small workshops and thousands of other workshops return the same documents with ritual answers. Building societies offer scope for change with economies of scale and a large throughput of conveyances and mortgages with beneficial effects in terms of lower costs.<br/>
The main argument against the proposition has been that conflicts of interests will arise if the recipients of mortgage finance wish to use building society conveyancing services. I accept entirely that conflicts of interest may arise, but it is a quite different matter to suggest that they cannot be resolved, and we contest that argument at every stage.<br/>
The new clause seeks to provide yet another guarantee against any possible mal-effects of the very occasional conflicts of interest that may arise. Under clause 33(1) a building society is expressly forbidden to make the use of any conveyancing or other service obligatory because the consumer is in receipt of mortgage finance. Unfair pressure of that kind will be illegal, and the consumer will be totally free to go elsewhere if he or she wishes. That is the ultimate protection in a free market. If one does riot want the service, one goes elsewhere. That-should be good enough for any of us.<br/>
Moreover, the building societies will largely be using solicitors who have an established code of ethics and professional practice to deal with possible conflicts of interest. We are dealing not with fly-by-nights but with


professional people who have accepted practices which are ethical. If conflicts of interests arise, therefore, we look to the professional standards of those involved to find ways out of the difficulty. As I understand it, the Law Officers Department says that that is not the position. We beg to differ and we are putting forward a code of practice as a constructive way out of the difficulty.<br/>
I point out to the Solicitor-General that in the critical area of the mortgage deed and the terms of finance for the borrower, the same solicitor may already act for the building society and for the borrower in millions of transactions every year, and very few conflicts of interest arise.<br/>
7.30 pm<br/>
At the end of the day it is an argument not about conflicts of interest but about which organisation is to take the biggest share of the conveyancing market when it is opened up to free competition. The legal profession is trying to protect an established service which has always borne heavily on the owner-occupier.<br/>
To explain the basic principle of the clause, we are bending over backwards to meet every objection from the Lord Chancellor's Department. If the proposed code of practice is not right, we shall invite the Lord Chancellor to frame another. We cannot do more than that. The Solicitor-General may argue that it is impossible to frame any code of practice that would resolve conflicts of interest but we bee to differ. Conflicts of interest can be resolved.</p>

<p>The problem is that there is an inherent conflict of interest if somebody operates for a building society and also for the customer. In the code of practice it would be necessary to say that a solicitor, if he felt that there was a conflict of interest, should refuse to act for both parties. There could be a conflict of interest. Most of us believe that almost all societies are good and fair. But let us suppose that a society put some nasty clauses in its mortgage contract. Would a solicitor tell every customer about that? Would that society employ a solicitor who would tell customers about those nasty clauses? There would need to be a code of practice not for the solicitor but in regard to the mortgage contract. If we could get a sensible mortgage contract which we knew was decent, fair and above board, without onerous resettlement clauses and so on, we could say that that had got rid of the most important conflict of interest because the solicitor would no longer need to comment on the mortgage contract. That is the real conflict. I do not know how the hon. Gentleman's new clause would solve it.</p>

<p>I am grateful for the intervention, because it throws into sharp relief some of the issues that have to be debated. In the latter part of his remarks the hon. Gentleman may have pointed one way forward by proposing certain structural changes. Conflicts of interest do and will arise. Is there a way round them? The main consumer organisations think that there is, and they have put forward suggestions to the Lord Chancellor's Department. Perhaps we shall hear from the Solicitor-General about the to-ing and fro-ing that has been taking place. Consumer organisations and many members of the legal profession are confident that the conflict can be resolved.<br/>
The new clause provides for discussions with the Lord Chancellor's Department about what should go into the

code of practice in an attempt to find a way out of the difficulties. The Solicitor-General should accept that it shall not be illegal for a building society to offer conveyancing services to a recipient of mortgage finance.<br/>
The number of conflicts of interest will be very small, and it should not be beyond the wit of hon. Members to find a way out of the difficulties. Therefore, the new clause is put forward in the constructive hope that the Government will consider the whole point and say that in principle we are right, but they will think about the detail and bring forward a solution at a later stage.</p>

<p>I speak with a feeling of resignation, because we have been over the ground so many times. The arguments that we have put forward are accurate. I do not want them to be devalued by repetition, but they have to be put forward.<br/>
In attempting to stop a building society from doing conveyancing for people who are getting a mortgage from it. the Government are betraying the promises that were held out to me. It is being done on a specious pretext, in a strictly dishonourable fashion. That point has to be reiterated because of the way in which the Government have persevered in their position.<br/>
The Bill allows building societies to provide conveyancing services, but the Lord Chancellor has said that the regulations under which a society will be allowed to do so will be so defined that a society will be able to provide conveyancing services only for the customers of other building societies and not for its own customers. The principle is being conceded, but at the same time the Government are specifying that it will be under rules that will make the practice so unattractive that building societies will not do conveyancing. It is a confidence trick to fulfil the principle in such a fashion.<br/>
The Government are betraying the promises and pledges given to me by the Solicitor-General and reiterated in the House by the Prime Minister. There is no point in being mealy-mouthed about it. The Solicitor-General promised that building societies would be allowed to do conveyancing for their own customers, not for the customers of other building societies. It was clearly envisaged that that would be part of a comprehensive service provided by building societies. On the basis of those promises, I withdrew my House Buyers Bill early in 1984.<br/>
It was clear from the Solicitor-General's speech in Committee that the promises were validly made. I do not think that he has been converted to believe that the promises were wrong or that the practice cannot be conceded. He has simply been overruled by the Lord Chancellor. That is a strong argument for getting rid of that medieval anachronism and having a sensible Minister of Justice answerable to the House.<br/>
The Solicitor-General has been put in a difficult and embarrassing position. I sympathise with him, but at the same time he is betraying the promises that were held out to me. He may have been overruled by the Lord Chancellor and is not being allowed to fulfil those promises, but that was not made clear in Committee. He did not say, "I promise this but, of course, I cannot promise anything because my boss, the Lord Chancellor, can immediately tell me that black is white and I shall come to the House of Commons and say that black is


white." Since the Solicitor-General made the promise to me, the Lord Chancellor has begun to use the conflict of interest argument as a way of resiling from the promise.<br/>
That process is crude. It is clear that it is the Lord Chancellor and not anybody else who is doing this. Ministers in various Departments and former Ministers have said to me privately, "We know that you are right. It will come; do not get over-anxious and push it too far. It's Hailsham. We cannot do anything about it." Clearly the will of one man is being imposed in an area about which he has little background knowledge or information and for which he has no responsibility. He is arguing that customers of building societies should receive independent financial advice. That is a financial matter, not a legal one.<br/>
At the same time, the Lord Chancellor is betraying the Government's policy on competition. We seek to extend the principle of competition through the new clause by allowing more organisations to compete to serve consumers. I should have thought that the whole Government. apart from the Lord Chancellor, were committed to that principle.<br/>
That is the position, and it has been brought about by a dirty trick, a betrayal and by dishonourable behaviour by the Lord Chancellor. It is directly in his interests to behave in this fashion. It is possible that the income of solicitors will suffer if they lose conveyancing to building societies, but I do not think that they will. I believe that they will maintain a major share of this expanding and lucrative market.<br/>
Why should house buyers subsidise the provision of other legal services by solicitors, as they are being asked to do? Secondly, if the income of the profession suffers, it is the Lord Chancellor's responsibility to make it good by improving and extending the legal aid scheme. It is not our responsibility to give solicitors a feather bed to rely on financially to protect their income from competition. The Lord Chancellor's financial interest is that he is responsible for the allocation of legal aid. He is having difficulty in providing legal aid on the level that he would wish because there is a power in the land superior to the Lord Chancellor &#x2014; the Treasury &#x2014; which is saying, "Thou shalt not hand out this money."</p>

<p>That is right, and the Lord Chancellor is in hot water with the profession over those fees. It is wrong that that influence on the Lord Chancellor should lead him to say, "I shall protect the legal profession from this competition which might affect its income because I cannot make as full provision as I should under the legal aid scheme." The Lord Chancellor has a conflict of interests which is resolved in favour of his profession&#x2014; the legal profession. His motivation is extremely doubtful.<br/>
The conflict of interest argument which has been advanced for not allowing building societies to provide conveyancing services for their customers is spurious. It is only an excuse, and that is widely agreed by most knowledgeable people.</p>

<p>I am a solicitor, and I have listened with interest to what the hon. Gentleman has

said about a conflict of interests in the case of a solicitor acting for both a building society and a borrower. Does the hon. Gentleman think it would be a good idea for a solicitor to act for a client who is buying a house and for the builder who is selling the house? A great deal of money would be saved, but the Law Society does not allow that to happen because, in its wisdom, it believes that there will inevitably be a conflict of interests. If a solicitor acts on behalf of a builder, who may be an important client, he cannot pay proper attention to the individual who is buying from the builder. If a building society employed a solicitor to act for a purchaser, would that purchaser not he put in exactly the same position, and would that not be undesirable?</p>

<p>In answer to that I shall cite the reply of the BSA to the Lord Chancellor, who put forward the argument about conflicts of interest. The letter stated:
<q>the conflict of interest to which you refer arises regardless of the status of the conveyancer (i.e. independent or employed) if he has accepted instructions from both parties to the transaction. While in either case the ultimate paymaster is the borrower, in practice the only way of ensuring that a borrower receives totally independent advice is to incur the cost of separate professional advisers on both aspects of the transaction.</q>
In other words, a conveyancer can act for both parties, in which case there is a conflict of interests, and the Law Society does not stop that. Where a conflict of interests is resolvable in favour of an extra fee for a solicitor, it is permissible, but where it is in favour of an employed solicitor, it is not permissible. The argument folds on that basis and on the reality that people face when buying houses.<br/>
The <i>Which?</i> survey shows&#x2014;this fact is demonstrable from all our experiences &#x2014; that people go first to a building society and subsequently to a solicitor, whom they regard as a type of mechanic. He has a function, but it is less important than securing a mortgage. In most cases the terms of the mortgage are agreed before people go to a solicitor for the subordinate function of conveyancing. We are not talking about a world where people want or get independent financial advice.<br/>
In most aspects of the transaction the interests of the lender and borrower are identical. People expect to receive advice as purchasers about the property, but not as lenders or borrowers. Indeed, solicitors are not qualified to give independent financial advice about a mortgage. They do not have the experience, they are not financiers and they are not answerable for their financial advice. It has been argued that people need independent financial advice about a mortgage, but the evidence from surveys is that they do not want it or receive it. Therefore, the conflict of interests argument is specious.</p>

<p>The problem is not advice on the mortgage as such in the conventional sense. Almost all building societies and banks charge almost exactly the same interest rate. The customer wants and needs advice on the clauses in the mortgage contract because it is like no other contract that any of us ever signs. It does not specify the price of the purchase, but says that the purchaser will be charged an interest rate such as the building society may care to choose at any time during the following 25 years.<br/>
I am anxious that the hon. Gentleman should have his way on this matter, if we can resolve this issue. Some


building societies are charging different rates for old and new borrowers, so there is no safeguard on interest rates. If we could get a code of practice which stated that building societies must charge the same rate to both existing and new borrowers, the client would have the safeguard of knowing that he was being charged the market rate. In that case, I would not mind if solicitors did not comment on the contract, except in so far as some societies build in onerous resettlement clauses so that if a customer does not like his interest rate which may have been pushed higher for existing borrowers, a customer is partially locked in because it is expensive to re-contract.<br/>
If we can get round that problem, I would agree with the hon. Gentleman. I wish that he would comment on that because it is a conflict of interest for everyone who signs a mortgage contract, not only for a few.</p>

<p>That is a wide-ranging problem. It is a problem on which solicitors in independent practice do not give advice to their clients. Why, therefore, should that be singled out as an area in which only employed solicitors working for the building societies have to give advice and in which people are disbarred from turning to those employed solicitors by the conflict of interest in that area. That point is not valid because it applies to all solicitors. What might be valid in the hon. Gentleman's argument is that solicitors can advise on the terms of the mortgage. That is another point. But it is interesting to note from studies carried out by building societies of their customers &#x2014;the Halifax building society surveyed its customers and, more importantly, its branches&#x2014;that solicitors do not give advice on the terms of the mortgage. That is the important issue. It is so rare for advice to be given that, for practical purposes, it does not exist. That is another area where a conflict of interest is alleged, but which in practice does not worry people.<br/>
I echo the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) that solicitors, whether employed or in private practice, are bound by the practice rules. Those practice rules can and should be used to obviate exactly the problems that have been held out as producing a conflict of interest. It is also important to emphasise that Ministers, especially the Lord Chancellor, have never specified what that conflict of interest is. We are asked to proceed on the basis of assertions and a specious argument which is never demonstrated and never proved. The Lord Chancellor never defines what he is talking about. Pressed to give a definition, he retreats into a cloud of gas and assertion which is never demonstrable. The practice rules will take care of the conflict of interest.</p>

<p>In Committee, the Solicitor-General defined the conflict of interest in reply to questions from me. He said that a very small conflict of interest was possible over title, but that in practice interest was almost the same for the borrower as for the lender so that it was not significant. But he thought that the serious conflict of interest arose on commenting on the terms of the mortgage. That is the conflict of interest upon which I keep inviting the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) to concentrate, because I believe that it is the sticking point for the Government. Much as I agree with everything that the hon. Member for Great Grimsby has said&#x2014;I can see that he is upset about not getting the concession that he was expecting&#x2014;I think that that is a

genuine conflict which we must resolve. I have suggested some ways of doing it, but the hon. Member may not agree with those.</p>

<p>We are agreed that the terms of the mortgage are rarely queried by independent solicitors. Therefore, on the basis of a service that people do not receive, other people will be excluded from a service which would be beneficial, competitive and cheap. There is no more specious argument than that.<br/>
On the conflict of interest, I rest my argument on the fact that solicitors do not give independent financial advice and are not qualified to give it. They are not legally responsible for any independent financial advice that they give. Indeed, independent solicitors often have a direct interest in channeling people to a building society with which they have some preferential financial arrangement. That in itself is a conflict of interest. Let us not give the impression that independent solicitors give independent advice and that that can be used as an excuse to say that people going to a building society should have independent advice. They will not necessarily get it from independent solicitors.<br/>
The arguments about conflict of interest are specious. However, the Lord Chancellor stands bloody but unbowed at the end of the arguments still asserting what he cannot prove and will not demonstrate. He sits there like a garrulous Buddha making assertions about a conflict of interest which, for practical purposes, does not exist on any serious scale.<br/>
The Solicitor-General made a charming speech in Committee, the gist of which was that this matter can be considered later. The message I received from that was that, in two years' time, when we have a sane or a different Lord Chancellor, the Government will fulfil the promises that they made. That is not good enough. We have a chance to do it now in the Bill, in terms which entrench the proposal by the building societies for a code of practice. I want a code of practice for the estate agency side of building societies. I certainly want it to be established for the conveyancing side of building societies. It is a chance to cover all the points that the Solicitor-General would want covered&#x2014;even those points that the Lord Chancellor might want covered&#x2014;in a clear and defined form which allows the solicitors to operate for the building societies.<br/>
I shall not quote the code of practice, because it has been circulated to hon. Members, but it provides that the customer shall be warned off in certain circumstances, that the solicitor shall give a precise definition of the services that he provides, what he is doing and what he is not doing, that he shall specify the fees and the charges and that, in some cases, he shall not act. The suggested code of practice could be rewritten. It might be the basis for a better code of practice. It could be expanded and better defined. We are arguing simply that we should write it into the Bill so that we can set down a respectable and effective code of practice.<br/>
The Lord Chancellor holds out some prospect of that in his letter to the building societies. I hope that it is not just a fob-off. He says:
<q>This need not be the end of the matter.</q>
He also stated that it might be possible
<q>to overcome the difficulties which concern me &#x2026; The best way forward is to continue work on a code of practice in the context of work on those rules.</q><br/>
If the Lord Chancellor is of that opinion, we should be obliging him in the Bill by specifying a code of practice which can be worked out subsequently.<br/>
I hope that we can pass the proposal, which concedes what the Lord Chancellor wishes, because it opens the way to the important principle of competition to serve the consumer. That is all that we are trying to get. Here is an expanding market in which house prices are increasing and in which the fees payable are increasing, in which much money is flowing into the market and in which we need competition to serve the consumer. We need competition for shares of that expanding market. It is wrong that solicitors should be feather-bedded by the exclusion of the competition from building societies in an area where, if building societies were allowed to operate, they could provide a comprehensive service such as solicitors should provide.<br/>
Following the pattern of Scotland, English solicitors are setting up solicitors' property centres. I welcome that. It is a beneficial development and an important advance. I am glad to see solicitors competing for their share of the cake. I am sorry that the Law Society is so laggardly in its rules.</p>

<p>Is the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) interested in allowing only building societies to act for both parties, or is he in favour of banks also acting for borrowers? I remind him that there have been some unfortunate incidents involving banks. Would he be happier if consumers were represented by solicitors also acting for Johnson Matthey? Would he be happy for estate agents selling a house also to employ a solicitor to act for their purchaser? Would he be happy for solicitors to act for both parties? Would he be happy for licensed conveyancers to act for both parties? All those instances would save money, but they would not protect the public.</p>

<p>In answer to that valid point, I must say that I am in favour of maximum competition and of people competing to serve the consumer comprehensively. The proposal for banks to do conveyancing came not only from me but from the Government. It was the Government's proposal that banks and building societies should be allowed to do conveyancing using employed solicitors for the range of property, registered and non-registered. My Bill restricted it to registered property. In this instance, we are talking only about building societies.<br/>
The principle of competing to provide a comprehensive service is valid. I should like solicitors to provide a comprehensive service through their property centres and estate agents through having employed conveyancers. Building societies should provide a comprehensive service by entering all aspects of house provision. I must emphasise that that is important, as it stops the drift of building societies into becoming big financial institutions. If the road to provide a comprehensive service to the house buyer is barred by the Government or the Lord Chancellor's whim, they will be forced much more in the direction of financial institutions and away from the prime and original purpose, which is service to the house buyer. That is what I want to see. Therefore, I want comprehensive competition. I do not see why building societies should have to face it with a ball and chain tied round their leg by Lord Hailsham when the solicitors can provide property centres, and the estate agents can do conveyancing.<br/>
8 pm<br/>
The costs of conveyancing have come clown substantially with the advent of competition. However, it is a rich market and I want to keep the pressure up. The consumer has no responsibility to provide, in any guaranteed way, an income to the legal profession for other aspects of legal business. There is every reason for expanding competition. What we are arguing for today will undoubtedly come. Even Lord Hailsham cannot hold back the tide of progress for ever. We should take the opportunity to allow competition on a sane, sensible and regulated basis which takes care of so many of the unrealistic fears which have been voiced by Lord Hailsham.<br/>
This is an argument on which right and honour are entirely on the side of the change we are proposing in this new clause. It is not right for the Government to behave in this fashion. It is dishonourable to betray the word they gave me as a Back Bencher. There are other important issues at stake. All the opinion polls show that people want the building societies to be able to provide a comprehensive service. The consumer organisations, which are there to protect the consumer and speak for them, want it and they say chat there is no problem. The building societies want it and can provide economies of scale and can use their computers and provide the kind of comprehensive service that the house buyer wants. Real competition and a genuine improvement in the range of choice to the consumer requires that comprehensive service. I can see no logic in the Government's position if they refuse the proposal.</p>

<p>It is unfair of the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell), in his undoubted enthusiasm and sincerity, to say that the Lord Chancellor is guilty of just a whim. I believe that when the Government gave the pledge they meant to honour it and they have now looked into the problem in more detail and it has turned out that serious problems are involved.<br/>
As the hon. Member for Great Grimsby knows, in principle I am strongly in favour of what he wants, but I have bumped into the conflict of interest. I should like to explain briefly why solicitors have never looked at mortgage contracts in detail, although they should. Perhaps the hon. Member for Great Grimsby will ponder on the fact that until recently we had a cartel of building societies of which many people disapproved. I did not disapprove because, since they were mutual friendly societies and non profit making, it was fine by me if they jointly set the interest rate. If they had been using the cartel to stuff up the interest rate to make vast profits and had been profit maximising plcs, then, of course, I would have been against the cartel. However, a cartel operating in a mutual society movement is nowhere near as bad as a cartel in a profit maximising environment.<br/>
The solicitors were faced with the fact that the building societies were a cartel. They fixed a common interest rate and, crucially, until recently building societies always charged the same interest rate for their existing borrowers and their new borrowers, which was the cartel rate. Therefore, why should a solicitor bother to look at a contract where the interest rate was set to suit the market at the time? Even if the contract said that the borrower would be charged such rate as the building society may choose from time to time, in practice, every solicitor knew that that meant the borrower would be charged at the cartel


rate. Therefore, solicitors got used to not bothering too much about the mortgage contract. Incidentally, given that the suppliers of mortgages have been praised by all parties in the House while they have been mutual societies operating specifically to help home ownership, there was probably little need for the solicitors to feel that they were dealing with a bunch of crooks who might be trying to rip off the customer.<br/>
However, we are now introducing a Bill in an age when the cartel has gone and where a number of building societies, I am sad to say, have started the practice of cutting the interest rate for new borrowers only and leaving it up for existing borrowers. That means that one could be heavily penalised in a way that is not specified in the contract. It should be pointed out that the contract does not safeguard a borrower from building societies charging two different interest rates. I would prefer the Government to have a mortgage Bill that stopped that nasty practice.<br/>
In addition, we should get rid of onerous resettlement clauses. If one is locked in by the higher interest rate for the existing borrower and there is also a big penalty for settling early, one cannot re-contract and become a new borrower at a lower rate with a different society. If we got rid of those practices, I would go all the way with the hon. Member for Great Grimsby and say that I could not care less whether solicitors looked at the mortgage contract. However, we do not have those safeguards.<br/>
I have suggested to the building society movement that it should have a code, of practice on mortgages. If the movement produced such a code, I do not believe that the Solicitor-General would now be having to get up to make the speech that we all know that he is about to make. He said in Committee that the only major conflict of interests that needs to be resolved is the mortgage contract.<br/>
The hon. Member for Great Grimsby and the hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) cannot get away with saying that that is a minor conflict or that it relates to only a few borrowers. In the new competitive environment that we are creating, where the mutuality and charity status of the movement may become a more bracing and competitive attitude, we cannot be sure that mortgage contracts will always be as if they were guided by a cartel in a charity or mutual type movement. We are going into a different world. Whatever solicitors have done in the past, they must start looking at the mortgage contracts that they are letting their customers sign.<br/>
The Lord Chancellor is not asked to do what the hon. Member for Great Grimsby says and ask what solicitors are doing&#x2014;we all know that they have not been looking at mortgage contracts. The Lord Chancellor's job is to ask what they should be doing. They should be looking at the mortgage contracts and they should not operate where they have a conflict of interests.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman is saying that there is an argument for requiring solicitors in independent practice to give financial advice to customers who come to them to arrange conveyancing. That is not being proposed. His argument put forward on the differential interest rate is valid whether employed solicitors do conveyancing or not. Therefore, it is irrelevant to his point.</p>

<p>I agree that it would be nice to get rid of the dual interest rate problem and the onerous

resettlement clauses whether or not building societies do conveyancing. However, my point is still valid. Suppose all building societies had identical contracts, which I am not proposing, which had been scrutinised by the Lord Chancellor, the commission and every consumers' association and had been declared marvellous contracts and we knew that they would always charge the same interest rate, none of us would want the solicitor to bother to read the mortgage contract. Because there is a possibility of nasty clauses turning up in the mortgage contract, I believe that the Lord Chancellor has to say that it is the solicitor's duty to look at the contract, not in order to give financial advice, but to give legal advice to tell borrowers what the contract legally locks them into. At the moment, borrowers are locking themselves into a 25-year contract which does not specify the price they will pay. I do not believe that any of us should allow that. I should be delighted if the Government would take action to make each institution charge old and new borrowers the same interest rate and not have onerous resettlement clauses. Therefore, if people were ripped off they could re-contract at low cost.<br/>
I shall read part of the Building Societies Association's code of practice which is fairly hilarious. All hon. Members have received immense help from the Building Societies Association. As a result of its advice, the Bill has been dramatically improved. The following part of the association's code of practice makes the Lord Chancellor's case far better than I am able to do:
<q>If the conflict of interest is in respect of a matter which, in all the circumstances, is not of a minor character, the employed conveyancer shall forthwith cease to act for the client.</q>
If a conflict of interest is not of a minor nature, the association's view is that its own solicitors should not act for the client. We are not talking about a minor conflict of interest. We are talking about a 25-year contract that people sign to purchase probably the most expensive object they will ever buy. Some people spend nearly half their annual income on mortgage repayments. We cannot say that there is no conflict of interest when a solicitor says, "Sign this contract which has been dished out by my employer. The contract is perfectly all right, but it does not specify the interest rate and it has a few onerous resettlement clauses which I shall not mention, because my employer would fire me if I did so."</p>

<p>I thank the hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) for his kind welcome to me in the debate. I return the compliment by saying that we have crossed swords on the topic on a number of occasions, but I have always welcomed and admired not only the dexterity of his attacks but the unfailing courtesy in which they have been expressed. I am grateful for the manner in which he moved the new clause. We are on interesting ground, but it is ground that has been thoroughly surveyed in Committee. Therefore, I believe that my response to the debate can be more succinct than otherwise would be necessary and courteous.<br/>
The Government's amendments are further positive evidence of the fact&#x2014;as the Lord Chancellor, myself and other members of the Administration have repeatedly asserted&#x2014;that the Government are strongly in favour of legislative progress towards integrated house buying services, subject only to the proper and sensible safeguarding of the customer against becoming the victim of a serious conflict of interest.<br/>
What distinguished the speech of the hon. Member for Ipswich from the much longer speech of the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) was that the hon. Member for Ipswich acknowledged that a conflict of interest can arise. I found it hard to discern in the speech of the hon. Member for Great Grimsby any recognition of that fact. When there is a conflict of interest with a solicitor offering services to a customer of his employer, there is a divided loyalty.<br/>
8.15 pm<br/>
The Government's amendments are designed to bring the sole practitioner within the scheme of schedule 17, whereby the Lord Chancellor may make recognition rules in respect of those to be permitted to carry out conveyancing services. Under the Bill as drafted, the sole practitioner was omitted. That point was raised by the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Ross) in Committee, and I promised that the matter would be considered. I am glad to say that the amendments are the result, and I hope that they find favour with the House.<br/>
I can offer the House further evidence and confirmation of the Government's policy in favour of moving towards integrated house purchase services. In December last year, we announced that consultations were to take place on the questions whether conveyancing services might be provided by subsidiary companies to lending institutions, and whether estate agents should be permitted to offer a combined house purchase and conveyancing service to vendors. Those consultations are now complete. In consequence, the Lord Chancellor has decided in principle that, subject to satisfactory safeguards, both subsidiary companies and estate agents should be allowed to offer conveyancing services. The nature of the safeguards that will be needed will be considered carefully by him when he makes the recognition rules under the provisions of schedule 17.<br/>
The kind of provision that might feature is a code of practice to prohibit preferential pricing arrangements of the kind so vividly alluded to by my hon. Friend the Member for High Peak (Mr. Hawkins), who knows so much about the subject and speaks without being vulnerable to the charge that he is yet another lawyer out to protect his cosy monopolies.<br/>
The new clause requires the commission to prepare, publish and administer a code of practice to cover the provision of conveyancing services by building societies, to be made after consultation with the Lord Chancellor and the Director General of Fair Trading. Societies operating in accordance with such a code would be able to provide conveyancing services to their borrowers.<br/>
I take minor issue with the speech of the hon. Member for Great Grimsby. On more than one occasion he spoke of the code. The new clause does not specify a code. No doubt, the hon. Gentleman had in mind the revised code already alluded to which was offered to the Lord Chancellor by the Building Societies Association. I shall say something about that in a moment. The new clause does not specify a code. It makes provision for a code to be provided by the Building Societies Commission.<br/>
I turn to the draft code that was kindly provided to the Lord Chancellor by the chairman of the BSA last month. It is a revision of a code which was first put forward in the middle of last year. I shall quote a passage from a letter

that the Lord Chancellor sent to the chairman, Mr. Cox, on 16 May, because it succinctly says what I wish to say in answer to the debate. The letter states:
<q>The adoption of a suitable code of practice may well be the best way of avoiding problems of conflicts of interest. I have seen your code and, while I think there is much to praise and a clear determination to protect the public, I am not at present satisfied that it yet overcomes the inherent problem of a conveyancer serving two masters.</q>
<q>I believe that it is somewhat unrealistic to expect a conveyancer to give advice in the best interests of both parties. The relationship between borrower and lender is one in which the interests of both can all too easily be at odds. Where this happens, both require an advisor who can tell them what they ought to do, not one who is 'impartial' or who is giving one party advice which is entirely against the best interests of the other. The code seems to leave the clients without an advisor at the one point in the transaction where. if a conflict does arise, he most requires this service.</q><br/>
The Lord Chancellor in his letter to the chairman made the point that my hon. Friend the Member for High Peak has just made. He said:
<q>The distinction between a 'major' and 'minor' conflict is, moreover, somewhat puzzling. It is not clear what is 'major' and what 'minor' or, indeed, who should take the responsibility of advising the borrower on such [natters. There seems to me scope here for delay and complexity.</q>
<q>I am sorry to write in such terms, but I think you appreciate the difficulties I have over this. I do not at present think that this code does overcome the problem of a conflict of interest. I should make it clear, however, that this need not be the end of the matter. Clause 101 and Schedule 17 of the Building Societies Bill are deliberately drafted in wide and flexible terms. No amendment to the Bill would be required to enable a code to be used if it proves possible to overcome the difficulties which concern me. All that would be needed would be an amendment to the recognition rules. The content of these rules is very far from settled and I am sure the best way forward is to continue work on a code of practice in the context of work on those rules.</q><br/>
In that passage from the Lord Chancellor's letter, the House will be unable to recognise the machinations of an unscrupulous protector of his profession's cosy monopolies which were conjured up by the hon. Member for Great Grimsby. If I did riot know the hon. Gentleman as well as I do, and if the House did not know the amiable way in which he invariably addresses it, I should feel, on behalf of my noble Friend the Lord Chancellor, a certain fleeting resentment at some of the expressions that the hon. Gentleman applied to him. But I let that pass.<br/>
From the passage that I have read from the Lord Chancellor's letter to the chairman of the BSA, it is plain that the Lord Chancellor is motivated by one concern alone &#x2014;that the Government's desire to enlarge competition should not be fulfilled at the expense of the proper interest of the customer in not becoming the victim of a serious conflict of interest.<br/>
In view of what has been said, I feel obliged to cite again some of the examples that I gave in Committee of where the need for separate advice may arise in practice. I used examples that were provided by the chairman of the Luton and Dunstable Law Society, including one involving mortgage terms. One example given by the Luton and Dunstable Law Society was as follows:
<q>That draft mortgage Deed contains a provision that the loan of &#x00A3;86,250 would carry a rate of interest of either &#x2026;
<ol>
<li>(i) a rate of interest higher by 6 per cent. than the base lending rate from time to time of the National Westminster Bank plc or</li>
<li>(ii) the rate notified in writing by the company to the borrower." &#x2014; [<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 20 February 1986; c. 479.]</li>
</ol></q><br/>
In other words, in this case the life assurance company had an open-ended ability to charge what it liked. I happily


believe that the number of such instances would be small although not negligible, but the customer must be protected from the divided loyalty of the solicitor or licensed conveyancer who is employed by the building society or bank. It is not a matter of conjuring up fantasies. We must have regard for what happens in real life.<br/>
In Committee, I also referred to a letter published in the <i>Daily Mail</i> from a manager of a branch of Lloyds bank. He said:
<q>I am the manager of a small branch of Lloyds. In the past five years I have seen the job changing from that of a general financial adviser to that of a salesman of Lloyd's products.</q>
<q>This is not to say that I doubt their worth, but increasingly I have difficulty in giving impartial advice when I am all the time looking to achieve business targets.</q>
<q>So far I think I have been able to achieve a happy compromise, but as I am under increasing pressure to sell 'in-house' products, especially insurance, the impartiality is bound to disappear. By far the worst aspect of this is that the financially less aware will have nowhere to go for advice which will be truly impartial&#x2014;everyone will have an axe to grind.</q>
That would be just as true- of a solicitor employed by a building society that is in competition with others.</p>

<p>That is an interesting suggestion. It falls outside my exceedingly limited field of ministerial responsibility, but I shall ensure that it is passed on and considered in the right quarter. However, I agree that that is where the conflict of interest principally arises.<br/>
There is great merit in the way in which the Bill is formulated. Schedule 17 empowers the Lord Chancellor to do three things: to make rules for the purpose of recognising institutions as being suitable to undertake the provision of conveyancing services and to recognise institutions under those rules; to exempt them from the present restrictions on persons who can undertake conveyancing; and to impose conditions on those institutions with which they must comply to remain recognised.<br/>
Following our consultation, we felt that we could not in all conscience sweep under the carpet serious warnings about a conflict of interest and legislate as though that consultation had never taken place. That would have been dishonourable.</p>

<p>Will the Solicitor-General give way?</p>

<p>I shall give way in a moment. The hon. Gentleman took me to task for having said to him in February 1984:
<q>We will shortly issue a consultation paper on how best to ensure that conflicts of interest and anti-competitive practices do not arise when solicitors employed by banks, building societies and other organisations are permitted to undertake conveyancing for their employers' customers. We hope to bring forward legislation permitting building societies to offer the service next Session." &#x2014; <i>[Official Report,</i> 17 February 1984; Vol. 54, c.347.]</q><br/>
It is abundantly plain, and must have been at the time, that if that consultation threw up advice to the effect that

it was impossible to overcome conflicts of interest in all circumstances where the solicitor's employer was lending money, it would be dishonourable to proceed.</p>

<p>It was also dishonourable for the Government to say that they hoped to bring forward legislation. The intention was clear. Can the Solicitor-General cite any instance of a conflict of interest that was not known at the time that he promised me that building societies would be allowed to do conveyancing through employed solicitors?</p>

<p>It was our intention to introduce legislation. We are not sufficiently arrogant about our confidence in our right thinking to say that, whatever consultation throws up, we shall not be influenced by it. We live and work in the hope that we may be able to overcome these difficulties. The Lord Chancellor's letter makes that clear. Meanwhile, the task is to press ahead with the hard work on the rules, consulting the BSA and others, with a view to bringing them into force with the minimum delay.<br/>
Although I regret not being able to commend the new clause to the House, I hope that my explanation&#x2014;which has taken longer than I intended because I felt obliged to answer the points raised&#x2014;will lead to the motion and clause being withdrawn.</p>

<speech hansard_id="414613" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1986-06-04a.982.2" hansard_membership_id="8365" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/22069" speakername="Mr. John Whitfield" colnum="982" time="19:45:00">
<p>I should declare my interest in the debate. I am a practising solicitor, and, although I do not engage in much conveyancing, I obviously have an interest in the matter.<br/>
It is extraordinary that more of my professional colleagues have not spoken in the debate. Apparently none served on the Committee, and that was also extraordinary. As a profession, I believe that we have much to be proud of, and that is at the heart of this debate. The problem is that the consumer is in danger of being sacrificed on the altar of competition. The hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) said that the consumer was king and that if he demanded it he should have the right to have it. I shall explain why that is a strange proposition.<br/>
Principally, we are concerned about conflicts of interest. The hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) belittled this concept and seemed to be saying that conflicts of interest can be got round, avoided or somehow rubbed out. That cannot be true. They cannot be overcome simply. Warning consumers that conflicts of interest exist does not mean that they will go away. No amount of warning in this day and age is sufficient for the majority of consumers. They want to buy a house and they have set their heart on one. They want as large a mortgage as they can possibly get, possibly more than they can afford, and warnings will not prevent them from going ahead with the transaction.<br/>
8.30 pm<br/>
Perhaps the most vivid example is the conflict of interest between banks and customers on the making of wills and the appointing of executors. Surely no customer would appoint a bank to be an executor if he knew how much it would cost&#x2014;it is usually 5 per cent. of the assets in the estate. Despite that, time after time, perfectly straightforward estates are complicated by the involvement of banks and the extortionate&#x2014;there is no other word for it &#x2014; charges that banks make for the administration of wills.<br/>
Competition is there to serve the consumer, and it is the Government's responsibility to see that that is the case and that competition does not become a god in its own right. The hon. Member for Great Grimsby said that my profession has been featherbedded against competition from building societies. To give him some credit, his initiative in the House Buyers Bill has made a fundamental change in the profession. Solicitors engaged in conveyancing are not featherbedded against competition from their own colleagues, and we are not afraid of competition from building societies. I doubt whether building societies will do conveyancing for less than solicitors are prepared to charge, and this is one of the sectors in which the consumer will be duped. He will be offered a package of an all-in loan which will cover his costs, and he will not know what the costs are. By the time that he has finished paying for the conveyancing, he will have paid many more times what he would otherwise have paid.<br/>
Another charge made by the hon. Member for Great Grimsby is that solicitors are not liable for advice that they may give on financial matters. Nothing can be further from the truth. We are men of affairs and give advice to clients on the full range of aspects of house buying, and we are liable personally for that advice. If it turns out to be wrong, we are personally liable to reimburse the client.<br/>
Various uncomplimentary statements have been made about my noble Friend the Lord Chancellor. My hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General has already rejected them, as we must. My noble Friend has a tremendous record of looking after the profession, and he is the last man who would stand in the way if he believed that what was proposed was right.<br/>
It has been alleged that solicitors are simple mechanics in the matter of house transfer, but this is inaccurate. A solicitor advises as to the suitability of the property for the buyer. He advises as to the terms of the contract, and all the flak that has been thrown at my profession about sending out inquiries that do not mean anything before contract is largely unfounded. The solicitor advises as to the financial aspects of buying a house, on the terms and on the cost of the mortgage. There can be no question of the enormous institutions that building societies are becoming giving the detailed personal independent advice through their employed legal people that is offered by independent solicitors.<br/>
How can a solicitor employed by a building society, who has his business targets, possibly have the time, patience, inclination or financial incentive to give independent advice to borrowers? All these are major matters, and even if the building societies' code which would make it necessary for the building society solicitor to send the customer elsewhere were to be implemented, as my hon. Friend the Member for High Peak (Mr. Hawkins) suggested, that would be unlikely to happen. How can the building society solicitor become involved with the detailed administrative arrangements of a house purchase and sale transaction? He will not have the time and inclination. All that he will be interested in is processing as many loans as possible in as short a time as possible. The borrower, the consumer, will be the sufferer.<br/>
We should protect the independence of the legal profession. It is a vital institution in any civilised society. In-house conveyancing does not cost the public any more.

It is probably already costing the consumer a great deal less than he would pay a building society if the new clause were adopted.<br/>
There is some pressure on me to sit down, so I shall end my speech by saying that I wholeheartedly support the anxieties of my noble Friend the Lord Chancellor about conflicts of interest and that I agree with the provisions of schedule 17. They will bring a tremendous wind of change to the profession, and the prospect of that has already brought some improvements to the profession. The Law Society has done its best, but it cannot keep things in the same way as they have always been. It has tried to do that, and that has been its failure. We have to admit that. The consumer must be protected, and it is the Government's responsibility to provide that protection. It is clear that the hon. Members for Great Grimsby and for Ipswich will not provide it.</p>

<speech hansard_id="414614" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1986-06-04a.984.0" hansard_membership_id="10009" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/21977" speakername="Mr. Weetch" colnum="984" time="19:45:00">
<p>Parts of the debate have been entertaining. I thank the Solicitor-General for his reply, although I am not sure whether to glean any comfort from it. I never am when I have replies from lawyers. Such replies are like mounting the Alexandine steps, which, as hon. Members will know, are a mirage. They appear to be going upwards, but when one treads on the steps one finds that they are, inevitably, going downwards. I suspect that that is what has happened in this case.<br/>
The new clause will not do anything revolutionary. Solicitors conveyance property, and in a short time licensed conveyancers will be doing so as well on their own account. Suddenly, it is said that if we put the same class of person behind a building society plate glass window the whole conveyancing world will collapse because of the conflicts of interest that are not capable of being resolved. I reject that argument.<br/>
The Government have created a new competitive world in financial institutions. I am glad to see it, because it could have done with some more competition, goodness knows. Building societies are in a new competitive world. If they engage in ripping off the consumer through conflicts of interest, they will not survive in the new competitive climate. That, at the end of the day, will be the answer to the problem. Conflict still remains. I do riot accept the Solicitor-General's reply, however hard he tried to bring some comfort to us. Therefore, I shall divide the House.</p>

<q>'A building society shall not place a restriction in its mortgage deed which prevents its member from obtaining finance from another source without first obtaining the society's consent.'.</q></p>

<p>First, I declare an interest. I am vice-president of the Corporation of Finance Brokers.<br/>
My purpose in moving new clause 26 is to draw attention to what many finance brokers consider to be an anti-competitive practice arising from an abuse of a dominant position by some building societies which require their borrowers to covenant within the mortgage deed not to enter into any further borrowing which requires the security of a charge upon the property without first obtaining the consent of the society in writing.<br/>
To enforce that covenant societies then apply to the Chief Land Registrar for a notice of a restriction to be entered into the register of title relating to the property. The result of that restriction is that the societies are contacted and given early notice of a borrower's intention to seek a loan elsewhere.<br/>
Building societies defend that practice by claiming that such a requirement enables them to encourage borrowers to explore their existing financial commitments and to exercise restraint if it seems likely that they may over-commit themselves. All that would be laudable were it not for the fact that building societies are themselves entering into the personal loan and second mortgage market.<br/>
In fact, the finance brokers are aware of many instances where an approach to a building society seeking consent to a second charge immediately results in that society calling in its borrowing member and persuading him or her to take a loan by way of a further advance or a second loan from the society itself.<br/>
That practice is seen by finance brokers as poaching. It makes use of the stranglehold which societies have, due entirely to the covenant in the mortgage deed. It also arises from the dominant position of a society and allows it to make a further advance at little or no cost whereas the information about the availability of further advances is often communicated to the consumer by means of an advertisement paid for and placed in the newspapers by a finance broker.<br/>
It can be argued that would-be house purchasers should read and agree to the restrictive covenant when they sign the mortgage deed. Perhaps solicitors should advise their clients on that point rather more effectively than they now appear to do. That point was touched on in the previous debate.<br/>
The fact of the matter is that most house purchasers do not read the fine print in the mortgage deed. I have often wondered whether there should be a requirement to put such a restrictive covenant in bold type in red ink, rather

like those warnings that we have all seen on hire purchase contracts. However, hire purchase contracts are rather different from mortgage deeds. Most house purchasers only sign one mortgage deed in their life, or perhaps two or three at comparatively long intervals.<br/>
The effect of the restrictive covenant is, in the view of most brokers, to interfere with the borrower's freedom of choice and to influence the borrower in such a way that he feels obliged to take a loan from a building society. That occurs when the borrower is suddenly informed that the society is aware that a loan has been sought from another lender. The borrower can even be called in to discuss the matter with the manager or some other official of his building society. The borrower may then be told that the society can refuse to allow the registration of a second charge, but if he or she would care to take a further advance from the society then, of course, the request can be accommodated over perhaps a 15 or 20-year term, if desired.<br/>
What of the claim that societies are protecting their members from over-committing themselves? Let us suppose that the society refuses either to agree to a second charge or to make a further advance. What happens then? The answer is that the borrower can borrow unsecured from another lender, for example, a high street money shop. In that case he could find himself paying high interest rates ranging today from 35 to 44 per cent., or in the case of a conventional hire purchase finance agreement on, say, a three-year-old car a borrower would commonly today be paying around 30 per cent. At the very worst a borrower could go to a loan shark charging horrendous rates of interest.<br/>
That compares with about 18 to 19 per cent. APR for loans arranged by members of the Corporation of Finance Brokers who adhere to a code of practice which ensures that they not only bear in mind the interests of their clients, but exercise the utmost integrity in dealing with their affairs, have regulations governing advertising and ensure that money is not spent before a loan is made.<br/>
I am sure that my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary will agree that there is much to be said for secured loans at reasonable rates of interest and subject to respectable conditions. Such a position can obtain only if there is free and fair competition between societies, the banks and other established finance houses and the brokers who place business with them.<br/>
In the Green Paper which preceded the Bill it was made clear that competition in the provision of financial services is one of the desired objectives. But does the dominant position of certain building societies, which makes it virtually impossible for any other lending source to secure their loan, really add up to competition, or is it really a restrictive or anti-competitive practice?<br/>
My hon. Friend the Economic Secretary to the Treasury has indicated in correspondence that he understands that on the whole it is the exception rather than the rule for a borrower to need the society's consent to a second mortgage, and that it is relatively unusual for consent to be refused. That may be so if the borrower really persists, but he will obviously feel inhibited from so doing. One building society which I understand directs requests from borrowers to the provision of a loan by the society is the Nationwide, which is one of the largest societies in the country, and there are others. I ask my hon. Friend the


Economic Secretary to consider whether the Nationwide is observing the policy of greater competition that the Government advance.<br/>
9 pm<br/>
These matters are of great importance to all members of the public who want to be sure that they have a free and fair choice of financial services in a competitive market. My new clauses are designed to put down a marker and to engage the attention of my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary, to whom I pay tribute for his constant interest in and wise advice on these matters. I know that he is not convinced that an absolute statutory bar on restrictions on the taking of a second charge or the making of an advance when approached for permission to make a second charge is the right way forward. I share his dislike of more and, perhaps, unnecessary restrictions in a rapidly changing mortgage market, but I have sought to indicate that there is a problem and where that problem lies.<br/>
I was glad to learn from my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary, in a letter that he wrote me yesterday, that he has arranged for information that I sent him to be provided to the Office of Fair Trading. I am glad to know from him also that the OFT is now to undertake some more general inquiries into the incidence of the practices which I have described and their effects on competition. I hope that all these inquiries can be completed quickly and that everything will be done to ensure free and fair competition, coupled with adequate protection for consumers against excessive interest rates that are often charged on unsecured loans.</p>

<p>I hope that the Government will resist these clauses. The hon. Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Shersby) has presented them as measures that are in favour of competition, but they are far from that, because they seek to exclude building societies from that competition. The hon. Gentleman mentioned one society. I understand that only one society has a prohibition rule that means that the society's consent is required. The building societies have nothing to fear from this issue going to the Office of Fair Trading.<br/>
The hon. Member for Uxbridge has talked about people being driven into the hands of loan sharks who charge interest rates of 35 per cent to 40 per cent., but I suggest that the new clauses would do just that. A borrower from a building society is as much a member of the society as a lender, and he is proud to be a member. The building societies have a tremendous record of looking after their members. If a borrower needs extra finance, it is fair for the society of which he is a member to discuss the matter with him. The society will probably say, "Let us examine your financial affairs. Is the best way of solving your financial difficulties the granting of an extra loan? Shall we extend your mortgage? Shall we transfer more money to your mortgage? What is the problem? Can we help you?" That is all that societies do.<br/>
The Building Societies Association has informed me that over the years it has had complaints from mortgage brokers and finance companies, but apparently it has never had a complaint from a borrower. The hon. Member for Uxbridge said that the new clauses will act in defence of the borrower and in the interests of competition and fair trading, but apart from the many drafting defects&#x2014;for example, unregistered land is not covered and there is

reference to unsecured loans&#x2014;I object to the principle which lies behind them I said, I hope that the Governent will reject them. They will prevent building societies from assisting their members and assist others to lend money.</p>

<p>I support the argument that has been advanced so eloquently by my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Shersby). I do not pretend for one moment to be an expert on building societies, but I support my hon. Friend because I have received representations from my constituency which I have passed on to him and to which he has responded. I believe that he is highlighting a problem, about which I understand he has had considerable correspondence with the Treasury, especially my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary, and that the Treasury recognises that there could be a problem.</p>

<p>the right hon. Member for Halton (Mr. Oakes) will admit immediately that in introducing the new clauses my hon. Friend said that he had tabled them as markers in the hope that the problems might occur and the concern that has been expressed by constituents to individual Members will be taken fully into account by the Treasury.<br/>
I make these remarks with deep interest because the headquarters of the Cheshire building society are in my constituency. It is an excellent society. I have never had a single letter or word of complaint about its practices, and I commend it for the excellent service that it gives to people not only in my constituency but over a wider area.<br/>
After considerable research over many months, my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge has presented an excellent case to the Treasury. I hope that my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary will give an understanding and sympathetic reply. I doubt very much whether my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge intends to press the new clauses to a vote, but he hopes that an area that is causing concern can be taken fully into account by the Treasury. I hope that assurances will be given from the Treasury Bench.</p>

<p>I compliment my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Shersby) on a well-argued case, and on the manner in which he put it forward. My hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) has just supported him. Equally, the right hon. Member for Halton (Mr. Oakes) asked us to resist the new clauses. In fact, it would not be wise to put them on the statute book.<br/>
I listened to my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge with considerable interest and a good deal of sympathy because the matter that he raised is a cause for concern and, as he mentioned, we have been in correspondence about it. I have also had a letter from the hon. Member for Thurrock (Dr. McDonald)&#x2014;only in the past 48 hours, so I hope that she will forgive me for not having replied, but perhaps I can do so now.<br/>
One of the basic themes of the Bill is competition. By letting societies offer a wider range of services, we hope that they will be able to respond positively to the competition that they now face in their traditional markets, and to introduce new competition elsewhere. The line between legitimate competitive activity and abuse of market position can be very fine. We need to be vigilant in making sure that one does not turn into the other.<br/>
I do not believe that the abuse described by my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge is very widespread, but it seems to come close to the line of what is acceptable and possibly even to cross it. I do not think that an absolute statutory prohibition of the sort that is suggested in the new clauses would be the best way to proceed, so I hope that my hon. Friend will not press the new clauses. However, I am glad to have the opportunity to comment on them because I believe that the situation that he has outlined needs further investigation.<br/>
As my hon. Friend mentioned, I have passed to the Director General of Fair Trading the papers that he sent to me, and his office is now to undertake more general inquiries into those practices to see whether further action under the competition or fair trading legislation would be appropriate. I hope that, pending the outcome of that investigation, any building society that might be tempted to poach business in that way&#x2014;to put it crudely, to trade off the efforts of others &#x2014; will recognise the distaste that is felt in the House for such behaviour. I should add that if that were to become a matter for legislation, which at this stage I do not accept it will, it would be for competition legislation, not for legislation relating to regulation or consumer protection. I shall ensure that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, who is responsible for those areas, is kept fully informed about it.<br/>
In view of that, I hope that my hon. Friend will feel able to withdraw his new clause, but in doing so will be satisfied that we are taking action on the point that he has raised.</p>

<p>I beg to move amendment No 414, in page 14, line 35, at end insert&#x2014;
<q>'(6A) A building society, once it has advanced money on the security of an equitable interest in land in England and Wales or Northern Ireland, may not sell on that loan without the express permission of the borrower which shall be obtained according to a code of practice which shall be agreed between all the building societies and which shall have received the approval of the Commissioners.'.</q><br/>
The purpose of this amendment is to deal with the growing market and to ensure that the borrower's interests are protected. When I raised this issue on Second Reading, the Minister said that it would be up to the
<q>borrower to ensure that the terms of a second mortgage were suitable." <i>[Official Report.</i> 19 December 1985; Vol. 89, c. 602.]</q><br/>
I think that he said that because he did not actually hear what I said. I hope that it was for no other reason. Of course, I was talking about the growth of the secondary mortgage market and urging that the borrower's interests there should be protected. Since Second Reading and our debates in Committee, I know that the Minister has taken a great interest in this issue and has encouraged his hon. Friend the Minister for Housing, Urban Affairs and Construction to propose the need for a code of practice. A draft code of practice has been drawn up by the Building Societies Association. I hope that a final draft will be forthcoming.<br/>
It is worth saying something about the need for protection as this is a new market in the United Kingdom. It has attracted interest in United Kingdom mortgages from investors as far afield as Canada and Japan. Part of the attraction lies in the fact that, at the moment, the rate of default is extremely low, although that rate has increased partly because of increasing unemployment and partly because of the continuing high rate of divorce.<br/>
9.15 pm<br/>
Like many other newspapers, <i>The Times</i> recently carried an article on the growth of the secondary mortgage market, which said:
<q>To reassure borrowers the new market will have to develop guarantees that the responsibility for, say, setting interest rates and foreclosing on people who do not repay will remain with an identifiable lender and not be sold along with the underlying asset.</q>
That is vital. I am sure that we have all corresponded with a building society about a mortgagee who is in arrears and been able to negotiate different terms for repayment to tide the borrower over a period of difficulty. That has often been easy because the branch is local and the manager knows the borrower. If mortgages are sold on and can be purchased by a foreign investor or a large finance company, however, that relationship may no longer exist. It does sometimes. It depends on what type of arrangements have been made by the purchaser of bundles of mortgages.<br/>
The matter requires a code of practice even more now than when we raised the issue in Committee and on Second Reading. Since then, the Government have announced that, for the first six months in which somebody is in receipt of supplementary benefit, payment of mortgage interest by the DHSS will be halved. The Opposition have had much to say about that. Just when people need most help and have very low incomes&#x2014; they can build up substantial mortgage arrears over only six months&#x2014; mortgage interest payments are halved. They may be unable to make up those arrears easily, even when the DHSS restores full interest payments if they continue to be in receipt of benefit. Bearing in mind the Government's change of policy, a proper code of practice is even more necessary. That is another issue on which consumers support the need for a code.<br/>
<i>The Times</i> article says that the fears of a new breed of ruthless investor entering the market who is willing to foreclose at the drop of a hat
<q>were highlighted when Barclays canvassed the opinions of its borrowers on the sale of their mortgages and received an unequivocal thumbs down to the idea late last year.</q><br/>
The Government are pursuing a voluntary code. That is an important step forward. The amendment proposes that the code should be compulsory and be agreed between the Building Societies Commission and the building societies. That would ensure that nobody could escape from the obligations, in a changing market, that they have taken on towards a borrower. It would also ensure that borrowers' interests are properly protected, even when their mortgages are sold in the United Kingdom or to foreign investors.<br/>
The matter is one of social concern. We must ensure that borrowers' interests are protected, especially when they hit hard times. They must be able to continue to deal with the person who gave them the mortgage.</p>

<p>In asking the House not to accept the amendment I do not want it to be thought that I ant in any way unsympathetic towards the remarks of the hon. Member for Thurrock (Dr. McDonald). There is a fair degree of unanimity between us. However, as she would be the first to recognise, the amendment would apply only to building societies. As she said, it is not necessarily the building societies which are likely to abuse the ability to transfer a mortgage. She referred to a new type of ruthless

investor coming to the market who might foreclose more easily than building societies. The amendment would not cover the new ruthless investor.<br/>
I am convinced that we need a broader approach to the problem which covers all people who loan on mortgages, rather than just building societies. I am therefore not convinced that the amendment represents the best way to proceed.<br/>
The hon. Lady may have seen a speech which my "ion. Friend the Minister for Housing, Urban Affairs and Construction made on 8 May. My hon. Friend said that he had great reserations about the selling of existing mortgages unless the borrower gives explicit consent to the sale. He also said that he did not necessarily feel that: the Building Societies Bill was an appropriate vehicle for changes, because any code of practice would apply to all those in the mortgage market, not just the building societies. He went on to say that the Government would be examining with interested organisations the appropriate arrangements to protect the legitimate interests of borrowers while enabling innovation in the mortgage market to bring the full benefit of additional funds for home ownership and wider choice in the types of loan.<br/>
Since making that speech, my hon. Friend has asked his officials and officials at the Treasury to discuss the matter with representatives of all those involved in the mortgage market. These discussions have covered the steps that need to be taken to protect the borrowers' interests. My hon. Friend hopes shortly to make an announcement which will be of considerable interest to the hon. Member for Thurrock and to the House as a whole.<br/>
The Government share the anxieties of the hon. Lady that ordinary borrowers should be protected in the market in which they play an active part but over which they have no control. We do not believe that it would be helpful to tackle the problem piecemeal. The mortgage market is no longer the exclusive preserve of the building societies. We are at present actively pursuing an initiative which will cover the whole market and examine the need to protect borrowers in the many different areas of the market.<br/>
Against that background, I ask the hon. Lady to await my hon. Friend's announcement, which he will make shortly, and not to pursue the amendment.</p>

<p>I begin by declaring an interest as parliamentary adviser to the British Insurance Brokers Association, a body of which I hope the insurance subsidiaries likely to be set up as a result of this legislation will in due course become members. In the meantime, the purpose of amendments Nos. 106 to 110 and amendment No. 315 is to establish a basis for the insurance services likely to be provided by the insurance subsidiaries stemming from this legislation that is as fair as can reasonably be attained.<br/>
The effect of amendment No. 315 is that building societies wishing to become insurance intermediaries would have to be registered or listed under the Insurance Brokers Registration Act, which would require them to observe the standards laid down in that Act, to which those now trading under the title of insurance brokers have to subscribe.<br/>
Paragraph 4.16 of the Green Paper, Cmnd. 9316, made the following proposal:
<q>Any further exterision of building society activities &#x2026; would need to be subject &#x2026; to the standards of behaviour expected of the insurance services industry.</q>
Paragraph 4.19 stated that those new activities
<q>would be subject to the regulatory regime for the particular service",</q>
which for insurance broking currently takes the form of the Insurance Brokers Registration Act 1977. Regrettably, that proposal has not been translated into the Bill. In the meantime, the conduct of insurance subsidiaries of building societies in so far as it relates to life and investment assurance is being taken care of as the Financial Services Bill proceeds through the House, but other insurance in which the building societies have traditionally dealt &#x2014; for example, householders' comprehensive, buildings and contents and related forms of insurance&#x2014;will remain unregulated unless amendment No. 315 or something very similar is absorbed into this Bill.<br/>
A concern that I have frequently heard expressed is that because building societies have a high reputation among the public there may be a tendency to assume that as there is undoubted expertise in house purchase and mortgage arrangement in the smallest branch office of a building society the same level of expertise will be available on insurance matters, but that does not necessarily follow. It is questionable how much training building society managers can claim in this area. From my own experience, I know that in a number of areas building society managers are not always able to assist in the way that could reasonably he expected of people registered under the Insurance Brokers Registration Act. It is a question not just of arranging an insurance and choosing the correct market, but of dealing with claims as and when they arrive. Under the present set-up, building societies cannot necessarily be expected to have that expertise.<br/>
9.30 pm<br/>
If the amendment were acceptable to the Government, the insurance subsidiaries of building societies would have

to register under the 1977 Act and be prepared to conform to its standards. That would be a means of directing to the consumer an implication of competence which would greatly strengthen consumer protection.<br/>
In regard to amendment No. 106, clause 33 prohibits a building society from making the provision of a primary advance conditional on the use by a borrower of other services by the society. The effect of the amendment would be to extend that prohibition to any advance or loan. The provision in clause 33 that a building society cart no longer insist on the borrower insuring his house through the society does not go far enough. The prohibition should apply also to second mortgages. For example, under the Bill as it stands, if a borrower obtained an unsecured loan of, say, &#x00A3;5,000 to buy a car, the society could insist that he insured that car with an insurer of its choice through its insurance department or subsidiary. This is an area of possible conflict to which the House should give attention in the discussion of this part of the Bill.<br/>
The reason for amendment No. 107 is to prevent a building society charging the borrower when he wishes to make his own arrangements rather than use the services offered by the society. Following pressure by the Office of Fair Trading, building societies permit the use of the client's own insurance intermediary, but one of the less reputable practices of many building societies over the past few years has been to charge for the privilege. Some extremely well-known societies do so. For example, the Cheltenham and Gloucester charges &#x00A3;25 to enable a borrower to make his own insurance arrangements. The Newcastle charges &#x00A3;25. The Portsmouth charges &#x00A3;15 per annum and if a borrower insists on making his own insurance arrangements it increases the mortgage repayment rate. The Skipton charges &#x00A3;25. The Town and Country charges &#x00A3;23. Many hon. Members will question the morality of having to pay for the privilege of seeking the best insurance market for one's personal insurance needs.<br/>
The effect of amendment No. 108 would be that a building society would have to make it clear, whether in the application form or elsewhere in its literature., that the borrower is free to make his own arrangements for insurance or other financial services, if he so wishes. No doubt some societies draw that freedom to the attention of borrowers, but a great many do not. I have with me literature from the Halifax, the Abbey National, the Nationwide and the Cheltenham and Gloucester, and none of it states clearly and specifically that there is no obligation to place the insurance relevant to a mortgage through the agency of the building society.<br/>
As we come close to the end of the consideration of this important legislation in this Chamber, the House should give its attention to these extremely important matters. The Government may have better ideas about how to achieve the same objective. I hope that the Minister will recognise that what is sought by insurance intermediaries is fair competition. It would be an exaggeration if I said that existing insurance intermediaries welcomed the prospect of building societies engaging in their sphere of commercial activity, but if there is to be such competition &#x2014;as must be accepted&#x2014;it should be fair.<br/>
I hope that I have been able to draw to the attention of the House a few areas in which I contend that the competition is not fair. Therefore, I hope that my hon.


Friend the Minister will be able to indicate to me that he is prepared to accept the amendments or in some other way to achieve the objectives that underlie them.</p>

<p>Before I deal with the amendments of my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle) I shall deal briefly with Government amendment No. 311, which gives the building societies wider powers to set up and run personal and money purchase occupational pension schemes. The amendment gives effect to the proposals which my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary to the Treasury outlined on 7 May, and will ensure that building societies can play a full part in the provision of personal pensions.<br/>
Amendment No. 315 requires building societies or their subsidiaries to register under the Insurance Brokers Registration Act 1977 and to become subject to regulation by the council. My hon. Friend's amendment recalls one which he tabled in Committee on the Financial Services Bill. That amendment would have required all insurance agents who sold general insurance, other than company representatives, to register with the Insurance Brokers Registration Council. I hope that my hon. Friend will not be greatly disappointed when I say that the Government are no more disposed towards amendment No. 315 than they were to that amendment, for much the same reasons.<br/>
We start from the general proposition that there should be no prohibitions restricting competition by limiting those who can take up any given area of commercial activity. Nor should we impose statutory burdens on businesses, unless there are good reasons for them. A case must be made for the sort of changes that my hon. Friend proposes, and the Government believe that the case has not been made.<br/>
As my hon. Friend recognised, in the case of life assurance, building societies, like other intermediaries, will be regulated under the legislation. I do not think that there is a point between us there. On general insurance, the original proposals in the Green Paper have not been implemented. The larger societies may well choose in future to form subsidiaries, registered with the IBRC, as the clearing banks have done, but to require such registration does not seem justified, and the Financial Services Bill Committee was not persuaded that there were problems in general insurance which could be solved only by statutory regulation. Still less am I aware that there is a real problem with the building societies. As my hon. Friend will know, we are promoting talks within the industry with a view to improving self-regulation on the basis of consensus.<br/>
We are not persuaded that all insurance intermediaries should have to register with the council, nor do we think that the building societies should be singled out and made an exception to that view. That would be to discriminate unfairly against them.<br/>
The building societies probably could not qualify. They would not necessarily have qualified or experienced insurance brokers on the board, so they would have to set up subsidiaries to register. That may be possible for larger building societies, but for smaller and medium-sized societies there would be considerable trouble and expense in dividing operations in that way. Some may simply decide not to offer insurance services, which would be disappointing, because competition would be reduced and

the consumer would be deprived of a convenient outlet for an important service. Neither consequence would be welcome to the Government, which is why we are inclined to resist amendment No. 315.<br/>
Amendment No. 106 seeks to extend the prohibition on tying services from cases where the societies are making a class 1 advance to cases where they are making any category of advance. As my hon. Friend knows, clause 33(1), which prohibits services from being tied to a class 1 loan, was the subject of a great deal of debate in Committee. The provision was inserted to buttress the general competition and fair trading legislation in view of the dominant position of building societies in the first mortgage market. In Committee it was argued strongly that it was discriminatory to apply prohibitions to building societies and not to other mortgage finance institutions. My hon. Friend's amendment would extend that disparity of treatment to cover services related to any loan, not just a loan on a first mortgage.<br/>
I do not think that this extension can be justified in its sole application to building societies where they do not have the dominant position in respect of second mortgages or unsecured lending. If one went down that path, it would be discriminating against building societies entirely without grounds for doing so. For that reason, the Government are not disposed to advise the House to accept the amendment.<br/>
While it is important that first mortgage borrowers should be protected by an anti-tying provision, I can see the force of the argument that it is wrong to provide a statutory obligation of that sort only in respect of building societies. My hon. Friend has said that he is prepared not to bring into effect this provision if societies adopt an effective code of practice which contains such an obligation. In a recent speech to the annual conference, the chairman of the Building Societies Association said that the association was now prepared to consider such a code of practice if the clause were not activated. The Government welcome that statement. The terms of such a code might be a more appropriate place for these additional protections, and I hope that the societies and the BSA will now give the matter full consideration. I am sure that they will bear in mind what my hon. Friend has said.<br/>
Amendment No. 108 would require a society to point out in writing to a borrower that he can make his own arrangements to obtain a service in connection with a loan. That might be a little bureaucratic. It would impose a requirement applying, not just in connection with a first mortgage loan, but with any advance. It would involve a society in the rather cumbersome and costly process of writing to any borrower to whom it wished to provide a service. Again in Committee there was a complaint that the existing provisions unjustifiably discriminated against societies and this would be a further step in what would be regarded as discriminatory treatment. Therefore, the Government are not minded to accept this amendment either.<br/>
My hon. Friend mentioned a number of societies which imposed charges on their members where they decided to opt out. I am sure that his listing of the societies will have had a salutary effect on injecting a greater degree of competition. I do not think that it would be right to ban that sort of charge. There are cases where a society would face additional administrative costs through a borrower going elsewhere and some charge would be legitimate. For example, if a borrower insured the property with an


outside insurance company, the society, as lender, would have to check the policy to safeguard its security. That would be an extra expense for the society, and it seems legitimate for that extra cost to be reflected in the charges that it makes.<br/>
The answer to my hon. Friend lies in an increasingly competitive mortgage market where building societies have to react to competition and remove these discriminatory charges. Indeed, removal of the differential on endowment mortgages is a recent example of such competition working and of the building societies removing a differential charge. Therefore, I hope that my hon. Friend will not find it discourteous if I advise the House to reject his amendments. I feel that he may have been aware in advance that the Government were not able to go down this path.</p>

<p>It comes as no major surprise that the eloquence to which my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary paid due testimony did not persuade him to accept even one, let alone the total number, of the amendments that I tabled. At least in this respect the Government are proving consistent, because that was the response I received when I proposed a similar amendment in Committee on the Financial Services Bill. Nevertheless, I am mildly encouraged by one or two of the remarks made by my hon. Friend in asking the House to reject the amendments. I cannot but feel that when he tries to justify the imposition of a charge by a society for allowing a consumer freedom of choice to arrange his insurance in the best market available he is flying in the face of the competitive society about which I believe he and I are united in many other respects.<br/>
I hope that my hon. Friend is right that the names of the societies that I read out&#x2014;by no means an exhaustive list&#x2014;will be shamed into accepting that the borrower must be given a far greater freedom of choice without the imposition of a charge. I am fortified in the knowledge that when the Office of Fair Trading has turned its attentions to this matter in the past it has considered that to be an anti-competitive practice.<br/>
If I have achieved nothing more this evening, I hope that I have moved closer to the time when there will be greater freedom for a borrower to arrange his insurances in the best available market without the imposition of a charge.<br/>
9.45 pm<br/>
Before I finally accept defeat, I wonder whether my hon. Friend can say something about Government amendments Nos. 312 and 316. They are not entirely clear in their import. Can my hon. Friend say whether I am correct in suspecting that the amendments are calculated to enable building societies to move into commercial insurance, as distinct from covering domestic arrangements, such as the contents of a house, a house, and even a motor car that is purchased by way of an unsecured loan? I do not suggest that the Abbey National or the Halifax will be prone to go into the aviation or marine markets once the legislation appears on the statute book.<br/>
In the interests of achieving the fair competition to which I referred and to which my hon. Friend responded, it would be helpful if we were a little clearer in our minds that the area of insurance activity that it is envisaged the building societies will move into more forcefully than they have done in the past is that part of the insurance market that relates primarily to what I shall call domestic risks.

Perhaps my hon. Friend can clarify the meaning of amendments Nos. 312 and 316, and confirm that the area of insurance activity he envisages is as I have suggested.</p>

<p>I hope that I can give my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle) the assurances that he seeks. Amendment 312 involves no change in policy. It simply clarifies what is involved. It does two things. First, it makes it clear that building societies can act as agents either for the person seeking the insurance or the person providing it. In other words, the society can act either as an independent broker or as a tied agent for a company. Under the requirements that will be imposed for financial services authorisation, it will be necessary for building societies to make it clear in which capacity they are acting.<br/>
Secondly, the amendment makes it clear that building societies can offer advice. Many society customers will be looking to the society for advice on their insurance needs, whether the society is an independent intermediary or a tied agent. Schedule 1 to the Financial Services Bill provides separately for the function of advising on investment business and arranging for its provision it is advisable for consistency and the avoidance of doubt to make it clear that the power available to building societies extends to both.<br/>
Amendment No. 316 provides that a society's insurance services must be provided primarily, rather than exclusively, to individuals and corporate borrowers within class 2. We do not see that as a means for building societies dramatically to change the nature of the insurance business. However, a building society may acquire an insurance broking business which has some small business customers on its books. That would not be possible without the amendment.<br/>
Likewise, someone with a building society loan on his house, who arranged the insurance on it through a society, may wish to arrange insurance in respect of his business. Instead of forcing societies to turn people away, which would make little competitive sense, it would be sensible to give them the flexibility to have a small amount of corporate business on their books. That is why the Government have responded in that way. In the light of what my hon. Friend has said, I accept that we need to watch to ensure that the nature of the amendment is not abused and that the building societies do not move to commercial insurance broking in a big way.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend's comments were helpful as far as they went. My hon. Friend used the word "small" twice in his response to my concerns about amendment No. 316. He talked about small business customers and later a small amount of corporate business. I am not aware that the word "small" can be defined in legislation. Indeed, it has clearly not been defined in the Bill. What would my hon. Friend consider to be a small business? What would he consider to be a small amount of business insurance in relation to the total that a building society's insurance subsidiary might transact?</p>

<p>In seven years as a Minister I have learnt not to give off-the-cuff advice on rather complicated legal questions. But the commission set up to monitor the building societies and the use of the powers will no doubt be interested in what my hon. Friend has said and will keep a close watch on it.<br/>
The legislation says that the societies' insurance services must be provided primarily rather than exclusively to individuals and corporate borrowers within class 2. We want the building societies to continue to provide a personal service to people who buy their houses, but, affixed to that, those people may run small businesses and may want to take out their insurance with the building society that insures their home. Without the amendment, building societies would not be able to offer that service.

It is sensible to make that exemption, and that is the object of the amendment. I am reluctant to go further than that, but the commission and the Government will be keeping a watch on this provision to ensure that it is not abused.</p>

<p>These amendments deal with the much debated subject of what has been described as obstructive mergers. This is where a merger approach is made to a society but is not put to the members of the society that receives the approach. During the debates on the Bill in the House and in Committee and outside, a great deal of anxiety has been expressed about the proposed provisions. In response to those anxieties, I have decided that the whole process should be greatly simplified in a way that removes all the anxieties that have been expressed by hon. Members and the BSA.<br/>
In future, if these proposals are accepted, there will be only the need for notification. There will be no special voting procedures and it will be open to members to use the general provisions of the constitution of the building society once the basic information is available to them. The paper circulated by the BSA says:
<q>The government has now greatly modified and simplified its proposals which are now acceptable to the Association.</q>
I hope that they will also be acceptable to the House.</p>

<p>I have received a letter from a small building society which continues to express anxieties. I know that the Economic Secretary has made plain the purpose of the amendments, but he may wish to add one or two points. The letter recognises that the Economic Secretary has considerably watered down the original provisions on proposals for mergers direct to members. The building society that wrote to me still feels that the revised provisions could prove embarrassing for small societies in particular and could be open to abuse. It says:
<q>For example there would be nothing to stop a predator society making a merger approach to a significant number of


small societies, all of whom would be bound to report in the Notice of Annual General Meeting a statement of any merger approach received"&#x2014;</q>
unless that has specifically been requested to be kept confidential. The building society still feels that it would be preferable if the contested merger provisions could be removed from the Bill. It feels that unless this is done, the provisions will continue to place unreasonable pressure on small societies. As the Minister knows, these societies often provide for specialised or local needs.<br/>
The letter is couched in fairly general terms, but it would be useful if the Economic Secretary could respond. If any points need further reassurance, perhaps he would make them plain.</p>

<p>I declare an interest as a director of a small building society.<br/>
My remarks are directed to amendment No. 3520. As the hon. Member for Thurrock (Dr. McDonald) has said, schedule 13, as originally drafted, could have sounded the death knell of the small local building societies, which would have been at the mercy of the large predator societies. This point was put forcibly by hon. Members on both sides in Committee. We were pleased by the way in which my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary took our point and undertook to bring back proposals on Report. He said:
<q>I think that the consequences will be the opposite. But I am certainly willing to build in a further provision &#x2026; which would restrict the obstructive mergers procedures only to cases that were not disproportionate in size. That would rule out the aggressive approaches by large societies to smaller ones."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A</i>,18 February 1986; c. 399.]</q>
That was helpful. I am delighted that the new proposals go further and that all that the societies are now required to do is to make a statement that they have received an approach and give the name of the building society.<br/>
As the hon. Member for Thurrock said, one or two small societies are still worried, because they feel that some large societies will make an approach to 10 or 15 small societies not just once but every year so that every year, at every annual general meeting, notices will go out with the merger statement saying that the Halifax building society or the Abbey National has made an approach. Some of the small societies feel that this might lead to a war of attrition. I have some sympathy for that point of view, but I feel that they are exaggerating. My hon. Friend the Economic Secretary to the Treasury has moved far towards the point of view that we put in Committee. The new provisions will allow small local building societies that offer important services in many of the regions to survive, provided that they are efficient. Therefore, I thank my&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Bridlington (Mr. Townend) referred to the Abbey National building society. I want to raise with my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary to the Treasury a point on the 20 per cent. conversion issue. As it has been maintained that this will be a realistic option for building societies, will my hon. Friend say what evidence might be required before it would seem reasonable to learn about that requirement of 20 per cent., short of a building society risking loss of confidence by attempting the leap and then failing?</p>

<p>If my hon. Friend will consult the <i>Official Report</i> of today's proceedings he will find that I touched on that matter earlier when I was asked a similar question.<br/>
As for the substance of this group of amendments, I am happy to respond to the hon. Member for Thurrock (Dr. McDonald). I do not believe that the anxieties of the society whose letter she quoted will be borne out in practice. She said that it was concerned that these provisions might place unreasonable pressure on small societies. I do not think that that will be the case. Small societies are protected by the disproportionate merger procedures, so they would be less vulnerable to approaches of the kind that that society mentioned. If those two provisions are taken together, building societies will not be exposed in that damaging way.<br/>
I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Bridlington (Mr. Townend) for what he had to say. I do not believe that the previous provisions would have sounded anything so dramatic as the death knell of smaller societies, but I came to the conclusion, after further consideration of this matter, that the proposed remedy was out of scale to the problem. Clearly there was a problem, but I was not convinced that it was necessary to erect such an elaborate procedure to deal with it. The notification process that I have now put forward is a practical and sensible option in the circumstances. I think that the hon. Member for Thurrock can be assured that, coupled with the disproportionate merger provisions, it should not have an adverse effect on the society that she mentioned.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.<br/>
Now that we have reached the end of the proceedings in this House on the Building Societies Bill, I should like to express my thanks to all those who have been involved in its passage through the House for the constructive and good humoured way in which the proceedings have been conducted. It has been greatly to the advantage of the legislation.<br/>
I do not apologise for the fact that the Government have introduced more than 1,000 amendments to the Bill. It is an exceedingly complicated piece of legislation which completely recasts the law for building societies which has been on the statute book, in generally the same condition, for over 100 years. The number of amendments is testimony to the care that we have tried to take in order to respond to all the points that have been raised in the process of consultation and discussion and, indeed, in response to the many points that were put forward by hon. Members in Committee. We have gone rather rapidly through a number of groups of Government amendments, and we have been able to do so because the matters were fully debated in Committee and the amendments meet undertakings that we gave.<br/>
I want to thank my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young), for the enormous amount of work that he has done and for his help in taking the Bill through the House. I greatly appreciate his support, both professional and personal. I also want to thank my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General for coming in at one or two crucial moments in our proceedings to deal with subjects on which I do not profess to have any skill or expert knowledge.<br/>
My hon. Friends and other members of the Committee all approached the legislation in a most helpful way. I do not at all take it in bad part that they were sometimes fairly rough with me. I only hope and believe that the Bill is in better shape as a result of the process of give and take that we have been through.<br/>
I thank the hon. Member for Thurrock (Dr. McDonald) for the way in which she has handled the Bill on behalf of the Opposition. Like myself, she had difficult clauses of the Finance Bill to deal with last night, and we shall be doing so again tomorrow night. Dealing with the Building Societies Bill in between has not been an easy matter. I compliment her on the way in which she has done so.<br/>
I also want to mention the hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch), who has taken up temporary residence on the Opposition Front Bench for the purposes of this Bill. His interest in the subject over many years is well known to the House and he has acquitted himself with considerable distinction. I hope that he will continue to occupy his present position in some other capacity.<br/>
I want in particular to express my gratitude to the chief registrar and the staff of the registry, who, in addition to their routine work, which is an important range of duties, have devoted an enormous amount of time during the past three years to preparing details of this legislation. Without their ready assistance, which I know has placed a great strain on their resources, it would not have been possible to get the Bill into this sort of shape.<br/>
On 21 January I announced that Mr. Herbert Walden had agreed to serve as a part-time member of the Building Societies Commission. I am glad to be able to announce today that Mr. Sidney Procter and Mr. Geoffrey Sammons


have also accepted invitations from my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer to be part-time members of the Building Societies Commission.<br/>
Mr. Sammons retired as senior partner of the firm of Allen and Overy in May this year, and his long experience of legal matters should be of considerable value to the commission. Mr. Procter retired as chief executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group in 1985. He is currently acting as adviser to the Governor of the Bank of England on banking supervision and will continue to do so in future, providing an important link between building society supervision and banking supervision. The Royal Bank of Scotland has agreed to allow him to relinquish his post as vice chairman with effect from 1 January 1987 to enable him to take up that appointment, and I am grateful to it for doing so.<br/>
I can also announce that Mr. Ronald Devlin, currently assistant registrar of friendly societies, will be a full-time member of the Building Societies Commission when it is established. Clearly the commission will have a most important part to play in the implementation of this legislation.<br/>
Finally, I should like to thank the parliamentary draftsmen for really heroic efforts in completing the Bill, and also the officials in the Treasury, who, during nearly three years of intensive work, have had to contend with an awkward Minister who questioned every proposal that they put forward. It was an enormous labour for them and they have done an outstanding job. In that tribute I include also the Building Societies Association, whose representatives and advisers have made themselves readily available to members of the Committee and other hon. Members, and I am sure that the Bill is in a much better shape as a result.<br/>
This is the most fundamental legislation on building societies for over a century. It gives them new powers and will enable them to compete more effectively in a changing marketplace. The emphasis will still be placed firmly on the provision of services for savers for house

purchase, but I hope that the Bill will also enable building societies to face the future in the confidence that they will be able to continue to serve the public as effectively as they have done for many generations. I am sure that they have the best wishes of us all in meeting the new challenges that they face.<br/>
I think that the Bill leaves the House with the united support of hon. Members on both sides of the Chamber and of the building societies themselves, and I hope that it will not be too long before it reaches the statute book.</p>

<p>First, I echo the Minister's words, because I believe that the Bill provides a framework for the building societies in a competitive market. As the Economic Secretary to the Treasury knows, we still have certain reservations about the Bill, but we wish the building societies well. We have emphasised during our debates the importance of their commitment to housing and their meeting of that social need in the past. We hope that in future the societies will remain as mutual organisations and will continue primarily to meet the housing need.<br/>
I thank the Minister for his kind remarks about the conduct of the Bill in Committee, and I thank the Building Societies Association for the assistance that it gave to all members of the Committee during the passage of the Brill through Parliament. I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) for agreeing to come on the Opposition Front Bench during the course of the Bill's passage through the House, for all the assistance that he has given me and for the wit that he has brought to the conduct of our debates. Perhaps we are not as anxious as the Minister seems to be for the Bill to return to this place and to face it all over again when we consider Lords amendments, but no doubt we shall face that prospect. We wish the building societies well.</p>

<p>I beg to move,
<q>That the draft Education (Assisted Places) (Amendment) Regulations 1986, which were laid before this House on 21st May, be approved.</q><br/>
Hon. Members may remember that last year we came to the conclusion that the original regulations had become rather cumbersome and a somewhat daunting bundle. For the convenience of all concerned, we introduced a single set of consolidated regulations.<br/>
As hon. Members will have noted, there has been little need this year for any substantive amendment to the consolidated regulations of 1985. The amendment regulations before the House are designed mainly to assist the smooth running of the scheme, although very little has appeared to need changing. As in previous years, provision is also made for the appropriate revaluation of parental income scales.<br/>
To provide some context for this debate on the amendment of the regulations, I should like to speak briefly about the nature of the assisted places scheme as it operates under the present arrangements.<br/>
More than 21,000 children are receiving assistance under the assisted places scheme at 226 of the best independent schools in this country. High academic standards are a prerequisite of schools' participation in the scheme.<br/>
Of those now receiving assistance with their fees, over 47 per cent. come from families whose gross combined income per year is less than &#x00A3;7,300. The scale for determining the amount of fee remission is intentionally a tough one and only those families with incomes below &#x00A3;6,376 in the current year qualify for completely free places. Even so, for the school year 1985&#x2013;86 over 39 per cent. of the assisted pupils qualified for full remission of fees. With this evidence before me, I stand ready to refute any claim that the assisted places scheme operates to subsidise the rich. Nor do I accept that it is a means of supporting children, albeit from low-income families, who would have attended independent schools even if the assisted places scheme did not exist. The principal regulations require all participating schools to ensure that at least 60 per cent. of their assisted pupils come from the maintained sector.</p>

<p>I think that I know what my hon. Friend is getting at. I shall attend to it in due course.<br/>
Only four of the participating schools have had difficulty in attracting sufficient suitably qualified applicants from state schools.<br/>
It is our view that the scheme is operating very successfully, and as evidence and support of that contention I would point to the consistently low-income profiles of the families involved, the successful recruitment of pupils from the maintained sector and the redistribution of quotas away from poor recruiter schools towards successful ones. For the Government, the participating schools, the pupils and the parents who benefit, and the general public, the assisted places scheme is a resounding success.<br/>
I refer to the text of the draft regulations. Regulations 1 and 2 are concerned only with nomenclature, and I shall not trouble hon. Members with comment on them. Regulation 3 does two things. It inserts a missing preposition in regulation 21 of the principal regulations. More notably, it increases the period allowed to the Secretary of State to respond to requests from the participating schools for increases in their fees. At present the schools must give the respective Secretaries of State one month's written notice of intended fee increases. The Secretary of State concerned then has only seven days in which to query the increase. We have found that administratively that has proved difficult, and we now propose an extension from seven to 14 days.<br/>
Regulation 4 is put forward to close a legal loophole that was brought to our attention by a number of the participating schools. The principal regulations are designed essentially to treat the assisted placeholder's current family as a family unit for the purposes of assessing income annd therefore the appropriate level of fee remission in individual cases. However, the principal regulations do not at present cover circumstances whereby an unmarried mother subsequently marries a man who is not the father of her child.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend has touched on a matter that is of concern in the context of the recent Treasury Green Paper on reform of personal taxation, which is not wholly irrelevant, in that it seeks to address the problem of it being an advantage for people to remain unmarried. It may have occurred to my hon. Friend that under the assisted places regulations as drafted there is a large incentive to someone contemplating taking up an assisted place similarly to remain unmarried.</p>

<p>I understand my hon. Friend's point. Through the change in the regulations, we have tried to deal with the anomaly whereby an unmarried mother with a child, who then marries a millionaire could find that the income of the millionaire was not taken into account for the assessment of fee remission. Regulation 4 amends this anomaly and allows that husband's income to be taken into account in determining eligibility and level of assistance under the scheme. I am sure that the House accepts that this is sensible, placing all family units on the same footing.<br/>
Regulation 4(2) is also an addition to the definition of "parent" for the purposes of the scheme and takes account of the new legal definition of "custodian" introduced under those sections of the Children Act 1975 which were implemented earlier this year. The principal APS regulations are being amended so that children who are the subject of custodianship orders and their legal custodians are placed on exactly the same footing as adopted children and their adoptive parents.<br/>
Regulation 5 covers the rules for assessing income. Any allowance paid by a local authority to an assisted pupil's


custodian will be ignored for APS purposes. Regulation 5 also updates the relevant income tax legislation in the principal regulations.<br/>
Regulation 6 provides for the updating of the income scale used for assessing the amount of parents' contributions towards the fees &#x2014; the threshold below which parents pay nothing towards fees being raised from &#x00A3;6,376 to &#x00A3;6,806.<br/>
I am confident that the changes that I have just described will allow the continuing smooth running of the assisted places scheme. Indeed, they can only enhance what is already highly successful and popular.</p>

<p>I am sure that the House is well aware that the Opposition strongly object to the assisted places scheme. It is a clear symbol of the divisive and destructive approach that we have seen from this Government since 1979 in their policies on education and their attitude to state education. When almost everything in state education was going wrong because of a lack of resources and a lack of Government interest, they seemed to do everything they could to nurture their assisted places scheme. No doubt it is because they believe that education should be elitist and they want to use it to confer privilege on a few rather than to offer higher educational standards to all the children of Britain. There is no need for me to go over again our opposition to the assisted places scheme.</p>

<p>Yes, Mr. Deputy Speaker, but I draw your attention to the fact that in introducing the regulations the Minister made a general comment about them. Perhaps I may just complete one or two general remarks, which might speed up our proceedings. There is very little support in Britain for the assisted places scheme. People want the privilege of good education for all our children and not for a select few.<br/>
I shall now turn to the regulations. It is rather interesting to note that the first time round the Government got the regulations wrong. It might have been of interest to us if the Minister had explained why he got them wrong the first time and had to come back with a second set. I put that question before Government Members become too critical. He might also have explained to us why he picked an increase of virtually 7 per cent. in the allowances for income. I can see that there is some relationship to average earnings, but I suggest that perhaps the income increases do not take into account people on very low incomes. The Minister might like to say something about that.<br/>
I notice that the new Secretary of State wants more time to think about decisions in education, because he is asking for 14 days rather than seven. I had hoped that he would move in the opposite direction and speed up the Department's consideration, especially of things like local authority proposals for the reorganisation of schools. I am sure that the Minister is aware of the considerable backlog of decisions there, and it would be better if the

Government came forward with proposals to reduce the time that it takes to reach ministerial decisions rather than to increase that time.</p>

The Minister mentioned parents and guardians, the regulations in respect of which, if we are to have an assisted places scheme at all, represent a sensible tidying up. Will the Minister answer a question that we asked the last time around when we considered the regulations, but which he did not answer? What evidence does he have about the rate of pay for teachers in the independent sector? There is some evidence to suggest that the rate of pay&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>It would be a tragedy if the merits of the regulations were lost because points have been made which are not strictly relevant to the debate, which is, after all, limited in time.<br/>
I am pleased to note the way in which the regulations show that the Department is prepared to make those changes that are a necessary consequence on changes elsewhere, and that they seek to provide an adequate definition of the person responsible for the child's education. These factors encourage us to believe that the scheme is being properly supervised and considered.<br/>
I want to confine my remarks to the changes that have been made in the income scales for parents and the rates at which they make their contributions to the education of the children. In his introduction my hon. Friend did not make it clear on what basis the changes had been made. As the income levels designated in the regulations will apply in the next education year, when the increase will be considerably above the rate of inflation, there is an element of generosity. However, some of us might think it inadequate. I should like my hon. Friend to confirm that that generosity was the intention of the Department and not something that happened by accident when a figure was, as it were, plucked out of the air.<br/>
Although my constituency is in the south of England, the people there have quite low wage rates. The Government should recognise that the levels at which parental contributions are fixed are significant in cities such as Portsmouth, which is akin to many of the industrial cities of the north in its social and economic problems. If my hon. Friend can assure us that it is the intention over a period to change the assessment of parental contributions to benefit parents, that will be welcomed in the less prosperous parts of the country, particularly by parents whose incomes are below average. It is they who make the greatest sacrifice for their children to be educated under the scheme.</p>

<p>I thought that what I had said, Mr. Deputy Speaker, had made it clear that I was talking about the draft regulations which extend what we considered an evil. These draft regulations facilitate the taking of money from the hard-pressed, maintained sector of education, to transfer children to the not necessarily better private sector. I will not buy their hype and call it the independent sector.<br/>
The draft regulations comes from a Government Department with responsibility for the public sector of education, yet it slaps its customers in the face by depriving them of their most gifted assets&#x2014;the children. I do not go along with a system that seeks to do more for assisted places than is absolutely necessary. Therefore, it will come as no surprise to hon. Members to learn that we are against these statutory instruments, which widen the catchment area of eligibility.</p>

<p>May I tell the hon. Gentleman, who presumably knows little about the procedures of the House, that a Division needs two Tellers. Were I not treading a lonely path, I might well be persuaded to divide the House.<br/>
I find it difficult to accept that the statutory instrument widens the catchment area of eligibility for assisted places by raising the earning threshold, not in line with inflation, but by a figure of 7 per cent., which Treasury Ministers frequently condemn as being outrageously high for wage awards. I particularly resent the fact that benefits accrue automatically to children on the scheme, while other poor and equally deserving children have their eligibility to better education cut, and while the actual availability of opportunity is disappearing for them.<br/>
The instrument subsidises parental income above the rate of inflation. As it subsidises school fees above the rate of inflation, it is therefore a double subsidy. In the maintained sector there is a double penalty: a falling

education budget, whatever the Minister tells us, and parents steadily picking up even greater portions of school expenditure to help the state system. The latest HMI report writes of parents paying for basics, such as rewiring the school hall.<br/>
This is a fair opportunity to welcome the Secretary of State to his new office. All hon. Members who have the wellbeing of children at heart wish the new Secretary of State well in a difficult task. There is about the debate an air of d&#x00E9;j&#x00E0; vu or, perhaps d&#x00E9;j&#x00E0; entendu, if the Minister's hearing aid is in working order. There is an element of confusion, in that the original order was withdrawn and we now have a new one because the clerk was unable to number the paragraphs of the original one correctly. It shows that good schooling costs money. It is right for the Secretary of State to realise that good education does not come cheap, as his predecessor found out with the training and vocational education initiative.<br/>
We oppose the draft regulations because they widen the inequality among children, undermine the state sector and give irrational ammunition to those who wish to denigrate comprehensive education. It is based on the utterly false premise that the private sector per se deserves to he better financed than the maintained sector.<br/>
I shall not divide the House because, despite this statutory instrument, when we have an opportunity we shall phase out the scheme, for the benefit of all children, rather than for those of the suppressed middle class who already get a good deal from education and who would, if they stayed in the maintained sector, greatly contribute to its excellence.</p>

<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to draw to the attention of the House the problems of my constituency, especially the major problem at the British Rail Engineering Ltd. works. Just before the Whitsun recess, it was announced that within just over a year the work force at Springburn would be reduced from 1,000 to fewer than 200 and that BREL would cease to operate as a company in Springburn and, indeed, in Scotland, and that the organisation would be taken over by ScotRail.<br/>
This is a sad occasion for me and for the community, because at one time Springburn employed about 10,000 people in the railway workshops. There were four workshops employing a highly skilled work force, and between the 1930s and 1960s one was considered a bit eccentric if one travelled outside Springburn to seek employment. It was a boom town in those days. I have lived in the community since I was 15, I served my apprenticeship there, I married a girl from Springburn and I now live in the community, and it is sad to see the problems from which we suffer now.<br/>
I asked the Library to give me the latest unemployment figures for Springburn. I do not have much time at my disposal tonight, so I shall not go into every detail of the problem, but I can get the picture across by saying that the latest figures show that 8,747 men and women are unemployed in my constituency. The Department of Employment does not give unemployment percentages for constituencies, but in Glasgow it is more than 22 per cent.<br/>
I wish to use this Adjournment debate to ask the Minister questions that have been asked by the work force at the BREL workshops in Springburn, and I took the liberty of telephoning the Minister's Department to forewarn him of the questions so that he could be helpful to the community and to the House. Why did BREL refuse to allow the press on to the premises, especially when a delegation from the Scottish TUC was visiting them last week? The media were allowed into the Swindon works, and we see no reason why, especially when we are considering a public asset, the media should not be allowed in to see for themselves the facility at Springburn.<br/>
The contract known as the gangway modification, which has been ordered by the Strathclyde passenger transport executive, has, in part, been completed by the Springburn work force. It is my understanding that the PTE, which is an organisation run by Strathclyde regional council, is satisfied with the work. Why is the remaining part of the contract to go to Wolverton? It seems ridiculous that Strathclyde regional council ratepayers should have to pay for this work. There is no harm to the work force south of the border, and it seems strange that the work should go south of the border when Springburn is in dire straits. It would be helpful if the Minister could give an answer as to why the contract is going to Wolverton.<br/>
If the proposals of BREL are to be carried out in full, it means that all major contracts will have to be carried out in Derby, York, Crewe or Wolverton and major repairs will also have to be carried out in those places. This means

that any work of that nature in Scotland will have to travel anything between 270 and 370 miles to be carried out. Can the Minister, who has always had a mind for economies, and has always put the case for them before the House tell me that that makes economic sense?<br/>
A fortnight ago an announcement was made about ScotRail taking over and that those who were fortunate enough to remain with ScotRail at Springburn would be involved in a method of repair known as component exchange. I should like to know whether this method of repair has been tried and tested in any other part of the United Kingdom. If not, it means, in effect, that Springburn is getting an experimental programme, and that makes the prospects for the remaining work force very unsure.<br/>
Mention has been made of the work force of the electronic department at the railway workshops. This department is graded as A1, which is a high grading for electronic work. Currently there is only a small work force consisting of 12 people. However, it is an area which the work force regards as having potential. It is the only section under BREL and British Rail that is involved in the repair of railway signal systems. There could well be room for expansion but there is a worry that under ScotRail this department could be taken away and that outside organisations will be left to do the work. I would be happy if the Minister could give me some reassurance.<br/>
The other area that has been mentioned is the upgrading of railway bogies. This has been mentioned in the press, and some people are giving the impression that it could bring a lot of work to the railway workshops. However, the work force feels that it would bring enough work for only six skilled fitters. I should like the Minister's opinion on that matter.<br/>
As with any company which is in difficulties, one is always concerned about asset stripping. With that in mind, I ask the Minister to say what will happen to the new high-tech machines, such as the CNCs and the brake presses, which were purchased recently at a cost of &#x00A3;500,000.<br/>
I feel sad whenever I pass the apprentice training school which is incorporated in the workshop. The school opened in 1979, shortly after I became a Member of Parliament. At that time BREL showed that it had some commitment to apprentice training. The school has facilities for 110 apprentices. Sadly, not one apprentice has been trained at the school for the best part of 18 months. When my son took part in a YTS scheme he did some training there. I know at first hand that the facilities exit at the school. Machine tools, machines and classrooms are lying waste and there are padlocks on the doors.<br/>
It is a scandal that the industrial base of an area which has a proud record in engineering is being destroyed to such an extent. If we do not train young apprentices, we shall destroy the seed corn. There has never been a greater chance to train them&#x2014;even if the economy does take a turn for the better. If the Minister is serious about the training and care of young people, he should end the scandal of the school lying empty. Something should be done.<br/>
I refer to the holding company which was formed to try to bring more industry to the site at Springburn. BREL boasts about the company. It tells us that it has been successful in other parts of the country and that it intends to attract new employers on to the site and will pay a subsidy for a year to every unemployed railway worker employed by the new company. I understand that the


subsidy will not be paid to a company doing subcontract work for the railway industry, yet in England such subsidy is allowed.<br/>
We have a community which was one of the best railway centres in the world. We have a railway engineering base which has existed for generations &#x2014; since the last century. Does BREL wish to destroy that base completely? It appears that that is what it intends with the holding company.<br/>
We intend to fight in the community, against the proposals. We are conscious of the fact that hundreds of people have left the factory because of redundancies. In view of unemployment and the redundancies that have taken place, there is a need to attract new industry &#x2014;railways railways or whatever&#x2014;into Springburn. I want to know what steps the Minister and his Government are taking to create work and to co-ordinate efforts by BREL, the Scottish Development Agency, Glasgow district council and Strathclyde regional council. I am grateful for the opportunity to put the case before the House.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Glasgow, Springburn (Mr. Martin) has been forthright in arguing on behalf of his constituents for the retention of the British Rail Engineering Ltd works at Springburn, and, quite reasonably, asked a number of questions. I join him in his profound regret about the proposed job losses affecting his constituency.<br/>
As the House will know, BR has recently announced, with great regret, proposals for substantial reductions in capacity at a number of its engineering workshops. These proposals include the rundown of the works at Springburn and the setting up of a regional maintenance depot on the site, employing some 200 people. I stress that these are proposals made by BR management. They are now the subject of the normal processes of consultation with the railway unions. It is right that the hon. Gentleman should seek some explanation for these proposals.<br/>
BR's requirement for rolling stock maintenance is declining sharply. This arises from the fact that it is undertaking a major programme of heavy investment in modernisation and new rolling stock. Since July 1984 alone, the Government have approved 10 major investment projects, worth over &#x00A3;630 million in total, including nearly &#x00A3;400 million of new rolling stock, and &#x00A3;200 million for new electrification. Some &#x00A3;700 million of investment in new rolling stock is planned by BR over the next five years.<br/>
This investment helps British Rail to give a better service to its customers, and provides important engineering work for British industry. I know that this policy of modernisation commands support from both sides of the House, but investment in modern equipment also means less work for British Rail's maintenance and repair workshops. The new rolling stock can be used more efficiently, and so the same services can be provided by a smaller fleet of vehicles, each of which in turn needs less maintenance than the one it replaces.<br/>
The hon. Member will perhaps be familiar with an example I have quoted to the House before, of the new Sprinter diesel multiple units. On average, BR needs only two new Sprinters for every three old units, and each new Sprinter needs 30 to 40 per cent. less maintenance at BREL than its predecessor. Overall, there is a reduction

of over 50 per cent. in BREL's maintenance work load for these services. It is a desperately unfortunate but undeniable fact that if there is less maintenance work, fewer maintenance men are required.<br/>
Furthermore&#x2014;this is a point that I believe is not always fully appreciated&#x2014; from the moment that BR takes the decision to order new rolling stock, heavy maintenance ceases on the old stock that is to be replaced. By heavy maintenance I mean the sort of general overhaul that a locomotive or coach would receive at a BREL works every eight to 10 years. It obviously makes no sense to do any more of this type of work on stock that will be scrapped in a couple of years' time. Although all the necessary day-to-day maintenance continues to be done on these vehicles, BR handles that in its local depots, not at BREL.<br/>
I move on from the general principle of what is happening to the more precise effects on Springburn. Scotland is particularly affected by the decline in maintenance requirements, because BR is improving services there through major fleet changes. In a few, years' time, a very high proportion of Scottish services will be operated by modern low-maintenance vehicles.<br/>
There is new electrification, with over &#x00A3;100 million being invested in Scotland in the east coast main line and the Ayrshire schemes. There are likely to be Sprinter-type vehicles on many services that currently use loco-hauled coaching stock, such as Glasgow to Fort William. There are also likely to be more high speed train type services, for example between Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Inverness.<br/>
I know that the hon. Gentleman will join me in deprecating the desperately unfortunate consequences of what is happening. On the one hand, we all want to see a modern BR, able to compete and provide the sort of services that the travelling public wants, so that it will use the services. On the other hand, to do that BR has to modernise its equipment and fleets. It is a desperately unfortunate byproduct of that, that it does not have the maintenance requirement that so fully occupied the works before. Over a year ago, BREL told its trade unions that the lower maintenance work load meant that the work force at Springburn would need to be reduced to about 500 by March 1987. British Rail was not able to give figures beyond that date, but Springburn's long-term prospects were clearly very uncertain.<br/>
That announcement was naturally unwelcome to the hon. Gentleman and his constituents. During the past year, BR has been giving further study to the best way of organising its maintenance arrangements in future years. It is seeking ways to improve efficiency, and it has concluded that in future, most light maintenance will be done by exchanging parts at depots. That helps to get vehicles back into productive use while the defective parts are taken away to be repaired separately.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman asked whether this was a tried and tested method, or whether it was experimental. It has already been in use for several years for some of the fleets used on the southern region of BR. That way, vehicles need go back to the main works for refurbishment only every eight or 10 years. It is in use, for example, at Chart Leacon, Ilford and Selhurst Park. The latest position is that last month BR announced the details of the new BREL organisation. British Rail made it clear that without a change in strategy, continuing reductions in the maintenance work load would have led to the complete


closure of Springburn next March. But instead, BR's new strategy of greater reliance on component exchanges at depots offers a new role for Springburn. British Rail now proposes that Springburn should become the regional maintenance depot offering work for up to 200 people.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman raised several detailed points about the implications of BR's proposals. Those details are management matters, which BR and BREL will need to consider in the consultation that they will be having with their unions. As the hon. Gentleman rightly pointed out, in reaching final decisions they will have to take account of the cost of moving vehicles to England for heavy overhaul. But the distribution of work between BREL sites must remain a matter for the BREL management. I understand that BREL plans to complete the existing Strathclyde refurbishment order at Springburn, but that it does not plan to undertake any further major overhaul work there.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman also asked some specific questions. He mentioned that the press had been refused access to the Springburn works. That is not quite the position. The press had access to the conference room, but wanted to tour the works. There were about 40 journalists, and I think that the hon. Gentleman will realise that for safety reasons&#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i> That is my information. The management took the view&#x2014;as it was entitled to do&#x2014;that for safety reasons people should not wander round machinery.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman also raised the question of upgrading bogies, and talk in the press of that work going to Springburn. I understand that the wheel shop will be retained when Springburn is taken over by BR, but I cannot predict the level of employment. Importantly, the hon. Gentleman also asked what would be done to help to provide alternative work. Regrettably, the new role for Springburn will still entail substantial job losses. I recognise that that causes deep anxiety and distress to all those concerned, as well as to me.<br/>
I share the hon. Gentleman's sadness about those job losses. I have explained this evening some of the reasoning that has led the British Rail board to put forward these proposals. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that British Rail will be doing all that it can to soften the impact of these changes. A senior BR director will co-ordinate measures to help those affected, working with BREL to find alternative jobs both within BR and outside the railway industry.<br/>
BREL has offered a major job creation package for Springburn on similar lines to that offered at other sites affected by works closures, making available &#x00A3;1 million at Springburn. The Scottish Development Agency has also committed money to the area. Scottish Ministers have indicated that they stand ready to deal with any selective assistance or regional development grant proposals for the area.</p>

<p>No. There is a very important point that I want to make.<br/>
I hope that every possibility for bringing new industry into the area will be explored. Unfortunately, I gather

that progress continues to be held up by strained relations between some of the bodies involved. May I ask the hon. Member for Springburn to urge all the interested groups to work with BR and the Scottish Development Agency on trying to find the best means of promoting alternative employment to replace the jobs that have been lost.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman will know that I am personally committed to helping in new job creation. Last autumn I went back to Shildon in County Durham to see the progress that has been made since BREL had to close its wagon works there. I was much encouraged to see the results so far. Over 700 jobs have been created in the area since the closure and a further 1,100 are in the pipeline over the next three years. That is a significant achievement in an area already hard hit by the decline of traditional industries.<br/>
I hope that similar success can be achieved at Springburn. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will join me in that thought, and I should be happy personally to ask him to join me on a visit to Shildon so that he can see the effect of maximum co-operation between all those who are able to help in the important task of job creation.</p>

<p>I should like to write to the hon. Gentleman about that point.<br/>
There is a very important point that I want to make. The hon. Member for Springburn &#x2014; who, perhaps under-standably, is emotional, as he represents an area where there have been job losses &#x2014;talked about fighting to prevent this. I hope that he will allow nothing to happen, because of the fighting talk that he uses that will inhibit in any way proper co-operation between the work force, the unions, the local authority, BREL and BR to ensure that the maximum is done to create new jobs in the area. That would be very unfortunate.<br/>
At Swindon strained relations led to substantial delay in the start of progressive work to create new jobs in the area. I hope that Glasgow will have the good sense to follow the pattern of Shildon rather than the disappointing pattern at Swindon. It makes a difference to the speed with which new jobs can be created in the area. I know that the hon. Gentleman would like job creation to be a success, and I hope that he will not do anything, or encourage anybody to do anything that would damage its effectiveness.<br/>
The next step is for British Rail to take forward its consultation with the work force. BR's proposals will, I am sure, be subject to critical and searching examination. It will then be for the management to decide how to proceed, but I hope that it can proceed in an atmosphere of co-operation, concentrating on how to cope with the adjustments which are necessary to bring our railway system into the 21st century. I am sure that BR does not see its proposals as immutable in every detail.<br/>
It is absolutely clear that we must modernise our railways if they are to
flourish and survive. That inevitably


means dramatic changes in the maintenance requirements associated with massive investment in modern rolling stock that does not require the amount of maintenance that was required by the old-fashioned equipment that British Rail has used for so long.</p>
