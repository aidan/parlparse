<p>The experiments in the narcotising of wood pigeons last winter included two in Huntingdonshire but none in Bedfordshire. Because of adverse weather, none of the experiments could be continued long enough for a proper assessment of the effectiveness of this means of control or of the degree of risk to wild life and to game birds. The experiments have been discontinued during the summer months, as the birds will not take the

narcotised bait then, but further experiments are contemplated for the winter of 1963&#x2013;64.</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon.

<p>I cannot accept that it is not possible to bring before the courts any case of cruelty that may arise in such circumstances. The powers of the police under Section 12 of the Protection of Animals Act, 1911, enable them to act against any person whom they have reason to believe is guilty of such an offence.

<p>My hon. Friend will appreciate that questions about the police and their powers are for my right hon.

<p>Is my right hon. Friend aware that his answer is totally unsatisfactory and unacceptable, since it merely exposes that it is, in fact, impossible to obtain any information in regard to these matters? If there is nothing to hide, why cannot my right hon.

<p>We have given advice to farmers that satisfactory results can be obtained by allowing calves reasonable freedom of movement in ordinary accommodation and in small groups, keeping them not in darkness but in a subdued light.<br/>
I do not know whether my hon. Friend is aware of the fact that these methods are not being used to any large extent. We made a survey in 1961, and our information then was that there were about 95 farmers indulging in this kind of calf rearing. I am informed that there has been a consistent lessening of the number since then. I do not believe that it is taking place to any great extent or in a way which involves cruelty to the animals, for it is an essential feature that the animals should thrive, and this cannot happen if there is cruelty.</p>

<p>None, Sir; but before the G.A.T.T. meeting in Geneva, discussions took place between representatives of the Forestry Commission, the Board of Trade, the Forestry Committee of

<p>I am very glad to hear my right hon. Friend say that there was adequate consultation between the proper interests and the Ministries concerned. Will he bear in mind that the problem of standing hard woods can be particularly affected by steps of this sort and that it is not sufficient just to consult the Forestry Commission on matters of this sort simply because the other half of the industry happens to own about 90 per cent. of the matured timber? Although relations between both the private side and the State side of the forestry industry are of the highest order, will my right hon.

<p>I thank my right hon. Friend for that reply, but is he aware that there has been feeling among inshore fishermen, particularly in my constituency, about the fact that, while they


have been free to land their catches in Norway, they have not received the same welcome in Sweden or Denmark? As these nations have freedom to land in our ports, cannot we ensure that our own fishermen are able to land in theirs if they wish to do so?</p>

<p>This booklet was published to help gardeners choose the right chemical and use it in the correct way. Of the listed chemicals, all the chlorinated hydro-carbons have been considered by the Advisory Committee on Poisonous Substances and the guidance contained in the booklet takes account of the recommendations of the Advisory Committee for their safe use.<br/>
The use of chlorinated hydro-carbons as seed dressings has already been severely restricted, but other uses of these chemicals in pesticides have not so far been considered to offer serious hazards to wild life.<br/>
In view of the continuing concern expressed by the wild life societies that

other uses of these chemicals in agriculture and in gardens may also be responsible for some bird deaths, I have asked the Advisory Committee to undertake a further examination, taking into account all recent evidence, and to make a report to me.</p>

<p>I am most grateful to my right hon. Friend for his Answer. Will he undertake to ensure that in future there is a thorough investigation into all of these new insecticides before they are introduced, because there is very great concern in this country about the loss of wild life as a result of the introduction of chemicals which might do damage and even cause death and suffering to animals?</p>

<p>I can certainly give my hon. Friend that assurance. His anxiety about the possible effects on wild life through the use of chemicals is widely felt, not least by myself. We have this Advisory Committee which covers all interests and which has a great deal of knowledge. I can give my hon. Friend the assurance that all chemicals will be referred to this body, and we shall ask it to look at any new evidence which there is.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1963-06-19a.430.2" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mrs. Butler" colnum="430" time="">
<p>Nevertheless, is it not very serious that this list has been published, and is there not great public concern about the dangers of farm and garden chemicals? Many people are led to think that if they follow this list they will be safe and that there will be no persistent danger to birds and animals. Will not this list as published by the Ministry do more harm than good in this serious situation?</p>

<p>I could not accept that. Perhaps I can help the hon. Lady. These chemicals to which she refers&#x2014;all the chlorinated hydro-carbons and persistent chemicals&#x2014;have all been examined by the Advisory Committee. As a result of the advice which it gave to me, we had a meeting with all the interests concerned, and the decision which was taken was that these chemicals should not be used as seed dressing during the spring and should be used only in certain circumstances during the autumn. This has been followed and the effect has been a very appreciable diminution in the number of birds found dead and sent to the laboratories


for autopsy. This was the only recommendation concerning these particular chemicals. They have been used for things other than seed dressing, and they are still so used.<br/>
What I am saying is that, in view of the anxiety expressed by certain societies that even in the use to which chemicals are now being put other than as seed dressing they may still be causing an undue number of deaths among wild life, this anxiety should be communicated to the Advisory Committee, which would report to me.</p>

<p>Certainly not. I am not confirming anything. What I am saying is that certain societies have said that, in their view, there is evidence that birds have been killed through having had contact with or having eaten chemicals other than those used for seed dressings and that this matter should be examined by the Advisory Committee, which I must look to. All that this published booklet does is to include these chemicals. It does not say that they should be used as seed dressings and it follows the advice given to me by the Advisory Committee. I do not think that there is anything unusual in referring this question back to the Advisory Committee. We must remain constantly vigilant, and no doubt if fresh evidence comes to light it will be noted.</p>

<p>Is it not the fact that there is no conclusive evidence that these chemicals are harmless?

<p>No, Sir. What the Parliamentary Secretary said was that the booklet itself was not sent to the

Advisory Committee. There was no need to do that. All that the Advisory Committee has done has been to look at the chemicals in the booklet, particularly the hydro-carbons. It has not examined all the chemicals. For instance, some of the older ones which have been in use longer have not yet been through the Advisory Committee, but all the persistent and chlorinated hydrocarbons have been examined.</p>

<p>The House would find considerable difficulty in introducing amending legislation to put the Market elsewhere without specifying where it is to be put.

<p>I remember my hon. Friend's Amendment, which would enable the Authority to rebuild the Market on any approved site outside the Covent Garden area. My hon.

Friend and others, both here and in another place, that during the passage of the Bill the Government made it clear that if the Authority decided that it wanted to go outside the Covent Garden area we would not stand in its way in proceeding by a Private Bill. It would not, however, have been acceptable to the House, nor do I think that it would be acceptable today, to pass legislation giving the Authority <i>carte blanche</i> about where the site should be before the location of the site is decided.</p>

Thirdly, in spite of all the evidence, does he now believe&#x2014;[Hon. Members: "Too long."]&#x2014;It is not too long. This is a very important matter indeed, and so far hon.

<p>The hon.

<p>These shortages were not foreseen simply because certain events happened which could not possibly have been foreseen. In particular, we were able to make much better progress than we had expected in the commissioning of ships, and that caused a temporary shortage here. There were certain changes in the run-down in Malta which also caused a problem. The whole matter has been gone into in detail, and I do not think that it would help to go over it again. This is not the result of being foolish and not looking forward; it is the result of success in our efforts.</p>

<p>Is my hon. Friend aware that what is normally called wastage is a very serious matter, because what it really means is that when a man retires from a job there is not another job for


another man looking for employment What we want to see is this Government maintaining in the Royal Dockyards the present standard of employment and the same number, at least, of people employed there as are employed at the moment.</p>

<p>The use of the expression "wastage" can cover a great many things. The wastage that I had in mind in preparing my answer to the Question covered things like death, discharge and voluntary retirement. There is, of course, a lot of room for misunderstanding of what wastage can mean. A promotion can involve no wastage if the job is phased out. On the other hand, a single promotion could involve wastage of up to six or seven people, so I think that one has to be a little careful in using the expression wastage in that sense.</p>

<p>With your permission, Mr. Speaker, and that of the House I will now answer Question No. 63.<br/>
Yes, Sir, and copies will be available to hon. Members in the Vote Office this afternoon.<br/>
Mr. Cronkshaw, a former prisoner, made 11 allegations of ill-treatment of other prisoners at Durham while he was there. The Visiting Committee finds that eight of these allegations were without foundation of any kind.<br/>
Of the remaining three, it reports that one involved a conflict of evidence but, even if true, was not of a serious nature; that one disclosed a defect in prison routine, which is being looked into, but no negligence or irregularity on the part of the officers concerned; and that one, which also involved a conflict of evidence, left the Committee with grave suspicion that two officers might have been guilty, if not of an assault on a prisoner, at least of using more force than the circumstances warranted, although no complaint


was made by the prisoner concerned or anyone else at the time.<br/>
The Visiting Committee itself reported that it could not regard the facts as having been proved, but I nevertheless thought it right that the papers be referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions. His conclusion is that the evidence is clearly insufficient to support a prosecution of the two officers.<br/>
Many of Mr. Cronkshaw's allegations included criticism of the prison medical service. The Visiting Committee finds that none of these criticisms has been substantiated, and that no blame of any kind attaches to the prison medical service.<br/>
Hon. Members will wish to read for themselves the comments in the report on the value to be attached to Mr. Cronkshaw's allegations generally. I cannot but regret the wide publicity that was given to them as soon as they were made and before their authenticity had been investigated. It inflicted harm on the reputation and morale of the prison service which the publication of the report, based on thorough investigation, should certainly dispel.</p>

<p>I thank the Home Secretary for making that statement today. Is it not rather a coincidence that a few hours previous to the right hon. Gentleman making his statement I received a message to suggest that Mr. Cronkshaw, who made these allegations, is now remanded in custody in Liverpool Prison on charges of forgery. This is the kind of man who made the charges in the first place.</p>

<p>I did not say that he had.<br/>
May I express satisfaction at the way things have gone, although the form of inquiry differed from the kind I asked for? A word of appreciation is due to the Visiting Committee for the lengths that it went to to try to discover the truth. This is already admitted by Mr. Cronkshaw himself, even though he attended for only one afternoon out of six whole days' sittings.<br/>
As for the report, I believe that it proves that the prison officers, except in one case&#x2014;and I am sorry about that case&#x2014;are doing a difficult job under very diffi-

cult circumstances. They are human beings, and ought to be treated as such. I share with the Home Secretary the view that too much publicity was given to the matter before the facts were known.</p>

We may wish to return to the report later, but before that I should like to ask the right hon. Gentleman one fundamental question. Is he aware that when he set up this committee of inquiry there was criticism from some quarters over the fact that we had asked a Visiting Committee to undertake this inquiry, and because the committee is a committee of visiting magistrates who themselves have been responsible in the past for hearing complaints from prisoners? Can he give an assurance that this in no way detracts from the value of the report?</p>

<p>Does the right hon.

As hon. Members know, the general strike began as a protest against the introduction of a Labour Relations Bill. This Bill had passed through the Lower House, but had not yet reached the Upper House. It has, therefore, lapsed with the prorogation and I hope very

much that the strike will now be brought speedily to an end.<br/>
I urge all parties in British Guiana, now that the cause of the strike has been removed, to work constructively towards remedying the economic damage done to their country in recent weeks, and to try again to resolve the political deadlock.</p>

<p>May I say, while acknowledging the apology from the Secretary of State for his absence and wishing every courtesy to be extended to the President of India, that I think it unfortunate that the Secretary of State himself was not able to be present to answer the Question, bearing in mind that these troubles, political and economic, have been going on for two months. It is the opinion of all of us on this side of the House that the Secretary of State has not given the matter the close personal attention which the problem deserves.<br/>
Can the Under-Secretary of State tell us when the next session will be summoned, because in the meantime a very dangerous situation exists? Perhaps the hon. Gentleman can tell us what is to be done immediately to try to solve the present problem and bring the strike to an end.</p>

<p>I apologise to the House for my right hon. Friend's absence. As the right hon. Gentleman said, my right hon. Friend is in attendance upon the President of India&#x2014;a very long-standing commitment&#x2014;and I hope that the House will excuse him.<br/>
We do not know how long the House of Assembly will remain prorogued, but I understand that six days' notice must be given before it can be recalled. I have sent a telegram to the Governor this morning to ask him for further information on that point.<br/>
On the wider question of the settlement of this dispute, I think that the strike will now be settled because the cause of it has been removed by the fact that the Labour Relations Bill, which was so objectionable to the T.U.C., has now lapsed. The difficulty we are in here, as the right hon. Gentleman will appreciate, is the terms and conditions for the resumption of work. Those are a point of real difficulty.<br/>
I did, as a matter of fact, try to telephone Mr. George Woodcock this morning, because I hoped that he might be able to suggest someone to go out on this essentially industrial matter. But, unfortunately, he is in Geneva. It was, I know, to the regret of the House that Mr. Cousins was taken ill, because he would have been an ideal catalyst acceptable to both sides.</p>

<p>While acknowledging what has been done, and hoping that a reputable trade unionist can be found who will be willing to go out at once, I still think that further action is required. I hope that the Government will not resolve their responsibilities by saying that this will settle the matter.<br/>
Can the Minister tell us whether it was the Premier of British Guiana who asked for Parliament to be prorogued?</p>

<p>Yes, Sir. It was the Premier of British Guiana who asked for prorogation, and the Governor is bound to act on his advice in this matter under the existing Constitution. I do not want to try to wriggle out of Her Majesty's Government's responsibility in this matter, but this is a fully internal self-governing territory where the Governor has no reserve powers except in the matter of foreign affairs and defence. We hope that they will not always look to Britain to save them from their follies, but will try to help themselves and to reconcile the political and racial difficulties which exist there.</p>

<p>I do not think that the Premier has given any such assurance and I understood this morning that the T.U.C. was inclined to press him so to do. I would hope that we could leave this matter now, because the Bill has lapsed. The cause of the strike is removed and I would hope that the local T.U.C. would not press the matter,

because I think that it might further sour up relations which now seem to have a chance of improvement.</p>

<p>Is there not a matter of grave constitutional importance involved here? As I understood the hon. Gentleman, he said that the Parliament had been prorogued and that, therefore, he thought the strike would come to an end. Is prorogation to be used as a method of strike breaking? Surely the Parliament has got to be called together out there as it would be here. What guarantee can the hon. Gentleman give us that Parliamentary democracy will take its course, quite apart from the settlement of the strike, and that the Parliament will be called together at the appropriate time?</p>

<p>This is purely a matter of fact. The very fact of the prorogation means that the Labour Relations Bill, which has not gone right through the whole Legislature&#x2014;not to the Upper House&#x2014;automatically lapses and, therefore, the cause of the strike is automatically removed. Of course, the Assembly will be recalled, but, as I explained to the right hon. Gentleman, I do not know when. I have inquired from the Governor what is proposed.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.<br/>
I have it, Sir, in Command from Her Majesty the Queen to acquaint the House that Her Majesty, having been informed of the contents of the Bill, has been generously pleased to place the interests of the Crown at the disposal of Parliament in connection therewith.<br/>
Few Bills have had such exhaustive examination in advance of Second Reading and I do not propose to spend any time taking the House through the various stages of the Wedgwood Benn-Stansgate case, the by-election, the Report of the Committee of Privileges and the attempts then made by my predecessor the Leader of the House, the First Secretary of State, and then by myself to find an agreed basis for inquiry.<br/>
Finally, the Joint Committee was set up in March, 1962, it reported in December, 1962, there were debates in both Houses at the end of March this year, a statement from myself on 15th May, and the Bill, as hon. Members will see, was printed on 30th May. To put it mildly, I do not think that anybody can claim that there has been undue delay in dealing with this important matter.<br/>
As far as implementation is concerned&#x2014;and I want to say one special word about Clause 7 in a moment&#x2014;the Bill will come into force on the dissolution of the present Parliament. That fulfils the pledge which I have given on a number of occasions, both in these statements and during business questions on Thursday, that we hope that the Bill will become law this Session, but, that in any event, we would, if we were supported by Parliament, see that it was in operation before the next General Election, whenever that might be.<br/>
I have spoken so often on this matter that I am sure the House will agree it is reasonable for me to speak briefly today, particularly as I have no new announcement to make, so I turn to the Bill.

The House will remember that the Committee of Privileges, in its Report in March, 1961, underwrote the view of the Select Committee which sat in 1895 and which, in turn, upheld the view of Mr. Speaker Onslow, in 1760, in some famous words, which were:
<q>The attendance in both Houses of Parliament is considered a service and the two services incompatible with each other.</q>
If the House agrees to the Bill, Clauses 1 to 3 will, in fact, alter that position. If these Clauses become law&#x2014;as I certainly hope that they will&#x2014;anybody who has succeeded to a peerage, or who, in the future, does succeed to a peerage, will have the opportunity to disclaim the peerage for his lifetime and so renounce for himself&#x2014;but not, of course, for his successors&#x2014;the rights and privileges of a peerage and, at the same time, remove his disqualification to sit in this House and to vote in parliamentary elections.<br/>
There is one point of nomenclature which I should mention. We have always previously used the term "surrender". The House will see that now we use the word "disclaim". The Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill says that this is for technical reasons. The thought behind it is that the word "surrender" is a technical term in real property law, and it means the merger of a lesser estate in a greater estate, and so its extinguishment. But that is not what the Commitee recommended, although some people might hold the view that it should have done.<br/>
In fact, the Committee did not do so and, therefore, the word "disclaim" is, I think, a more accurate reflection of what the Committee said, because it does not connote the extinction of the thing disclaimed. For example, a legatee may well disclaim a bequest which he does not want.</p>

<p>Does that mean that if the word "surrender" were put in the place of the word "disclaim" it would mean that they would have to hand on any entailed estate to anybody who would normally succeed them?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1963-06-19a.462.1" hansard_membership_id="8744" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/17735" speakername="Mr. Macleod" colnum="462" time="">
<p>I do not think that it would. I will ask my right hon. and learned Friend the Attorney-General to deal with that from the purely legal point


of view. But I am sure that the answer is, "no". The Bill itself would still prevail, but for the reasons I have given I think that "disclaim" is a more accurate expression of the sense of the Committee.<br/>
Three separate periods of time are involved. For a future succession it is twelve months. For a peer who has succeeded before the passing of the Bill it is six months. He has had, of course, many months, in addition, to reflect on the position likely to appear. There is an even shorter period of one month&#x2014;because, of course, of the necessity of not disfranchising the electorate in a particular constituency&#x2014;in the case of a sitting Member of the House of Commons or a candidate in an election.<br/>
There are two small complications which I ought to mention, and which follow from two of the departures that my statement of 15th May&#x2014;with acceptance from the other side of the House&#x2014;indicated that it might be right to make from the recommendations of the Joint Select Committee. The Committee recommended that a candidate in an election to Parliament, by accepting nomination, should be deemed to have entered into an undertaking to surrender any peerage he might inherit before the declaration of the poll.<br/>
This is, of course, an extremely unlikely contingency. But it seems right to make some provision for it, particularly as it is not always possible to be certain straight away, in the case of a complicated succession, whether anyone has or has not succeeded. We therefore propose&#x2014;I hope that the House will think it reasonable&#x2014;that the election should be allowed to proceed. If the candidate does not top the poll, the question does not arise. If he does, he should have one month. That is the maximum period. If he is determined to continue with his membership of this House, should he be successful in the poll, there is nothing whatever to stop him from disclaiming straight away to remove an uncertainty, if there is one.<br/>
The second departure from, or actually in this case it is an addition to, the Joint Select Committee's recommendations, is to meet a point made by many hon. Members, I think with considerable force, during our last debate, that a

Member of Parliament should be allowed some latitude during the period of one month if he is ill, or there is a reason for which he cannot reasonably exercise his choice. We have tried to meet that point in Clause 2 (4) and you, Mr. Speaker, have agreed that under this subsection you would be ready to act and to certify that a Member is under such infirmity as would disable him from acting. We have also covered the case of a Member of Parliament who is abroad, perhaps on a parliamentary delegation, by providing that the time should not run, particularly during a Recess.<br/>
The third point of departure from the Joint Select Committee's recommendations is one to which I myself drew attention and I am sure that what we propose is the right thing to do. We do not propose to require a peer who has disclaimed to exhibit to the returning officer a certificate of disclaimer, so there is nothing about that in the Bill. I understand the reasons for the Joint Select Committee's recommendation, but this would put an entirely new function upon the returning officer and it would mean that he would have to screen candidates in this respect. That is a duty he does not have on any other grounds for disqualification of membership of this House. If the returning officer has this responsibility, in logic we should have to add to the number.<br/>
I do not know what description of themselves hon. Members give when they hand in their nomination forms. In the five or six elections in which I have taken part I have described myself as a journalist. So far as I know, it is no part of the duty of a returning officer to check whether I am or not&#x2014;although, in fact, I am a card carrying, although an associate member, of one of the main organisations concerned.<br/>
Equally, if a woman candidate for this House describes herself as a spinster, it is not part of the duty of a returning officer to ascertain whether that is a correct description. I think that the House will agree, therefore, that this is not perhaps a duty which we ought to put on the shoulders of returning officers, and that is why there is nothing about it in the Bill.<br/>
I propose to discuss the rest of the Bill very swiftly. Clauses 4 to 6 incor-


porate the recommendations of the Joint Select Committee on Scottish peers, Irish peers and peeresses&#x2014;I will say a separate word about that in a moment. The position so far as Clause 4 is concerned is that full rights of admission to the House of Lords are given to all peers and peeresses of Scotland and the system of representative peers is brought to an end. Peeresses in their own right are to be in the same position as hereditary peers for Parliamentary purposes and the existing restriction on peers and peeresses of Ireland in respect of membership of this House and the constituencies for which they could stand and in relation to their voting are removed.<br/>
I pointed out in an earlier debate that the effect of this would be to add 34, as a maximum, members&#x2014;some of whom might not wish to play their full part in the affairs of another place&#x2014;to the present maximum complement of 930. But that is less any peers who may disclaim.<br/>
I have not dealt with Committee points, although some such points will probably be raised in the debate today. I have also not dealt with the argument which, I understand from the previous debates, the Opposition may wish to put forward; that is, that a peerage should be extinguished rather than simply disclaimed for life, as is the proposal of the Joint Select Committee and as is proposed in the Bill. I have not discussed the position of the Irish peerage, although I am sure&#x2014;certainly in another place and probably in this&#x2014;that this question will be raised. The Government's view is that the recommendation of the Joint Select Committee in paragraphs 10 and 11 is correct in relation to this matter; although we will, of course, listen to any comments that are made.<br/>
Equally, I have not dealt with the one or two special cases, one of which has been referred to as the case of the noble Lord, Lord Long ford, who, for various reasons, could not obtain relief under the Bill as it stands. This is a Committee point to which, in due course&#x2014;if the matter is raised&#x2014;we would be glad to listen. The Government's view coincides with that of the Joint Select Committee and is, therefore, embodied in the Bill as it stands.</p>

<p>Can the right hon. Gentleman say whether the Government still have an open mind on this point? Will they give sympathetic consideration to an Amendment, if one is proposed, in Committee?</p>

<p>I would not like to go as far as that. We will listen to any comments that are made, but the connotation of "sympathetic consideration" is usually, from this Box, that one is inclined towards it. The view of the Government is that the view of the Joint Select Committee&#x2014;and, therefore, of the Bill&#x2014;is right; but we will listen to any arguments that are put forward.<br/>
The Bill contains no reference to courtesy titles although the Joint Select Committee recommended that they should be abolished for the relatives of peers who disclaim as well as for the peer himself and his wife. There is an important distinction here. The peer has a title and his wife has one in her own right and, therefore, the legislation we propose is necessary for that reason. But courtesy titles are, as the name implies, not really titles at all and, as they do not exist in law, we can hardly pass laws about them. It is extremely improbable, in any case, that any situation in this sphere will arise.<br/>
The sort of possibility would be that if the son of a peer who had himself disclaimed decided to stand for the House of Commons, and in respect of his father's disclaimer and his own candidature for this place, persisted in using a courtesy title. I would not have thought that this is particularly likely, although it could happen and I suppose that the House, if it wished, could deal with this question by the way it makes reference in debate to those who may hold courtesy titles.</p>

<p>Will my right hon. Friend explain what the position will be under the Bill for such hon. Members as myself and my hon. Friend the Member for Hertford (Lord Balniel)? Do we, in the sad event of succeeding to the peerage, retain our courtesy titles if we do not accept the peerage, and do our families, or do we, become commoners and renounce our courtesy titles? What is the position?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1963-06-19a.466.3" hansard_membership_id="8744" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/17735" speakername="Mr. Macleod" colnum="466" time="">
<p>As I understand it, the position is that in the unfortunate event


of my noble Friend succeeding through a death to a peerage to which he is the heir, he would become a peer. In this connection, I will shortly make a special reference on a fairly narrow point about this matter. He would then be a peer and, in the next Parliament, he would have one month in which to disclaim that title. If he did disclaim, it would be in accordance with the effects of the disclaimer under Clause 3, which states:
<q>The disclaimer of a peerage&#x2026;shall operate&#x2026;</q>
<q>(<i>a</i>) to divest that person (and, if he is married, his wife) of all right or interest to or in the peerage, and all titles, rights, offices, privileges and precedence attaching thereto&#x2026;</q>
Therefore, the answer to my noble Friend's question, subject to a point which I shall make in a moment, is that in the next Parliament&#x2014;and if he were an hon. Member of the House of Commons then, and then succeeded&#x2014;he would have a month in which to disclaim. If he did so disclaim, then from the time of that disclaimer he would have no right, for his lifetime, to the title and would, therefore, use his ordinary name without the courtesy title.</p>

<p>That is the position. Indeed, I said that. I said that courtesy titles are, as the name implies, not really titles at all. The hon. and learned Member is quite right. This is a matter of social convention. What a man calls himself is not our concern.</p>

<p>We should try to get this matter clear, because the right hon. Gentleman tended to make the point that courtesy titles were probably not very important. Is

it the case that, from the point of view of the rules of this House, a person concerned in this way would be a commoner?</p>

<p>That is exactly right. In law and otherwise they would be commoners, but what one cannot do in a Bill is to provide, shall we say, what name is written opposite a person's place if that person is attending a reception or something of that sort. They are social matters with which we are not concerned.</p>

<p>I think that it would be more sensible, from my point of view, to know what the position is. Do I have to renounce all titles? I want to get the legal position clear. I am technically a commoner now. Is there anything to stop me continuing to call myself "Lord Lambton" and remaining a commoner in the House of Commons, through never having gone to the House of Lords?</p>

<p>The hon. and learned Member for Northampton (Mr. Paget) put the matter correctly. In law, my noble Friend would have no right to do so. If the time comes when my noble Friend becomes my hon. Friend we will go on, I hope, on precisely the same footing. The point is that, in law, he would, in those circumstances, be entirely a commoner and would be so referred to in all legal documents, but what he called himself would be a matter entirely for him.<br/>
That is why there is nothing in the Bill referring to that point. Other people, of course, could call my noble Friend what they like, but that is a tempting field into which I shall not enter. I think that what I have said to the House is accurate. My right hon. and learned Friend the Attorney-General tells me that it is, and perhaps he will specifically deal with this point when he winds up the debate.<br/>
There is one point that I should bring to the notice of the House and of those hon. Members who, like my noble Friend, may succeed to a peerage. Subsection (2) of Clause 7 says:
<q>This Act shall come into force on the dissolution of the present Parliament.</q>
That is in accordance with everything I have said, and I think it right&#x2014;I have


said so over and over again&#x2014;but there is the point that a Member of this House might, in the unhappy event of a death, succeed to a peerage before the dissolution of this Parliament. In that case, unless the event took place within a few weeks of that date, he could not take advantage of this Measure, and could not return for the same seat&#x2014;not, at any rate, without an interval.<br/>
This point arose in the drafting of the Bill, and I looked at it carefully. I do not suggest that we should make any amendment to the Bill, but it is right that hon. Members should have this point in mind. I had thought of seeing whether we could draft a formula in relation to the matter, but as the ends of the commitment would be unknown&#x2014;that is to say, the date of the election and the date, if any, of a death&#x2014;I have so far found that impossible.<br/>
My recommendation, therefore, would be that we should keep subsection (2) as it is, subject, of course, to the usual examination by a Committee of this House and in another place. There are eight or 10 hon. Members who, unhappily, could conceivably be affected by this provision, and I thought it right to draw attention to it.</p>

<p>I think that we are on very dangerous ground now. Some of us would equally claim that the one person disadvantaged up to now is Mr. Wedgwood Benn himself.

<p>With respect, the hon. Gentleman has got the point entirely wrong. I was concerned only with the question of the one month, and only with present Members of the House of Commons. I make it clear that I do not suggest an alteration, but I think it only fair to those eight or 10 hon. Members, and to the House as a whole, to draw attention to the conceivable effect of this provision upon them.<br/>
I have been through the Bill; it is simple but, at the same time, of considerable importance. I think that at all stages&#x2014;and there has been very close consultation, indeed&#x2014;there has been a

surprising and growing measure of agreement. We may therefore reasonably hope that the Bill will find its way to the Statute Book at an early date, and I personally commend it to the House.</p>

<p>As one who spent long days on the Joint Select Committee, I welcome the Bill. That Committee had strictly limited terms of reference and, broadly speaking, its conclusions within those terms of reference have gone into the Bill, although in it there are some things with which I do not agree.<br/>
The wider issues were, by agreement of the House, excluded, and I merely state that I have never been persuaded of the value of a second Chamber. I certainly do not believe in an hereditary right to become a legislator although, equally, I do not believe in a hereditary bar to the right to become a legislator or to vote. But I must admit that many of the disadvantages of the second Chamber disappear if it is a chamber without power. One can only tolerate it on the assumption that it does not abuse what powers it has, and never stands in the way of this elected Chamber.<br/>
We did not get all that we wanted in the Joint Select Committee, but the Bill does give us a chance to put right one or two grave wrongs, and I will certainly not forgo the right to correct them just because we are not getting all we wanted.<br/>
The major wrong we are righting is that done not only to Mr. Wedgwood Benn&#x2014;who was, after all, fairly elected to this House but not allowed to take his seat in it&#x2014;but the more important wrong done to those who voted for him, who were themselves disfranchised. That is the great wrong that we are putting right. As my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. C. Pannell) said on a previous occasion, that was putting the hereditary principle before the elective principle. We cannot tolerate that, and that is why there is broad agreement on the principles of this Bill.<br/>
A reference to the major principles that guided the Joint Select Committee will probably make it easier to judge the merits of particular proposals in the Bill, or not in it. The major argument in the Joint Select Committee was between two completely conflicting views. One view was that if a peer divested himself of his title, or disclaimed it&#x2014;whatever the term may be&#x2014;he was making a sacrifice of his own rights and positions and the rights and position of his children to come.<br/>
The opposite view, held by my hon. Friends and myself, was that to be able to disclaim a title, far from taking away a right, conferred a very great right on the peer concerned; the very great right to be a commoner, and to exercise the great privileges and status of a commoner, both to vote in the country&#x2014;because a peer cannot now so vote&#x2014;and to sit in this honourable Chamber. We felt that a very great right was being conferred on him.<br/>
It is extremely important that we should approach the whole matter from the point of view that we are conferring a great right upon people who have been deprived of it, and not upon the basis that we are taking away rights from them, or enabling them to take those rights from themselves or their children. That was the basic issue that at first divided the Joint Select Committee. Broadly speaking, we went on the second

principle, namely, that we were conferring a great right on peers by enabling them to assume the status and the rights of a commoner.<br/>
We went on to other basic principles which I think I should state in order to make it easier to judge the various issues in the Bill, or not in it. One is that we should do our utmost to avoid any danger of anyone having it both ways, of people having options about which House they sit in because they happen to be hereditary peers. We wanted to avoid any in-and-out possibility as much as possible.<br/>
The second principle was that we should give the right to become a commoner only to peers who had been involuntarily deprived of it. In other words, it should not extend to Members of the House of Lords who had gone there at full age by their own decision, not to life peers, peers of the first creation, Law Lords and people of that kind. Only those who have not gone there by pure accident but by their own decision at full age should be deprived of this right.<br/>
The Committee carried out these principles and, in effect, they are all embodied in the Bill. We cannot be wholly logical in this matter. In spite of our dislike of the hereditary principle, we find ourselves in agreement with the view that 34 peers should be added to their Lordships' House. It would create far more anomalies in applying this right to give up a peerage if we had gone on with the elective system of Scottish peers. It would have involved continuing inequality between the sexes in the other House. On the Joint Select Committee it seemed to all of us that when balancing one thing with another this would be common sense although not strictly logical.<br/>
On the point made by the noble Lord the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Viscount Lambton), we wanted to make perfectly clear that while anyone might avail himself of the right to become a commoner there will still be people, like himself, sitting in this House with a title and there might be Irish peers doing so. We felt that we could not clear up the whole of this enormous problem and that it would be right to concentrate on the major issue. The basic position is that any peer who avails himself of the right to become a


commoner should be assimilated as closely as possible to the status of a commoner. It is for that reason that he gives up his title for life and loses the hereditary right to go to another place. The commoner would not have that right.<br/>
It seemed that we ought to go further in one particular. This is a matter to which we attach very great importance. It is that any peer who avails himself of this very great right to become a commoner should drown and extinguish his title, not just suspend it for his lifetime. The argument for this is simple. If he is becoming a commoner he should be a commoner. A commoner does not carry in his loins the capacity to send his eldest son to the House of Lords.</p>

<p>Or to the Commons.<br/>
A peer who comes to the House of Commons should be a commoner and be deprived of this right because, if he is to become a commoner, he should become a commoner and should have the full rights of a commoner, but not have the privileges which do not inhere in a commoner. That is why, not merely because we are against the hereditary principle but because we feel so strongly about this, we must make a peer who becomes a commoner, a commoner.<br/>
That is the logic of the whole thing and why, quite apart from our general view of principle here, talking merely within the logic of what the Committee tried and the Bill tries to do, it seems that this is the conclusion which ought to be drawn. It is sometimes said that we would then be asking a peer to forgo rights which inhere in children, but this never carried weight with me. No one said in the past that someone who became a hereditary peer was depriving his children and his children's children of the right to become a commoner. That was a far greater deprivation, a greater taking-away, of rights from successors than this would be in giving them the right for ever to be commoners. This is something to which we attach very great importance and we shall seek to amend the Bill on this issue.<br/>
We are not&#x2014;at least I am not&#x2014;completely satisfied about the courtesy titles, although I do not think that this is of great importance. Equally, a commoner cannot confer courtesy titles, whatever their status. If a peer becomes a commoner he should not have rights which are not those of a commoner.</p>

<p>That, I think, is in the Bill, but I am not conducting the debate entirely to satisfy the hon. Member. I advise him to read the Bill with a little more care.

<p>They are matters of public importance, but they are answered in the Bill. Whether or not that is so can be easily ascertained in Committee when we deal with the Clauses.<br/>
Although courtesy titles are not known to the law, certainly the law is capable of dealing with them. If we wish we can make a Statute. Either by the way suggested by the Leader of the House when he referred to our speeches here, or by the way in which the Bill is drafted or redrafted in Committee, we should make quite clear that in the view of the House or of Parliament it would be wrong for courtesy titles to be used when a peer had availed himself of rights under the Bill.</p>

<p>I may be wrong, but I thought that these titles were real titles held by the father who holds the peerage and the courtesy consists in the son or grandson, being by convention and courtesy allowed to use one of his father's titles.

<p>I am getting into a social level which is a little above me. I do not understand all these things.

<p>I am very flattered to be already treated as if I were speaking for the Government, but that is not the case. It is still true that the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster is primarily responsible for interpreting all the idiosyncrasies and corners of the Bill.<br/>
Although we did our best to think of every conceivable circumstance and situation in Committee, I do not think that we considered the case of a person who had become a life peer because&#x2014;or might claim that he had become a life peer because&#x2014;he was to succeed later to an hereditary peerage. I never thought of it and it was never raised

in my hearing. I have some sympathy with the point, although I do not think that it is a major point, and certainly not one on which there will be any sort of party division.<br/>
I come to the question of the sitting peers having a six months' right to avail themselves of the advantages of the Bill. First, this seems to me to be a just provision; if we are giving this right to peers who succeed in the future, we should not refuse to give it to peers who have succeeded under the previous law and who might have availed themselves of this provision if it had then been operative. It should be a once-for-all right which runs for only six months from the coming into operation of the Bill. It would be wrong if it were a continuing right.<br/>
It seems to me to be just to give this right, but it was carried in the Committee by only one vote, and, had it not been for the solid support of the Labour Members there, this just provision would not have been in the Report or the Bill. This shows that we are not concerned simply with what might be thought to be the Labour interest in connection with the Wedgwood Benn aspect. We are also concerned with the justice of the proposition, because this might be called the Hailsham amendment if the other might be called the Wedgwood Benn amendment, although we should not personalise and particularise.<br/>
Secondly, I do not agree with the proposal that the Bill should come into operation on the dissolution of Parliament. This does not seem to me to carry out the promise which the right hon. Gentleman gave, as reported in column 1549 of the Official Report of 28th March, when he said:
<q>But if such legislation were desirable, we would bring it forward in this Parliament so that it might be in operation for the coming General Election."&#x2014;[Official Report, 28th March, 1963; Vol. 674, c. 1549.]</q>
The Bill carries out only the words of the promise and not the spirit. If we wait until the dissolution of Parliament it is very difficult for anyone in the short period between the dissolution and the election to avail himself of this right. It is, of course, possible that someone has a seat all lined up&#x2014;that someone has had a seat kept vacant for him. But


it is difficult. There may be quite a number of people involved. I am not thinking only of Mr. Wedgwood Benn or Lord Hailsham. There may be many others who want to avail themselves of this right.<br/>
There is also the point that one of the rights which would be conferred on peers is not only the right to sit in the House of Commons, but the right to vote as electors. There may be sitting peers who simply want to divest themselves of their peerage in order to vote. The earlier we give them this right the more chance they have of getting on the electoral register. In general justice, we should give this right as early as possible. I do not see why Clause 7 cannot be amended simply to say, "This Bill will come into operation on the Royal Assent being given." This gives the maximum time and carries out the intent and spirit of the right hon. Gentleman's promise as we understood it.<br/>
I cannot deal with this matter without considering the problems of the leadership of parties, because the date at which the Bill, when it is an Act, comes into operation might affect these matters. We do not want to interfere in the slightest way with the difficulties or problems of the Conservative Party, but it seems to me in justice that it would be to the general public advantage that as wide a choice as possible were available to right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite for the leadership of their party. If this Bill came into operation on the Royal Assent being given, it would widen the field in an effective way. It makes absolutely no difference to us who becomes leader of the Conservative Party. We are prepared to take them all on, and the sooner the better.</p>

<p>Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that there is an additional point in his argument? It appears that there are eight or 10 Members of the House who might succeed to a peerage by reason of death at any time in the next two or three months. They would be disfranchised until the dissolution of Parliament.</p>

<p>I quite agree. Mr. Wedgwood Benn would be in some difficulty about fighting an election. If one intends to fight a seat one needs time in which to fight it. If the right

is given only on dissolution, this makes things very difficult.<br/>
I agree with the hon. Member. It seems to me that whichever way we look at it&#x2014;from the point of view of the rights of individuals or of the rights of the Conservative Party to have a free choice of possible leaders&#x2014;there is a good case for amending the Bill to make it come into operation on the Royal Assent being given.</p>

<p>When dealing with the question of leadership we should be fair to both sides of the House. Ought we not to make it possible for Lord Morrison of Lambeth to come back? He might well be needed.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1963-06-19a.478.1" hansard_membership_id="5220" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/15396" speakername="Mr. Gordon Walker" colnum="478" time="">
<p>Of course, this would apply all round, but Lord Morrison of Lambeth is a life peer. There are some hereditary Labour peers who might be interested. I think that the point about a life peer is settled on a different principle. Of course, Lord Morrison might be made an hereditary peer in the meantime, and then it would be possible for him to do this. I am afraid that at the moment we cannot get Lord Morrison under the cover of the Bill, and I think that the case of Lord Hailsham is a touch more actual.<br/>
There are, therefore, two important Amendments which we want to propose. One concerns the drowning or extinction, or whatever is the technical term, of the the title, rather than its suspension for life. The second is to make the Bill come into operation on the Royal Assent and not on the dissolution of the House. There are one or two other matters, and possibly my hon. Friends may wish to raise one or two smaller points.<br/>
I assure the right hon. Gentleman that we do not want to delay the Bill. We want it to come into operation as soon as possible. If the right hon. Gentleman is asking, as he is, that the Bill should be facilitated and should come into operation as quickly as possible, why is he delaying its operation to the dissolution? The only argument for speed is that it should come into operation quickly. We could get the Bill to the Royal Assent in three weeks, with a little co-operation.<br/>
I assure the right hon. Gentleman that as long as we have the right to argue the points in which we greatly believe, par-


ticularly that about extinguishing the title, it is our firm intention&#x2014;and I give a firm undertaking&#x2014;to facilitate the passage of the Bill. We do not want to hold it up. We want it on the Statute Book, but we want it there so that it may come into operation.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman wants the Bill speedily on the Statute Book so that it shall not come into operation until some time in the future. My position is rather more logical than his and, whatever he says about other Amendments which we put forward, I hope that he will give careful consideration to the Amendment about the timing of the Bill in order to provide that it will come into operation on the Royal Assent. We welcome the Bill and we shall facilitate its passage.</p>

<p>I have only one point to make and at first sight it seems to be in line with a point made by the right hon. Member for Smethwick (Mr. Gordon Walker), although I do not think that it is. I want my right hon. Friend to bear in mind what I think would be a considerable objection to the words of the Explanatory Memorandum, which reads:
<q>The peer who disclaims is divested of the peerage itself and all legal incidents belonging to if, including disqualification for membership of the House of Commons, but the succession to the peerage on his death is not affected&#x2026;Disclaimer of a peerage does not affect rights of property.</q>
I am strongly in support of people being allowed to stand for the House of Commons if they wish to do so, and I think that the impediment of being an hereditary peer should be removed if that is a man's wish. But I do not go with the right hon. Gentleman's suggestion that the hereditary system has no value at all. As long as we have the system of the monarchy, I think that the hereditary system is very important, even outside the realms of the monarchy itself. As long as we believe in the monarchical system, we cannot have that standing in isolation as the only hereditary system that exists in the country. I therefore believe that to preserve that we must preserve the hereditary system in a more general way.<br/>
I am not with the right hon. Gentleman in suggesting the permanent ending

of the hereditary principle but I cannot bring myself to believe that the Bill as it now stands will do anything more than create many more problems and anachronisms unless we go a little further than the Bill now suggests, I believe that the Bill should do this. If anyone entitled to succeed as a peer does not wish to do so in order to have all the benefits of a commoner as explained by the right hon. Gentleman, I believe that he should be allowed to divest himself of it, under similar terms as set out in the Bill, but I believe that he himself alone should go; and, in addition, he should give up all the rights to any entailed property that go with it and I believe that, just like the monarchy, whoever is next in line of succession to the peerage should take over at once. If the next in line is a son, he should take over at once, including property. If a brother, the brother should take over the peerage; he should take over the property that goes with it and the brother's successors should keep the line moving.<br/>
If it is done in any other way, we get very near to the point that the right hon. Gentleman made when he said that he thought that the peerage ought to be "drowned". He said that a person ought not merely to disclaim it for the period of one generation, but that it ought to be "drowned"; it ought to go for ever. I think that that would be bad. It would weaken the hereditary system. I believe that the anachronism by which a man ceases to become a peer, but still enjoys all the legal rights that go with the property and the things which are part of the peerage, even under law, creates problems which are unnecessary. If he does not wish to continue with the peerage, if his son is next in line of succession, his son should take on the peerage and should be legally entitled to all the entail that goes with it. If his brother is next in line, he should take it on. If his cousin is next in line, he should take it on.<br/>
This would mean that the person would be contracting out of something he did not want to have. He would not be retaining any of the advantages that go with that from which he was contracting out in the sense of possession of the property and control of anything that goes


with it. It would mean that he was going half way to killing the hereditary system, such as is the case now.</p>

<p>I do not think that the hon. Gentleman understands the logic of his remarks. I lived with this problem for a long time. What the hon. Gentleman is advocating is that if a man renounces the title for his lifetime he completely disfranchises his branch of the family. That is a form of drowning.</p>

<p>No. The hon. Gentleman has not followed me. If a man divests himself of the right to become a peer, the peerage automatically goes to his son at that minute. The title is then in being and the entailed estate that goes with it goes to the son.</p>

<p>I think that the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. C. Pannell) is right in certain circumstances, because if at the time of disclaimer the peer is unmarried and has a brother who succeeds the disclaimed peer may subsequently, have a son who would not be able to succeed because the peerage would have gone to the brother and gone on a different line.</p>

<p>I was coming to that point. That is the one risk in my suggestion, that a man may be divesting an unborn son of the right to succeed. I claim as against that risk that the anachronism of leaving it as it is would be much more damaging to the nation, if one believes in the hereditary system, than divesting an unborn son of the right to succeed.<br/>
I believe that we want to preserve the hereditary principle, because I believe that if it is taken away we are likely to weaken the system of the monarchy. I do not believe that the peerage ought to be in a different position from that of the monarchy itself. If a king abdicates, the Crown automatically goes to the next in line of succession and the line flowing from that successor is the one which prevails. That is the position of the

monarchy. It ought to be the position with the peerage. If they go together, they are more likely to be able to strengthen each other.</p>

<p>Is not the hon. Gentleman, in effect, suggesting the creation of a new form of privilege? The heir to a peerage, or at the moment when the Bill comes into force an existing peer other than life peer or a peer of first creation, would be able to say to his brother or his son, "I will stand for the House of Commons, and you can take my place in the other place." Surely that would be rather unreasonable and would, in fact, be a new kind of privilege.</p>

<p>The speech to which we have just listened from the hon. Member for Peterborough (Sir Harmer Nicholls) reminded me rather of a remark which was made by Adam Oak-apple in the third act of "Ruddigore", that if a man cannot disinherit his own unborn son whose unborn son can he disinherit?<br/>
The hon. Gentleman's speech illustrated the tremendous gulf there is on these matters between the two sides of the House. The hon. Gentleman argued that, because we have a hereditary monarchy, we must therefore preserve a hereditary peerage. Very few Members on this side of the House would propose to get rid of the hereditary monarchy, but all of us would get rid of the hereditary principle if we could, and I hope that in due course we shall.<br/>
The Bill is a much more modest affair. I, for one, support the Bill simply as a humanitarian measure, in much the same way that I would support a Bill to prohibit the hunting of carted stags. This is a measure for the assistance and relief of those who, through no fault of their own, are condemned to a death worse than fate. From time to time, like many hon. Members, I wander along the corridor to the other place and I see there those of my friends whom I knew in this House sitting with an air of supreme hopelessness on their red benches.<br/>
On these occasions I always feel rather like Odysseus, when he paid a brief visit to Hades. The House will remember how he greeted the dead Achilles as a


king among the shades and the terms of Achilles' reply. I quote from Pope's translation of the Odyssey:
<q>Talk not of ruling in this dolorous gloom,</q>
<q>Nor think vain words, he cried, can case my doom,</q>
<q>Rather I'd choose laboriously to bear,</q>
<q>A weight of woes, and breathe the vital air,</q>
<q>A slave to some poor hind that toils for bread,</q>
<q>Than reign the sceptred monarch of the dead.</q>
This is a Measure of resurrection. Speaking for myself, I hope that before very long we shall see my old friend Quintin Hogg losing his temper on the benches opposite. He will, I imagine, choose to return from hell, and Mr. Anthony Wedgwood Benn from the purgatory in which he has been living for the last two or three years. I express the hope that another old friend of mine, Frank Pakenham, will also be able to make his exit from among the shades.<br/>
This is only a stop-gap measure. It does not deal with what I would call the real problem of the House of Lords. The Tory Party is always trying in one way or another to patch up the other place. A year or two ago we had the Measure for the admission of women to the House of Lords and for the creation of life peerages. All this really defies the scriptural adjuration against pouring new wine into old bottles. It avoids the two fundamental questions which, sooner or later, all political parties in this country have to consider.<br/>
The two questions are these. First, do we need a second Chamber? Secondly, if so, what sort of second Chamber should it be? The answer to the first question is, I believe emphatically, "Yes". In my view, the case for having an effective second Chamber is stronger than it has ever been. That is why I would support the abolition of the present House of Lords. I think that it was just 320 years ago that the Long Parliament, in its wisdom, passed this Resolution:
<q>That the House of Lords is a useless and dangerous institution and ought to be abolished.</q>
I would certainly vote for that Resolution if it were proposed again today. I think that the House of Lords is useless and dangerous for this reason: it deprives us of a really useful second

Chamber. We cannot have a really useful or effective second Chamber if it is based on the hereditary system.<br/>
Here may I say, speaking only for myself, I have found that whenever it has been proposed to reform the House of Lords or to substitute something else in its place, the objection is always taken that we must not give too much prestige or authority to the other place, because then it might possibly rival or come into conflict with the House of Commons. That is always advanced as if it were a conclusive argument. It does not seem so to me.<br/>
I have now sat in this House, with broken periods, for nearly twenty years, and I take as much pride as any other hon. Member in being here. But do not let us assume that the House of Commons is perfect. It seems to me that the House of Commons as it exists today has three weaknesses. First, the supremacy of our Chamber rests upon the fact that we represent the people, but we do not always represent the majority of the people. It has happened on several occasions that a Government with a majority of seats, sometimes a substantial majority, has represented only a minority of the electors. There is no guarantee that that will not happen again.<br/>
It is something which is very liable to happen as long as we have the system of single-member constituencies. I do not think that that system is likely to be changed, at any rate in my lifetime. I have always been a believer in proportional representation, but I think that it is more or less a lost cause. But if I am right, there is always the danger, under our present system, of a Government which represents only a minority of the people carrying through a particular policy which is against the wishes, which may have been the wishes expressed at a General Election, of the majority of the electors.<br/>
Secondly, there is a further difficulty with which we in this House have to contend. That is, as I have tried once or twice to point out before, that we are here the slaves of the timetable. We try to reform our procedure from time to time, but we are always up against the difficulty that we have not enough time for all the matters that we ought to debate. It is perfectly true that matters


of great urgency and public importance are generally discussed.<br/>
When a Minister confesses a falsehood, or is detected in suppressing the truth, there is almost always an immediate debate. But there are a great many subjects of considerable importance which go for a very long period undiscussed in this House. We have had, for example, reports of Royal Commissions and Departmental Committees dealing with matters of great public importance and sometimes one, two or three years elapse before they become the subject for debate. This is a situation which grows constantly worse.<br/>
Every back bencher in this House&#x2014;and, I would think, every Minister,too&#x2014;must be conscious of the increasing congestion on the Order Paper, especially at Question Time. We may have a matter which ought urgently to be raised in the House, but unless it is so urgent that we can bring it within the rules governing a Private Notice Question, it cannot be raised&#x2014;it may be for a matter of weeks&#x2014;until the turn of a particular Minister comes round. That is a situation from which we in this House have thought of no way of escape. That is another reason why I believe that we need a second Chamber with greater leisure than we have, and a second Chamber which is not in the same way the slave of its own time table.<br/>
Thirdly, there is one other defect of this House, and that is excessive party discipline. Because the House of Commons can in extreme circumstances make and unmake Governments, it follows that a certain degree of party discipline is unavoidable. A Government, in normal circumstances, have to be reasonably certain of their majority&#x2014;it is the foundation for it&#x2014;but I believe that party discipline has been tremendously overdone on both sides of the House during the past thirty years.<br/>
I think that it is, as we know it today, one of the evil legacies of 1931 when mere subservience to the Executive was regarded as being a political virtue. It seems to me that for all these reasons there is a great deal to be said for having a second Chamber whose Members are not subject to the same pressures, as the Members of the House

of Commons, and who are not so much at the mercy of their own timetable.<br/>
I would also say&#x2014;some of my hon. Friends may not agree with me&#x2014;that there may be a good deal to be said for having a second Chamber when, as now, we are reaching the later stages of a Parliament and when the Government have quite clearly lost the confidence of the electorate. The present Administration are in a very similar position to that of Mr. Balfour's, in 1904. No one had very much doubt what would happen to them when they had to face the electorate.<br/>
But the Government today, like the Government then, has apparently resolved to drag on its miserable broken-backed existence to the very last moment. They are supported by a large number of hon. Members opposite who know that their chances of survival at the polls are microscopic. When we have circumstances like that, we are not dealing with a newly elected House of Commons, which, as Bagehot said, has always been the ultimate authority in the British Constitution, we are dealing with an ageing House of Commons, and I believe that there would be virtue in having an effective second Chamber.<br/>
What sort of second Chamber ought it to be? There are only two alternatives. It can be elected, or it can be nominated. The only system of election which I think has ever been worked out was that worked out in the Bryce Report, in 1917. It is a remarkable thing, when we reflect on all the controversy that there has been over the House of Lords and its powers, that the only authoritative Commission which has ever considered the constitution of the second Chamber was the Bryce Commission, all those years ago.<br/>
It proposed, in effect, that the House of Lords should be made up elected Members and nominated Members. The elected Members would be elected on a geographical basis by Members of the House of Commons, but they would be elected for a fixed term in each case of twelve years. They would be elected to represent the particular districts or areas, Members for the West Country, or East Anglia, or Wales, or Scotland, each meeting at certain intervals to


make their election, and it was also suggested that there should be 81 Members who should be chosen&#x2014;nominated in a sense&#x2014;by a standing commission of both Houses. That would have been a rational basis on which to form a kind of senate in this country. The alternative was proposed in 1948 at a conference of the leaders of all three parties.<br/>
Though they could not agree on the powers of the House of Lords they agreed on what they thought should be its composition. As John Bright said:
<q>The worst of these great thinkers is that they so often think wrong.</q>
They certainly thought wrong on that occasion, because they proposed that there should be a wholly nominated Chamber and that the nominees should take their place in that Chamber and should receive some kind of remuneration. I do not think that they themselves mentioned a figure, but the figure canvassed at that time was a salary of &#x00A3;1,000 a year. That seems to me to be open to every possible objection, because it would bring back patronage in this country to an extent unknown here since the eighteenth century.<br/>
No doubt the figure of &#x00A3;1,000 would now be higher and it would mean that each party machine would have in its gift a large number of paid appointments which could be treated by their holders either as part-time jobs or as sinecures. I say this not only to the Government, but to my right hon. Friends. I hope that in these circumstances, whatever reform is proposed, we shall never return to the proposals of 1948. Therefore, for this reason, taking advantage of the Second Reading of this Bill, I strongly urge the appointment of another high-powered commission, rather similar to the Bryce Commission of forty-six years ago. I would urge these considerations on hon. and right hon. Members on both Front Benches.<br/>
I have been complaining here not of what the Bill includes, but of what it does not, because in Committee on the Bill we shall not be able to canvass these wider principles which I have endeavoured to mention. Like every other hon. Member I welcome the Bill, such as it is. It is a modest Measure, but it will redress considerable injustice both to individuals and to electors.</p>

<p>The hon. and learned Member for Ipswich (Mr. D. Foot) has covered a very wide range on a Bill which, as far as I can see, has a much narrower object. It is also, I suppose, inevitable that the tendency here today is to speak mainly on the subject of Members of this House deciding whether they should go to the House of Lords or stay here. At the same time the Bill has two or three other sides to it, such as allowing peeresses to take their seats and Scottish peers to become no longer representatives but actually to hold United Kingdom peerages.<br/>
I think that a very grave injustice is being done to one other body of people, namely, the Irish peers, and I hope that before we come to a final decision on the Bill the Attorney-General and others will look into the constitutional question, although I know that it has been raised already in Committee before we received the Bill. On the arguments used by Lord Hailsham in another place, it seems to me that the Government have been wrong on many points with regard to the original Act of Union and the position of the Irish peers. When this matter was raised in this House many hon. Members interrupted my hon. and noble Friend the Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Lord Robert Grosvenor), and they seemed to think that these people represented the Irish, being members of one country, but in fact the claim is that they represent the peerage of Ireland.<br/>
Lord Hailsham said that that was not true and that they represented Ireland. Later he was written to by the present Recorder of Hastings, who is an Irish peer, and it was pointed out to him where he was wrong. I understand that Lord Hailsham has replied, unfortunately in private, admitting that he was wrong but so far he has not admitted it publicly. I hope that when this Bill goes to the House of Lords he will take steps to correct the mistakes he made. The Union with Ireland Act, 1800, does not state in Sections 39 and 40 exactly what the Irish representative peers represent, but by Article IV of that English Act it is provided that an
<q>&#x2026;Act shall be passed in the Parliament of Ireland previous to the Union to regulate the mode by which the Lords spiritual and temporal and the Commons, to serve in the


Parliament of the United Kingdom on the part of Ireland, shall be summoned and returned to the said Parliament, shall be considered as forming part of the Treaty of Union, and shall be incorporated in the Acts of the respective Parliaments by which the said Union shall be ratified and established.</q>
In the Irish Act of 1800, to which I have referred, and which had to come before this Act, it is expressly stated in Article IV that the 28 lords temporal are to be elected
<q>to represent the peerage of Ireland in the Parliament of the United Kingdom</q>
and not the Irish people as such.<br/>
If any further authority is needed for that, it can be found in the article on "Parliament" in Halsbury's <i>Laws of England,</i> third edition, volume 28, of which I believe Lord Kilmuir was the chief author. It reads:
<q>So long as any representative peer for Ireland remains in the House of Lords, he has a seat in the House of Lords as a representative neither of the Republic of Ireland nor of Northern Ireland, but of the peerage of Ireland.</q>
This is what the Irish peers are claiming today.<br/>
At one period it was said that most of them lived in Southern Ireland, which is now an independent country, but the figures have been looked into and it has been found that of the 69 Irish peers involved, 46 live in the United Kingdom, four of these being in Ulster. Only 17 live in Eire and four others live overseas and, as my noble Friend the Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone has added, two have been "mislaid ". This means that there are 69 who today have no means to go to the House of Lords. They have a legal right but, as we all know, that has gone wrong because when in 1922 Southern Ireland became a member of the Commonwealth but not yet independent it was decided that there should be no Lord Chancellor in Ireland, and part of the arrangement under the Act had been that whenever an Irish representative peerage became vacant the Lord Chancellor of the United Kingdom should write to the Lord Chancellor of Ireland and ask him to call together the Irish peers and they would elect someone to the vacant life peerage. This, of course, could no longer be done, with the net result that bit by bit, as they died, no one has been replacing them.<br/>
At the same time they have a perfect constitutional right to be represented and if anything goes wrong they have also, according to the original Act of Union an arrangement for arbitration in the event of any dispute. This is provided for in Article IV of the English Act of George III, Sections 39 and 40, col. 67, which says that
<q>&#x2026;questions attaching to the rotation or election of Lords spiritual and temporal of Ireland to sit in the Parliament of the United Kingdom shall be decided by the House of Lords thereof&#x2026;</q>
It shall not be decided by a Committee of both Houses, as is being done now, and I understand that the Irish peers are about to get together and try to test this case, or at least petition the Queen about it.<br/>
In 1922 it was quite obvious that there had been a slip-up about the Lord Chancellorship, but at that time, as hon. Gentlemen will remember, there was a good deal of bitterness about Ireland; things were going very badly and there was practically civil war; and it was not felt to be a moment when it would be a very popular move to try to do anything about having Irish peers in the House of Lords. Because of that, this injustice has gone on from that date to this. Nothing was actually done.<br/>
There are, I believe, something like 140 Irish peers in existence. Of those, many have United Kingdom peerages or other peerages, and therefore the number immediately affected is only69 who are at present without a place. To refer back again for a moment to that period, as 28 was the number allowed to represent the number of people concerned in 1800, it may be said that the number would be less now. I think everybody would agree to that.<br/>
As the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Smethwick (Mr. Gordon Walker) said, it will make things much easier it we allow the Scottish peers to become United Kingdom peers than have them elected each Parliament. So I think that something ought to be done for the Irish peers on those lines. I do not say that the whole 69 should be found places in the House of Lords. It was suggested in our last debate that the number should be only four. I think that would be rather unfair. It is in the power of Her Majesty the Queen to appoint life peers, and I feel, and it has been


suggested in another place, that it could be put to Her Majesty by the Prime Minister, or whoever will be responsible for it, that a certain number of representatives of those Irish peers should be made life peers. I do not think that that would be unfair.<br/>
After all, they practically all of them have extremely good British records. As I say, the vast majority of them are living in the United Kingdom. Their peerages were given them in days long ago for a variety of reasons which were gone into in the last debate and there is no point in going into them again now, but I would point out a small detail of interest.<br/>
We have been talking so much about courtesy titles and whether peers who disclaim will be able to retain them or not. There are many Irish peers in the House of Lords with higher titles than their United Kingdom ones. Two just occur to me, the Marquess of Ely and the Marquess of Headfort. Both of them have Irish marques sates but sit as United Kingdom barons, by virtue of United Kingdom baronies which they obtained during the last century. They inherit their marques sates and they come in also for the United Kingdom baronies. Suppose before their fathers died they were Members of this House, or wanted to sit in this House: they could do so after this Bill has been passed, and they presumably would lose their United Kingdom baronies&#x2014;they would not be allowed to retain them during their lives. But what would happen to their marques sates? They would presumably be allowed to keep them, and their higher rank for their children and their families.<br/>
That would be an anomaly separate to the Irish alone. The Irish peers themselves claim something should be made clear about this and if something is not done about it to clear the matter up we shall be left in the position, as mentioned by Lord Kilmuir in a debate in another place, that the Irish peers will be left as they were before. They will be the only people, a complete anomaly, left in that position. The original constitutional position under the original Act of 1800 will have been broken, but they will be left as an entirely separate entity and body under the Queen. If subsequently the Labour Party or others

decided to abolish peerage, they would not be able to touch the Irish peers, for they would be completely separate and beyond that control. The Irish peers do not want to be in that position; they want the link and the control of the link, and the only reason why there were the representative peers was that there should be that link. I hope that this possibility and danger may be carefully studied both in Committee on the Bill and again in the House of Lords.</p>

<p>I do not want to follow the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Sir W. Teeling) into this discussion of the rights of Irish peers except just to remark that if the proposals before us now are accepted we shall, I believe, be adding some 34 peers to the 930 who are already entitled to sit in another place, and if his ideas which he has suggested were accepted we should increase the total to something over 1,000, which I do not think myself would be a good thing.<br/>
I want first of all to say that this is, I think, Mr. Wedgwood Benn's day, and I myself have always been full of admiration for the long and gallant fight he has put up. It is a rather sad reflection on the conduct of affairs in this country that it should have needed the determined and courageous efforts of this one man to focus attention on a problem which has been with us for so many years.<br/>
It is true, as the hon. and learned Member for Ipswich (Mr. D. Foot) said, that reform of the House of Lords has been very slow. It has been proceeding on leaden feet through the decades and centuries. In the days of the great struggle between the Liberal Party and the House of Lords, in the days before the First World War, it must have seemed to many people as though abolition of peerage was both inevitable and imminent. It was brought about, of course, by the peers' continuing obstruction of the progressive legislation which the Government of the day were introducing. Yet here we are, 50 years after the passing of the great Parliament Act, solemnly considering the comparatively insignificant question of whether we should permit succeeding heirs to renounce for their lifetime their peerages&#x2014;for their lifetime, be it noted, because under these


proposals the same choice would be available to every succeeding generation.<br/>
On the Motion to take note of the Report of the Joint Committee on so-called House of Lords reform&#x2014;which, of course, it was not&#x2014;the Leader of the House threatened that if anybody tried to modify the recommendations of the Joint Committee other than in very minor aspects the reactionaries would retaliate by returning to the attack with their own solutions which, he implied, they had been persuaded not to press because of the concessions made by those favouring more drastic reforms.<br/>
All the same, I think it should be put on record that we in the Liberal Party are extremely dissastisfied&#x2014;as my hon. Friend the Member for Huddersfield, West (Mr. Wade), who was a member of the Joint Committee, said&#x2014;with the method of suspending peerages for the lifetime of persons who disclaim. My hon. Friend made it quite clear that he was opposed to the hereditary principle as such and he did not consider that anybody should be entitled to sit in the Legislature purely by virtue of his birth. I do not see that that is a proposition with which any sane man could possibly disagree, but my hon. Friend, I believe, would have been prepared to compromise on this for the time being, without, of course, committing any future Liberal Government to being quite so restrained, and I think he would have been prepared to make a compromise for the sake of reaching agreement. In the Joint Committee he moved an amendment which would have considerably widened the scope of this inquiry and would have brought in matters such as the hereditary principle itself, and whether the composition of the second Chamber should be determined by selection or election.<br/>
But on the more limited question of whether renunciation, as I prefer to call it, should be made temporary or permanent, I think I should warn the Leader of the House that we are not prepared to compromise at all, and in passing I remark that in spite of the play which is made with the use of the word "disclaim "the dictionary tells us that it is a synonym for "renounce ". So I do not think that it would be necessary to do as we wish, to alter the word "disclaim "wherever it occurs in the Bill.<br/>
It is quite instructive to look at the voting on this question in the Joint Committee. Naturally, as one would expect, out of the nine peers who voted eight were in favour of making renunciation effective for a person's lifetime only. Of the commoners there were five in favour of making renunciation permanent and four in favour of it for life only. One of these was the hon. Member for Windsor (SirC. Mott-Radclyffe), who seemed to contradict what he said in the debate on 28th March, 1962, that, if one allowed people to renounce for a lifetime only, we should reach
<q>the rather strange position of successive generations opting in and out like jacks-in-the-box in respect of certain hereditary obligations."&#x2014;[Official Report, 28th March, 1962; Vol. 656, c. 1380.]</q>
He seems to have changed his mind during the last year.<br/>
The fact that the voting was on those lines shows that a different view of the matter might be taken if the decision were in the hands of this House alone I am quite certain that this would be true if it were put to the people as a whole; they might see it as a comparatively simple way of thinning out, over a long period of years, the swollen ranks of the hereditary peerage. This would fall a long way short of the radical changes which some of us would like to see, but it would at least be a small breach in the edifice of privilege.<br/>
In either case, no one will be naive enough to believe that the granting of the rights proposed in the Bill will lead to a wholesale exodus from another place. The ostensible advantages of being a peer are quite negligible, but everyone will agree that, in a class-based society such as, unfortunately, we still have in this country even after the upheaval of the last war, the holder of a peerage can exploit his position to give himself tangible advantages. He can, for example, write articles for magazines or newspapers even if he is practically illiterate. He is invited to undertake this work. He is welcomed on to the boards of large companies which are quite happy to pay him substantial fees merely for the privilege of allowing his name to appear on the letter heading.<br/>
In the circumstances, it is obvious that the only persons who have any incentive to disclaim a peerage to which they might be entitled are those who know they can


obtain, or, if they are already Members of this House, retain, a safe seat in the House of Commons. The hon. Member for Kidderminster (Sir G. Nabarro), who speaks much more sensibly on this subject than on some others, has estimated that the maximum number of peers who might offer themselves for election at any one General Election would be 12. In fact, he put the number at between6 and 12, but his top figure was 12. I should be very surprised if that number were ever reached, unless hon. Members can produce evidence to show that I am wrong. By comparing that figure with the total number entitled to sit in another place, we can put the matter in perspective. It is 12 out of 930, which amounts to only a little more than 1 per cent. of the Members of another place who would, or might, desert at a General Election every five years&#x2014;hardly enough to warrant the amount of Parliamentary time which is being given to such a minor reform.<br/>
With the hon. and learned Member for Ipswich, I hope that one of the outcomes of our debates will be the initiation of reform on a very much wider front. As he said, there seems to be widespread agreement that we need some kind of second Chamber, but I should not exclude from the terms of reference of the Commission which he proposed the question whether we need a second Chamber at all. No doubt we could ascertain whether it would be practically possible for the remainder of the functions of the House of Lords to be handed over to this House and what changes in our procedure here would be necessary to bring that about. But if this is not thought desirable, we ought at least to consider the composition of the second Chamber as a whole and not merely the right of a few people to decline or accept membership of it.<br/>
It is to me unthinkable that, if the House of Lords did not exist today and it were being set up for the first time, we should decide to base membership of it on the hereditary principle. We should certainly have elections to the second Chamber just as every other democratic country I can think of has now.<br/>
The arguments in favour of the hereditary principle are summarised in the Report of the Joint Committee in a memorandum submitted by the Garter Prin-

cipal King of Arms. If one studies it, one sees that, although those arguments might have been thought valid in the eighteenth century, they make absolutely no sense today. For example, the genetic argument is manifestly untenable when one considers the unstable behaviour of some noble Lords which is reported almost daily in the national Press.</p>

<p>These are matters which could be referred to a Commission of the type suggested by the hon. and learned Member for Ipswich. The fact that membership of this House is based on election and not on hereditary principle does not mean that we have no younger Members here. The hon. Gentleman himself is an example.<br/>
I turn now to two memoranda submitted to the Joint Committee by the noble Lord, Lord Hailsham. His memoranda contain what I regard as rather stale and vapid thoughts with which it would not be worth while troubling the House were it not for the fact that they seem to represent a fairly wide body of opinion within the Tory Party. The noble Lord, of course, is an upholder of the hereditary principle where it suits him. He advances the contention that
<q>most peers regard their position as involving responsibilities and duties and not simply privileges".</q>
In my view, the late Lord Samuel was nearer the truth when he remarked that the House of Lords is the only institution in the world which is kept going by the persistent absenteeism of the great majority of its Members.<br/>
Lord Hailsham in his memoranda gives his reasons for objecting to the complete extinction of a title at the choice, as he puts it, of its "temporary holder", He says that many of these titles
<q>are links with a famous past and justly regarded as a part of the national heritage".</q></p>

<p>I note that that meets with approval on the benches opposite. One might, perhaps, agree with it if one could guarantee that all successors were worthy upholders of the famous names which they bore, but, in practice, the degrading conduct of some of the descendants of some of our greatest men of the past is an insult to our national heritage. Even if this were not so, it is, in my view, time that we stopped living on our past glories. The existence of a system of titles does not help us to export any more atomic power stations or improve our balance of payments.<br/>
Lord Hailsham points also to the unfairness which complete extinction of titles might inflict on remote heirs who might wish to inherit when their turn came. But no one has hitherto successfully objected until this date to the unfairness involved in forcing a person to accept a title which he does not wish to hold since, I believe, the fourteen century, as the hon. Member for Lincoln (Mr. Taverne) remarked in a previous debate on this subject.<br/>
But the noble Lord, Lord Hailsham, accepts the concept of renunciation. In fact, he holds to it even more strongly now than when he first succeeded, possibly because he thinks in his own case that it will enable him ultimately to grasp the mantle of leadership which is slipping from the moribund hands of the Prime Minister. It is extraordinary that, after the events of the last few months and the startling revelations of the Prime Minister's total incompetence at the beginning of this week, he is still in his office. There is one possible explanation for the way that he clings to his office, and that is that the inner circles of the Tory Party may already have decided in their inimitably undemocratic way that Lord Hailsham will replace him. If that is the case, the resignation of the Prime Minister would have to be delayed until this Bill has taken effect. If that happens, we can give an even more literal meaning to the words of Collingbourne which already apply so aptly to this wretched Administration:
<q>The cat, the rat, and Lovell our dog,</q>

<p>I have several disqualifications for addressing the House today&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] I thought that there would be somebody below the Gangway clever enough to see that one. I have several disqualifications for addressing the House on this topic. Once upon a time I had a little learning in the prehistory of this matter. I have now forgotten all that, and the worst minds to bring to these topics are those which think that they are informed when really they are no more than forgetful.<br/>
Secondly, I sat on the Committee of Privileges by the sad accident for this House, although, I hope, glorious for him, of the departure of one of my colleagues to the House of Lords. So I came in on the middle of it.<br/>
Thirdly, I sat on the Joint Select Committee, and there, I am afraid, I betrayed and let down the House, because, although I was present at all the informal discussions&#x2014;and those who have sat on Select Committees know that the thoughts in the heads of the people discussing emerge at the informal discussions, but always with provisos and caveats, and so on&#x2014;about not being committed&#x2014;I sat through that stage, but when it came to the formal and voting stages I was removed by act of God or some other superhuman authority from almost all the rest of the proceedings. Therefore, I am not in any sense a good authority on this; nor have I prepared a systematic dissertation for the House.<br/>
One or two things have been said which perhaps I might be allowed to comment upon. I should like to comment first on references to the hereditary system, or the hereditary principle. I do not want today to defend a hereditary system or hereditary principle: I am not sure what the words can be taken to mean. On the other hand, we had a warning from the right hon. Member for Smethwick (Mr. Gordon Walker)&#x2014;perhaps he could bear to listen to me for a moment at the cost of not listening to his colleague next to him&#x2014;that in these matters one must not stick too closely to logic, especially to verbal logic. He indicated&#x2014;and I entirely agree&#x2014;that there is a certain amount of feeling and common sense which necessarily comes into it.<br/>
I think that that is true about what I will call&#x2014;and I think it is an uncontroversial and anodyne word&#x2014;the hereditary factor in life. There is nobody who does not believe in it, and that is the honest truth. I do not know how many trade unionists opposite would deny that in trade union affairs and in matters of wage-earning employment, and so on, it is sometimes of very great advantage to belong to a certain family, to be in the business, to have been in the business, and so on. That has been true since Old Testament times, and I suppose that it always will be true.<br/>
What is rather striking is that in this matter Mr. Wedgwood Benn showed some signs of believing in the hereditary factor, and so did three or four of his more Leftish supporters on the benches opposite. I will not weary the House with quotations, but Mr. Wedgwood Benn, when he was before the House of Lords in his first attempt and when precedent was quoted against him, used as an argument against unfavourable precedent that both his grandfather and father had sat in this House. The right hon. Member for South Shields(Mr. Ede) and the hon. Lady the Member for Cannock (Miss Lee) spoke more than once about how Mr. Wedgwood Benn's case should be very carefully considered and how strong his claims were because of the distinction of his family, because of their Liberalism, patriotism, effectiveness in and devotion to the House of Commons.<br/>
Therefore, in spite of all this stuff about, "Do not be mediaeval, old boy, remember that this is the twentieth century", which some of us may even come to regret&#x2014;anyway, I have never found it possible to forget it&#x2014;all this kind of stuff will not do. The hereditary factor is a real thing, and the agitation and this Bill and what led up to it, and as was observed by those on the benches opposite, especially by the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. C. Pannell)&#x2014;I could quote from him&#x2014;whatever came out of this Committee it was bound to be something which, I think the hon. Member said, would affront, or perhaps it was damage, the hereditary factor. Perhaps he said that it would diminish it. I think that the hon. Gentleman was right.<br/>
Whether this is the best moment to

diminish still further the recognition of that factor which already has been diminished very much I do not feel sure. Nor do I feel sure that it is in the interests of the democrats opposite, who always use democracy nowadays as though it were a synonym for all that is good and who might well remember as part of this common sense which the right hon. Gentleman indicated about the hereditary wisdom of ordinary people in their ordinary conversations and actions in this country that when we absolutely complete a process we have begun the opposite. The people in this country are deeply saturated with that superstition, and it is a very true one. It is not necessarily the fact that what may seem to be logically more democratic is in fact conducive to the continuance and aggrandisement of that democratic arrangement which we have arrived at in this country.<br/>
I do not want to go on at length about the hereditary factor, but I did not want the matter-of-course damning to go by default. There is the habitual assumption that what is unfashionable is, and always has been, absolutely dead and meaningless, which is the most nonsensical assumption in the world. I did not think that that should go by without some very slight comment.<br/>
The hon. and learned Member for Ipswich (Mr. D. Foot), whose long and varied experience of politics has made him quick and clever enough to be out of the Chamber for most of the last speech but who came back just before the end of it and now has been clever and quick enough to go out again, will not mind if I now remind him that if he wants to be dragged into the twentieth century he might begin by remembering that glass&#x2014;I know that there is nothing like leather&#x2014;glass is not at all like leather. It has superseded leather for the purpose of storing wine and therefore the sense in which the hon. and learned Member quoted Holy Writ, namely, in warning against putting new wine into old bottles, was really of opposite effect to what he meant it to be.<br/>
I want to say a word which will please my listeners on the benches opposite, as perhaps I have failed to do hitherto. As at present advised, I agree with the hon. and learned Member and I refrained


from voting&#x2014;it was almost the only vote for which I was present in the Select Committee&#x2014;because I then was not quite sure. On the whole, I agree with him on the principle that if anything like what is suggested is to be done, it ought to be done by drowning the peerage and not by putting it to sleep ready to wake up when it might choose.<br/>
Anybody who has inherited, so to speak, a whole hereditary package of things which, in his judgment, are good things and bad things, should accept his father's assets and also accept his father's debits. That is why I am dubious about the whole principle, although I am prepared to acquiesce in it and do not think we need spend a lot of time discussing it, as everybody else is prepared to acquiesce in the principle of the Bill.<br/>
It is obviously true that if one accepts the hereditary factors sufficiently to say that it has been proper hitherto and still will continue to be proper, with certain reservations and modifications, for a single member of a single generation by his action to make sure that his descendants, if any, 50 or 500 years later will have a peerage&#x2014;if that is proper, it seems to me impossible to deny the propriety when the decision made by the single member of a single generation is that the family should not be able to claim back the peerage. So that, as at present advised on this point, I agree with hon. and right hon. Members opposite on that.<br/>
Those are, I think, most of the things which, I felt, should be said. We ought not now to go back on to the things about Mr. Wedgwood Benn's case and how good or how bad it was. We have had a little too much today about how good he was and how remarkable it is that we should have had to await for this Bill, his nobility and ability. I have not a word to say against those things, but to put the argument upon him personally is an invitation to somebody to put what considerations there may be on the other side&#x2014;and there are some considerations on the other side.<br/>
We have had complaints today, for instance, about the disfranchisement of the electors of Bristol. I wish that the hon. Member from wherever it is, Colne and Nelson or somewhere, if he must

always talk when he is sitting in the House, would do it not quite so loudly.</p>

<p>No, he was not really saying so, nor was he ennobling anybody with the title of "dog". What he was saying was what he did say, that he wished the hon. Member for Nelson and Colne (Mr. S. Silverman), when he sits in the House conversing, would not converse quite so loudly.</p>

<p>I am one who speaks unwillingly and not very often and who finds it much more difficult to speak and who speaks much worse if loud conversations are continued. In my judgment, it is not a fair way of debating that that should be done, and that is what I was referring to.<br/>
In continuation of what I was saying when I interrupted myself, another thing that is worth remembering is that it was the Opposition Whips who moved for a Writ to fill the room of Mr. Wedgwood Benn. That made it rather difficult to do what, in any case, was impossibly difficult, although it was attempted by the hon. and learned Member for Ipswich, to accept and further the final Wedgwood Benn case, the case that was put before the Committee of Privileges and which was quite different from the


case which was put at the time of the Private Bill in the House of Lords.<br/>
I do not want to pursue these things any further. I only want to make it plain that upon this matter of the relationship of the Bill, which is a Bill of considerable constitutional importance&#x2014;the right hon. Member for Belper (Mr. G. Brown) described it, I think, as being of tremendous constitutional importance and the hon. and learned Member for Kettering (Mr. Mitchison) has said something of the same sort&#x2014;we ought to be slow to assume that the source and origin of it and its whole justification have been the strength of the personal claims of the person primarily concerned.</p>

<p>Although, in general, sympathetic to a paradoxical argument&#x2014;which, I took it, was what the hon. Member for Carlton (Sir K. Pickthorn) was trying to deploy about the hereditary principle&#x2014;I found it a little difficult to follow the case which he was putting in the earlier part of his speech.<br/>
As I understood it, however, one of the points that the hon. Member was trying to make was that one should not be too sceptical about an hereditary peerage, because some form of hereditary activity or behaviour was applied in a great number of directions and many parents tried to pass on advantages to their children and many children derived advantages from their parents. That may well be the case, but that is hardly an argument for enshrining such a matter as a principle of law and of the constitution.<br/>
In a way the hon. Member for Peterborough (Sir Harmar Nicholls) deployed the hereditary case in extreme form and even more cogently than did the hon. Member for Carlton. I was surprised how far the hon. Baronet&#x2014;I hope that he was not too influenced by his new hereditary title&#x2014;went in his defence of the hereditary principle. He or anyone else who tries to tie up the fate and the strength of the monarchy with the position and powers of an hereditary peerage is behaving foolishly and doing great disservice to the monarchy.<br/>
The last sovereign who showed any sign of being worried about this was King

Edward VII at the time when the first disputes leading up to the Parliament Act came about. He expressed doubt about what the position of the monarchy would be if the buttress of a powerful hereditary peerage was removed. He was firmly assured by the Prime Minister of the day that it was most unwise to link the fate of the monarchy in that way with a reactionary and unrepresentative House of Lords. The question has wisely not been raised by any sovereign since then.<br/>
The detailed proposition put forward by the hon. Baronet was a curious one. What it amounted to was that instead of the present provisions in the Bill by which a peerage can be put into abeyance for a generation, there should automatically be a succession so that a peerage could never not be in a position of being actively held, if that is the right phrase, even though this, of course, might, from the point of view of those who believe in the value and importance of the peerage, involve some injustice subsequently to the son of the peer renouncing his rights.<br/>
The hon. Member's point can have force only in so far as he takes the view that nothing must be done to reduce the number of peers at any one time, because otherwise there would be a serious derogation from the position of the peerage and the service it is entitled to render to the country.</p>

<p>I did not mean that. If it is the considered policy of the nation and Parliament that the number of hereditary peers should be reduced, let it be through the front door as a matter of constructive policy and not through the side door.</p>

<p>But this is a side-door Bill which no one pretends even touches the fringe of the problem of the House of Lords. It deals only with certain anomalies and injustices to a very limited number of individuals. I am glad that we have the Bill because those injustices were intolerable. The Bill is great tribute to the determination and skill in putting his case of Mr. Wedgwood Benn, for without him we would not have had it. But there is no doubt that the Measure does not really grasp the nettle of the problem of an hereditary peerage or second Chamber.<br/>
I am surprised that the hon. Member


took the view that one cannot afford to have a peerage in abeyance for a limited period. I would not have thought anyone would be particularly concerned about there being an insufficient number of peerages. The forces working on the peerage for a long time have been inflationary. Surely no one could object to a little deflationary pressure to counter the persistent inflationary pressure which has been going on for the last forty years.</p>

<p>I want to make my position clear. I rested my case largely on the fact that I do not think that a man who has divested himself of a peerage ought to have all the advantages of being an owner, as it was put by the right hon. Member for Smethwick (Mr. Gordon Walker), and should still hang on to the moneybags&#x2014;the entailed estates. I think that the entailed estates should be kept alive to go to the next in succession.</p>

<p>If that were done, all sorts of questions ranging very widely over the law of property generally would be involved. Here we are dealing exclusively with the right of a man and his heirs either to sit in another place or in this Chamber. I would have thought that a little deflationary pressure on the size of the peerage would not be a bad thing.<br/>
I remind the hon. Member for Orpington (Mr. Lubbock), who is a Liberal, when he says that he does not think that anyone could possibly want the size of the peerage to rise to over 1,000, that the only person I know of who was in favour as long ago as fifty years of a peerage of the size of 1,000 was the right hon. Member for Wood ford (Sir W. Churchill), sitting then as a Liberal Minister.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman expressed this view at the time of the controversy leading up to the passage of the Parliament Act, 1911. As the House will recall, there was a great controversy as to whether or not it would be necessary to make a mass creation of peers in order to get the Measure through. The general line taken by almost everyone in the Liberal Party, and certainly by everybody outside, was that, while the threat might have to be used, it was highly desirable that it should not be put into effect&#x2014;that it should be a threat but nothing more.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman had occasion to write a remarkable letter to Mr. Asquith, the Prime Minister, in which he said that he dissented entirely. He thought that it would be a good thing to create 500 peers since the country could well afford 1,000 notables in its then state of wealth, and that their creation would lead to a great increase in the influence of the Liberal Party throughout the country.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman, with his inimitable gift for phrase-making, concluded by saying:
<q>Therefore, let us go forward clanking coronets in our scabbards.</q>
Apart from the right hon. Gentleman I am not aware of anyone who has advocated the advantages of a House of Peers of 1,000 or more Members.<br/>
I am sorry to see that the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Sir W. Teeling) has left the Chamber. He spoke of unfair treatment of Irish peers. I do not think that it was so much unfair treatment under this Bill as the fact that the opportunity of the Bill was not being taken to give them fairer treatment than they have had in the last forty years that he was complaining about. But I find it very difficult to attach much conviction to the argument he deployed that there was extremely unfair treatment of these 67 gentlemen.<br/>
The argument as to whether they should represent the peerage of Ireland or Ireland itself is an extraordinarily sophistical one. The representation was set up as part of the bargain of the Act of Union in 1800 and it is inconceivable that it would have existed had an Act of Union between the two countries not been created then. We could not have had a representation of the peerage of a non-existent country.<br/>
Considering the circumstances in which that Act of Union ceased to exist forty years ago, to go back and recreate special representation of this category of peers would be farcical. It would be as though one had created a peerage of the thirteen colonies in the eighteenth century and claimed that now we should have representative peers of the United States sitting in the House of Lords.<br/>
In fact, the Irish peers have been in a very favourable position. They have


been in exactly the position to some extent which has been almost universally agreed, in the discussions leading up to this Bill, that people should not be allowed to be in. It is the position of having an option. Lord Curzon, for instance, although as far as I know he had nothing to do with Ireland, when he became Viceroy of India in about 1899 and had to accept a peerage because it was thought then to be the natural accompaniment of viceroyaity, chose to accept an Irish peerage in order to give himself the right, as he was a relatively young man, to return to this House if he wished to do so.<br/>
When he came back, rather under a cloud, he did not find it so easy to come back into the full stream of unionist politics, and he chose at that stage to be elected a representative peer of Ireland. Ironically enough, however, in 1922 it was thought that this peerage excluded him from the Premiership. This was although he had since accumulated higher peerages.<br/>
There is no particular injustice to these 67 gentlemen. The suggestion that they should have life peerages specially conferred upon them is a most extraordinary idea. They are certainly eligible for life peerages if anything they have done suggests that they would be particularly useful members of another place, but the idea that they should be given life peerages merely because of an anomalous position seems very far fetched.</p>

<p>The hon. Member has rested his argument on the Act of Union, 1800, when, as we all know, many Irish peerages were created. But many were created before that and it would not be fair to base the entire argument on the Act of Union when many Irish peerages were in existence long before 1800.</p>

<p>Yes, but the idea of representation in the United Kingdom Parliament of the Irish peerage as a class was something which arose from the Act of Union of 1800. The Irish peerage at no time in itself conferred the right to sit in the House of Lords of the United Kingdom. It did confer the right to sit in the Upper Chamber of the Irish Parliament.<br/>
When that Parliament was abolished,

as part of the arrangements for the Act of Union, arrangements for limited representation in the United Kingdom House of Lords were made. That Act of Union no longer exists. What basis is there now for special representation along the lines of the arrangements made on the Act of Union and made then for no other reason, made for reasons having nothing to do with the fact that peerages not giving and not intended to give the right to sit in the United Kingdom Upper Chamber were conferred before 1800?</p>

<p>I agree that that is part of the case, but the contention by the peers of Ireland is that the Scottish peers are treated in a certain way and are made equal with the English peers while the Irish peers are not.</p>

<p>So far as I am aware, there is still a United Kingdom between England and Scotland, which seems to make the matter rather different. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion is not here. He deployed this argument himself and I can only place on record the fact that I found it a singularly unconvincing argument, not merely because of the way he deployed it, not at all because of that, but because of the inherent nature of the case.<br/>
The fact that we are tinkering away with the House of Lords, first, by letting in life peers and, secondly, through the Bill allowing certain peers to opt out, inevitably brings nearer the day when we shall have to raise the whole question of the House of Lords itself. I do not find it as easy as does my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Ipswich (Mr. D. Foot) to see exactly what sort of second Chamber ought to be constructed. It may be that my hon. and learned Friend started with the clear conviction that the second Chamber was of great value, but I do not go along with him in that. It may be of some limited value in certain circumstances, but it can be said against that that it is extraordinarily difficult to construct a second Chamber which is both useful and democratic and not an unjustified rival to the main seat of power, as it should be, the Lower House.</p>

<p>It is difficult to follow the hon. Member for Birmingham, Stechford (Mr. Roy Jenkins),


with whom I basically agree in much of what he says, even on the subject of the Irish peers. There is one great distinction between them and the Scottish peers. So far as I know, Scottish peers are not allowed to offer themselves for election to this House and Irish peers always have been. Therefore, they have no complaint of any kind, because, if they have been loyal enough to remain British subjects, which some of them have not, they have every right to offer themselves for election to this House. I think that we can dismiss that argument.<br/>
I am sorry that the hon. and learned Member for Ipswich (Mr. D. Foot) is temorarily not in his place, because I wanted to agree with him, too. His views on a second Chamber and its absolute necessity are extremely sound. I suggest to him that he has a good deal of missionary work to do on his own Front Bench and I trust that he and the hon. Member for Stechford will start on that without delay. I do not think that there is much danger of the party opposite forming the Government of this country in the very near future, but, in case it does, hon. Members opposite might as well have some sound and constructive views on this matter.<br/>
The hon. and learned Member for Ipswich rather gave the show away when he was saying that he was hoping that he would be confronting his old Friend, who was then to be Mr. Hogg, on these benches, arguing, therefore, that in this way Mr. Hogg would be on this side of the Chamber; and of course he will be.</p>

<p>That is an unlikely contingency; he is a fastidious man.<br/>
I want to be perfectly clear. I dislike this Bill intensely from almost every point of view. As has been said, it is piecemeal dealing with a major problem with which I have thought we should deal ever since I was first elected to the House. In the second debate on the Address which I ever heard, I took part in an effort to secure some sort of agreement that something should be done. I point out that it was a pronouncement of my own party in the General Election of 1924 that the reform of the second Chamber was something which would brook no delay. So far, all the efforts have

been rightly described by hon. Members opposite as tinkering.<br/>
I am not devastatingly attached to the hereditary principle. If we look at it in action and then at ourselves, Members of another place do not seem to do much worse than we do and a great deal of it might well be left alone. I do not mind whether there is an hereditary principle or not, provided that there is an effective second Chamber.<br/>
The hon. and learned Member for Ipswich has just come back. In his absence I have suggested that he should do some tense missionary work on his own Front Bench and I sincerely trust that he will. Basically, he is a lone Liberal voice in a slightly more extreme party. Basically, the party opposite does not want a second Chamber at all.</p>

<p>An amiable monarch who had the habit of decapitating unnecessary agitators.<br/>
I have been slightly led away from my main theme. I was making the point that the basic aim of the party opposite in dealing with the second Chamber is to weaken and not to strengthen it. That is why they are supporting the Bill which will allow a certain number of intelligent and ambitious men to leave


the Upper Chamber and offer themselves for election here. In other words, the Bill is to produce a drain of possibly the best of the second Chamber and. therefore, unquestionably weaken it.<br/>
There are one or two points which will have to be put right in Committee&#x2014;many of them were mentioned by the right hon. Member for Smethwick (Mr. Gordon Walker)&#x2014;especially concerning the date on which the Bill will come into force. The right hon. Gentleman's argument on that was perfectly sound. It will be very difficult for persons who might wish to take advantage of the Bill to do so. They have, first, to find for themselves constituencies. They have to have time to get around and nurse those constituencies.<br/>
The purport of the Bill as it now stands would be, with one exception which I will come to later, to postpone any possibility of these persons offering themselves for election to this Parliament at the next General Election. Their one hope would be a favourable by-election, or the election after that, so it is postponing this for much too long.<br/>
I come for a moment to the question of the renunciation of titles. I think that this leads to a great deal of unnecessary complication. In spite of the fact that my right hon. and learned Friend the Attorney-General has studied this carefully, I do not believe that the Bill will not produce a great deal of confusion. If a peer opts to come to this House if he can get in, he divests himself and his wife of all titles, rights, offices, and so on, and I cannot see how, in that case, any of the courtesy titles can continue to be used by his children. In fact, as far as I can see, that must happen under the Bill, because they are not their titles. They are titles which have been renounced. The titles have been renounced by their father, and they are therefore deprived of them.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1963-06-19a.511.0" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Dr. Alan Glynn" colnum="511" time="">

<p>We are assuming that the

father is a Member of the House of Lords. I do not see how he could have got there if, in fact, the title was to miss one generation and go to the grandchildren. I think that we are getting into rather deep water here.<br/>
I do not think that the renunciation of courtesy titles by the father is quite fair. Certainly, Miss Mitford would point out that this would cause sinister mutterings in the hons. cupboard when the news broke. It should be enough that a peer wishing to come to this House should renounce for his lifetime the right to receive a writ of summons.<br/>
We may find a curious anomaly if we insist on implementing the provisions of the Bill, in that a perfectly good viscount may come into this place as Mr. Smith, having once been Viscount Smith. Alongside him on these benches, or possibly on the benches opposite, there maybe a number of persons who are entitled to call themselves viscounts, marquesses, and so on, but who are not. They are merely using their fathers' titles. It would not make sense to have Mr. Smith who is a real viscount sitting here as Mr. Smith while others who have courtesy titles and are not real peers continue to use their titles.<br/>
Also, this is to a certain extent removing some of the traditions of the House, and our system of address might start altering. I like our method of addressing someone as "my noble Friend", and so on, and I would be sorry to see it go. I know that hon. Gentlemen opposite have no respect for tradition and would like to see the remainder of our better traditions go, but I think that these traditions are worth maintaining.<br/>
There is only one man whom this Bill can possibly benefit. He has worked very hard and meritoriously for it. In fact, he has a constituency which is being kept warm for him. He has never been regarded by his local constituency association as being anything other than their prospective candidate.</p>

<p>He cannot be regarded as their Member; that is nonsense, but he can be, and is, regarded as their prospective candidate. He is the only person who can derive great benefit from the Bill. He is the only one in that fortunate circumstance.<br/>
The Bill is far too limited in its scope and deals only with trivialities and not the major problem of producing a decent second Chamber which is a thing I have always desired and always will, because I think that there must be some form of chain on any legislature, however moderate. I think that this Bill is much more rightly described as the Stansgate Relief Bill rather than the Peerage Bill, and I do not thinik that I shall find myself supporting it at any stage of its proceedings.</p>

<p>Like the hon. Member for Carlton (Sir K. Pickthorn), the hon. Member for Rugby (Mr. Wise) has given us a string of aphorisms that spring from muddle-headedness. The hon. Gentleman has not read the Joint Select Committee's Report. He could not have done, because if he had he would not have drooled on in the way that he did about courtesy titles. I refer the hon. Gentleman to page 9 of the Report which makes this point quite clear. It says that
<q>the wife and descendants of a Peer who surrenders should not use the courtesy titles or enjoy the social precedence derived from such Peer, even in the cases where such wife and descendants had enjoyed these titles or precedence in the lifetime of a more remote ancestor before the surrender took place.</q></p>

<p>The Report goes on to say that
<q>the other relatives of a Peer who surrenders should retain the use of courtesy titles and enjoy the social precedence derived from an ancestor or collateral of such Peer.</q>
I do not know whether this is the first debate on this subject which the hon. Member for Rugby has attended. Perhaps I might give the example of the Stansgate peerage. Lady Stansgate, the widow of the previous holder of the title, still remains Lady Stansgate. The other son still remains the Hon. David, but Wedgwood Benn himself is no longer Lord Stansgate. He dropped the "Honourable" and became Mr. Anthony Wedgwood Benn, or Anthony Wedgwood Benn, Esq., and his four children do not have the title "Honourable" at all. I should have thought that that was clear.<br/>
On a previous occasion it was suggested that I bad made a mistake in the case of Viscount Hinchingbrooke. If he comes

back here he becomes Mr. Montagu, but his wife, being a member of the Devonshire family, retains the courtesy title of Lady, which is derived from a more remote ancestor. I think that I have got that right. Curiously enough, that which is blazingly daylight clear to the hon. Gentleman's hon. Friend is not even dimly clear to the hon. Gentleman, but it would have been clear had he read this Report.<br/>
The same applies to the noble Lord the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Viscount Lambton). Bearing in mind that he has a vested interest in this Bill, I am surprised that he did not read the Report itself.</p>

<p>But it was still clearly understood here, because it was agreed earlier in the debate, that for the purpose of the records of the House, and for the purpose of Hansard, in respect of social occasions springing from membership of this House, including, presumably, invitations to Royal garden parties, such a person is to be "Mr." or "Mrs." as the case may be.

<p>The right hon. and learned Gentleman agrees with me.<br/>
There are other considerations. I understand the value of a courtesy title. Anybody who has ever been the mayor of a borough and has seen the scramble for precedence on social occasions must know all about this. I am not limiting this to people who are "honourable"; questions such as whether the chairman


of a housing committee should take precedence over the chairman of a baths committee give rise to arguments that only people who have experience of municipal government can know. Let us not have any misunderstanding about this sort of filing.<br/>
I am sure that the Attorney-General will agree that, as far as possible, the intention of the Joint Committee is enshrined in the Bill, in effect, in that such people receive no benefit at all. Personally, I am rather sad that our former colleague, Lord Hinchingbrooke&#x2014;now the Earl of Sandwich&#x2014;was not prepared to stay here as Mr. Montagu. We lost something when he went from the Commons. He is not the sort of man who derives character or nobility from his ancestors; he has character and nobility in his own person.<br/>
The other day, in a most wounding speech, the right hon. Member for Flint, West (Mr. Birch) said, of another unfortunate person who has come to the notice of this House this week, that the fact that he was a Privy Councillor never made him any different from what he otherwise was, and the fact that he was a Secretary of State never made him any different. It is the individual personality of a man that causes us to honour him. Fundamentally, titles do not make any difference. To suggest that a man is rather a better man if he has a title is absolute snobbery, and the sooner we end it the better.<br/>
There is great point in what my right hon. Friend said, namely, that we are conferring on any number of people a great honour in allowing them to be commoners.</p>

<p>He probably does not; his name is a misnomer.<br/>
The curious thing is that we have had this gibe at Mr. Wedgwood Benn. I cannot repeat too often that but for him there would have been no Bill of this sort. It is an undoubted fact that this Bill would have been a Wedgwood Benn enabling Bill, but for one reason. I know that the hon. Member for Torquay (Mr. F. M. Bennett) will agree with me about this. If we look at Appendix 18 in the

Committee's Report&#x2014;the memorandum by Lord Hailsham&#x2014;we find that it was a cry from the heart. In that document he puts forward the plea that people like him, who, for reasons of public duty as they saw it, accepted service in the House of Lords, should not be denied the advantages given to people who refuse the writ of summons.<br/>
That argument was carried by one vote, and immediately it was this Bill ceased to be a Wedgwood Benn enabling Bill, because it allowed Lord Hailsham to come back here, and also every other peer who has ever gone to the other place, except peers of first creation and life peers. It is, therefore, a complete travesty of the facts to suggest that this is now a Wedgwood Benn enabling Bill. There can be no argument about this.<br/>
I have just been reading the life of the late Lord Pethick-Lawrence. His biographer refers to the fact that when the fight for women's suffrage fell in, the legislation on the Floor of this House evoked hardly any interest at all; the battle had been won. The backwoodsmen of the time dared not raise their voices any more. Where are the backwoodsmen today? Even the hon. Member for Carlton (Sir K. Pickthorn) sounds reasonably progressive.<br/>
The hon. Member for Rugby suggested that Mr. Wedgwood Benn had some advantage over others, and said that he had kept his seat warm. He did not keep his seat warm; the electors of Bristol kept it warm. Those electors, not confined to the Labour Party, claim that Anthony Wedgwood Benn was their returned Member, and that he still is. Certainly, the hon. Member who was returned on a minority vote, and is not in the Chamber today, cannot be considered to be the returned Member.<br/>
I agree with those who say that the Bill merely scratches the surface. I am in favour of single-Chamber government. On the other hand, my long experience in political life&#x2014;forty years&#x2014;has taught me to take what I can when I can. I am always suspicious of those people who despise small advantages, won on a narrow front, having the idea that something broad is required, as though the social revolution is just round the corner. At the age of 16 I believed that it was, but I believe it no longer.<br/>
Another point made by the hon. Member for Carlton was that the Opposition Whips moved for the Writ for Bristol, South-East. In view of Mr. Speaker's Ruling, they could do no other. They moved for the Writ&#x2014;with what result? The result was that the electors of Bristol were tested on this very point. What was their answer? It was a more resounding victory for us&#x2014;or a more resounding defeat for the Government&#x2014;even than Orpington. It was one of the most spectacular election results that we have had, despite the fact that the Government sent the ex-Attorney-General there to tell the people what the constitutional position was. He told them that if they voted for Wedgwood Benn they were throwing their vote away. Well, they threw their vote away&#x2014;to what purpose? They take their share in the victory consummated here today. We are the most mature elected democracy in the world, and the electors of Bristol, South-East were not as silly as hon. Members opposite.<br/>
I shall vote in this House in the same way as I did on the Select Committee, by which I mean that I shall support the amendment for the drowning of peerages as against renunciation for a lifetime, surrender for a lifetime, or disclaimer for a lifetime. The argument that a man is somehow disfranchising his successors is an odd one, bearing in mind that all sorts of men can take on the liability of life peerages and condemn their sons. If a man can take on a peerage, as has been done in the past, which has been laid on his ancestor, he should be able to renounce it in the same way. I am glad that the hon. Member for Carlton came down with us on that question.<br/>
Do not let us imagine that all peerages are concerned with the wish to remain in this House. I know of a man who can go into the House of Lords, but who was told by his employer, "Make up your mind whether you want to go to that place as a peer or work in my office". He obviously could not work in that office, and he finds his peerage a social liability.<br/>
Another question concerns Lord Pakenham. I must make my position clear on this. I am against peerages, but presumably peers of first creation and life peers are not against peerages. They have accepted them for their own lifetime. If one is a member of a Select

Committee and is attempting to get a reasonable package deal, one enters into certain commitments&#x2014;not formal, but moral and mental commitments&#x2014;in order to reach an understanding of the "give-and-take" sort.<br/>
Broadly speaking, hon. Members opposite did not like the Hailsham amendment. They were defeated on it, as we were defeated on the drowning issue. We can thrash these matters out in the House. But it seems to me reasonable that any man who says, "I will go into the House of Lords", has opted for his lifetime, and I cannot be bothered with it any further.<br/>
Lord Pakenham accepted an office under the Labour Government which involved his going into the House of Lords. In effect, he got the title. He considered that inexorably the Earldom of Long ford would fall to him. On the other hand, he had taken a decision about another title. I speak as an individual from the back benches&#x2014;I can speak only for myself&#x2014;when I say that to take one attitude on the Select Committee and then to take another in the House would not be a sensible position for me.<br/>
The position was exactly the same when, as members of the Select Committee, we argued about the Scottish peerage. There are certain principles which I think have priority, and one for which I have struggled is the equality of women. I believe that women should have equality with men and should have the liability of sitting in the House of Lords if that is also a male liability. I believe that a society is healthy and civilised only to the extent to which it recognises in 1963 the complete equality of women, and I do not apologise for sending women even to that place.<br/>
Equally, with the Scottish peerage we have the mediaeval hang-over that certain people are elected. It seemed better to bring them all into line, bearing in mind that this Scottish creation involves no more than the number of peerages often created by a Conservative Prime Minister in one year. In any case, many of them may decide not to come.<br/>
The next point concerns the date of the application of the Bill. I always felt&#x2014;perhaps the Attorney-General will seek to disabuse my mind&#x2014;that the


reason that the Bill was drafted to defer its application until after the dissolution was that the Government did not want another by-election in Bristol, South-East. I know what will happen in Leeds tomorrow. Did hon. Members see the picture in the <i>Daily Mail</i> today, of four people standing on a Conservative platform, including the Minister of Health, and only two people in the audience? Despite all the publicity last week and the reference to a Minister who would bring down the Government, only two people turned up at the meeting in Leeds. I will tell hon. Members why. It is because the massive shadow of Gaitskell hangs over South Leeds.</p>

<p>It had nothing to do with that. The massive shadow of Gaitskell hangs over South Leeds and the massive shadow of Profumo hangs over the Conservative Party&#x2014;and they are very different images. Only two people were present at that meeting to hear a potential Prime Minister.<br/>
If the Bill takes effect from the date of the Royal Assent it will give the advantages about which the hon. Member for Rugby spoke, enabling people to get into seats. All seats are marginal for the Conservatives. It might even allow Lord Hailsham to be adopted for Stratford-on-Avon, although I do not know about that. But if the election is too long delayed, it will allow another by-election in Bristol, South-East. Even considering the present majority in Stratford-on-Avon. I know that in both cases the result will be very unsatisfactory for hon. Members opposite.</p>

<p>With the exception of the last point, which I regard as a fair debating point and which, if we did not all rely on your endless wisdom, Mr. Speaker, I might have suggested was out of order in the context of the Bill, there was much in the robust remarks of the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. C. Pannell) with which I have considerable sympathy.<br/>
I know that the hon. Member will agree with me that we have to view the Bill and the Report in the light of the maximum degree of agreement which could

be reached not only between two or three parties, but between a substantial number of people of widely differing views within their parties. He referred to a package deal, and I hope that he did not mean that there was any question of a package deal over the Hailsham amendment as far as I am concerned. I voted against the Hailsham amendment.<br/>
My objection to the Hailsham amendment was not on any of the grounds to which he referred. It was based rather on his own argument about Lord Pakenham. I believe, and some of my hon. Friends believe, that inheriting a peerage is an involuntary act for which it is unfair to penalise a man, but that accepting the writ and sitting in the House of Lords is a voluntary act, and that, once it has been taken, the same rule applies as to those who take a peerage in the first instance. These are the arguments which I adduced. If one says that it is hard luck to have legislation which debars them, anything which happened in the past is hard luck, and this House, generally speaking, has set its mind against retrospective legislation.<br/>
That is the only critical comment which I have to offer on what the hon. Member said. Naturally, he and I will find ourselves on different sides, as in the Committee, when we consider the question of the permanent or temporary submerging of peerages.<br/>
One of the difficulties of catching your eye, Mr. Speaker, is that one almost invariably fails to catch it when one particularly wishes to follow an hon. Member. I should have liked to follow the hon. Member for Orpington (Mr. Lubbock) a little earlier. He, with the rest of the Liberal Party, has now left the Chamber. In his challenging remark she seemed to be trying to be more radical than the ultra-radical on the benches opposite.<br/>
The hon. Member made a number of surprising statements. He complained about the number of peers there are in this country and reproved the Conservative Party for this fact. There has already been a reference to an earlier effort by the Liberal Party to increase the number of peers, and I should like to refer to a more recent example of an extremely distinguished Liberal Member who played his part in substantially increasing the number of hereditary


peers, for reasons other than strictly political reasons.<br/>
The hon. Member for Orpington also said that if we were to have a second Chamber it was time that we had an entirely elected Chamber, as was the practice of every democratic country throughout the world. I believe that he is a member of the Liberal International, together with members of the Liberal Party of Canada, where they have an Upper House which is completely appointed. His Liberal colleagues in the Canadian Upper House were all appointed. Moreover, there is a ceiling of 100 members and one can never rectify the balance except through death when another Government gets in. One of the efforts of the late Mackenzie King, before he vacated office, was to get no fewer than 96 Liberals appointed life members of their Upper House&#x2014;a number which has only now been reduced to 82. So, the next time the hon. Member for Orpington attends a meeting of the Liberal International, I hope that he will reprove his Canadian friends for being the only other undemocratic country in the world in addition to our own.<br/>
There is only one reason of substance why I have risen to address the House today. I feel that probably on these occasions those who have been members of the Select Committee should give a chance to other hon. Members to take part. Yet I have felt justified in asking for a few minutes' tolerance today because, in the lonely company of one other member of the Committee, a Labour peer, I suggested that there was a third alternative to drowning of peerages and giving them up for life. This has been mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Peterborough (Sir Harmar Nicholls). I apologise for not being present when he made his speech.<br/>
I suggested that the same principles which apply over the abdication of monarchs should apply in this case. If one wants to contract out of responsibilities which go with a title one should contract out altogether. If one has sons after that it is just too bad. I regard it as just too bad in relation to a peerage as for a monarch who abdicates, and for his children after the date of abdication. [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."] If the muted sounds of

applause from my hon. Friends indicate support for what I suggested in the lonely company of one member of the Committee, I hope to have support when I seek to rectify this matter in Committee on the Bill.<br/>
There is one considerable advantage on the grounds of simplicity that all these complications about courtesy titles&#x2014;people willing themselves "Mr. Earl", or "Mr. Duke"&#x2014;because there is no law against calling oneself what one wishes&#x2014;then disappear. We would get out of the complications about courtesy titles and all else if we said that if a man wanted to become a commoner he could do so as long as he fell out of the line of succession and after he and his subsequent sons would have to take into account his prior decision to have become a commoner. I advanced this argument at much greater length in Committee, but was not able to get it adopted. I refer to it today only because I am still an unrepentant supporter of a system which, I think, would have greater simplicity and be viewed with much more respect in this House, the country, and the other place.</p>

<p>I agree very strongly with one point made by the hon. Member for Torquay (Mr. F. M. Bennett). That is on the question of names, courtesy titles and so on. He did not put it as widely as I would have put it. The Bill is about our two Chambers and more about the House of Commons than another place. I shall come back to what the hon. Member said a little later. This is essentially a very minor and trifling small Bill so far as it applies to another place. Perhaps in its immediate application to us&#x2014;because it is concerned with one or two, in their different ways, distinguished personalities&#x2014;it is more important.<br/>
Although it is not a sort of Wedgwood Benn Bill, it is in a sense almost a Private Member's Bill, a limited Measure arising from the efforts of one individual who, as has been said by someone, pushed the side door open a little. Like one or two other hon. Members, I feel very disappointed that there has been just this small push to the side door. I strongly sympathise with those who feel that peerages ought not simply to be disclaimed for a lifetime, but


drowned if they are disclaimed. That seems sensible and would be no loss to our social organisation. It seems that during the course of a not very long time we shall have to tackle the question whether we are to maintain the hereditary principle in our Legislature at all. I cannot see that we can maintain it for very long.<br/>
Those on this side of the House have no sympathy for it, but perhaps it is a stronger argument than simply putting a party point of view to try to figure what the younger generation are thinking about it I cannot find any sort of sympathy at all among those who have reached maturity after the end of the war with anything which would suggest continuing hereditary qualification for membership of a second Chamber. I imagine that as the post-war generation begins to take positions of greater maturity and authority the hereditary element will be simply wiped out.</p>

<p>How would we get the younger generation into a reformed second Chamber? How could anyone under 25 go there except by the hereditary principle?</p>

<p>It depends on the second Chamber. If we have a second Chamber one gets into it in prescribed ways. If the prescribed ways include ways which do not insist on an age limit of 25 there is nothing to bar someone joining at a lower age. If he looks around at other second Chambers the hon. Member will find that there are some which have comparatively young members. This, in any case, seems not a particularly important element in the matter.<br/>
One <i>caveat</i> I put as, I suppose, a minor point. I am not altogether satisfied on the question of limiting the time. I suppose the argument is that if one does not decide to disclaim within a certain period one is making a positive decision to remain a peer in the House of Lords. I do not feel that that is altogether realistic. I should have thought the starting point should be membership of the peerage and the one positive action should be the disclaimer. I should be inclined to say that there should be the one action and that a person cannot chop and change.<br/>
The decision should be considered at the beginning of the period, or the operation of the Act is a passive one. If the person concerned does not do anything about it at 25, but decides at a ripe old age to drop out in October, I see no reason why we should not accept that. It would simply mean one less hereditary peer, one slightly increased breach in the body of hereditary folk in the House of Lords. The alternative argument seems a little over-logical. I do not think that this is a matter on which one can be particularly logical.<br/>
My chief criticism of the Bill is not so much on the score of its size, or its particular provisions, but on the direction of thought it seems to represent. There have been a long series of attempts to legislate on the basis simply of removing from a peer his right to sit in another place. This seems to be what we should be doing. I cannot see why the other elements matter. It does not seem that titles, names, courtesy titles and all that sort of business have any real relevance. What we are concerned about is simply what should be the qualifications for membership of this Chamber and of another place. I cannot attach any importance or significance to whether a man is called Lord So-and-so or the Honourable So-and-so, or whatever it may be.<br/>
I thought even the financial arguments adduced by the Liberal Party were a little over-played. It may be that a number of peers manage to get a few directorships because they are peers. I wonder how many get them simply because they are peers. I imagine that it would be marginal.</p>

<p>I agree with the hon. Member. I can assure him, after a small acquaintance with the City, that companies which have peers as directors simply grade them in the graph not in accordance with repute, but lack of repute.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1963-06-19a.524.1" hansard_membership_id="9960" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/17816" speakername="Mr. MacPherson" colnum="524" time="">
<p>I am grateful for that support. But, with it or without it, I say that this must be a marginal matter. We have a large number of peers and I do not imagine that many of them, even those who have professional skill in industry, commerce and finance, earn their living in this kind of way.<br/>
In any case, as the hon. Member for Torquay said, a person can call himself what he likes. There are people whose peerages were "drowned"&#x2014;if that be the correct trans-Channel expression&#x2014;at the time of the French Revolution, but who still used their titles. There will always be people who like to call themselves by a particular name, and there is no reason why they cannot call themselves by a name which suggests a title, even if their father had no title. "Mr. Johnson" down the road may like to call himself "Lord Smith" starting from tomorrow.<br/>
I do not think that anyone can stop him from doing so. If the Attorney-General has any suggestion to make that there is some means by which he can be stopped from doing so, perhaps the right hon. and learned Gentleman would make the position clear. But so far as I understand it, in this country we are completely free and easy about what we call ourselves, provided that people do not use their name in order to "bilk" the tradesman.<br/>
A young friend of mine used to argue that it would be much more sensible if human beings called themselves by numbers. There might be some complication about signing cheques. But people might call themselves "No. 007"&#x2014;like James Bond&#x2014;or "XYZ123", or something like that. I cannot understand why this legislative body should make a fuss about that kind of thing. Surely we should be saying that what matters is whether a person has a right, that we can recognise as a proper right, and a qualification to sit in one Chamber or the other, not whether they want to call themselves this, that and the next thing. Those are trifling matters.<br/>
Even the argument that to continue them produces some snobbishness&#x2014;I recognise that such an argument has some substance&#x2014;becomes comparatively weaker in these days. Members of the post-war younger generation will not be "bulldozed" for very long by that kind of attitude. They will judge a man more and more on his face value and less and less upon the value of his name.<br/>
Reference has been made to the pro-

posals about Scottish peers and, again, this seems to me very much a marginal matter. If all the Scottish peers took their seats, the House of Lords would be increased, more or less, only by a capful of peers. I do not see that that will make any difference one way or the other. It is just as convenient to treat Scottish peers in the same way as peers of the United Kingdom are treated. What would be lost is what I might call a very picturesque ceremony which takes place at the beginning of every Parliament at the election of those who are elected Scottish peers. I always regret the disappearance of a picturesque ceremony. The number of people who have seen it is limited, I have never seen it.<br/>
I believe that its disappearance would be a trifle compared with the actual membership of the other place. I do not think that this will in any way strengthen the other place and I say that without intending any disrespect to individuals who may happen to join those in another place as a result of it. This particular little group will not make any serious difference to the second Chamber, whether we regard it as an hereditary, a legislative, a working or any other kind of Chamber.<br/>
What is needed in the Scottish peerage is a much more liberal infusion of life peers. I have had occasion just lately to note the reason for that. I promoted a Private Member's Bill, which is now in another place, and when I came to look at the number of active peers&#x2014;with one or two extremely distinguished and competent people among them&#x2014;Ifound that the range of choice among those from whom I could find a sponsor for my Bill was very limited. It seems to me that the infusion of additional life in the way of Scottish life peerages would be a much more useful process than this is.<br/>
The question of life peerages and hereditary peerages brings up the whole question of another second Chamber. This has been a very odd Second Reading debate in that it has, it seems to me, enabled some matters to be dealt with&#x2014;I dealt with some myself&#x2014;which might be considered odd matters to be discussed today. But we have managed to introduce broad considerations of policy regarding a second Chamber. I am of


the opinion that we cannot continue for much longer to work with one Chamber. We are the "odd country out" among the Commonwealth countries, and among other countries of our own range of population, in that respect. It seems to me that we are not in a position in which we can carry on in that way in a practical fashion.<br/>
There are three alternatives as I see it. Before I continue, may I emphasise what is the position? I refer to what I have heard because I have not myself seen the Annual Report of the Registrar General. But I am told that he forecasts that the population of this country will, in a comparatively short time, rise to 70 million or 75 million. In my view, we cannot ca&#x0155;ryon with one Chamber and provide the debating facilities at this level which would be needed by a population of that size.<br/>
We know that even now we cannot provide proper facilities for a population of 50 million with only one Chamber. We need one of three things. Either we should consider increasing, revising, and changing the nature of the Committee system in this Chamber as a whole, or we should develop a second Chamber. We should not necessarily give it powers. But at least it should have the facility to debate questions of public importance. Thirdly&#x2014;this alternative seems to me the most attractive&#x2014;we should do as other Commonwealth countries and countries of our size have done, and that is establish minor Chambers in suitable parts of the country.<br/>
There could be a Parliament for London, a Parliament for Wales&#x2014;</p>

<p>I accept your rebuke, Mr. Speaker. I wondered how some of the earlier substance got into the debate, but I realise that I was going fairly far a field in discussing that matter.<br/>
My point is that in this Parliament and in this nation we are not in such a situation that we can say that we will limit ourselves to one Chamber and continue in that way. We have a wonderful Chamber, but its tasks today are so numerous that we shall have to take

some additional steps regarding its continuing life. Although I may prefer one alternative, which I cannot discuss, I do not think that my preference is one that history is likely to follow, because it would need a new initiative. The building of a second Chamber is the kind of thing which we tend to do without starting something new. There is a second Chamber and we should be intent on building it up to what it ought to be. That, probably, is the way in which we shall go and, therefore, the future of the second Chamber, its immediate future, is of considerable importance.<br/>
I should like to see immediately&#x2014;I am not now talking of the long-term ideal&#x2014;two things get under way with a great deal more strength. One is the cutting out of the hereditary element by little bits or by bigger bits&#x2014;preferably bigger bits and, even better, by wholesale methods&#x2014;and the other is the development of the life peerage system. If we follow these two lines in respect of the second Chamber, I believe that we shall be proceeding in the right direction.</p>

<p>This Bill represents a small link in a large chain of statutory changes in the powers and composition of the House of Lords which were started in 1911. We must admit that it is primarily a Bill which removes certain disabilities to certain people. But it is a Measure into which we have managed to incorporate one or two useful alterations in the composition of the House of Lords.<br/>
This debate illustrates the fundamental difference between the two sides of this House and the approach of hon. Members to this problem. It is fair to say that the majority of Members who sit on this side of the House are in favour of; bicameral system, whereas the majority of Members on the other side would favour single-Chamber government.<br/>
I am certainly a protagonist of the bicameral system. When I look at the Bill, I ask myself; how much good or how much harm does it do to the present two-Chamber system of Government? One of the criticisms which was made in an earlier debate, to which I subscribed at the time, was that by allowing people to surrender or give up, or whatever expression we choose to use, their peerages, it


could tend to drain the Upper House of a certain amount of young talent.<br/>
People who had greater ambition than to remain in the Lords might tend to come here. I believe that the number of people who will, in fact, do this will be so small that it is not a factor which ought to be considered. It is a formidable thing for a man to be faced with the decision of renouncing a safe seat in another place for the possibility, however good it may be at the time, of a seat in this Chamber. I believe that many Members of the Upper Chamber would think very carefully before they surrendered a very great right in the hope of gaining admission to this Chamber.<br/>
I share the view of many other Members of Parliament that one of the disadvantages of the Bill is that perhaps it does not go far enough. I am also well aware that the contents of the Bill are the art of the possible. We have achieved the maximum that we could at this juncture. I am not against the hereditary principle. I believe that the public image of the Lords as it is at the moment, in the minds of the public, whether one likes to admit it or not, is increasing.<br/>
I hope that in years to come the reform of the other place, which is something which takes centuries and not decades, will, with that ability which we in this country have of moulding the old and the new together, take a form which I have suggested to the House before. I refer to a half-hereditary and half-elected system, the hereditary peers sitting amongst themselves and electing those whom they wish to sit in the Lords. This is perhaps a long-term dream, but I believe that we shall eventually come to this.<br/>
It is a suggestion which was made about forty years ago by Lord Salisbury and the late Earl of Clarendon. It is a solution which may command agreement between the two protagonists, one against the hereditary principle and one for it. If we could mould the two together, we might be able, as we have done in the Bill, to meet the wishes of both sides of the House and the wishes of another place.<br/>
The question whether a man should renounce for life or for ever is not of so much consequence. What we are trying to do is to remove an anomaly. As the hon. Member for Stirling and

Falkirk Burghs (Mr. Malcolm MacPherson) said, we are trying to achieve a Measure which allows a particular category of people to return to this House. I do not think that it is important whether they renounce for life or for ever.<br/>
The question of the Irish peers was raised earlier. I think that here the consensus of opinion would be that, unfortunate as it may be, there has been such a time lag that it would be difficult to resuscitate the connection, whether good or bad, between the Irish peerage and the House of Lords. The easiest way to do it would be by a Measure which transposed the name of Lord Chancellor of Ireland to Lord Chancellor of England so that the machinery could be started up again. I understand that a case is coming before the House of Lords, a plea for something of that nature to take place, although I am not in a position to know the details of the appeal.<br/>
I think that we have a strong second Chamber, and it is important for the country. During the debate much has been said by some hon. Members about life peers and peers of first creation. If a man is offered a peerage knowing what the consequences are for his life, it is only right that he should not be given the chance of renouncing that peerage. In one case I think that it is fair to say that the person concerned was induced to take the peerage under the guise that at a later date he would automatically inherit a hereditary peerage. I refer to the case of Lord Pakenham. This is a difficult case, but I do not think that it would be right to cater for him in the Bill.<br/>
There are a number of considerations which a Member of Parliament weighs when he accepts a peerage. There may be a hundred reasons. One reason in this case possibly was that he would at a later date, anyway, succeed to a peerage. I should have thought that this was a factor. I do not think that his case would be sufficiently strong to allow him to return to this House, otherwise we would open the gate wide for that to happen with life peers.<br/>
I welcome the inclusion in the Bill of the provision which will allow peeresses in their own right to take their seats. This is an anomaly which I have always


considered to be very unfair. I also welcome the provision in relation to Scottish peers.<br/>
I want to put one or two points to my right hon. and learned Friend. One of the difficulties of renunciation would be in the case of the Arundel title which is, as I understand it, the only territorial title in the country. If this title were to be renounced, it might well be that the holder in years to come could by selling the castle create a title. I believe that this is the only case in the Constitution. My right hon. and learned Friend, when he winds up the debate, may agree that this could happen, although I must admit that it is not of real importance on the Bill.<br/>
Another point I want to make was well brought out by the hon. Member for Stirling and Falkirk Burghs. We cannot possibly legislate for courtesy titles, even though they have been discussed in earlier debates, because there is no legislation and no legal justification for their use. I think that I am correct in saying that in legal documents Lord Tom Noddy is described as "Mr. Noddy, commonly known as Lord Tom Noddy". There is no legal justification for the title. Such titles spring from the Crown. Indeed, they can be given by the Crown at will, I understand.<br/>
In this case perhaps the right thing to do is to ask for some guidance and ruling from the originator of all honours and titles, the Sovereign. We could ask for some guidance on the rules which should be applied to anybody renouncing his title so as to enter the House of Commons. This would be the easiest way of dealing with the matter.<br/>
Much as I welcome the provisions of the Bill&#x2014;not so much because of the provision relating to renunciation and the ability of former peers to come to this House as because the Bill allows Scottish peers, and peeresses in their own right, to sit&#x2014;I cannot for the life of me understand why it should not come into force when the Bill receives the Royal Assent. There seems to be no logical reason.<br/>
This point has been raised by a number of hon. Members, and when my right hon. and learned Friend winds up I hope that he will give us some valid reason

why the Government have deliberately made it the dissolution of Parliament. It would be far fairer and wiser to allow the Bill to come into force when it receives the Royal Assent, which I hope it will. At that time let time run for these people. They can then decide what they want to do. Give them a chance before the next General Election to think about it and, as hon. Members opposite have said, to nurse their seats or anything else. We serve no valid purpose whatever by delaying the time at which this Bill will become effective.</p>

<p>I want to make one reference to the speech of the hon. Member for Clapham (Dr. Alan Glyn). It is on his last point. Whether the effective operation of the Bill should commence now, as it were, or only after the dissolution of this Parliament might depend on how long its dissolution is to be deferred. I would have preferred to treat the Government's decision to make it operative only after this Parliament had been dissolved, as an earnest of their intention to give the electorate of this country an early opportunity of electing a new Parliament, but, if that is not so, and this Parliament is to drag on in this half-hearted, rather cynical way for its full legal term, then I should have thought it better, if we are to have the Bill at all, to have it as soon as it can be enacted.<br/>
By an unforeseen and unfortunate chance, which I am sure that the hon. Member for Rugby (Mr. Wise) regrets even more than I do, I happen to agree with his whole attitude to the Bill. I apologise for not having heard all the speeches in this debate but I have heard a good many of them, and very interesting and, in some cases, fascinating speeches they have been. By tradition of the House the limits of debate on Second Reading are rather wide, and it is far from me to suggest that they ought to be narrower, so there is no question about not being in order, because all the matters that we have been discussing lie in the background of the Bill. Although not in any sense not in order, a great many of the more interesting things discussed had little, if any, reference to the contents of the Bill.<br/>
The Bill does not, as I understand it, raise at any point the question whether we should have two-Chamber or single-


Chamber government. No doubt this is all in our minds. No doubt this is the question, on whichever side we are, that the majority of the Members of the House of Commons would like to have decided and removed from future political controversy, either as between the parties or across the parties. This Bill does not decide that. The Bill has nothing to do with it. One can be for the Bill or against it, for this Clause or against it on Committee stage. Report and Third Reading and now on Second Reading, whatever one believes about the question whether we ought to have single-Chamber or two-Chamber government. So although the speeches were interesting, they do not do us much good.<br/>
The same is true of the other important principle involved. On the assumption that we have two Chambers, ought one of them to consist of people who are members of it by hereditary right? That is not involved here at all.<br/>
This is a little Bill&#x2014;a petty Bill. I shall not vote against it because it is not worth voting against. It does not do anything that is important enough to vote for or against. I should be very glad, if I am fortunate enough to catch your eye, Mr. Speaker, to state my views on either of those principles at a time when Parliament is ready to decide anything about them, one or the other. But at this moment to vote in the context of this Bill in the self-delusion that somehow or other we are making a contribution to the great constitutional questions of the hereditary principle or two-Chamber government&#x2014;I cannot follow that at all.<br/>
I should at this stage have liked to say something to my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. C. Pannell), who has taken so prominent and useful a part in the arguments and discussions that we have had about these matters. I, too, am just a year or two too old to be very patient of the all-or-nothing boys. One prefers all rather than some, some rather than less, no doubt. If I could persuade myself that the Bill was really a half-way house or a quarter-way house or even one solid inch along the road, I certainly would not cast cold water or a wet blanket on it merely because it did not go far enough. It seems to me that in so far as it impinges at all on either question&#x2014;the question of

single-Chamber government or of the hereditary principle&#x2014;it is not a step forward, or at least only a very small step. For what it is worth, it is a step backwards.<br/>
My hon. Friend said that this was not a Wedgwood Benn enabling Bill. I gathered from the rest of his speech that he will do his best in Committee to make it just that. Let me say at once that I have no objection. If this really were a Wedgwood Benn enabling Bill and nothing else, I think that it would be a much better Bill. It would, at any rate, do one really limited thing&#x2014;remove one single unit of injustice even if it did not really affect the principle. But it does not as it stands on Second Reading. I do not know what it may be like on Third Reading, but at the moment it does not do that. Why not? First it begins by giving a statutory sanction, I think for the first time since the Act of Settlement, to the hereditary principle. It presupposes that we ought to create special privileges in order to remove, if they choose but not otherwise, disabilities which fall upon people by reason of their parenthood.<br/>
It may be asked what is wrong with that. It may be asked, "Is not that a step forward to what you want? Does it not go at any rate a little way and is it not nonsense to say that it does any harm in the opinion of those who would like to see the hereditary principle abolished or diminished?" I think not, and I invite the House to look at it and see.<br/>
If a man who has an option under the Bill to say, "No, whatever my father may have decided, or whatever obligations he might have been content to accept when my grandfather died, I for my part renounce them and renounce them for ever", then it could be fairly said that we had gone a little but a significant way towards reducing the operation of the hereditary principle. Perhaps in Committee this may be done. I doubt it, but if it is done, then to that extent the point which I am making will cease to have validity. This afternoon, however, we can consider the Bill on Second Reading only as it now stands, and as it now stands no one who has this option of privilege conferred upon him by the Bill is called upon to


renounce anything whatever as far as the hereditary principle is concerned.<br/>
This is why the Bill quite rightly calls it not a surrender but a disclaimer&#x2014;a disclaimer for himself without prejudice to the hereditary principle, the effects of which he is disclaiming for himself. When he dies, his son, by the operation of the hereditary principle, jumping the gap of the disclaimer, becomes again a member of the second Chamber on the hereditary principle.<br/>
I cannot see that, in objecting to that, I lay myself open to the criticism which my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West offered, that I was casting away&#x2014;he did not put it this way but it is the point&#x2014;half a loaf because I did not get the whole. I am not. The Bill does not contain a half, a quarter, or a slice of a loaf or even a crumb as far as the hereditary principle is concerned.<br/>
It seems to me, therefore, that in order to remove a disability in the case of a very limited number of individuals, and perhaps only one, we have to prescribe once again for the first time for several hundred years in our legislation and constitution the acceptance and reaffirmation of the hereditary principle. This seems to me to be far too high a price for the only redeeming and compensatory feature of the Bill, namely, that it will enable my friend Mr. Anthony Wedgwood Benn to return to the House of Commons.<br/>
What does the Bill do about a second Chamber? It reaffirms that too. It is based on the assumption that a second Chamber will go on for at least two generations, for the generation of the man who disclaims for himself so that his children shall not be prejudiced or embarrassed by his choice and will enable them on his death to be members of a second hereditary Chamber of which he might have been a member but for his disclaimer. It does not seem to me, therefore, that the Bill is worth all the time and all the heavy learning and all the profound philosophical disquisitions spent on it in this debate.<br/>
Why cannot the House of Commons take its courage in its hands and face the realities of the political situation here? No one thinks that if we did it now we would be doing it for all

time. Somebody spoke about 1924 and statements about a belated amendment. In 1924 it was already belated by 30 years. The 1911 Parliament Act was a temporary Measure to tide over particular political difficulties. In those days life peers could not be created. Therefore, the Sovereign's consent had to be obtained in advance to intimidate the Opposition of the day by creating enough hereditary peers to enable the majority of the House of Commons, representing the majority of the people of the country, to have its way.<br/>
I hope that the House will forgive me for any apparent unseemliness, but in those days the story was told of a political hostess who when asked if she believed in a second Chamber replied, "Of course I do. My husband is a Liberal peer." That, I think, had as much relevance to the argument as all we have heard today about the limited purpose of the Bill.<br/>
Why cannot we take our courage in our hands and deal with a problem, whichever way we decide it, which by common consent has been overdue for decision for more than half a century? I know that the House is anxious, and very likely ready, to come to a decision. In view of the fact that apparently nobody, not even myself, will oppose the Bill, there is no reason why the House should not come to a decision. But there are important constitutional issues here and I hope that the House will forgive me for having kept it so long from the decision which it wants to take.</p>

<p>I am concerned about certain things in the Bill and I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Nelson and Colne (Mr. S. Silverman) will forgive me if I do not follow him in his various arguments.<br/>
I accept the principle of one-Chamber government. I object to an hereditary institution playing a part in the legislation of the country, I recognise that all of us inherit qualities from our parents, that there is a biological inheritance running through every family, but it does not follow that if a man who has made a great contribution to society by some activity or other has a peerage conferred upon him, genera-


tions later someone should be able to play a part in our Legislature because his ancestor was a famous soldier, engineer, or scientist.</p>

<p>I think that this is part of the evolutionary process of a democratic society. It would be out of order to discuss the matter now, but it might well be that something would evolve out of the House of Commons, and this House needs reforming. It is urgent that in our Parliamentary institutions and in that reform we should discard the inherited second Chamber and out of our deliberations have reform, by creating either permanent committees or an institution which is part of this House for the democratic government of the country.<br/>
I am concerned about the point made by several hon. Members that a peer, or a nobleman who is the son of a peer, may sit in this Chamber for twenty years and maybe for that period a very awkward Member of the House of Commons. I believe that democracy and the Parliamentary institution is strengthened if we have in the House of Commons quite a lot of awkward Members, awkward from the point of view of the Establishment&#x2014;of either side. I am not referring to my hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Emrys Hughes).</p>

<p>No. I am leading up to a point which is the converse of that.<br/>
Hon. Gentlemen on the other side have talked of their wish that dynamic personalities in the other place or liable to go to the other place will be retained here. I can visualise in the present Chamber many noble gentlemen who perhaps some time will go to the other place. There are many here who would welcome the speeding of the day on which they go there and who would not wish to come back.<br/>
I have been here long enough to know the difficulties in our Parliamentary

system, the difficulties with the parties and the Establishment, and to know how difficult it is for those who have very strong convictions of their own, and who are dynamic personalities, and who refuse to be slavish servants of the party machines. I am not one of those people myself. I generally support the party of which I am a member. I have generally done so, although every one of us, I suppose, has his moments when he disagrees with his party.<br/>
I am convinced that the Bill, as my hon. Friend has said, is a petty little thing, because I really do not think that the Establishment&#x2014;particularly that Establishment&#x2014;will make it at all smooth or easier for anyone who is an individual and the son of a peer, or is in the other place, to stay or to come here through being elected for a constituency. I am absolutely certain that pressure will be put on to try to stop awkward, dynamic people from getting in here. Dynamic people are not always so welcome as some of us tend to think&#x2014;not always so welcome in this institution or in many another institution.<br/>
There is one thing I do not understand. I understood that the House of Lords was abolished by Cromwell by Act of Parliament and that that Act has never been repealed. I may be wrong about that. I understand that that is why it is out of order to refer in this Chamber to the House of Lords; we must refer to it as the "other place".</p>

<p>Well, Mr. Speaker, Clause 1(2) says:
<q>in respect of a peerage by a person who has applied for a writ of summons to attend the House of Lords&#x2026;".</q>
Such a person may be a Member of this House, and maybe the heir to a peer, and liable to be called to another place.


When this Bill becomes law he will be able to submit himself to be nominated as a candidate in a Parliamentary constituency, and go before a selection conference in the constituency. While he is going through that nomination, even when he has been selected, he may inherit a peerage; his father may die and he inherits the peerage. He is then subject to be summoned to the House of Lords, but he continues to contest the election. If he fail she need not submit a disclaimer; he can go to the House of Lords.<br/>
As I understand the Bill, he can go to the House of Lords. If he wins the constituency seat he can make a disclaimer. This seems to me to be giving him two bites at the cherry of entering this Legislature.</p>

<p>I am saying this because I hope for an answer from the Attorney-General. It seems to me that this is the position. He need not apply for a disclaimer before he contests the seat, or before he offers himself as a candidate. He can offer himself as a candidate a month before making a disclaimer, and if he is successful he can make the disclaimer, and if he fails he need not make the disclaimer and can go to the House of Lords. I may be wrong in this, but I am explaining the Clause as I read it, and if within twelve months another seat comes up he can have another shot. It may be a point on which I am wrong but I hope for an answer from the Attorney-General.<br/>
I feel that on the first point I am very nearly correct and if I have read the Clause correctly, then I object to it very strongly indeed. I think that if a young man wants to pursue a political career in this place he should do it in the way all of us have to do it, through election, in the way of all of us to this House.<br/>
Another thing I strongly object to is that on disclaimer of the title none of the other benefits or the assets of the peerage, whatever they may be, is disclaimed. I understand that many of those who have inherited peerages have inherited not so much assets but

liabilities, and have not spent their lives enjoying the benefits but have spent their lives trying to overcome the disabilities which their inheritance has brought upon them. I read in a book published by a well-known member of our party, many years ago, that many of those who inherited peerages have had very hazardous lives trying to overcome the disabilities they inherited.<br/>
However, there must be some value to a peerage, to the great honour which is handed on, and if there are great liabilities they must be discharged, just as, if there are assets, they are retained. In this case, however, liabilities can be discarded, the liabilities which bar from a political career in this House; but, at the same time, the material benefits of the gift or inheritance which is handed on are retained.<br/>
Many of those who will inherit peerages and who will toy with the idea of disclaiming in order to come into this House will be reluctant to apply for disclaimer unless they can feel that by coming into this House they are stepping on to the ladder of very high office indeed. I think that this consideration will weigh very heavily on those who will be able to make disclaimers. This is one of the reasons why I agree that this is a very small Bill indeed and that very few will renounce their inheritance.<br/>
There is a great duty on anyone who inherits a great quality to cherish and develop it, but I feel that many noble gentlemen will hesitate before, as it were, discarding a gift, unless they feel that in doing so they can achieve advancement and progress for themselves through this institution. This, I feel, is undesirable; and it is for this reason I think that the Bill's proposal is undesirable, for it sounds as though it may develop some nepotism&#x2014;some such relationship between peers, on the one hand, and, on the other, the establishment of whatever political party is governing the country.<br/>
Although I shall not vote against the Bill, for many reasons, I still think that it is an undesirable and very petty Measure.</p>

<p>We have heard some very interesting


speeches in the debate, although I agree with my two hon. Friends who have just spoken, the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Bence) and the Member for Nelson and Colne (Mr. S. Silverman), that this is a distinctly limited Bill. The House will remember that, in the discussions before the appointment of the Joint Select Committee whose Report the Bill follows, suggestions were made at one time that there should be a broader field of consideration including something about the reform of the House of Lords, questions of bicameral government, and the like, and those suggestions were turned down, as far as any possibility of agreement went, on the ground that we on this side would not go into those questions unless we could also go into the question of powers.<br/>
This is a line which has been taken for many years in my party and also, I think, in the Liberal Party. We are not prepared to discuss questions of reforming the House of Lords by agreement unless we can consider also the limitation of powers which we should think necessary in that sort of case. Accordingly, the present Bill is a much smaller matter.<br/>
I think that the House will agree that it arises out of what was really an injustice. Not for the first time had this injustice occurred. One Member of the House after another had had occasion to protest against being dragged up to another place against his will because he had succeeded to a hereditary peerage. People have felt that this was unjust, but this kind of injustice does, in fact, find a remedy when someone comes along who not only is sufficiently vehement but has some of the, shall I say, unreasonable awkwardness of the reformer, someone who takes every opportunity open to him, and some which, perhaps, are hardly open to him, to get the thing put right. This is what happened in this case. I feel that Mr. Wedgwood Benn should receive the thanks of all of us for having been unreasonable, for having got an injustice put right against the whole force of the Establishment, tradition and the rest. This is something worth doing by any Bill, by any use of die machinery of a Joint Select Committee or the like.<br/>
The occasion has been taken to deal with one or two other minor absurdities and injustices which called for correction. There is one matter which, though quite small from the point of view of numbers, is, I think, of real importance. By the Bill, for the first time is established the right of women who are peeresses in their own right to stand on the same footing as men. I hope that we are all sufficient feminists to regard that as a good and important change well worth making.<br/>
We have dealt with two other matters. One is the wholly absurd position of Irish peers. They have been called peers. There is no Irish representative peer now; the last one died a couple of years ago. The Irish peers are, therefore, not representative, so there cannot be representative peers. There does not seem to me to be any particular reason why there should be, and the only point is that they cannot sit in the Northern Ireland Parliament. Of all ridiculous situations, I should have thought that that was one of the most ridiculous which our history and constitution ever arrived at.<br/>
As to Scottish peers, I hesitate to say that there is any absurdity about them, but there is an almost infinite complication. If anyone wants a bit of light reading, I recommend Appendix 14 to the Report of the Joint Select Committee. In the absence of any Scottish Law Officers in the House, the right hon. and learned Gentleman the Attorney-General will, I do not doubt, be only too glad to give us at some time a short summary and criticism of the memorandum of the Lord Lyon King of Arms on questions connected with Scottish peerages. Perhaps I had better say no more about it.<br/>
Those are the purposes of the Bill, and I am very glad that, although some of us would have liked a different Bill, and some have this or that point to make about it&#x2014;I shall mention one or two myself&#x2014;we all feel, at the end of the day, that it is right to let this vigorous and vehement young man have his way and be able to come back here. It is right not particularly for him&#x2014;he was a very good instrument for the purpose&#x2014;but it is right, too, for the people of Bristol, South-East. They voted for him knowing very well that there was something a bit odd about the situation&#x2014;I am not using judicial language or trying to&#x2014;and they made perfectly clear that he was


the man they wanted in the House of Commons.<br/>
I am not saying anything contentious about his opponent or about what happened. I mean simply that it is a good thing for democracy that, when this kind of event occurs, it should, if possible, have some effect ultimately. That is what has happened in this case. It is probable that, however vehement he had been, without that support from the people of Bristol, South-East, he would not have succeeded in getting us to do what I hope we shall do today.<br/>
In any consideration of whether we ought to have a second Chamber, reform of the House of Lords, or anything of that sort, there is one important fact which should be borne in mind but which nobody has mentioned today, although a good deal has at times been said about it. The House of Lords is, and seems likely to remain, the preserve of one political party. We cannot really talk sense about the question unless we bear that in mind. However, I am not here to talk about that now.<br/>
There are two important points which my right hon. Friend the Member for Smethwick (Mr. Gordon Walker) mentioned at the beginning of the debate and which I repeat shortly now. One relates to the extinction of peerages, the drowning of peerages&#x2014;whatever words are used. As the Bill stands at present, one has to produce a state of affairs which has never existed before. Artificially, one makes a dormant peerage, something which is supposed to lie about somewhere and to crop up again when a man who has renounced his peerage dies. I have never heard of that being done before.</p>

<p>Of course. I am well aware of that, but I have never heard of an Act of Parliament which had the deliberate intention and effect of creating dormant peerages. I see no reason for doing it. Quite simply, it seems rather absurd.<br/>
I never really know why people talk about the hereditary principle. Why is it a principle? What sort of principle is it? What does it mean? Rather like Henry Ford who said that history is "bunk", I feel that the hereditary

principle is rather "bunk" too. But I dare say that others take a different view. Be that as it may, whatever lies at the back of it all, this extraordinary device of tucking the peerage up in bed, telling it to go to sleep until someone dies, seems quite ridiculous.</p>

<p>I still take the point, and I think my hon. Friend will agree, that, important though it is to deal with what might be called the Wedgwood Benn question, it is important also that the limited number of women who have been penalised compared with men, whatever we may think of the men's rights, should at least have the same rights. I am sure that we are all good enough feminists to feel that that should be done. Indeed, it should have been done long ago. When we divided in the Joint Select Committee on this matter of drowning peerages the majority of Members of this House voted for drowning. The voting was five to four. It was only members of another place who swung the balance the other way. No doubt this will be raised in Committee.<br/>
The second point is this. Why have the Government thought it necessary to make the Bill operative only from the date of the next General Election? I have been sitting here practically the whole day thinking what can be the reason for this. I have been able to evolve only one possible reason. I do not know whether it is the right one or not; it probably is not. Are the Government thinking that an ex-peer who has renounced his peerage may be adopted as the next candidate for the Bromley Division?<br/>
Is that what is in their mind&#x2014;one man out of another place and another man going into it? I agree that this kind of suggestion is not too serious, but what is the object of making this provision? I simply cannot see it. No doubt when the Attorney-General winds up the debate he will tell us what is the practical reason for this. There are very obvious reasons against it. It looks fishy. Whether it is fishy or not it looks it, and that is a rather good reason in a Bill of this sort.


Thirdly, I am rather worried about the timing in some of these cases of renunciation&#x2014;or should I use the other word? Let me give one very short instance. Take a man who succeeds to his peerage the day before Parliament is dissolved. He has a month in which to disclaim. If he is a Member of Parliament, he must do that by notice to the Speaker. I am not clear that the Speaker is there for that purpose. People always say that the Speaker remains between one Parliament and another, but he does so only for limited purposes.<br/>
I assure the Attorney-General that I do not expect him to answer this sort of point this evening, but one finds on page 251 of Erskine May that by two Acts of Parliament of 1832 and 1846
<q>it is provided that, in case of a dissolution, the then Speaker shall be deemed to be the Speaker, for the purposes of those Acts, until a Speaker shall be chosen by the New Parliament.</q>
When one looks, as I have looked, at the purposes of those Acts, one finds that they are strictly limited. There happen to be certain financial purposes with which I need not trouble the House. It seems to me that if we say that the Speaker shall be deemed to continue as Speaker for certain purposes, it is very strange that he should be taken to continue for other ones. This kind of point wants looking into.<br/>
The point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East and one or two others are all Committee points, and I hope that the Government will have a look at them. May I say in the presence of the Leader of the House that I listened very carefully to what he said at the beginning of his speech. I did not quite follow him. I am sure that this is my fault and not his, but I suspect that there was another point which also needed some attention. I trust that the Government will take the opportunity to look at these matters before the Bill reaches Committee.<br/>
I have taken up too much time already on a Bill of this sort and I conclude by saying that we on this side are heartily glad that this limited Measure has been brought forward. We shall certainly support it in every possible way. We think that the two points which I mentioned, and which I will call roughly drowning and dare, are serious and important, but, just as they were not enough in the

proceedings of the Joint Select Committee to make us vote against the Report as a whole, so they are not enough to make us vote against the Bill as a whole.</p>

<p>I agree with the hon. and learned Member for Kettering (Mr. Mitchison) that we have had very interesting speeches during the debate. It is usual for one to say that they have been wide-ranging speeches. In the course of this debate they have been exceedingly wide ranging on a Bill which has a limited purpose. Some speeches were slightly more wide ranging than others, but I note that only one voice has been raised firmly against the Bill, and, after I have given what explanations I can about the questions which have been raised, I hope that the House will give it a Second Reading.<br/>
It is quite right, as has been said, that the Bill does not attempt to reform the House of Lords in any way. Nor does it raise the very wide issues which were touched on particularly by the hon. and learned Member for Ipswich (Mr. D. Foot) about whether there should or should not be a second Chamber and whether, if there is a second Chamber, its present composition ought to be radically reformed. Nevertheless, I submit that the Bill makes some important constitutional changes which may vitally affect the prospects, future life and usefulness of numerous individuals, and, in particular, as the hon. and learned Member for Kettering said, of peeresses, who, up to now, have not been able to have the equality between the sexes which is now almost universally accepted in this country.<br/>
The Bill affects the composition of both Houses of Parliament and, to that extent, it changes the rules of the political game. It is desirable that constitutional changes of this nature, whether we regard them as large or small or whether we regard them as more or less important, should be made with the maximum support and agreement between not only the political parties in each House of Parliament but the two Houses themselves. It is for that reason that I am grateful that there has been so much unanimity in the House today. I agree entirely with my hon. Friend the Member for Clapham


(Dr. Alan Glyn) that this is another example of the art of the possible, which is what politics are so often about.<br/>
While there are no doubt many details which will have to be examined in Committee, where many of the subjects which have been discussed today will be raised again, I am glad that there is fairly general agreement on the Bill's main provisions. I agree particularly with the right hon. Member for Smethwick Mr. Gordon Walker) that it is important that we should maintain the principle that there should be no "in and out" of either House. There should be a single option, and it should remain a single option throughout.<br/>
It is also important that the Bill should maintain the principle that it applies to hereditary peers only. It is very difficult to see how it is possible on that principle to make any special exception for the noble Lord, Lord Longford, whatever regrets people may have about that. While it can be discussed, it seems difficult to depart from the general principle for a particular individual's advantage.<br/>
May I deal first with one of the principal subjects of discussion, namely, whether the disclaimer provided for by the Bill should, as it is said, drown the peerage and extinguish it not only for the peer who disclaims but for his descendants, or whether, as the hon. and learned Member for Kettering said, the peerage should be made dormant or in abeyance by Statute for life. The right hon. Member for Smethwick and the hon. Member for Orpington (Mr. Lubbock) dealt with that. I agree with the hon. Member for Nelson and Colne (Mr. S. Silverman) to the extent that it raises the question of whether the hereditary principle should continue to apply.<br/>
I am grateful for what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Peterborough (Sir Harmar Nicholls) and my hon. Friend the Member for Carlton (Sir K. Pickthorn) about the importance of the hereditary principle as the support of the House of Lords. However one may agree or disagree with those arguments, I submit that those are matters which fall for consideration at the time, when it comes, when there should be a general review of the House of Lords and the basis upon which persons should sit there, and that it would be wrong in a Bill of

this nature to endeavour by a side wind to diminish the effect of the hereditary principle because one is trying to make a provision under which an individual may sit in this House if he desires to do so.</p>

<p>I cannot quite follow this argument. When a man accepts a peerage in the first place, he accepts it for himself and his posterity; he has no opportunity of consulting them. When he accepts it in this way and binds posterity by so doing, why is it not an equal principle that if he is allowed to disclaim it, he should disclaim it for his posterity in exactly the same way as it was created for his posterity in the first place?</p>

<p>All I am saying is that that might be the basis of a general reform for, as the hon. Member said, a diminution of the numbers in the House of Lords; but that is not what we are doing in this Bill. We are providing the opportunity for individuals to sit in this House although they would otherwise have been peers.<br/>
All I am saying is that it would be wrong, while the membership of the House of Lords generally remains based upon the hereditary principle, to use this Bill to diminish that principle and that, as long as that hereditary principle is retained as the basis of membership for the House of Lords, it would be anomalous to allow a peer by his arbitrary action to prejudice both the Sovereign's and his heirs' constitutional rights and obligations.</p>

<p>Is not the inevitable conclusion that in these cases we are creating a kind of dormant peerage, which has never existed before and is not supported by the hereditary or any other principle?</p>

<p>It is quite right that during the time it has been disclaimed for the life of a particular incumbent, the peerage will be in the same condition as a peerage which is dormant. This will have been achieved, it is true, by Statute, but it will not mean that the peerage itself has been extinguished or drowned. This should not happen while the hereditary basis is the foundation of the House of Lords. I quite appreciate that there are arguments on either side, and I have no doubt that


we shall return to them in Committee and that this will be one of the principal matters of debate that is bound to arise in Committee.</p>

<p>Would not my right hon. and learned Friend agree that it is a mistake to assume that the heir to a peerage which is in abeyance, or which has been disclaimed, is necessarily of that peer's posterity or one of his descendants? He may be no such thing. Clearly, if he is a distant relative, the opportunity for blackmail would be considerable.</p>

<p>That may be so. The converse is that by a whim, an elderly gentleman who was unlikely to live long might desire to disinherit from the peerage his relations or cousins who he knew were the next successors. Arguments of this kind always work both ways. Examples can be found both sides of the line. One must consider the general foundation of whether they try to diminish or to maintain the hereditary principle.</p>

<p>I hope that we do not try to make logic out of illogical arguments. I remember an old gentleman of 81 accepting a peerage. That condemned a lot of young men who were not consulted. It is all according to whether one thinks that they are being ennobled or are struggling after a liability. We had better accept it as what it is, a tidying-up operation, and not attempt to rationalise on the larger issues.</p>

<p>That is what I was trying to say, that the Bill was to this extent a tidying-up operation and should not, therefore, diminish the hereditary principle.<br/>
I was asked by my noble Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Viscount Lambton), who made some earlier interventions and endeavoured to cross-examine without success the right horn. Member for Smethwick, to tell the House that he could not be here at this hour. He asks me to apologise to the House for his absence.<br/>
The position about titles of courtesy under the Bill is that the Bill does not deal with them at all. They are not a matter of law, except I understand&#x2014;it has been mentioned to me during the

debate&#x2014;that it may be the fact that the elder sons of Scottish peers, who are often known as the Master of somewhere, may have a title as of right and this will have to be looked into and may require an Amendment to the Bill. Apart from that example, however, courtesy titles are entirely a matter of social convention. They are not matters that carry any legal right or obligation. It was, therefore, thought right that any mention of them in a Bill which legislates should be omitted.<br/>
A person who succeeds to a peerage and who disclaims it will be a commoner. In all legal documents, official documents, invitations, books of reference and matters of that sort, he will be a commoner. It is probably well known to all hon. Members that those who come into this House bearing courtesy titles because their fathers are peers are sworn in and entered on the rolls of this House as "Mr. John Smith, commonly known as Viscount&#x2026;"whatever it may be. Such a person is sworn in in his Christian name and surname, in the same way as any other commoner. The effect of a disclaimer will be that it will extinguish not only the principal peerage to which the person has succeeded, but any lesser title which normally would have been born by courtesy by his eldest son. The eldest son of a peer usually, by courtesy, bears one of the titles of his father who is the peer. Of course, it will be an obligation, before the person who holds all those peerages can sit in this House, that he should have disclaimed them and, therefore, they will be in abeyance.</p>

<p>A baron's son is the Hon. Mr. So-and-So. As far as he is that in his own right, he is the son of a baron, just as an esquire is an esquire in his own right as the son of a knight. What happens to the eldest son under the Bill if a baron disclaims?</p>

<p>He is not that as of right; he is it by courtesy as it is a courtesy title. The phrase "courtesy title" exactly describes the position in these matters. What the social conventions will be in the future, I do not know, but I assume that the majority of persons who wish to disclaim a peerage would not themselves desire to continue to bear any courtesy title. They are not themselves interested in con-


tinuing the obligations of the peerage. The majority of them, particularly those who came to sit in this House, would think it right and proper that they should sit here without any reference to the peerages which they have disclaimed.</p>

<p>Would not this mean an alteration in the entry in the Official Report when a person holding a courtesy title is sworn in? I have here the entry at the beginning of this Parliament when the present Lord Sandwich was sworn in. It reads:
<q>Alexander Victor Edward Paulet Montagu, esquire"&#x2014;</q>
thus ranking him as a commoner, but goes on&#x2014;
<q>commonly called Viscount Hinchingbrooke, South Dorset"&#x2014;[Official Report, 21st October, 1959; Vol. 612, c. 28.]</q>
Do I understand that that sort of description will continue? Earlier today I heard it suggested that if Lord Sandwich came back here&#x2014;and he is a considerable loss to us while he is away&#x2014;he would merely be described as Mr. Montagu. What would happen? What happens in the case where a peer has a son who dies and whose widow and children have then no title?<br/>
When I was Home Secretary I had on occasion submitted to me a document which alluded to such a case and claimed that the widow and children of the deceased man should have the social precedence that would have been theirs had he been alive and succeeded to the title. What will happen with regard to that kind of case? That was not a matter of law but of social precedence.<br/>
I understand that on certain occasions at court, and on other social occasions, some people seta great weight on this question of precedence. For instance, I often used to say that owing to some thing that happened in the eighteenth century&#x2014;</p>

<p>The question of the name of a peer who comes back to the House is a matter for the House

itself and for its practice. I would suppose that such matters would be entirely within the control of the House. I do not think that any decision has been taken, but I believe that the general understanding will be that the peer will come back as "Mr. X" or whatever his surname may be. But there will be nothing whatever to prevent a man from calling himself commonly by any title he likes, or to prevent his friends, as a matter of courtesy, from calling him by his title. They need not call him by that title if they do not wish to do so.<br/>
One difficulty is that, if one were to legislate about this, one would have to say that no one was to use a courtesy title if he either had disclaimed the peerage or was the son of a man who had disclaimed it. It would be an odd sanction to devise which would provide a penalty for a person who called himself by a courtesy title even although we had passed an Act of Parliament saying that he should not be called by that name. Who would enforce it and what would the penalties be? It would be a somewhat curious situation.<br/>
We do not have an active court of chivalry in being at the moment&#x2014;or at least not one that sits very much&#x2014;and whereas these matters might have been dealt with there in ancient days we have to get on without it. I think that all this question of what a person will be called will be a matter of social convention. We shall have to see how the matter develops although it is plain, I should have thought, that those who have disclaimed their peerage would give up not only the title, dignity, honours, rights and obligations of the peerage but also any courtesy title as well.</p>

<p>Reference has been made to the Earl of Sandwich. He was


famous here as Viscount Hinchingbrooke. If he stood for this House again he might well professionally&#x2014;to put it that way&#x2014;wish to be known as Lord Hinchingbrooke. In the same way, Mrs. Aneurin Bevan is not normally known by that name. There are other cases where people are not commonly known by their ordinary legal names.</p>

<p>We may call a peer who has become a member of this House by his courtesy title when we meet him in the Lobby or in the smoking room, but that does not affect what he is called in this Chamber, where we refer to him by his constituency. The only official terminology entering into that is whether he should be called the "noble Lord" or not. His actual name will be irrelevant to our proceedings.<br/>
The question of the traditonal Scottish peers has been raised and the hon. Member for Stirling and Falkirk Burghs (Mr. Malcolm MacPherson) was good enough to welcome this provision. I am sure that it will be generally welcomed. I understand that it will result in 15 additional Scottish peers and 10 Scottish peeresses in their own right being added to the House of Lords. While, of course, I understand that there may be regret by some people that ancient ceremonies that take place at Edinburgh at the beginning of each Parliament may become otiose and therefore abolished, I would think that on balance there is greater gain for Scotland in the provision about Scottish peers in the Bill.<br/>
I turn now to the Irish peerage. It seems to me that the claim of Irish peers to membership of the House of Lords, as put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Sir W. Teeling)&#x2014;that they should sit as representing the peerage of Ireland&#x2014;seems wholly to ignore the partition which has now existed in the geographical entity of Ireland over the last 40 years, to ignore the fact that Eire is a republic and not in the Commonwealth, and to ignore the historical geographical and political facts which have been in existence for 40 years.<br/>
All we are doing now by the provisions as to the Irish peerage in the present Bill is to give a legal status and reality to what has been a fact since 1921. The Bill only recognises that position, and I do not understand how it can be said that because, for the purpose of the Act

of Union in 1800, an Irish peerage was created, it is now necessary despite partition that there should still remain representatives of the Irish peerage in the House of Lords.</p>

<p>Because Parliament has never dealt with the position that existed since 1921 in order to regularise it. From 1921 the situation was that while those already in the House of Lords continued to sit there, there was no method or system of renewing that representation.<br/>
Of course, I recognise the importance of this matter to Northern Ireland in particular. It would be impossible to divided the Irish peerage into Northern and Southern Irish elements. Each individual Irish peer has a different residence which he may change throughout his life, and particular titles are not necessarily attached to one part of Ireland or another. We all recognise that Northern Ireland is the nursery of great men. It provided most of the field marshals in the last war and I do not see why it should not provide as many peers, either hereditary or life, in the future as any other part of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>Is it not the fact that, with the suggested merging of the Scottish peerage, what we are getting is one United Kingdom peerage?

<p>The other main point which was raised by a number of hon. Members was the question of the date on which the Bill will begin to operate. It is rather curious that today


Opposition Members have suddenly shown an active interest in the subject. The right hon. Member for Smethwick and the hon. and learned Member for Kettering raised a lot of teasing questions about this subject, but when it was discussed in March the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Belper (Mr. G. Brown) confined himself to saying that all he wanted was that it ought to be brought in so that the reform would apply in time for the next General Election.</p>

<p>That is what we we are saying, that it should apply in time for the next General Election; not that it should formally come into effect, but that it should apply. It came as a great shock and surprise to us to hear what was proposed. My right hon. Friend had not then read the Bill.</p>

<p>It comes as a great shock and surprise to me to hear that announcement, because my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House has consistently made this announcement and there has not been one peep or murmur from hon. Members opposite who now appear to be shocked by the idea. This is the first occasion on which shock has become audible from their lips.<br/>
Let me explain what is the basis of the reason why it was decided that the Bill should operate only from the dissolution of this Parliament. The Bill affects the composition of the two Houses and the constitution. It was thought right that, as we had all been elected on one basis of the constitution for this Parliament, we ought to continue through this Parliament on that basis and that the composition of the House of Lords in particular should not be altered in this Parliament and that it would be perfectly satisfactory if the Bill came into operation for the purposes of the next Parliament.<br/>
One of the objections was that there might be noble Lords desirous of standing at the next General Election. But their position cannot be affected by whether the Bill comes into operation immediately the Royal Assent is given or upon the dissolution. They all know the terms of the Bill now and they all know that it will be possible, as soon as dissolution takes place, or the Royal Assent is given&#x2014;they could all tomorrow and they could yesterday since the Bill has

<p>That does not affect the argument about whether the Bill should operate on the Royal Assent or otherwise, because it would not arise. I would have submitted that it was sensible and right and would not affect the interests of those who may be desirous of disclaiming their peerages and standing at the next election, because as from today they can present themselves for candidature at a constituency and no doubt put in a proviso in an undertaking to disclaim subject to the Bill's passing. I should not think many people would have much trouble about that.<br/>
A number of detailed points were raised. There was an interesting question about the Arundel estates with which I do not intend to deal at the moment but which will be carefully considered. It needs a good deal of research and I should not like to answer it without consideration. I am grateful to the hon. and learned Member for Kettering for also reserving my right to deal with another of his fast balls at a later stage and not immediately on the Floor of the House.<br/>
This has been a useful and interesting debate. The points raised will be given the fullest consideration. The Government are grateful to all right hon. and hon. Gentlemen who have drawn these matters to the attention of the House and I ask the House to give the Bill a Second Reading.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.<br/>
The Bill will, I believe, be welcomed on both sides of the House, especially after what has been said so many times in the past, about the need to expand the territory in which the present Colonial Development Corporation operates.<br/>
What the Bill does to amend the Overseas Resources Development Act, 1959, and the Colonial Development and Welfare Act, 1959, is well set out in the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum, and if any right hon. or hon. Gentleman is not sure on any point, my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies will be able to answer any question when he winds up the debate.<br/>
The House will remember that the C.D.C. was set up under the Overseas Resources Development Act, 1948. Its operations were confined to Colonial Territories not possessing responsible self-government and to British Protectorates. There have been various amending and validating Acts since then, but it was felt until recently that the Corporation would need all its resources for its work in dependent territories, for which Britain has a special responsibility.<br/>
Thus, when the first country to become independent since the Overseas Resources Development Act, 1948, Ghana, shed colonial status, the C.D.C. was precluded by the Ghana Independence Act from operating there, without prejudice to the continuance of any operations begun before the date of independence. It was thought at that time that private funds should be the main contributor to development in the independent Commonwealth.<br/>
Private enterprise has undoubtedly done a fine job in many Commonwealth territories. In the last few years, approximately &#x00A3;100 million per annum have been invested privately in these areas of the developing Commonwealth

which in future will be covered also by the C.D.C. But the policy of relying on private enterprise solely was changed in the Commonwealth Trade and Economic Conference in Montreal in 1958. Thenceforth, Commonwealth assistance loans were to be available, but even so, because formerly dependent countries are now so quickly becoming independent and because so many of them are poor and under-developed, there is a strong argument for not confining to Colonies the operations of the C.D.C. which is so well adapted to meet the needs of countries which have recently become independent.<br/>
Therefore, this Bill puts back into the sphere of activity of the Colonial Development Corporation, now rightly to be renamed the Commonwealth Development Corporation, all Commonwealth territories which were in it in 1948 when it was set up. The Bill includes Southern Rhodesia, which is already within the ambit of C.D. and W., and the New Hebrides, but not British Somaliland, which has become part of a foreign country and in which the C.D.C. never had any interest. The ex-British South Cameroons have also become a foreign country&#x2014;and I know that this part of the world is of considerable interest to my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool Kirkdale (Mr. N. Pannell)&#x2014;but there the C.D.C. can continue in co-operation with its associate, the Cameroons Development Corporation, the development approved while the Cameroons was still a trust territory.<br/>
It is, however, as well to take note that in accordance with the powers conferred under the Bill my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State intends to instruct the Corporation to seek his prior approval before starting operations in an independent country, and will give that approval only if the agreement of the Government of the independent country concerned is given.<br/>
There is no intention of raising the amount which the C.D.C. can borrow from the Treasury above the limit of &#x00A3;130 million. The net advances outstanding amount to &#x00A3;92 million, and borrowings in the last ten years have averaged under &#x00A3;10 million per annum, and, of course, the C.D.C. can always also borrow from the banks or use its share of its now fairly substantial profits.<br/>
I should tell the House that the C.D.C. welcomes the policy embodied in this Bill, and I should like to pay my tribute to the work of the Corporation. The recently published Report for last year shows that the operating surplus has risen from &#x00A3;1,869,000 in 1959 to &#x00A3;4,361,000 in 1962, and the profit last year was &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;6 million, of which the Treasury, under the 1959 Financial Settlement, will receive &#x00A3;690,000.<br/>
Paragraph 4(5) of the Report says that in 1959 approximately &#x00A3;12 million had been lost out of the then investment of &#x00A3;21 million, but since 1952 only &#x00A3;250,000 has been lost. In 1951, a staff of 325 at head office looked after an investment of &#x00A3;21 million. Now the staff at head office amounts to only 157, looking after an investment five times greater; so much has been achieved during the last twelve years which have coincided with a Conservative Government.<br/>
The Corporation's objective is to assist in the development of the country in which it operates, yet the money with which the Corporation works is received on the strictest possible terms. However, in 1962, the Corporation's investment in manufacturing and processing enterprises alone was associated with a turnover at the rate of &#x00A3;38 million, of which goods worth &#x00A3;23 million were exported from the territories concerned, and British exports generated by those activities amounted last year to over &#x00A3;7 million.<br/>
The Report goes on to say:
<q>When a project has been successfully established the Corporation is ready to dispose of its investment, provided the price is satisfactory,"&#x2014;</q>
and this is a point of which I think private enterprise might well take note&#x2014;
<q>particularly to buyers resident in the country where the project is situated. When a sale is complete the money is available for use for the development of some other project.</q>
I turn now to the colonial development and welfare part of the Bill. This is the sixth time that Parliament has been asked to provide funds since the first Act was passed in 1940 at the height of the German victories in France. The funds have always been dealt with on a cumulative basis, and each Act has simply extended the period in which funds are provided and has increased the aggregate amount.<br/>
The Colonial Development and Welfare Act, 1959, which was a consolidating Measure, provides assistance of two kinds. First, money for schemes for development and welfare in the Colonies, and this is mostly in the form of free grants. Secondly, Exchequer loans for colonial development programmes. The sums provided under both these heads are cumulative. Exchequer loans have proved invaluable because, despite the success of Barbados last year, the House will know that there have been many occasions when Colonial Governments have been unable to borrow money in the City.<br/>
British aid to the Colonies this year is likely to be nearly &#x00A3;90 million, of which assistance under the C.D. and W. Act may account for about &#x00A3;35 million. Private investment is approximately &#x00A3;15 million, but more than half the territories rely almost entirely on C.D. and W. assistance for their development. Much of it is in the form of grant so that it can be used to cover local expenditure, though where this aid goes to finance imports, colonial territories are, naturally, expected to buy British. C.D. and W. money is intended primarily for basic Government social and economic services and not for projects in the commercial sector.<br/>
The Bill extends the period in which C.D. and W. schemes may be made and Exchequer loans approved from 31st March, 1964, to 31st March, 1966. There will, therefore, be the customary overlap with the existing Act, thus enabling Colonial Governments to be informed well in advance of the aid they can expect. They can therefore plan ahead.<br/>
The effective period of the Bill is three rather than five years because in these days of rapid constitutional and political change it is difficult to foresee more than three years ahead what the requirements are likely to be. It is, however, realised that the need will continue after that.<br/>
The Bill increases from &#x00A3;315 million to &#x00A3;340 million the amount of money that may be spent on schemes under Section 1 of the C.D. and W. Act. At 31st March, 1963, about &#x00A3;43&#x00BD; million remained unspent of the &#x00A3;315 million, so that about &#x00A3;68&#x00BD; million will be available for expenditure in the three years, 1963&#x2013;66. The provision for Exchequer loans is increased


from the figure of &#x00A3;100 million, made available by the 1959 Act, to &#x00A3;105 million. Issues of loans amounted to &#x00A3;64 million at 31st March this year, so that the Bill will permit further issues of &#x00A3;41 million.<br/>
In deciding how much money should be provided under the Bill we could not overlook the probability that some territories now covered by it will become independent before 1966. If any territory enters independence with an unspent C.D. and W. provision, that amount will be "frozen", that is, set aside and not spent. This does not mean that we automatically stop development assistance to such a territory, but we cannot give it under this Act.<br/>
We can, if necessary, give it in other ways, as we have done in the independence settlements relating to Tanganyika, Uganda, Jamaica and other territories. Conversely, if it is found that we have under-provided in our assumptions for the needs of such a territory, its continuing need could be met possibly by releasing to it some frozen balances from somewhere else. There is thus an element of swings and roundabouts in this arrangement.<br/>
Although the Bill reintroduces a ceiling on expenditure for C. D. and W. schemes this is a purely precautionary measure, because of the substantial increase in our total overseas aid, particularly since 1959. In fact, it has approximately doubled since 1957. The scale of assistance provided by the Bill is considerably greater than that provided by the 1959 Act. The increase, taking grants and loans together, is 28 per cent., and the proportion of grant to loan is greater.<br/>
The House will bear in mind the fact that previously for research and technical assistance for the Colonies funds have been found under the C. D. and W. Acts, but this expenditure is now financed by the Department for Technical Cooperation. This change, however, does not imply any decrease in the amount of research done for the benefit of colonial territories.<br/>
This is a hybrid Bill, dealing with two distinct types of development aid for the less developed members of the Commonwealth, both dependent and independent. It will, however, I believe, commend itself to the House.</p>

<p>Just now the Under-Secretary of State said that the Bill would be welcomed, and he is quite right. We welcome it very much. But in doing so, we say, "At last", because, as he truly pointed out, we have said on very many occasions that we wanted this Bill. We think that it has been introduced very late in the day indeed. We pestered the Secretary of State on the matter. I have personally pestered him for a long time now, and as long as a year ago we received assurances that it was coming. It has been a very long time being born, but it is certainly better late than never.<br/>
On the other hand, we are critical of the Bill now that it has appeared, because it does not appear to us to be adequate. The obvious inadequacy that first strikes one is that it does not cover the whole of the Commonwealth. When we introduced this great change&#x2014;and I am talking entirely about the C.D.C. now&#x2014;making it possible for the Corporation to initiate new schemes outside the dependent and colonial territories, we surely ought to have gone the whole way and made the Corporation able to take action in the whole of the Commonwealth.<br/>
Why should we restrict it to the territories which were dependent when the 1948 Act was passed, setting up the Corporation? I was one of the two Ministers who piloted the Measure through the House, and I have naturally been keenly interested in the Corporation ever since. Now that it is becoming a Commonwealth Corporation&#x2014;quite rightly&#x2014;why do we not include the whole Commonwealth in the scope of its activities? At present, three exceedingly important parts of the world&#x2014;South-East Asia as a whole, India and Ceylon, and Pakistan&#x2014;are excluded. This is a nonsense.<br/>
I do not say that India is a very suitable territory for the C.D.C. It has reached a state of development where it does its own planning and a great deal of its own technical assistance. The scale of the Indian economy is so large that it rather dwarfs the Corporation. The Corporation has been the instrument of some territories which are not particularly small&#x2014;it is very active in Nigeria, which is a big country&#x2014;but India is on an altogether different scale. But even in India


I can imagine that there might be opportunities for suitable schemes, and I cannot see why it should be excluded. It might be that the Corporation would never operate there. But why exclude it?<br/>
In the two other territories, Ceylon and Pakistan, there might well be very suitable opportunities. Ceylon might well benefit from C.D.C. activities. My hon. Friend and myself have recently visited Pakistan and we were struck particularly by the fact that there would appear to be suitable opportunities for the Corporation in Pakistan. It is noticeable that the Pakistani Government have established two very similar Corporations of their own, one in East Pakistan and one in West Pakistan, which act internally in a similar sort of way.<br/>
Rightly, I think, on balance, the C.D.C. now acts indirectly. It invests in what are, as it were, local corporations and acts as a banker or, in a sense as a finance house. But I should have thought it might discover useful opportunities to act with the Pakistan corporations in a manner similar to its operations in East Africa. It seems to us a great mistake and a great pity that there should be this exclusion and we propose to move Amendments during the Committee stage to try to rectify this limitation.<br/>
It may be that the Corporation might feel that this is too big a thing too take on. But it would be purely permissive, because no one would wish to force the Corporation into great schemes in South-East Asia if it did not wish to undertake them. But it seems to me a great mistake that the Corporation should be stopped from initiating anything in that part of the world should it desire to do so.<br/>
To be frank, this is, I suppose, another example of Treasury caution. The Treasury has understandable reasons for entertaining certain suspicions about the C.D.C. and for not being keen on a wider extension of its activities. This, of course, brings me to the fact that was well brought out by the Under-Secretary, that the C.D.C. is now a success story. There is no question about that. But I was amazed when the hon. Gentleman said that this was coincidental with the arrival of the Conservative Government. I consider that "coincidental" is just the

right word and no more. After all, what happened was that the C.D.C. had severe teething troubles and this was just about what could have been expected.</p>

<p>Yes, it had lots of them. I do not believe that a Conservative Government would ever have set up the Corporation. But had they done so, I do not think that the teething troubles could have been avoided.<br/>
The C.D.C. had to find out how to do its job, and that it has done. I am perfectly willing to give credit to the present Government for allowing the Corporation to discover its scope. But I cannot accept that this Government should take credit for the Corporation having overcome its teething troubles. Anyway, the C.D.C. would have been gradually throttled but for the new Measure, and it has been enabled to undertake new schemes in independent Commonwealth countries.<br/>
The Under-Secretary has given the figures of its present-day results, and they are striking. The Corporation is not a philanthropic or an eleemosynary undertaking, but one which is of mutual benefit to this country and to the countries in which it operates. I think that the Treasury and the Government would be unwise to limit its activities on balance of payments grounds.<br/>
I thought one of the most striking parts of the Report, which the Under-secretary did not quote and to which I should like to call the attention of the House, is the end of paragraph 6, where an attempt is made to show the effect of C.D.C. activities on the balance of payments. Those are very interesting figures. This is what the Corporation claims. It claims that last year&#x2014;this is the Report for 1962&#x2014;it drew &#x00A3;4&#x00B7;7 million from the Treasury, but of that it either kept in this country or remitted the larger part to this country, &#x00A3;3&#x00B7;7 million, leaving, at first sight, a burden on the balance of payments of only &#x00A3;1 million, almost a trivial amount when we think of the size of the figures involved.<br/>
As against that it sets, interestingly enough&#x2014;and it is an interesting economic point&#x2014;the &#x00A3;7 million of British exports which it says the activities of the Cor-


poration as a whole, I take it, of the &#x00A3;100 million invested, had generated.</p>

<p>I beg pardon. That is correct, paragraph 4(7).<br/>
Seven million pounds of exports are generated and, therefore, there is a failure on the balance of payments of &#x00A3;6 million. I should not like offhand to pin my faith on that exact calculation&#x2014;I think it a difficult one to make&#x2014;and to compare the exports generated and how they have been paid for. But it is a good claim of the Corporation and I think that one could say that it is fairly clear from those figures that the activities of the Corporation today are imposing at the most strain on the balance of payments at all. If the C.D.C. did not exist, our balance of payments certainly would be no more favourable and might be a little less favourable than it is today.<br/>
The Treasury, rightly, of course, and inevitably&#x2014;we should not complain of that&#x2014;must be thinking always of balance of payments and always have this in mind, but it should take a wider and more favourable view of the C.D.C.'s activities. It is an impressive instrument today. In these smaller territories, some still Colonies and some High Commission Territories, where development, for obvious political reasons, is extremely important today, in those African and Asian territories, the C.D.C. is an incomparably flexible and effective instrument.<br/>
I was particularly struck&#x2014;and this refers to paragraph 6, which I mentioned, paragraph 6(2)&#x2014;by the variety of agencies and partnerships by which the Corporation extends its activities, with Courtaulds, in Swaziland, the Dutch company, in Tanganyika, the International Bank, in Kenya, with the Kenya Government, with the Northern and Eastern Nigerian Governments, and with the West German Government, in Tanganyika. It is an extraordinary range of partnerships and, of course, there are many others in different parts of the world. A very attractive and impressive technique has been worked out there. I am sure that

every hon. Member who is present this evening who knows the Commonwealth will agree that the Corporation appears to be welcome wherever it operates.<br/>
That is a remarkable thing, because the aid itself has not always been welcome and has sometimes created friction, but the Corporation seems to have been extremely successful in generating good will. It is becoming increasingly self-financing and is able to turn over its enterprises more and more to local entrepreneurs or local governments. I make no point about whichever it should be. It is excellent to do it to both. This frees funds for new enterprises. I think that its extension to the Commonwealth as a whole, long overdue, is a great step forward.<br/>
Having said that, I look at the Report and study the figures, and I am impressed by the fact that, compared with the scale of international needs and of the international aid which goes on in the world, and even compared with the general amount of aid and investment which this country is undertaking in the world, mainly in the Commonwealth, the Corporation is not a very large element or a very significant factor, and we should delude ourselves if we thought that it was.<br/>
The Government say that we are investing or giving in aid to the world as a whole, on both public and private account, about 1&#x00B7;7 per cent. of the gross national product, which means between &#x00A3;200 million and &#x00A3;300 million a year. The Corporation was doing only &#x00A3;4&#x00B7;7 million last year and as an annual contribution to aid this is very modest. Even public aid, I suppose, is about &#x00A3;150 million a year.<br/>
The Corporation, on its present scale of initiating new operation, is a pretty small part of general aid and investment. I suggest that this very wide extension&#x2014;we hope that before we have finished with the Bill it will be wider still&#x2014;marks the Government's intention widely to extend the scope of the Corporation's activities. That cannot be done all at once. Because of the burdens put on the Corporation, it cannot be done suddenly, but a policy of steady expansion on the very sound basis which exists would surely be well received today. That would mean raising the


ceilings. The Corporation has not come near the &#x00A3;130 million yet, as the Minister said, but it would probably mean raising the ceilings in the end.<br/>
It would also mean&#x2014;and the Corporation has views about this&#x2014;a change in the method of financing in the sense that the Government would become an equity holder rather than having a fixed charge on the Corporation. But, mainly and essentially, it would mean an intention to make the Corporation's activities over a period of years a substantial part of our general aid and investment programme, which we cannot say that it is at present.<br/>
I am leaving to my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. G. M. Thomson), who knows more about it than I do, the part of the Bill which deals with colonial development and welfare and the welcome extension which the Bill makes there. Whether it is adequate or not is another matter. I put it very strongly to the Government that in the C.D.C. we have a body which is a success story, but on a limited scale. We should not be frightened; there is no reason to suppose that it would impose any hurden on our balance of payments if we steadily expanded its activities so that it was brought into a rather different scale in the end form what it is on today.<br/>
It represents an almost ideal method of investment and assistance to the developing world. It combines financial aid and technical aid in a way nothing else does. It brings together British financial resources and British technical and administrative resources for the aid of the developing Commonwealth and does it in a way which has been proved to be welcome in every part of the Commonwealth.<br/>
Therefore, we regard the Bill as no more than a beginning in the development of the Corporation and it will be the intention of a Labour Government to build on a very considerable scale on these foundations.</p>

<p>In common with the right hon. Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Strachey) I welcome the Bill as a natural consequence of the transition of the Empire to a Commonwealth. It would be

churlish to emphasise too much the delay which has occurred in presenting the Bill. Rather we should express our gratitude for the action now it has been taken. I agree with the right hon. Gentleman that it seems an anomaly that countries like India and Pakistan should be excluded. Those of us who have urged the extension of the C.D.C.'s operations to the Commonwealth had in mind those countries that have become independent since 1948. We were disappointed that as soon as they became independent any new projects in those territories immediately had to cease. It is fair comment to say that when the Overseas Resources Development Bill was introduced by the Labour Government in 1949 they specifically excluded the independent members of the Commonwealth such as India and Pakistan.</p>

<p>I know, but this could still have been done. At that time it could have been made a Commonwealth Development Bill and India and Pakistan could have been included. Those countries were deliberately excluded from the operation of the Act.<br/>
I want to take the opportunity of referring to one project of the Colonial Development Corporation which comes outside the scope even of this Bill. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations referred to it in his speech. I want to make special reference to it. I refer to the project known as Camdev, or the Cameroons Development Corporation, which operates in a foreign country in a Federal Republic of Cameroon. Its activities are centred in what is now known as the Western Cameroons section of that Republic, a territory which was formerly a British mandated territory and which in 1961 decided not to join Nigeria but to become a member of the Federal Republic of Cameroon.<br/>
This project had been in existence by the C.D.C. in that territory for some years, and it continued after the territory became part of a foreign country. The arrangement was that any profit that might arise should be paid over to the Federal Republic. The extent of the


C.D.C. investment in this project is not quite clear from the accounts I have. All we know from the report received this morning is that &#x00A3;1 million has been lent by the C.D.C. to this project. It is undoubtedly a very important enterprise indeed, vital to the economy of this part of the Republic of Cameroon. It is engaged in the production of a large number of commodities&#x2014;rubber, tea, bananas&#x2014;and I think that the most important of them in point of value is bananas. When this section of the Republic became an independent country outside the Commonwealth in 1961, the Government decided to continue the Commonwealth preference, despite the fact that: the territory was no longer within the Commonwealth. It was in the first place extended until September, 1962, and later until September this year.<br/>
That preference is particularly important in regard to bananas which are such an important part of the economy of the country. The C.D.C. itself in the Cameroons Development Corporation produces 30,000 tons of bananas a year of the value at point of export of about&#x00A3;1 million, and nearly twice that amount on arrival in this country to which most of the bananas are exported. This production of 30,000 tons is out of a total production in that area in the Western Cameroons of some 70,000 tons. Ten thousand tons, or perhaps 8,000 tons, are produced by a British company. Elders and Fife, and the balance of 30,000 to 40,000 tons is produced by local African enterprise.<br/>
The preference is &#x00A3;7 10s. 0d. a ton. It has been said that this is not very important, that it does not matter much whether this preference is continued after September this year or not, that it is only &#x00BE;d. per lb. and the bananas fetch prices of anything up to 1s. 6d. per lb. in the shops, and that therefore the industry can bear the burden of a &#x00A3;7 10s. 0d. per ton. tax. I do not think this is proved by the facts that we have before us. I do not want to go into any tedious argument as to the high retail profit that is necessarily obtained on bananas and that the price to be taken into consideration is not the retail price but the wholesale price. I am looking merely at the accounts of the Commonwealth Development Corporation where,

under the heading of Federal Republic of Cameroon, the figures for the Cameroons Development Corporation are given. Last year, there was unfortunately no profit to pay over to the Federal Government. There was a profit in 1961 of &#x00A3;47,000 and in 1962 there was a loss of no less than &#x00A3;316,000. It was said that this was largely because the banana market prices were the worst in the Cameroons Development Corporation's history.<br/>
It will be observed that the exports that year of bananas were 32,000 tons, and &#x00A3;7 10s. a ton duty would represent about &#x00A3;250,000. If that sum were added to the loss of &#x00A3;316,000, it will be seen that this enterprise, which seems to depend on a low capital of &#x00A3;1 million only, would be involved in a loss of over &#x00A3;&#x00BD; million in one year's operation. That is the prospect before the company next year if the preference is not continued. It surely cannot be imagined that any enterprise with such a meagre capital could possibly continue operations on the basis of over &#x00A3;&#x00BD; million loss per year.<br/>
There is another aspect&#x2014;that if the industry were to fail, the shipping which is a most important factor in the economy would also cease from that country, and there are no fewer than 60 shipments of bananas every year to the United Kingdom. I am not pleading a constituency case, but more than half of these shipments come to the port of Garston in Liverpool.<br/>
It has been asked why this industry does not benefit from the E.E.C. arrangements, because it is in part of a country which is an associated territory of E.E.C. The fact is that there is a special arrangement with France for the purchase of bananas from the Cameroons and it is confined to bananas from the Eastern Cameroons, which is a former French part of the territory. It is, therefore, assumed that a quota will be imposed by France on bananas from Africa at 125,000 tons a year, of which only 50,000 tons will come from the Republic of Cameroon, and since over 50,000 tons already come from the former French part of the Republic there is obviously no place for the 70,000 tons of bananas produced in the Western Cameroons.<br/>
The industry in the Western Cameroons has faced this problem and ever since danger of the removal of Commonwealth


preference appeared it has made strenuous efforts to improve its position. It has introduced a new variety of bananas known as "Poyo", as distinct from the strain grown up to now which is known as "Gros Michel". This variety is more productive and less susceptible to disease. It is believed that in time production could be so much improved that the industry would stand the burden of the &#x00A3;7 10s. duty which would be imposed if Commonwealth preference were to disappear. This, however, must take time. Great progress has been made, but not enough, and it is estimated that it will take a further three years before this new variety is in full production and the industry will have the opportunity of standing up to full world competition without the advantage of Commonwealth preference.<br/>
It is argued that it is anomalous for a non-Commonwealth country to benefit from Commonwealth preference. The other Commonwealth interests have urged their own cases against the Cameroons. The West Indies&#x2014;Barbados, the Windward Islands and Jamaica&#x2014;export large quantities of bananas and they feel that if the Commonwealth preference were withdrawn from the Cameroons they would benefit, but that is a shortsighted view. It would not be possible for the deficit in the short term to be made up from other Commonwealth sources. This would mean that the market in this country would have to have recourse to other foreign sources of cheaper bananas which would lower the whole market to the long-term detriment of the West Indies. I ask my hon. Friend the Under-secretary of State for the Colonies to make some mention of this in his closing speech. It is urgent that a decision should be taken in the matter.<br/>
The interests involved are great. A great many Europeans, mostly Britishers, are employed there and there is a labour force of 17,000 Africans. All these are in jeopardy. I ask my hon. Friend to consider some tapering off of Commonwealth preference over a period of three years so that it should continue for another year at &#x00A3;7 10s., reducing the next year to &#x00A3;5 and in the third year to &#x00A3;2 10s., and then disappearing altogether. This would give an opportunity to the industry to adjust itself to the new situation by the development of this higher yielding

variety of banana and perhaps in that way would save the country from disaster. There is also a serious political content in all of this, in that if this industry were to fail there is always the prospect that these countries would turn to the Iron Curtain countries, an event which we should take into serious consideration and seek to avoid.</p>

<p>Having crossed swords violently in previous Commonwealth debates with the hon. Gentleman the Member for Liverpool, Kirkdale (Mr. N. Pannell), it is a change and a pleasure to follow him and to find myself in substantial agreement with everything that he said.<br/>
I had not intended to refer to the Cameroons, but the hon. Gentleman's speech has prompted me to do so, for any of us who were present here in the Palace of Westminster when the first meeting was held of the Anglo-Cameroonian Society which has now been formed will appreciate the value which the people of the West Cameroons attach to their previous relationship with this country and their anxiety that those ties of friendship shall be perpetuated.<br/>
I would underline the request the hon. Gentleman has made to the Government that they should consider the possibility of tapering off Imperial Preference rather than suddenly turning it off at an arbitrary date. I think that there is great force in the argument he has put forward on that ground.<br/>
I, also, warmly welcome the Bill. It is a Bill which could mark a new phase in Commonwealth relations. I suppose that there is always a tendency in this House for hon. Members who are particularly interested in any matter which is the subject of debate to regret that other hon. Members do not show an equal interest in the subject, but though, perhaps, it is slightly churlish I find it regrettable that on a subject of such vital importance as this to the Commonwealth as a whole, and when we are considering a Measure for the development of the assistance which this country is able to give to the Commonwealth, there is not a larger attendance of hon. Members. This is a Bill for which hon. Members on both sides of the House have pressed for a very long period of time, and I believe that one of the most


cogent observations in that regard was made by the late Hugh Gaitskell during a Commonwealth debate. I well remember his pointing out the brutal fact of independence for a Colony was that it was suddenly deprived of any further, fresh assistance from C.D.C., and not merely the tapering off of the completion of existing schemes.<br/>
Therefore, I think that this is of enormous significance. First, I think that the change in name is of importance. The word "Colonial", to some, had a connotation which was opprobrious. I think that psychologically this is an important change. It is enormously exciting to feel that nine or ten countries, such as Nigeria, Ghana, Malaya, Sierra Leone, Tanganyika, Uganda, Cyprus, Jamaica, can all now benefit from the provisions of the Bill.<br/>
I think it right to say that, in addition to the pressure of right hon. and hon. Members of the House, there was pressure from some of those territories upon the Government in the United Kingdom to introduce this Bill. Perhaps I have not travelled as much as other hon. Members who have taken part, or will be taking part in this debate, but when one goes to East Africa or West Africa, or, indeed, the Caribbean, one thing which one learns is that the Governments of all those countries are crying out for bigger investment to provide employment for their people, technical knowledge and "know-how".<br/>
I agreed with the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Strachey) when he regretted that the Asian members of the Commonwealth would not be included within the purview of the Bill. They can, of course&#x2014;I am subject to correction&#x2014;ask for advice and for managerial assistance from the C.D.C.; they can make that request, but will have to pay for it.<br/>
I think that this is something which must be looked into, to see whether it is possible to extend the formula. I envisage that, within the present limited formula, the provisions of the Bill would be of very great assistance in, for instance, Pakistan and India in agricultural schemes. There are great possibilities there.<br/>
This brings me to the first point which I wish to press upon the Under-Secretary

of State, that the scope for association with other organisations and other financial interests is tremendous. The right hon. Gentleman drew attention to paragraph 6(2) of the 1962 Report of the Colonial Development Corporation which refers to various private organisations and public companies and banks with which it had co-operated. I should have thought that, particularly in the Far East, there might well be opportunities for the technical and managerial "know-how" of the Corporation being married to the financial resources of the World Bank.<br/>
I should like to see Commonwealth investment, that is, one member country of the Commonwealth investing in another. As far as I know, this has happened only under the Colombo Plan. I have always wished that the wealthier countries of the Commonwealth&#x2014;Canada, Australia and New Zealand&#x2014;could be encouraged to play a part in providing technical assistance and capital in the developing parts of the Commonwealth. It would be out of order to discuss the ideas which have been canvassed for a service to provide doctors and technicians on a Commonwealth basis, but, dealing only with finance, I hope that it may be possible to interest various countries of the Commonwealth in investing in this way.</p>

<p>Is the hon. Gentleman aware of the work which New Zealand does in providing education on a rotary basis to the Pacific Islands? I agree with what he says, but I hope that he recognises the work which is already being done.</p>

<p>Certainly. I wholeheartedly recognise and commend the investment which Canada is making in Jamaica and various parts of the Cameroons and what New Zealand is doing, as the hon. Gentleman says, in parts of the Pacific. But, as far as I know, there has been no actual investment made for the purpose of Commonwealth development along the lines of the Commonwealth Development Corporation. I should like to see it not only Commonwealth in scope, but Commonwealth in investment. I believe that there are enormous possibilities there.<br/>
A great advantage of the Corporation is that its capital is not tied. If a country


lends capital for a scheme, the Corporation is not bound to buy its raw material and machinery from the lending country; it can go into the world market and buy in the best market. I know that there have been whispers that this is a state of affairs which the Treasury and the Government would, perhaps, like to alter, but I hope they will set their face against any such change. In my view, this is one of the reasons why the Corporation has been able to buy in the cheapest market and has been able to economise in many respects when purchasing capital equipment. It would be retrogressive if that system were to go.<br/>
The Corporation's record has been one of superb stewardship. Of course, there were teething troubles at the beginning. It was a totally new conception. But every penny borrowed is being repaid. The Corporation has proved a boon to many countries which have been able to build up their basic services in a way which would have taken them years on their own. Although one is usually very cautious about giving to a public corporation increased powers, there is no corporation which has proved itself more capable and which more richly deserves to have its powers increased than the C.D.C.<br/>
Now, a word about colonial development and welfare. The powers here, particularly the financial powers, are to be increased. In a Question on 4th February, the hon. and gallant Member for Arundel and Shoreham (Captain Kerby) asked the Secretary of State for the Colonies what was to be the period for repayment of the loan made under Section 2 of the Colonial Development and Welfare Act, in round figures &#x00A3;200,000, to the Kenya Government with reference to certain farm lands in the Nandi Salient, with which, perhaps, the Under-secretary of State is familiar.<br/>
This is a case which C.D. and W. will be considering in the very near future and in which this country has a very strong moral obligation. I hope that C.D. and W. and, indeed, the right hon. Gentleman will be very generous in it. The right hon. Member for Woodford (Sir W. Churchill); when he was Under-secretary of State for the Colonies in 1907, and when he was an ornament of

the then Liberal Administration, declared that that plot of land belonged in perpetuity to this particular tribe.<br/>
Since then, beginning in 1912 and later in 1919 and subsequently over the years, that property has been wrongfully alienated and wrongfully taken away from this tribe and leased to various European farmers by the Crown. It was leased with aid which the Kenya Government sponsored European Agricultural Settlement Board gave to these farmers who went out to settle there.<br/>
In 1950, the British Government realised that they had an obligation to hand back this land to this tribe and they bought 10 farms of 11&#x00BD; thousand acres for which they paid &#x00A3;120,000 in compensation to the European farmers on those farms. That was to be compensation for their crops, movables, legal cattle and for a disturbance allowance. At the time the British Government said that, in their view, that was the end of the claim of this tribe, but recently the Government have realised that they are under a moral obligation to see that the remaining part of this territory is handed back voluntarily to this tribe.<br/>
We are, therefore, faced with the fact that there are 20 farms which will be bought out and the money for buying them out will come from a C.D. and W. loan. The European farmers on those farms have accepted that they must sell their farms and move elsewhere. For the most part, they are anxious to remain in Kenya and to reinvest in other parts of the Colony&#x2014;I think that it is still technically a Colony&#x2014;but, because the money is coming in the shape of a loan and because the land will be given back free, there has been cheeseparing in the valuation on those territories. Although the right hon. Gentleman originally said that a loan of &#x00A3;200,000 would be made, that has now been whittled down to &#x00A3;150,000 and the basis of compensation is that there will be no disturbance allowance paid at all to those farmers.<br/>
This is not similar to the voluntary 1 million acre scheme which is going on at the moment in Kenya. This is a very special state of affairs in which farmers were induced to take leases on property in respect of which the Crown held itself out as having a title which, in fact, it does not have, and, through no fault of their


own, the farmers are having to give up their farms and are being compensated at a figure which does not take into account a disturbance allowance.<br/>
They have accepted this valuation from the Kenya Government on the understanding that this will be reviewed by the Secretary of State with the possibility of a disturbance allowance being subsequently paid. Therefore, since we are discussing colonial development and welfare, I hope that a proper market price will be paid to these farmers, to whom we have a strong moral obligation.<br/>
All I should like to say, in conclusion, is to add my word of congratulation to an extremely efficient board which has varied interests and wide experience. The board of directors of the Corporation and the staff are few in number in relation to their turnover, but, collectively, they have achieved a fine result. I believe that this could help to raise the living standards of many parts of the Commonwealth. I hope that we shall be able to widen its scope and to interest other members of the Commonwealth to invest generously in it.</p>

<p>I will not follow too closely the avenue along which my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Kirkdale (Mr. N. Pannell) led us a little earlier in connection with bananas. He is obviously an expert on that subject, which I am not. Similarly, I will not attempt to follow too closely the remarks of the hon. Member for Devon, North (Mr. Thorpe), who gave us an exposition at some short length, and of necessity slightly woolly, on the Liberal ideas of Commonwealth cohesion. I will leave the hon. Member with the machinations which he put before the House.<br/>
I should, however, like to express some accord with the right hon. Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Strachey). I share to some extent his remarks about the desirability of expanding the work of the Colonial Development Corporation, as it used to be called, or the Commonwealth Development Corporation, as it will henceforth be known as a result of the Bill. I do not, however, go all the way with the right hon. Gentleman, who tended, perhaps, to fall into an old custom of his of encouraging grandiose schemes in different continents of the world.<br/>
This time, the right hon. Gentleman was talking of vast schemes in Asia. A few years ago, he was concerned with vast schemes in Africa, and on the last occasion the British taxpayer had to foot the bill for the errors which arose there from. Therefore, I would not go all the way with the right hon. Gentleman in his vast expansion of the C.D.C. I would rather see a fairly steady annual and regular expansion of the moneys which are put into C.D.C. and a sensible and annual expansion of the work through C.D.C.<br/>
I welcome, first, the commonsense change in the description of the Corporation. It was foreshadowed in the Gracious Speech from the Throne at the beginning of the Session and it puts matters in their proper perspective. I similarly welcome Clause 1 of the Bill, which provides a sensible enlargement of the sphere of operations of the new C.D.C. Perhaps I should say that instead of providing a sensible enlargement, it prevents a curtailment of the sphere of operations of the Corporation. This would have naturally followed had one Commonwealth country after another achieved independence and the Corporation no longer been allowed to operate therein.<br/>
I believe that I am right in saying that both sides of the House are agreed with the two sensible measures which have been urged upon the Government Front Bench from both sides for a number of years. What has turned what could have been a major Commonwealth unifying initiative into a somewhat petty little Bill, however, has been the entire failure to expand the total sum of money&#x2014;&#x00A3;130 million&#x2014;which can be advanced from the Consolidated Fund to the C.D.C.<br/>
In the last debate on this subject, on 7th July, 1960, hon. Members on both sides of the House referred to the ham-stringing of the C.D.C. by the lack of money available to it from the Consolidated Fund. The then limit was also &#x00A3;130 million from the Exchequer. This Bill will considerably increase the activities of the Corporation but apparently it will still maintain the same limit of money available from the Consolidated Fund.<br/>
The then Secretary of State for the Colonies in 1960 said that the capital


which the Corporation then had should be made to revolve. But however much one revolves 6d. it will never appear to be 1s., and of necessity many of the projects of the Corporation require not permanent but certainly long-term involvement of its funds.<br/>
On two grounds alone I am extremely puzzled to understand the reasons for refusing to extend the money available. First, it is doing pioneer work in many undeveloped territories&#x2014;all of which, except for the Cameroons, are in the Commonwealth. I have seen the work it is doing in Bechuanaland in comparatively virgin territory, putting in a great deal of hard work and money into a fine project. Secondly&#x2014;and an even stronger factor&#x2014;thesre is the fine financial performance of the Corporation since we debated it in July, 1960.<br/>
Then it was shown that its profits were steadily increasing. Since then, there has been a further marked improvement in its financial position. For instance, in 1959, it showed an operating surplus, after overseas tax and before interest to the Government and provision against capital loss, of &#x00A3;1,800,000, and in 1962 this increased to &#x00A3;4,361,000. That is an excellent result, reflecting great credit on the management of the Corporation and all who work for it.<br/>
In addition to this steady and welcome increase in profits, as my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State said there has been a really marked improvement in the office figures in London. The office staff has been halved while the capital involved has multiplied from &#x00A3;20 million to over &#x00A3;100 million. In view of the considerable benefits which flow to us from the C.D.C.&#x2014;the development of backward nations and areas, which hon. Members often call for, the need to maintain some form of our national connection with those areas, and, not least, because it is a pretty secure investment&#x2014;I suggest that the sum of money which is the maximum that can be advanced from the Consolidated Fund to C.D.C. should be raised to &#x00A3;250 million.<br/>
Finally, why are we being asked in Clause 2 to approve a reduction in the annual rate of C.D. and W. loans in 1964 and 1965? The annual average of loans at the moment is a maximum of &#x00A3;25 million. My right hon. Friend may be

envisaging that with the continual development of our Colonial Territories into Commonwealth nations C.D. and W. funds will not be required for the development of these territories to the same extent as in the past, but the work is still there to be done.<br/>
There is much to be done in many colonial territories which, for as far as one can see into the future, will not be independent or connected with independent Commonwealth territories. I could name many of them, such as British Guiana, the Mauritius, the Seychelles, or even the High Commission Territories. Why is the ceiling of money available annually to be reduced from &#x00A3;25 million to &#x00A3;20 million? Can my hon. Friend tell me what has been the loan demand on the sum available in the past three years and what proportion of that demand has the sum available met?<br/>
If we are to channel from C.D. and W. work a sum of &#x00A3;5 million a year, cannot the money we save in that way be used to enlarge the total limit of sums which may be made available to the C.D.C? I believe that the C.D.C is a winner. I am not concerned with whether it is a Government body. It has done wonderful work for the Commonwealth, and on those grounds alone it should be continually fostered and expanded.</p>

<p>I want to focus attention on one narrow topic which I believe to be of crucial importance&#x2014;the provision of paper, writing paper and textbooks, to developing areas. Most of us have travelled widely and have experience of West Africa and other developing countries and know the need, but I was reminded of it only last week when entertaining a representative of the Sierra Leone Red Cross.<br/>
He said that he was one of a family of 20&#x2014;his father had four wives. Of his brothers and sisters, he said, 17 would have done well in some sort of higher education, but only he and one brother had achieved it. Basically, that was because schools in Sierra Leone, as in other developing countries, demand fees which are relatively high, and they are high because of the cost of books and education materials of all kinds rather than because of the cost of teaching, and school buildings.<br/>
From the particular to the general and to the Report of the Second Commonwealth Education Conference which took place in New Delhi. On page 57, paragraphs 33 and 34 say:
<q>We are unaware of any precise estimates of the need for books in Commonwealth countries; but our discussions made it clear that there is a growing unsatisfied demand for reading matter of all kinds, ranging from primers aid simple readers for children and new literates to literature and reference material for general readers and specialists.</q>
<q>It is clear that, unless urgent steps are taken to enlarge the existing supply of suitable books and to improve the facilities for their production and distribution, education will continue to suffer.</q>
This can be met by the C.D.C. setting up the sort of printing and paper making apparatus which is needed or, alternatively, and in the very near future, by using the under-utilised resources in Britain to help the developing countries. Surely this is an instance in which the paper mills which are working, or were throughout the winter, four days a week can be brought into operation on behalf of this priority aid which should be given to the territories? This applies not only to the paper mills which produce school jotter paper, but to the manufacture of text books which is carried on in many of the areas which are hardest hit by unemployment. I refer, in particular, to the firm of Nelsons, which has done so much pioneering work for text books adapted to Africa.<br/>
Perhaps for a moment I might come back to the description given by my Sierre Leone Red Cross friend to the situation in Sierre Leone&#x2014;the way in which, for instance, only one maths jotter of 24 pages of inferior paper is allowed each term. The fact is that one cannot learn mathematics if one has only a slate and is allowed no more than one jotter per term, and this kind of example can be multiplied in other territories.<br/>
I say no more not because there is a great deal to say, but because I wish crisply to confine myself to this one topic with the hope that I shall have an interview with one of the Departmental officials, if not with the Minister himself within the next few days, and perhaps he will give this point his consideration.</p>

<p>Lest the praise of the right hon. Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Strachey) and that of the hon. Member for Devon, North (Mr. Thorpe) make my hon. Friend the Under-secretary feel that there is every reason to be contented with this piece of legislation, I should like to raise one voice in opposition to the Bill, which, I consider, is disappointing and dreary. It will not measure up to the challenge of potential investment in the Commonwealth. Having waited for the Bill for some time, I find that in total it is a disappointing document.<br/>
The failure lies in the fact that there still tends to be an attitude, when talking in terms of investment and welfare aid to the Commonwealth, to think in terms of what can be done out of what is left over after we have examined our balance of payments problem. This results in a relatively small sum being devoted each year to this problem, certainly small compared with other major items of Government expenditure when the return and the reward in moral or in economic terms could be enormous.<br/>
One of the reasons for this failure is that there is virtually no background information on the total potentiality of investment in the Commonwealth to try to get a general impression of what is required in terms of investment and what would be the result of that investment were it available. This is something which has not been examined in detail and is not readily available to hon. Members.<br/>
The few facts that one can glean from the trend of Commonwealth trade, or from the trend of investment in the Commonwealth, indicate that there is enormous economic potentiality in substantially increasing our investment in certain Commonwealth countries. I think that the results of the work of the Colonial Development Corporation, now to be the Commonwealth Development Corporation, up to date show the rewarding investments that can be made in African territories.<br/>
If one studies the trend of trade with our African territories in the Commonwealth, one finds, for example, that in the years 1950 to 1960 our exports to African, Asian, and West Indian territories increased by &#x00A3;257 million. Yet our


investment during that period was relatively small. Indeed, direct economic aid in 1960 amounted only to &#x00A3;36 million in all, plus certain loans. Last year, we exported to African territories alone, leaving out the Republic of South Africa, nearly &#x00A3;300 million worth of goods. Yet our aid to African territories in that year&#x2014;aid of all types, such as loans, financial grants, and supply of equipment and technical assistance&#x2014;amounted to &#x00A3;78 million.<br/>
It would, therefore, seem, as has been proposed by certain distinguished experts working in this sphere in the United Nations, that any increase in investment brings with it a substantial increase in the importing potentiality of the country concerned, and, therefore, a substantial increase in opportunities for British trade.<br/>
I regret that more has not been done by Her Majesty's Government to produce reliable information as to the relationship, first, between investment and exports, and, secondly, investment and general economic growth. I must also express my disappointment at the fact that a proposal in which I know my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations has taken a great personal interest over the years was not in some way included in the provisions of the Bill.<br/>
I refer to a scheme to provide some form of insurance cover to private firms investing in under-developed and Commonwealth territories. A Commonwealth Capital Development Department could well have been incorporated in the terms of the Bill. This is an operation in which the advice of the technical staff of the C.D.C. would be invaluable, because it has constantly had to make commercial decisions and has constantly had to assess the risk involved in investments in particular Commonwealth countries.<br/>
It therefore has the "know-how" which could provide the ratings and mechanism required to embark upon a scheme and which would give substantial guarantees, and interest private investors in going into these countries. Yet there is no such provision in the Bill. Indeed, all that the Bill does is to provide certain rather limited increases in the amount of expenditure over the next few years. It does very

little to increase the general activities either of the C.D.C. or those made possible by the various welfare Acts.<br/>
I hope that the time will come when my hon. Friends will recognise that we have here a great economic potential&#x2014;something of great moral importance and something which, in terms of the overall strategy of the West, <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> the struggle against Communism, has continued to be neglected.</p>

<p>I want to intervene briefly to seek an assurance from the Under-Secretary of State that the smaller territories of the Commonwealth will be no worse off under the Bill than they are at present. I wish to make a special plea for some small territories which are rather neglected by the Government. They tend to be forgotten because they are small and remote, and because they have apparently no great problems to be solved.<br/>
It is not unnatural that the Government should be preoccupied with the obvious problems of the large African territories, but the fact remains that these small territories have their own very real problems to contend with. I have in mind particularly the island of St. Helena, which is over 4,500 miles from these shores and has a population of less than 5,000.<br/>
There is for example the problem of unemployment. The people depend for work mainly on the flax industry which has a history of instability. The other source of employment is the Government service and there is also a certain amount of farming on a small scale. There is sporadic unemployment and few opportunities for emigration to this country. There is also the problem presented by the lack of amenities. Housing generally on the island is of a very poor standard.<br/>
Shortly the British Government will be left with only these small territories to care for&#x2014;only such places as St. Helena, Tristan da Cunha, Mauritius and the Seychelles. The large territories are rapidly gaining their independence. I should have thought it would be not only our moral duty but also in our own interests to see that, so far as is possible, these small territories are made econo-


mically viable. I hope, therefore, that additional funds will be made available to assist them to attain this objective under the provisions in this Bill. It would be an excellent thing if the new Corporation could send out a representative to St. Helena to inquire into the potentials of the island and the possibility of establishing a small industry there.<br/>
The provision of an airfield would make an enormous difference to St. Helena. In order to get to St. Helena at present one must travel by sea. Ships call there infrequently and the journey takes from 14 to 16 days. Were the island more easily accessible, it would undoubtedly be a popular tourist centre, because it is a delightful place with an admirable climate. I believe that these potentialities, the possibility of providing new industry and an airfield, should be investigated. I hope that this will be possible. I hope that the Under-Secretary will deal specifically with the position of the small territories and reassure the House that more and not less assistance will be available to them under this Bill. If he can give that assurance, I shall be glad to welcome this Measure.</p>

<p>Like all hon. Members who have taken part in this debate, I wish to extend a welcome to the Bill. I could hardly do otherwise because, as hon. Members opposite who have taken part in the successive debates on this subject will know, we on this side have been pressing the main change proposed in the Bill for a very long time.<br/>
We should have welcomed the Bill more warmly had it come a bit earlier, because it is quite a long time since this uncontroversial proposal was originally conceded by the Minister. In fact it was in July of last year, almost exactly 12 months ago. It was mentioned in the Gracious Speech and the Bill has taken a considerable time to arrive before us, at the tail end of the Parliamentary year. To hon. Members on this side of the House this seems to provide further evidence of the lack of success of the experiment of having one Secretary of State in charge of the Colonial Office and the Commonwealth Relations Office. Perhaps the time will come when

it would be a good idea. But the evidence of the last 12 months has proved that it has meant considerable delay.</p>

<p>This position has meant a very considerable delay in business coming before the House. This is why we have had to wait so long for this Bill.<br/>
There is, I am afraid, a long history of delay in the Government's dealings with the Colonial Development Corporation. The Under-Secretary, who opened the debate, said that it was a remarkable coincidence that the Corporation should have done so well during a period of Conservative Government. I think perhaps that the reason is that the Conservative Government have paid so little attention to it and it has been able to get on with its business without the Government expressing much concern.<br/>
I well recollect those of us, including the Minister who opened the debate, who were concerned about the financial disabilities of the Corporation in earlier years being very glad when the Sinclair Committee was set up to investigate the financial structure of the Corporation. That Committee performed its duty with remarkable expedition. It produced its Report in three months, in July, 1959, but it was not until July, 1960, that we were able to have the Report discussed in the House. That was when the present Leader of the House was Colonial Secretary. Not until the year after did the present Leader of the House manage to get round to doing anything about the Report. What he did in the end was remarkably timid and cautious.<br/>
Now we have had a further year's delay over this proposal. I think I can recollect 12 Conservative Ministers one after the other standing at the Dispatch Box giving powerful and irrefutable reasons from their own point of view why it was quite inconceivable that the Colonial Development Corporation


should be converted into a Commonwealth Development Corporation. This is a delayed conversion, but we welcome it nonetheless because of that fact.<br/>
It seems remarkable that, despite these delays in Government decision-making in relation to the work of the Corporation, the Corporation should have gone ahead with its morale seemingly unimpaired and recorded the achievements which are in its Annual Report published a day or two ago. Despite the fact that we welcome the main proposal in the Bill, it seems to me that the Bill itself is rather messy and not sufficiently imaginative. It used to be an argument from the Government side against turning the Colonial Development Corporation into a Commonwealth Development Corporation and allowing it to initiate new projects in independent countries of the Commonwealth that it might cause offence among the newly independent Commonwealth countries if they were to be linked with what basically was a colonial corporation. I do not think that this was a well-founded argument, but it was one frequntly put forward by the Government.<br/>
It therefore seems strange that when the Government have finally decided to take the risk and make this change it should have put it into a Bill which is also mixed up with the extension of colonial development and welfare grants. If we had two separate Secretaries of State we probably would have had two Bills to deal with these matters, and we might have had both of them a little earlier. To put the question of the Commonwealth Corporation in the same Bill as proposals for expanding C.D. and W. grants seems to me to be a typical example of the muddle which the Government have allowed to grow up in the general area of aid-giving to Commonwealth countries.<br/>
I give an example. The C.D.C. itself has come under the Colonial Office. Is is now to be under both the Colonial Office and the C.R.O.? To whom are we to put questions about the operations of the C.D.C. in future? In any case, the C.D.C. will be between these two Departments. Capital aid to the Commonwealth is in the hands of the Treasury. Technical assistance to the Commonwealth is in the hands of the

Department for Technical Co-operation, C.D. and W. grants, the other part of the Bill, are in the hands of three Departments&#x2014;the D.T.C., the Colonial Office and now the Central Africa Office.<br/>
Everyone will agree that there are immense possibilities for inter-Departmental chaos, warfare and hold-ups. When this change was being made in the scope of the C.D.C., I think that there was a case for transferring it to the authority of the Department for Technical Co-operation. Apart from the fact that it is a capital-consuming Corporation, it seems in some ways to fit much more closely into the functions of that Department of the Government than any other.<br/>
It is impossible for hon. Members on this side of the House, with the knowledge available to us, to say what exactly would be the best pattern of Governmental organisation for economic assistance to Commonwealth countries, but it is beyond doubt that the increased importance of this subject over recent years has meant that there ought to be an inquiry into this matter and some streamlining of the Governmental organisation.<br/>
I think&#x2014;and I speak personally here&#x2014;that there is probably some case, for instance, for the Commonwealth Development Corporation, as it will be, to act as an agency in some of the expenditures incurred under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act. A number of hon. Members have said that a unique feature of this Corporation is that it combines the possession of capital aid with special "know-how" in terms of development in under-developed countries, as well as having a resident team of people in the various areas of the Commonwealth. In the light of some difficulties which the Colonial Office has had with the expenditure of C.D. and W. money at certain times, it is, I think, worth exploring whether the C.D.C. might play some part in using these moneys in Colonial Territories.<br/>
Equally, we on this side of the House would like to see the scope of the C.D.C. very much extended in the newly independent countries of the Commonwealth, and we should also like to see an extension in the character of the operations which it undertakes. It is a pity that the Government originally watered down so much the recommendation of the Sinclair Committee which would have encouraged


the Corporation to undertake much more risky developments in the new countries. To have had an equity type of financial arrangement, would have been more suitable. There is a great need for this kind of development to be undertaken by the C.D.C.<br/>
Some hon. Members opposite chided my right hon. Friend a little for the fact that as one of the initiators of this Corporation he encouraged it in new ventures, some of which in the end were not successful. It was inevitable at that stage. There were bound to be great difficulties. But it is unfortunate that the C.D.C. now plays so financially safe. I do not think that it is the Corporation's fault. I think that it is the Government's responsibility to give it the kind of financial framework which will allow it to do this kind of thing.<br/>
The hon. Member for Harborough (Mr. Farr) rebuked my right hon. Friend for having grandiose ideas about what the C.D.C. should go on to do. The hon. Gentleman said he was very much afraid of this happening. Then the hon. Gentleman himself went on to urge on the Government that they should raise the capital authority of the Corporation from &#x00A3;130 million to &#x00A3;250 million. My right hon. Friend would never dream of being as grandiose as that. What my right hon. Friend was suggesting was something very much more modest and more cautious. I am sure that with the increased geographical scope of the Corporation under the Bill it is important that it should have an opportunity to increase gradually its financial resources to undertake that sort of work.<br/>
I should like to endorse very strongly the case made by my right hon. Friend that the Corporation should be enabled to operate, if asked to do so, in India, Pakistan and Ceylon. I thought that the arguments advanced by the hon. Member for Liverpool, Kirkdale (Mr. N. Pannell) about the situation in the Federal Republic of Cameroon, apart from their own force in relation to that situation there, underlined the case made by my right hon. Friend. It will surely be a rather anomalous situation that the Commonwealth Development Corporation will be enabled, as I believe it should be enabled, to give assistance in this development in the Cameroons, now a

foreign country, although it will be prevented by Statute from doing it inside a Commonwealth country. I hope that when we seek to bring this matter forward in Committee the Government by that time will have had time to consider the matter and will look at this proposal sympathetically.<br/>
My right hon. Friend said that one of the remarkable features of the C.D.C.'s operations was the amount of good will it engendered wherever it worked. I can confirm that this is true in what is now West Cameroon. It seemed to me that the work of the Cameroon Development Corporation under the auspices of the C.D.C. was perhaps the most important single thing that this country has done in that part of Africa.<br/>
I think that there would be very wide support for the plea made by the hon. Member for Kirkdale that any adjustments which finally have to be made in the preference on bananas should take place sufficiently gradually to safeguard the welfare of the people of that part of the Cameroons, with whom we have been very closely associated over a very long time.<br/>
Another suggestion I want to put to the Government in connection with the extended operations of the C.D.C. is this. The Government should look to the staffing of our High Commissions in the Commonwealth countries in which the C.D.C. will now be able to begin new projects. Not only in relation to the C.D.C, but in relation to our aid policies generally, there is a good deal to be said for having on the staff of a High Commission in a developing country someone whom I suppose might be called a technical assistance attach&#x00E9;. It is important to have someone on the staff who is particularly qualified in the problems of economic and technical assistance and who can ensure that, as far as possible, expert consideration is given to the needs of the developing countries and that there is expert representation of those needs back here in London.<br/>
The hon. Member for Devon, North (Mr. Thorpe) made a plea for a bigger allocation of Commonwealth investment in the developing countries. I remind him that Canada has engaged in very substantial investment in the Warsak Dam in Pakistan. I very much agree with his point, but I think one should pay fair


tribute to what has been done by some of the other more developed Commonwealth countries.<br/>
I want to say a few words about the C.D. and W. proposals in the Bill. I was glad to hear from the Under-Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations that the fact that the Bill leaves out research funds in the amendments it makes does not mean that money will not go on being spent on research in the colonial territories. This is now to be undertaken by the D.T.C. presumably under its votes and without need for statutory provision.<br/>
I am puzzled about the general provisions of C.D. and W. in the Bill. The Under-Secretary said that what was being proposed was a three-year extension of C.D. and W. According to my calculations, what is being proposed is only a two-year extension, and instead of ending in 1964 it will end in 1966.</p>

<p>I understood that, but the practical effect of the Bill is to put forward a two-year extension in the operation of the C.D. and W. arrangements. This is the first time, certainly for many years, that such a limited extension has been proposed. Normally the extensions have been for five years, and I think that we need a more adequate explanation than we have had from the Government why it is for only two years in this case instead of for the normal four- or five-year period ahead. The Minister assured us, so I gathered, that there is no intention of bringing these funds to a close. I think that we need some indication why the Government have suddenly chosen to do this on a shorter term basis than on the longer term basis which has been the usual thing.<br/>
I would remind the Minister that one of the reasons for doing this on a five-year basis under previous Acts was that the colonial territories were supposed to operate development plans on a five-year basis. What are they going to do now when in fact they can only look to March, 1966?<br/>
Like the hon. Member for Harborough, I want to find out why the annual loan sanction is being reduced from &#x00A3;25 million

to &#x00A3;20 million. Is this because it is assumed that there will now be fewer territories entitled to these loans and therefore we can drop the annual ceiling? It looks to me from the figures that for the extra two years there will be only an extra &#x00A3;5 million in total loan sanction as against &#x00A3;40 million which has been the normal annual increase allowable. This seems a very substantial drop, even allowing for the fact that the number of colonial territories during these two years is likely to be less than it is at present. The needs of these territories are particularly great because so many of them are grant-aided territories. My hon. Friend the Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) emphasised the educational needs. These are only one of many needs that affect these territories.<br/>
The grant-aided territories are in a specially difficult and complex position in relation to C.D. and W. grants. As I understand it, in the past the Treasury have been very unwilling to give consent to C.D. and W. grants which would not be self-financing by the end of the normal five-year period because at that point it would mean an increase in the grant in aid. I gather that the Colonial Office in its ingenuity has got round this in the past by giving the Colonial Territories an assurance that they will in fact go on under C.D. and W. getting the necessary financial assistance required to meet deficits on current expenditure. What will happen about this if we have now only a two-year period ahead of us?<br/>
I think that another thing that we ought to do is to take rather a fresh look at the whole operation of C.D. and W. grants and loans in relation to the changed nature and much smaller number of Colonial Territories.<br/>
I hope that the Government will say that the shorter period will be used to take a fresh look at this method of giving economic assistance. As the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies knows, I am as much in favour of assistance being on as generous a scale as possible as anybody else, and I am wholly against a reduction in the number of Colonial Territories meaning a commensurate reduction in the financial help given. Looking at the financial help given to Colonial Territories over recent years and comparing one with


the other, one finds some very odd figures. If we look at the amount of help per head of the population given to different Colonial Territories we find that British Guiana, for some reason, has been receiving tree times as much per head as other Caribbean territories. British Guiana is as under-developed a colonial territory as one could find, but it is no more under-developed than Dominica or one or two other West Indian Islands.<br/>
Malta receives four times as much per head of the population as the British West Indies as a whole. As the Under-secretary knows, the West Indians at the moment are feeling rather aggrieved that Malta seems to be receiving special concessions in connection with Commonwealth immigration which are not given to West Indian territories. If they began to look more closely at these figures they might be even more disturbed.<br/>
The Malta figures are extremely interesting. Nobody grudges economic help to Malta, but in the years before Nigeria became independent Malta was receiving 150 times more aid per head of the population than that great West African country. The odd thing is that Malta, with a population of 300,000 was receiving more total aid in those years than Nigeria was receiving altogether.<br/>
I am as guilty as anyone in the House of pressing for help for particular territories, and I am not arguing that there are not in some cases good reasons for the distribution of aid having substantial variations, but over the years a pattern has been established gradually which is not necessarily relevant to changing circumstances. All I argue is that the Government should begin to give some attention to the way in which the pattern of Colonial assistance falls in the remaining dependent territories.<br/>
I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Anglesey (Mr. C. Hughes) is absolutely right that as the number of dependent territories shrinks it is tremendously important that some of the smaller territories, very often forgotten and overshadowed by events in other parts of the Commonwealth, should begin to receive more attention and concern from the House of Commons than they have received in the past. My hon. Friend the

Member for Anglesey could well be called the hon. Member for St. Helena. That small island has good reason to be grateful to him for the continued concern which he has shown in the House for its needs since he visited it a number of years ago.<br/>
We on this side of the House welcome the main features of the Bill. The Under-secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations called it a hybrid Bill. I am inclined to call it in some ways a hotchpotch Bill. While we like the main proposal in it we do not believe that the proposals relating to C.D. and W. are any substitute for a fresh and radical look at the level of our economic assistance to countries of the Commonwealth, both independent and dependent.</p>

<p>I know that most hon. Members present would agree with me that this is perhaps the most important piece of Commonwealth legislation, certainly for the Colonies, that we shall consider here during the next two or three years, because upon it depends the financial aid, apart from grant-in-aid of administration, for the economic development of these territories for the next three years. Some of the colonial territories depend absolutely upon this Bill for any aid which they will receive and they do not get aid from any other source. It is, therefore, an immensely important piece of legislation for those territories for many years ahead.<br/>
I could have wished, like the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. G. M. Thomson) that the total for which the Bill provides could have been double or treble the figure which I have now to recommend to the House, but I think that we must recognise the difficulties of Treasury Ministers, and also the difficulties of the British taxpayer who has to pay these bills in the end. We are all very much inclined to ask for more and more money for the things in which we are interested, and tonight we here are all interested in the Commonwealth, and feel deeply and sincerely about it. But there are other people who are interested in roads, housing, hospitals, and so on, and we cannot go on asking for everything and, at the same time, hope for lower taxation. So I think that I must repeat that argument in fairness to the Treasury.<br/>
I should also like to say how grateful I am to my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House who, in this very crowded period of the Session, has found time for this Bill&#x2014;even a little late in the evening&#x2014;because it is important, quite apart from the C.D.C. aspect, which is mostly what we have been considering tonight. I was very anxious to take the Bill in this Session so as to give the Colonial Territories the advance authority which they must have to be able to plan their development programmes ahead. That is, as my hon. Friend explained, the reason for the overlap between the Bill and the end of the 1959 to 1964 C.D. and W. legislation.<br/>
I was very glad of the welcome given to the new C.D.C. part of the Bill, and I would say to the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Strachey) that some of us, including my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations and myself, pressed very hard for this, too, when we were on the back benches. We are very glad that we have been here to see the fruition of the project. I am very grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for his tribute to the C.D.C. I noted his criticism and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Harborough (Mr. Farr) that the C.D.C. does not have enough money.<br/>
I do not really agree with my hon. Friend's economics when he says that if we revolve a 6d. and make it do its work over and over again it remains only a 6d. in the effect it produces. I do not think that this can be right. That is one of my arguments, in fact, that a steadily increasing part of the C.D.C. investment nowadays is financed by its own funds. We still have a good margin. I think that my hon. Friend mentioned it in opening the debate. At the end of 1962 the total outstanding Treasury advances amounted to &#x00A3;92 million. So there is a good margin for new borrowings at present, and the C.D.C. Report does bring out this trend, to which I referred, of greater self-sufficiency in financing.</p>

<p>I must have got that wrong. It must have been my hon. Friend the Member for Harborough. I am sorry if I associated the right hon. Gentleman with that point.<br/>
I do not take all the credit to which the right hon. Gentleman referred when speaking of the Government's excellent record over the C.D.C, but it is the Government who appointed the men who run it so well, and I think that we must have a little credit for that. It is a trend started under Lord Reith's chairmanship and developed under his successor, Lord Howick. We must congratulate the Corporation because over the last three years it has produced investment sums of &#x00A3;5 million a year from sources other than the Exchequer, and there is every reason to suppose that that level will be maintained or even increased in the future.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman&#x2014;and, I think that the hon. Member for Devon, North (Mr. Thorpe) made the same point&#x2014;spoke of the C.D.C's partners in the territories. It does not finance every project unaided, and that means that its money goes further than it would if it had to find everything for every scheme. As my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State said, when a project is operating successfully and does not need any further help, it is often possible to sell it.<br/>
We have had many examples of this in Nigeria, with a fishing company in Tristan da Cunha, and with a fruit company in British Honduras. There has been a very recent example in Malaya, where the Malaya Borneo Building Society has operated so efficiently that the C.D.C., in response to local demand, is now able to market locally no less than &#x00A3;600,000 worth of its shares in the society. This, of course, makes the proceeds available for re-investment in another project. It is a very good trend, and it is making more money available from sources other than the Exchequer all the time.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman drew attention to the fact that the C.D.C. does not operate throughout the whole Commonwealth, and he mentioned particularly the under-developed countries not covered by the Bill, India, Pakistan and Ceylon. This is an interesting point which has not been mentioned before. We felt it best to restore to the Corporation the power to invest in the countries where


it originally had operated, and this was the sort of scheme on which we worked. In itself, it will, I think, give the Corporation a very big new task and large new fields in which to operate.<br/>
I do not know whether it would wish to take on, in addition, such a large field as the whole of the Indian sub-continent. It may already act as managing agent and perform this kind of advisory function in any independent Commonwealth country, including India and Pakistan, so that its specialised experience and advice is available to all those countries. I can have a word with the chairman on this matter, but it has not, I believe, been seriously considered hitherto that we should do more than extend its operations to the countries where the Corporation operated originally in 1948 when the first Act was introduced.<br/>
The hon. Member for Devon, North spoke of the desirability of other great Commonwealth countries helping us in this excellent work. I am very keen on this and I should be delighted if some of the great Commonwealth countries would join more fully with us at the giving end. Many of them do a great deal, but I hope that some of them will read what the hon. Gentleman said.<br/>
The hon. Member referred also to the question of the tying of grants. Colonial development and welfare is, of course, tied to a certain extent nowadays, and I think that that is probably right. Most aid-providing countries do tie their loans and grants, and this in itself handicaps British suppliers. I think it only fair to give our exporters some help in our own Commonwealth, and also, of course, there is the balance of payments aspect which we cannot overlook.</p>

<p>May I correct what is, perhaps, a misunderstanding? I was not really complaining about C.D. and W. I was merely praising the C.D.C. system under which there is no tying of capital and saying that I hoped that this would be allowed to continue.</p>

<p>I am grateful for that correction.<br/>
I should be glad if no country tied any of its aid at all. That is an objective towards which we should like to move.

But, in the interests of both our own producers and the balance of payments, I think that, while other countries tie, we have to do a certain amount of it. Even in colonial development and welfare&#x2014;I realise that the hon. Gentleman did not raise this point&#x2014;we only tie the imported element. All local services are, naturally, left to the territory.<br/>
I know about the Nandi Salient, but, if I may, I would rather not say anything about it tonight. Perhaps I may be allowed to write to the hon. Gentleman, or speak to him about it very soon. I am not quite ready to say anything now, if he will forgive me.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Kirkdale (Mr. N. Pannell) spoke about bananas in the Cameroons. I am rather worried about this. I thought that I had covered every point before I came into the Chamber, but I had not thought of this one. As my hon. Friend knows, no decision has yet been taken. The question of Commonwealth Preference does not properly arise under the Bill. I am sorry that I cannot say more about this tonight. I have carefully noted what my hon. Friend has said, but it is not a subject upon which I am well briefed. I know less about it than does my hon. Friend and for that reason I prefer not to make a fool of myself in front of him.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Harborough and the hon. Member for Dundee, East both referred to the amount of colonial development and welfare money. My hon. Friend answered it, I thought, in anticipation of the debate when he opened. Since the date of the last Act in 1959, nine territories have become independent, three more will do so in August, when Malaysia comes into existence, and others&#x2014;like Kenya, Zanzibar, Malta and, perhaps, British Guiana and the Little Seven in the Eastern Caribbean&#x2014;are likely to become independent during the life of this Act.<br/>
There is also the fact that research and technical assistance are now provided by the Department of Technical Co-operation and, therefore, are financed through other sources on the Vote of that Department. There is the further consideration, which was referred to in another context, that the Bill is to operate for three years


instead of five years. When these three factors are taken together, it is true to say that we are providing a good deal more money than we did under the 1959 Act. Not only is the proportion of grant to loan higher, which is important for the smaller territories, but the total represents an increase of 28 per cent. That is not at all bad. I am not ashamed of it and I hope that hon. Members will accept that this is a large increase for the territories.<br/>
The hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) spoke about books for schools. I am advised that quite a lot is being done under the cheap books scheme and under technical assistance schemes, both, of which are the concern of the Department of Technical Co-operation. I will certainly draw the hon. Member's remarks to the attention of my hon. Friend the Secretary for Technical Co-operation. I have no doubt that the C.D.C. will also note what he has said, but under its terms of reference the Corporation cannot give assistance direct to educational institutions. I will, however, draw attention to the hon. Member's comments about investing in schemes for the production of paper.</p>

<p>I am not familiar with that, but I will see that the point is raised.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Worcester (Mr. Walker), with whom I have great sympathy because I remember advocating it myself, referred to the multilateral scheme of insurance in the Commonwealth. That is now being considered by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Therefore, it cannot yet, I am glad to say, be classified among the list of lost causes.<br/>
My hon. Friend also complained of the total of British Government aid overseas. I was not sure about some of his figures. The latest estimates which I have for 1962&#x2013;63 give a total of &#x00A3;160 million of Government aid alone. We had expected the figure to be a good deal more, and if all the commitments which we had undertaken bad been drawn upon by overseas Governments, it would have been more. It frequently happens that they spend more slowly than they expect

and, therefore, they draw less aid in a year than we have provided for them.<br/>
It is difficult to say what will be the precise figure for 1963&#x2013;64, for the same reason that what we are committed to provide and what we shall be called upon to provide may in the result be different. It seems safe to say, however, that during the next three years the total of Government aid will probably range between &#x00A3;180 million and &#x00A3;220 million a year.<br/>
It is quite a big figure. My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Wirral (Mr. Selwyn Lloyd) when Chancellor of the Exchequer, put a ceiling of &#x00A3;180 million on overseas aid in July, 1962, and we have actually been below that amount up to now. But I hope we shall spend more&#x2014;considerably more&#x2014;in the next three years. That is a trend which I am sure, subject to the balance of payments, we all want to see encouraged.<br/>
The hon. Member for Anglesey (Mr. C. Hughes) mentioned the smaller territories. I am glad that he did so, because he takes so much interest in them. He also knows my own keen interest in them. I think that they will do quite well under the Bill. I have done my best for them. We have had long arguments about allocations to the smaller territories and I have been a very keen advocate of what he has said.<br/>
I hope that St. Helena, in particular, will not get a smaller territorial allocation, but it has not done too badly for a tiny island. It has had &#x00A3;635,000 in C.D. and W. assistance since the war, which is not bad in that context, as the hon. Member knows. But I am conscious that a great deal remains to be done and I promise him that I shall not forget St. Helena&#x2014;not that he will allow me to do so.<br/>
The hon. Member for Dundee, East seemed to think that the administration of these funds was too scattered. He suggested that we should in some way integrate C.D.C. and C.D. and W. funds into a more co-ordinated pattern. But they are two quite separate sources of finance, administered quite differently and intended for quite different purposes. The C.D.C. is purely for commercial purposes and is supposed to earn a return and break even. C.D. and W. is quite different. It is designed for social and not commercial purposes.</p>

<p>I was not arguing that they should be integrated. I suggested that it would be worth looking at the possibility of C.D.C. being allowed to act as agent for the use of some of the C.D. and W. funds.</p>

<p>I do no know whether it would be suitable to do that but I will ask about it. I am sorry that I misunderstood the point. The purposes of the two are so different that I am not sure this could be done, but perhaps they could well be combined financially. That has often been done. It does reduce the rate of interest if one has combined a C.D.C. and a C.D. and W. scheme for the same project.<br/>
The hon. Member also made what has become a stock criticism from the Opposition Front Bench, about one man doing two jobs, and he criticised if not my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State then, by implication, the Prime Minister for having combined these two posts. It is not for me to comment on that, but the hon. Member complained of the great delays which he claims this combination of jobs under one Secretary of State has caused.<br/>
There has been absolutely no delay in the case of the C.D.C. In fact, the extension of C.D.C. was the very first announcement my right hon. Friend made in July last year after he was given both posts. It was an instant decision that he took.</p>

<p>After dealing with places all over the world, we now return to our own country and to my own county, Yorkshire. I am raising this Adjournment debate tonight because I feel that the President of the Board of Trade and the Parliamentary Secretary should consider what kind of industry and diversity of industry and population are required in my area. I know that the President of the Board of Trade is either a very popular or unpopular man, and in this case, as far as I am concerned, he is unpopular. I am concerned because I believe that the right policies are not being put in hand.<br/>
The growth of industries because of their national importance matters locally as well as regionally. The Parliamentary Secretary knows why I am taking a special interest in the West Riding of Yorkshire. For generations we have had staple industries and we can boast that we have sustained the economy of the United Kingdom for a long time. At the moment, I believe, we are producing the biggest profits for the National Coal Board. Ours is a prolific coal field and employer-employee relationships are as good as any in the United Kingdom.<br/>
But for years there has been a drift of population to the South and South-East and the Midlands and one is bound to be concerned for a constituency like mine and others in Yorkshire. We claim to be a development district. We are not crying out "Action stations". We well understand and sympathise with the greater unemployment in the North-East and Scotland and parts of Wales and Lancashire.<br/>
The President of the Board of Trade has adopted a panic policy. He is trying to divert industry from Yorkshire to the development districts. If we are not asking for new industries, why should the President of the Board of Trade try to take away those that we have? The right hon. Gentleman has failed to take

cognisance of the arguments which have been put to him on this issue. He has dug his heels in and said that industry must be sent to the development districts. I do not disagree with that, but I believe that these industries should be sent from the South, from the South-East, and from the Midlands.<br/>
The pattern of industry in Yorkshire is changing. If we are at all forward-looking, I believe that we must plan not for the next year or two, but for the next fifteen or twenty years. The West Riding is the most populous part of Yorkshire, yet there are only two people per acre. Land commands a terrific price in the Midlands and the South, but this state of affairs could have been avoided if, ever since 1951, consideration had been given to ensuring that there was a proper diversification of population and industry.<br/>
Many towns in Yorkshire are losing their populations, among them Castle ford, Shipley, Mexborough, Sheffield, Halifax, York, Normanton, Barnsley and Wakefield. One has only to look at the figures issued by the Registrar General to realise this. We are not asking for new industries; we have developed our own industries, and yet the President of the Board of Trade is trying to take away our industries and send them to other parts of the country.<br/>
At present, 110,000 men are employed in the mining industry in Yorkshire. Does the Parliamentary Secretary realise that within the next five years 20 per cent. of our manpower will be unable to find employment in the mining industry? Although the mining population is going down, the production of coal is going up. I am pleased about this, but what will happen to the young men and boys who will be unable to obtain work in the mines? Not long ago the Parliamentary Secretary told me that the Coal Board was taking care of its redundancy problems. Within the next six years two collieries in my constituency will close. What will happen to the boys who leave school and are unable to find work in the area?<br/>
We have been told about opencast mining in the West Riding. Our countryside looks like a battlefield, and it has been like that since 1941. We therefore claim that we have a right


to receive some of these new growth industries, but the President of the Board of Trade says that these industries are ideal for the development districts.<br/>
The heavy woollen industry is facing heavy competition from other sources. In places like Morley, Batley and Dewsbury the Board of Trade should give consideration to the pattern of industry likely to develop over the next few years. If we look at the pattern of employment we find that for 1961, dealing in thousands, in London and the south-eastern district it was 5,120, whereas in the West Riding it was 1,225. The percentage increase for London and the South-East was 12 per cent.; in the West Riding it was negligible. All the regions mentioned in the "Regional Pattern of Industry" have a figure above that of the West Riding with the exception of Wales, Scotland and the northern region.<br/>
Why does the President of the Board of trade want to destroy viable industries in my county? I know that a new plastic industry has started from scratch and is being developed, but we have no electronics industry and will have no motor industry in Yorkshire now that it is closing down in Doncaster and going to the North-West. We are dependent on the traditional industries. We are afraid that sufficient consideration is not being given to what is likely to happen in the near future.<br/>
I was alarmed when I looked at the <i>District Bank Review,</i> which deals with some figures concerning the regions I have mentioned. This no doubt was after spending a terrific amounton research. It tells us that vehicles, engineering and electrical goods industries are situated in the South and the Midlands. In the East and West Riding, Northern Scotland and the northern region they are put down as negligible. I claim that in the coal zone alone in the West Riding 30,000 females are prepared to take jobs if they could be made available. I can give figures concerning Pontefract, Castleford, Barnsley, Rotherham and other areas, If the Parliamentary Secretary is interested I shall be willing to supply him with details.<br/>
I shall not be acrimonious. I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary will not disagree that I am trying to fight

for something which is important to the well-being of the West Riding. It is time that real consideration and planning were given to this matter, not that panic action should be taken just because there has been a rapid increase in unemployment in certain parts of the country. By all means those places must be helped. There is nothing more demoralising than unemployment. I realise this and I also realise that if more consideration were given to proper planning it would be seen that the kind of growth industries to which I have referred should be allowed more or less equally to spread throughout the country instead of being allowed to collect in one or two parts.<br/>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept the points I have put forward and encourage our industries as much as possible. At least the Minister has no right to upset industries where employers and employees work well together and where the industries are viable. He has no right to tell such people that they must go elsewhere. My challenge to him is that he must give this consideration. I am not concerned only with the present but with the future. When applications are made for I.D.C.s, the President of the Board of Trade and the Parliamentary Secretary should say to our own industries, "You are doing a good job and we will put nothing in the way to prevent your progress."</p>

<p>The employment pattern in Yorkshire is rather similar to that which occurred recently in the North-East. May I draw attention to the figures given only two days ago in the House? The north-eastern unemployment figure was 5 per cent. At that time, two days ago, the unemployment figure in a black spot in my constituency, Thorne, was 6&#x00B7;6 per cent. The national average is 2&#x00B7;4 per cent.<br/>
I appeal to the Minister to do something along the lines suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton (Mr. A. Roberts) in recognising the changing pattern of industry in Yorkshire, taking account of the diversity of industry there and making some effort to deal with a black spot such as Thorne and to a lesser extent, Goole, by encouraging new industry to go there, or if that cannot be done, by giving en-


couragement and assistance to existing smaller industries, so that they may be able to expand and to provide the local unemployed people with the work which they are anxious to do.<br/>
A little while ago, on one of the 15 occasions that I have raised local unemployment in the House this year, I was told by the President of the Board of Trade and the Minister of Labour that the unemployed of Thorne could go a dozen miles away to Doncaster where there were better opportunities of finding work. The latest report of the local employment committee says:
<q>There are very few openings in Doncaster and little improvement is to be expected there.</q>
In the light of that, I should like the Minister to review the consideration which was given to the local position a little while ago, when my Question was answered, and to see whether anything can be done, either separately in Thorne and Goole or by combining the two into a development district and dealing with them as a concerted whole.<br/>
Recently, special consideration was given to shipbuilding in the North-East. We can do shipbuilding in Goole and Thorne; it is done, but far too little, and far too many would-be shipbuilders are unemployed. I can devote only a moment or two to this issue, by courtesy of the hon. Member, and I want to give him time for a full reply, but I hope that he will give Thorne and Goole special consideration in the same way as it was given to the North-East.</p>

<p>I very much welcome the opportunity to reply to some of the arguments advanced by the hon. Members for Normanton (Mr. A. Roberts) and Goole (Mr. Jeger).<br/>
The hon. Member for Normanton gave us notice that the Adjournment debate would embrace the vast subject of industrial development in the whole of Yorkshire. Although my own county, Hampshire, at cricket recently, disposed of Yorkshire in three days, I should not dare attempt to discuss the industrial problems of Yorkshire in 10 minutes, and I shall confine my remarks to the West Riding and particularly to that part of it in the neighbourhood of Normanton.<br/>
Even with this attempt to limit the subject, it is obviously quite impossible to do justice to it in the time available or, indeed, to answer all the hon. Member's questions.<br/>
The hon. Member complained that in the Board of Trade we are unreasonable in refusing industrial development certificates for projects in the West Riding and that we are depriving Yorkshire of its own industry by steering the expansion of local firms to other parts of the country. He and I have discussed these matters together on a number of occasions, and if I have not so far convinced him of the rightness of our policies, I hope that I shall be able to do so tonight.<br/>
In terms of actual unemployment, the West Riding has few problems compared with the less favoured parts of the country. I recognise, and will make reference to, the particular problems of Goole in a moment. I will give the House some recent comparative figures on unemployment to illustrate this. In the West Riding in May, 1963, the average rate of workers wholly unemployed was 1&#x00B7;6 per cent., compared with a national average of 2&#x00B7;3 per cent. and with rates in the North-East of 4&#x00B7;7 per cent., in Scotland of 4&#x00B7;5 per cent., on Lower Merseyside of 5&#x00B7;7 per cent., and in Ireland of 7&#x00B7;8 per cent. These are our major problem areas, and I am sure that the House would agree that they must have the first call on new industrial projects.<br/>
I have great sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's suggestion that we should think these things fifteen or twenty years ahead. I agree that that is a very good thing if one can do it, but one must give the priority where the unemployment actually is now and not where it might be fifteen years ahead. Any hon. Member who found himself in my position would make the same priority.<br/>
I realise that the West Riding is a large area and that the average figure may hide local problems. Let me break down my general proposition in some detail. In the main industrial centres of the West Riding, with their well diversified industrial structures, the rates in May were as follows. The House will forgive me if I reel off some figures quickly: Bradford, 1&#x00B7;7 per cent.; Barnsley, 2&#x00B7;5 per cent.; Doncaster, 2&#x00B7;3 per cent.; Halifax, 1&#x00B7;2 per cent.; Huddersfield, 0&#x00B7;9 per cent.;


Leeds, 1&#x00B7;4 per cent.; Rotherham, 2&#x00B7;1 per cent.; Sheffield, 1&#x00B7;7 per cent., and Wakefield, 1&#x00B7;2 per cent. Nevertheless, we realise that the West Riding has its industrial and its social problems.</p>

<p>I will deal with Thorne separately.<br/>
The labour force of the two traditional industries&#x2014;coal and wool textiles&#x2014;has declined over the last decade. We recognise that. But this fall in employment has not caused any significant rise in unemployment generally. Therefore, we are entitled to assume that people coming out of lost jobs have been absorbed by the prosperous and often newer industries of the main industrial centres&#x2014;the hon. Member for Goole (Mr. Jeger) will notice the phrase "main industrial centres"&#x2014;which I have just listed. Nor should there be any likelihood of serious unemployment arising in future.<br/>
Now, coal. The Yorkshire coalfield, as the hon. Member for Normanton has rightly observed, is an efficient and very profitable one, the largest in the country in terms of employment, the second largest in terms of output. It presents no major problems or major difficulties of redundancies arising from closures. Indeed, it is a receiving area for manpower displaced by closures elsewhere in the country. Lord Robens has spoken recently of the brighter future ahead for the coal industry, and I think that we are entitled to assume that the future of the Yorkshire coalfield seems assured for a number of years to come. I say a number of years because in all these extractive industries it is very difficult to speculate when we get on to the hon. Gentleman's 15- to 20-year cycle.<br/>
The wool textile industry, which to many of us is almost synonymous with the words "the West Riding", is Britain's sixth largest exporter whose annual sales abroad consistently reach between &#x00A3;140 million and &#x00A3;150 million. It is true that the production of the wool textile industry was slightly lower in 1962 than in the two previous years, but this year all the signs to date are upwards. In the longer term, the industry should be able at least to maintain its position and to improve its productivity. It is true that this may well be achieved with a continuing slow decline in employment.

I want hon. Members to know that we are aware of this.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned the question of jobs for women. Another problem in the West Riding, which again we recognise, is the shortage of jobs for women and girls, particularly in the smaller towns. We know, too, that thousands of women and girls have to travel long distances to work daily to get to the major industrial centres. For this reason, we have welcomed&#x2014;I ask the hon. Gentleman to recognise this&#x2014;the introduction of female employing industry, and I can assure the House tonight that we shall continue to take a favourable view of new projects in the West Riding where labour is predominantly female.<br/>
There was the question, too&#x2014;the presence and voice of the hon. Member for Goole tonight draws our attention particularly to it&#x2014;of pockets of unemployment within the general picture which I have presented to the House. We recognise that pockets of comparatively high unemployment exist in places such as Thorne, which I think is the most serious one, Maltby, the Hemsworth group of employment exchanges, and the Mexborough group.<br/>
These are mainly comparatively small places within travel-to-work distance of larger and more prosperous centres of employment, but we realise that such towns have a need for suitable new industry. I also recognise that the hon. Member's problem in Thorne is probably the most serious of all I have mentioned. In the time available I cannot give particular attention to it, but I should like him to know that we are aware of it and I should be happy to discuss it with him some time in the near future.<br/>
The House knows that, subject to the overriding needs of the development districts, we are prepared to approve suitable developments in these places. We do and shall continue to keep a careful watch on them, but any development must be related to available labour. If the shortage is of work for females it is no good encouraging heavy industry to set up in a town, and conversely.<br/>
The hon. Member has said that we have encouraged West Riding firms to move away to other parts of the country. It is true that some West Riding firms have established factories in Northern


Ireland, in the North-East and in Scotland, for example, Jeremiah Ambler, of Bradford, and Hepworth and Grandage, of Bradford. It is not unreasonable to expect expanding firms in these prosperous towns to make some contribution towards our distribution of industry policy. The moves made by these firms have, of course, been to their own advantage by providing them with ample supplies of labour compared to the labour problems which many of them faced in the West Riding, as well as being to the advantage of the areas to which they have moved.<br/>
We must hope and expect that such movements of expanding Yorkshire industry to areas of greater need will continue. It is only by such means that the problem of the development districts can be solved. I am sure that the House would agree that it would be scarcely reasonable to demand that the Midlands and London could or should supply all the expansion that is needed for the development districts. On the other hand, even in these prosperous areas we have approved local-based expansion which could not be expected to move elsewhere and we have welcomed reasonable new developments in places where there is a special need.<br/>
To put the hon. Member's complaints into perspective, the House may be interested to have information about the issue of industrial development certificates for Yorkshire in the period from 1st January, 1960, to 31st May, 1963. In that period we have refused industrial development certificates in only 13 cases in the West Riding and in three of these cases approval was subsequently granted. In the same period we have issued 736 certificates for the West Riding. The jobs arising from these certificates represented about 0&#x00B7;8 per cent. of the estimated working population of the West Riding in 1962.<br/>
Within the hon. Member's constituency, we know of the forthcoming closure of the "West Riding" Colliery and of the British Railways depot and sidings, but we understand that the workers in both cases will be offered suitable employment near at hand and that in neither case are redundancies likely. Employ-

ment in the new colliery at Kellingley, not far from Normanton, will probably build up, I understand, to as much as 2,400 by about 1966. The completion of the Sheffield-Leeds motorway, which will make the West Riding quickly accessible from other major industrial areas, will be of great significance to West Riding industrial development. My right hon. Friend the Minister of Transport has told the House that he hopes that preparation of the Don Viaduct, and some substantial part of the road works, could be completed in readiness to start construction in the financial year 1964&#x2013;65.<br/>
While the need for new jobs in the West Riding cannot be compared with the need in the development districts, we realise that there is a big need for improvement in and renewal of the social infrastructure. In some places this need is comparable with that of the older industrial areas which form so much of our development districts. Thus I acknowledge, and my colleagues in the Government do, that the West Riding generally is an area where for a long time there have been problems of slum clearance and redevelopment, and, while much has been done, much still needs to be done, and my right hon. Friend the Minister of Housing and Local Government is determined it shall be done.<br/>
Therefore, I would say, in conclusion, that the solution of the problems of the West Riding lies not in a change of our general policy towards the issue of industrial development certificates, which I hope I have shown hon. Members is rather more reasonable than the hon. Member for Normanton suggested, or in a change of our policy of steering new industry wherever possible to development districts. The solution will lie in the general upturn of the economy which will result in a higher level of activity of firms in the West Riding generally as in firms throughout the country.<br/>
This, I believe, is beginning to take place, steadily but surely, on the basis of expansion without inflation rather than on a basis of boom and bust.</p>
