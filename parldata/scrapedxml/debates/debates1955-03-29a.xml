<p>Things certainly seem to have taken a friendly turn lately. I have never departed in any way from my view that a top-level meeting without agenda might be a hopeful manner of approaching the solution to these world problems. It might be helpful to have the wish and the will expressed from the summit and the agreements of heads of Governments recorded in broad and simple terms if any can be reached. These can then be studied and implemented on the official level.<br/>
This procedure, like all others, may fail to reach an agreement, but there might be a better chance of success if the initiative came from the summit. So far, however, the heads of Governments have not agreed to this method.<br/>
Meanwhile as my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary said in the House yesterday, nothing is excluded from our minds in the way of machinery to bring about the results we all require. In view of the recent statements by President Eisenhower, by the French Prime Minister and by Marshal Bulganin, we must not lose patience or courage.<br/>

Will he take steps to see that as few as possible of our markets in Australia are lost?</p>

<p>As the hon. Gentleman is probably aware, the present cuts are much less severe than those in 1952. He is also probably aware of the inter-Departmental inquiry that took place following the 1952 cuts, and of the subsequent report which tended to show that the difficulties in 1952 were not solely due to Australian import cuts.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page <b>14,</b> line 28, at the end, to insert:
<q>(7) Where a croft has, in consequence of the making of an order under subsection (1) of section seventeen of this Act or under subsection (5) of section twenty-one thereof, become vacant and has remained unlet for a period of six months beginning with the date on which the croft so became vacant, the Secretary of State shall, if the landlord, at any time within three months after the expiry of the period aforesaid, gives notice to the Secretary of State requiring him so to do, direct that the croft shall cease to be a croft and shall purchase the buildings on the croft.</q>
The Committee will remember that my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Argyll (Major McCallum), during the discussion in Standing Committee, raised


the question of compensation to a landlord who found that his croft was unlettable because of an action of the Crofters Commission. In my reply, I then pointed out that this contingency was a very remote one, and could happen only in certain circumstances, into which I shall not go at the moment, but I gave an undertaking to see whether anything should be done in this matter. On considering it, we feel that it is possible that a croft might, because of the action of the Commission, be found to be unlettable, in which case the landlord would have to pay compensation to an outgoing crofter who was dispossessed by the action of the Commission, without being in any way able to recoup himself, because the croft was unlettable.<br/>
The Amendment would enable the landlord to require the Secretary of State, in the circumstances envisaged, to declare that the croft shall cease to be a croft and to purchase the buildings upon it. This is in line with the taking over by the Secretary of State of buildings rendered redundant upon the reletting of the croft by the Commission under another Clause. I think it is a reasonable thing to do, and it puts this matter in line with what we are doing in another part of the Bill.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1955-03-29a.209.0" hansard_membership_id="4636" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/31212" speakername="Mr. Thomas Fraser" colnum="209" time="">
<p>I cannot see any need for the Amendment. It provides that when an order has been made under Clause 17 (1) and the croft becomes a vacant croft, the landlord may direct the Secretary of State to purchase the buildings on the croft, but under subsection (1) the Commission, in determining whether or not to make an order terminating the tenancy of an absentee crofter, has to take into account the question whether&#x2014;and I quote from Clause 17 (1, <i>b</i>)&#x2014;
<q> it is in the general interest of the crofting community in the district in which the croft is situate that the tenancy of the crofter should be terminated and the croft let to some other person or persons.</q>
If the tenancy of the absentee tenant has been terminated and the croft has been let to some other person or persons it is exceedingly difficult to see that the making of an order could put the landlord at such a disadvantage that he should be empowered to require the Secretary of State to purchase the buildings upon that croft.<br/>
I do not think that the Amendment fits into the Clause at all. I can well under-

stand subsection (6) of the Clause giving power to the landlord to require the Secretary of State to purchase the buildings, because the Commission has determined the croft to be a vacant croft and because the Commission has taken certain buildings from the land in the croft and has given the land to another croft to be worked as part of and for the enlargement of that other croft.<br/>
In the proposed new subsection there is no suggestion that the land has been severed from the croft or is to be worked as an enlargement of an adjacent croft. It is just because at some time the Commission has acted upon the provisions of Clause 17 (1), has declared a croft to be vacant and has provided for its being let to some other crofter. It is very wrong that, in those circumstances, the landlord should be enabled to direct the Secretary of State to purchase the buildings and the croft. He may well make it impossible for this croft land ever to be worked in future as part of a croft at all. Presumably, that would be running counter to the whole purpose of the Bill.<br/>
We think there has been no justification offered for putting forward the proposed new subsection. I hope that we shall have some justification offered for it, or a willingness on the part of the Government not to push it.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1955-03-29a.210.0" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. Soadden" colnum="210" time="">
<p>The hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. T. Fraser) will recall that I pointed out in Committee that the chances of this position happening were remote, in that the Commission, in the case of dispossessing an absentee crofter, would probably in nine cases out of ten be quite certain that it could re-let the croft before it dismissed the absentee. If the crofter were dispossessed under the good husbandry Clause the crofting Commission would be certain that it could re-let the croft. There is the remote contingency that after having done this, the Commission finds that the croft is unlettable. The landlord would then be confronted with paying compensation to the outgoing tenant.<br/>
The Amendment is a reasonable one to meet the case in which, because of the action of the Commission, a landlord becomes liable to pay compensation to an outgoing tenant while unable to re-let the croft, and I have no hesitation in asking the Committee to accept it.</p>

<p>I had doubts on this matter. I have now heard the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. T. Fraser) express his view that the proposed new subsection is not necessary. The Minister has pointed out that we are legislating for what is likely to be the very rare occasion that a croft, by reason of action of the Commission or the Secretary of State, has become unlettable and the landlord has to pay compensation to the outgoing tenant. He then finds himself with buildings with which he can do nothing. Such a case is likely to occur very rarely, but it is a matter of justice to the landlord that we should pass this Amendment.</p>

<q>and in carrying out their functions shall have regard to local circumstances and conditions.</q>
In Committee, the Opposition put down an Amendment to this subsection to insert:
<q> the requirements of local circumstances and conditions and the general requirements of the crofting counties of any part thereof and subject to.</q>
Hon. Gentlemen opposite will remember that after discussion of the Amendment I undertook to consider whether words could be inserted to meet at least some part of the Amendment. I said that we did not find ourselves able to accept the whole of it, for reasons which I gave with regard to its very wide application to the whole of the crofting counties. I said I would see whether we could accept the other part.<br/>
This we have done by putting down an Amendment requiring local circumstances and conditions to be taken into account. I am thus fulfilling the promise I made in Committee.</p>

<p>We are most grateful to the Joint Under-Secretary for giving effect to his promise, which is reported in col. 19 of the Report of the Scottish Standing Committee for 22nd February this year. We said that we would await what he was able to put on the Paper and decide whether to put something down. The hon. Gentleman has put this Amendment down, which, in fact, gives effect to the promise he made.<br/>
The view was expressed by many of my hon. Friends in the Committee that the whole Amendment that we then proposed was reasonable. We feel a little regret that the Minister has gone only half-way to meet us, but I imagine that we ought to be grateful for small mercies and must accept what we have now got.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 2, line 7, at the end, to insert:
<q>(4) The Commission shall include members with knowledge of crofting conditions and at least one member who can speak the Gaelic language.</q>
There was considerable discussion on this question in Committee. The Opposition put down this Amendment:
<q>(4) It shall be the duty of the Secretary of State in appointing the Commission to ensure that one or more of the members is a person who can speak the Gaelic language, that one or more of the members is a person who has practical experience of crofting and that a majority of the members have knowledge of crofting conditions.</q>
The Government indicated that they would accept that part of the Amendment which referred to the necessity to have a Gaelic speaker on the Commission. I gave that undertaking. We felt that it would make things rather difficult for the Secretary of State, and, in particular, for any future Secretary of State, if we went further and accepted the whole Opposition Amendment, because it would be tying and binding them in their future choice of members. After listening to the views expressed, I said that we had accepted the Gaelic speaker idea and would again look at the second part of the Amendment and consider how far we


could go to meet the arguments advanced by hon. Members opposite.<br/>
Every hon. Member will agree that, whoever the Secretary of State may be, the most important thing is that we should have the best people selected to be members of the Commission. On inquiry, I am informed that experience has shown that it is often unwise to lay down in a statute of this sort too strict or too elaborate qualifications. They could easily lead to difficulty after the initial appointments had been made. It is possibly quite a simple matter to fulfil certain qualifications initially&#x2014;when we are starting afresh&#x2014;but we do not want to go so far that we may so bind future Secretaries of State for Scotland as to prevent the best people being elected to the Commission.<br/>
For example, in the initial stages it may be possible to appoint a member to the Crofters Commission who has the best practical experience of crofting and who has a knowledge of the Gaelic language. That is quite possible. Looking a little further ahead, there may come a time when the Minister may have to replace that member on retirement and it may well be that the person whom he has in mind as best able to serve on the Commission could fulfil only one of the conditions laid down by statute. Therefore, although we are able to accept the principle of the Gaelic speaker, and have incorporated it in this Amendment, here again we have not been able to meet the Opposition entirely.<br/>
The Amendment takes this as far as we think it wise to go having regard to the duties that will fall upon any future Secretary of State when he re-appoints people. It recognises the importance of having on the Commission some members possessing a knowledge of crofting conditions. It also meets the views of the Committee in favour of including a member who can speak the Gaelic language. With that explanation, I hope that the House will accept the Amendment.</p>

<p>The Joint Under-Secretary of State for Scotland will not be surprised to learn that we are disappointed by the Government's response. I can scarcely imagine anyone on the Front Bench opposite who could have made such an answer with more reluctance than, I am sure, did the hon. Gentleman.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman is a practical farmer, who, quite apart from his Governmental capacity, has given great service to farming. He knows that this Commission is to take over the role of the agricultural executive committee for this very huge area. Would he suggest to his professional brethren in Perthshire or Stirlingshire that there should be an agricultural executive committee which had in its membership not one man having practical knowledge and experience of the industry? Of course he would not. He would not dare. Yes, despite arguments which were not seriously contested in Committee, he now says " I cannot do this." Why? Because he considered the difficulties of the Commission? Not at all. It is because he is concerned about the difficulties of a Secretary of State. That is certainly the wrong approach.<br/>
I do not want to be ungracious. The Joint Under-Secretary was anxious to meet us and brought an intimate knowledge of the situation to the Committee's service. I do not want to appear ungrateful. But now, not having seriously contested that aspect of the argument in Committee, the Government say, " We are sorry; we cannot do anything about it." It really is a disappointing reply and one that may seriously embarrass the Commission. The Commission cannot be thought to be best endowed for its work if it is without a man having practical experience of this localised, complex and highly peculiar industry.<br/>
Moreover, if there is not such a person necessarily and statutorily on the Commission, it will in some degree forfeit the confidence of the people to whom it must immediately appeal. It is all very well for the hon. Gentleman to say that it may turn out that such a person may be on the Commission. The crofters will not be looking at this in terms of what a benevolent Secretary of State may do for them. They will expect their reasonable demands to be met. In this case, those demands will not be met.<br/>
In Committee, we made three points&#x2014;I think all of equal worth. I would not say that the Government's concession is the least important, but the point from which the Under-Secretary of State has run away&#x2014;that of practical knowledge&#x2014;is certainly the most important. Perhaps,


also, we were not quite right in using in our Amendment the words:
<q>&#x2026;a person who can speak the Gaelic language&#x2026;</q>
I think we could have found a more facile phrase. In conversation we talk of a Gaelic speaker. I hope that this phrase will not be taken by a lawyer to mean that because a man writes the language he is disqualified. " Gaelic speaker " would be a better phrase.<br/>
I plead with the hon. Gentleman to consider whether, in the light of arguments which were not contested from the other side except by one hon. Gentleman, he cannot find an opportunity in another place to put right this omission. There will otherwise undoubtedly be a great deal of criticism from the people who will come under the r&#x00E9;gime of the Commission.</p>

<p>I do not quite understand the adamant disappointment of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Greenock (Mr. McNeil). I take it that it is to the omission of the word " practical " that he objects. Or does he object to all the members not having a knowledge of crofting?</p>

<p>I agree with the right hon. Gentleman that there should be members with a practical knowledge of crofting, but I do not believe that in this case a majority is really vitally necessary.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman mentioned agricultural executive committees, but the Crofters Commission will have powers far wider than the agricultural executive committees have ever had. It has many things to look into. For example, it can take over the powers of the landlord. I hope it was a slip on his part, but I am disappointed that the right hon. Gentleman did not acknowledge that both the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. N. McLean) and I put down an Amendment that there should be a Gaelic speaker.</p>

<p>I want to acknowledge my appreciation, and that of all people in the crofting communities, of the fact that the Government have seen fit to put down this Amendment. It will certainly mean a great deal to the people in the areas concerned, and it will facilitate the Commission in its work.</p>

<p>I take it that it is clear that, after this Bill has passed into law, the members of the agricultural executive committees will lose their authority in enforcing good husbandry on crofts, and that that authority will pass to the Commission. If that is so, it is important that the same standard shall be enforced by the Commission as has hitherto been enforced by the agricultural executive committees. There are many districts where one holding is a croft and the next one is not a croft. One will be under the Commission and the other will not.<br/>
May I take it that the Commission will probably use the same officers as the agricultural executive committees do now, so that there will be people with a practical knowledge applying the same standards as are set out in the Fourth Schedule to crofts and to holdings which are not crofts?</p>

<p>I should like to follow what has been said by the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Grimond), who put his finger on a point which the right hon. Member for Greenock (Mr. McNeil) overlooked. The right hon. Gentleman spoke about this vast area which the Crofters Commission is to look after. It will not look after that area. It will only look after the crofting areas in the crofting counties, which is a different matter. As the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland said, the powers of the agricultural executive committees and of the Crofters Commission are quite different; but surely, in matters of good husbandry, the same standards will be followed and possibly the same officers will be employed in watching the good husbandry of crofts and of neighbouring farms.<br/>
The other point I want to mention is this. If the Crofters Commission is composed of normal, intelligent people, and is set up by a normal, intelligent Secretary of State, surely it does not require to be laid down here that the members of the Commission shall have a practical knowledge, provided they have a knowledge of crofting.</p>

<p>A Gaelic speaker is a matter for one area only. A Gaelic speaker will not be of any assistance to the crofters in Orkney or Shetland. But we are anxious that there should be on the Commission one member who is able to speak the Gaelic language. I hope the House will accept this Amendment, which goes a long way to meet the objections which were raised in Committee.</p>

<p>I will not quarrel with the Minister about the Gaelic-speaking provision, because I think he has met us there. We say that one or more members should be able to speak the Gaelic language, and he says, in his Amendment, " at least one." I cannot imagine that ultimately it will remain at just one. The words " at least one " are perfectly satisfactory, and I have no quarrel with that part of the Amendment.<br/>
As I have indicated before, I do not admit that simply by including a Gaelic speaker on the Commission, the other conditions of our Amendment in Committee have been satisfied. Another Secretary of State, perhaps a less wise one, might appoint a distinguished Gaelic poet with no other qualifications at all, and certainly with no knowledge of crofting. Therefore, to satisfy the Gaelic-speaking condition does not necessarily satisfy the qualification regarding practical experience.<br/>
This qualification is vitally important. We need the most appropriate people on this Commission, people with the best knowledge of conditions in the areas concerned and with the best administrative experience. While we may differ about what section of the community these people should be drawn from&#x2014;such as schoolmasters, the professional classes, and so on&#x2014;nevertheless, we have agreed generally that the provision should be wide enough to enable the Secretary of

State to find the best people for the job. I am sure that we all agree that the best qualifications are those appropriate to the problems which have to be solved.<br/>
To ask that the Commission shall include persons with practical experience of crofting is not unreasonable. There is no provision in this Amendment for including those with practical experience of crofting, and I am afraid there will be disappointment among the crofting communities if this Amendment is accepted. I am sure that it would add prestige to the Commission and would in every way bring good will to that body in its work from the very beginning if we could all agree on the necessity for including persons with practical knowledge of crofting.<br/>
I have further criticism of the Amendment. Looking at it in conjunction with our Amendment in Committee, in which we asked that there should be a majority of members with knowledge of crofting conditions, in the Amendment under discussion there is no reference to a majority of such persons. To say
<q> shall include members with knowledge of crofting conditions </q>
does not in any way define the qualifications which we seek. We might have on the Commission two members with a knowledge of crofting conditions, however vague, and four members with no knowledge whatsoever.<br/>
We do not quarrel with the Gaelic-speaking part of this Amendment. " At least one " is satisfactory. We feel, however, that the Commission would be weakened considerably if it did not include members with a practical knowledge of crofting and a majority, at any rate, with a knowledge of crofting conditions. I do not mean that a member should have had an ancestor who owned a croft a hundred years ago. At least one person should have a practical knowledge of crofting and the majority should have a really good knowledge of crofting conditions. These conditions are not in this Amendment, and I am sorry that the right hon. Gentleman has not seen fit to strengthen it.</p>

<p>I reinforce the plea made by my hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles (Mr. M. MacMillan) because that was the aspect with which I was primarily con-


cerned during the Committee stage, namely, that a majority of the members of the Commission should have some knowledge of crofting conditions.<br/>
The Government's Amendment is a rather strange one. It provides that the Commission shall include members with knowledge of crofting conditions. Surely it is not expected that the Government would appoint a Commission with no members who had knowledge of crofting conditions. Therefore, why include such words? They seem to me to be meaningless. I should have thought that at least a majority of the members should have some knowledge of crofting conditions.<br/>
We have been told that the Commission will deal with a vast range of subjects. The subjects are all related to crofting. No matter what the subject is, the Commission will be dealing with it only in so far as it affects crofting areas. Surely, to understand any problem, no matter whether it is one very closely associated with cultivation of the croft or remote from the actual cultivation, it has to be taken into consideration in terms of the crofting community. I should have thought that even when dealing with the wider problems it was necessary to have knowledge of crofting conditions.<br/>
The Government ought to look at their Amendment again, when the Bill goes to another place, and try to make the composition of the Commission a little clearer. The first part of the Amendment seems to be meaningless unless it is assumed that the Government would appoint a Commission with no one on it having knowledge of crofting conditions. There ought to be a positive provision that someone shall have practical experience of crofting.<br/>
As my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenock (Mr. McNeil) pointed out, that is important in view of the obligations resting on the Commission for the actual husbandry of the crofts and for other reasons. It is a very modest request that at least a majority of the members of a commission dealing with crofting should have some knowledge of crofting. I am surprised that the Government have not yielded on this point.</p>

<p>I am very pleased that the Government have decided to include a Gaelic speaker,

which should be very useful indeed when the Commission gets to work.<br/>
However, my faith is a little shaken in respect of what I anticipated the Commission would attempt when I consider what has happened to other parts of the Amendment put forward during the Committee stage. I am shocked that the Joint Under-Secretary, who has a vast knowledge of agriculture and conditions in the crofting counties, should coolly state that he does not think it necessary that even one person on the Commission should have a practical knowledge of crofting.<br/>
I am surprised at the acceptance of this by hon. Members opposite from the Highlands, for it is their responsibility more than it is mine. I have roots there and, naturally, I am concerned about it. The hon. and gallant Member for Argyll (Major McCallum) thought the members would have practical experience anyhow. Seemingly, the Government wish to guard against that. The statement by the Joint Under-Secretary conveyed to me that no working crofter would be on the Commission. The Secretary of State has, apparently, made up his mind, and he must bear some responsibility&#x2014;</p>

<p>If the Secretary of State is as forthcoming as that, then I am sorry.<br/>
The position now is that if, in any of the Highland counties, there is a practical crofter who can attend meetings, talk intelligently and get on with five other people, he may be appointed to the Commission. I cannot imagine that the right hon. Gentleman will not be able to find suitable types of person still in the Highlands although we have exported many elsewhere who are now engaged in commerce, industry, medicine and other useful activities. I hope that as a result of


the Secretary of State's intervention we have a good chance of getting at least one such person on the Commission.<br/>
I feel that the wording proposed by the Secretary of State:
<q> The Commission shall include members with knowledge of crofting conditions&#x2026;.</q>
gives a wrong impression, as if such persons might be excluded. Why should the wording be in that form? Those interested in the matter would conclude from reading the reports of our deliberations in Committee that people who had a knowledge of crofting conditions would be included. I ask the Secretary of State to consider the picas which have been made about the appointment of persons with practical knowledge of crofting.</p>

<p>The answer to what has been said can be summed up briefly in this manner. The Secretary of State will do his very best to get a crofter, a man with practical experience, on the Commission. Such a man will not be excluded because he is a crofter. We shall do our very best to find the right type of person, but he will need to be the most suitable person. We want on the Commission the most suitable people.<br/>
In the Amendment we meet the point about a Gaelic speaker, but we do not want to bind the Secretary of State or future Secretaries of State. There may be available an extremely able practical man with a good knowledge of crofting conditions who is not necessarily a crofter. It would not be right to bind the Secretary of State and future Secretaries of State specifically to appoint a crofter. Others who are not necessarily crofters may be more suitable for the task. It would be unwise to go as far as has been suggested. We must leave future Secretaries of State free to do the best they can.<br/>
In setting up the Commission, on which the Bill hangs, my right hon. Friend will try to get the best and most practical men, men with a real knowledge of the crofting areas. No one need be afraid of that. If we can find a crofter for the Commission he will certainly be on it. We want to be sure, however, that he will be the best man.<br/>
The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Grimond) asked if it was a fact that the Commission would take

over the powers of the agricultural executive committees to dispossess for bad husbandry. He also asked whether it would be the same officers on whom the Commission would rely for advice. The answer is that the Commission does, in fact, receive such powers under the Bill. But I should like to make it clear that they are slightly different in that the standards of good or bad husbandry of the crofters take into account provisions that do not apply to the ordinary farmer. The standards will be slightly different because these are, in fact, part-time people.<br/>
Generally speaking, the officers who advise the A.E.C.s would be the same people, but not necessarily so in every case. It would depend on the particular circumstances. I hope that hon. Members opposite will realise that we are really out for the same thing which they are out for, but we do not want to fetter a future Minister by laying down in the statute that someone must be a crofter. in case it should be difficult to do this in making re-appointments.</p>

<p>That person, of course, would have been eligible if our advice had been taken, because we said that he had to be a person with practical experience of crofting.<br/>
There is no occupant of the Government Front Bench who would say that it would be wrong for Parliament to decide that the Crofters Commission, which has such authority in the crofting area, which


is to take over the functions of the agricultural executive committees in the crofting areas, which is to supervise good husbandry in the crofting areas, should be without one single person who has practical experience of crofting. No one would say that it should be without one person who has practical experience of crofting.<br/>
The Joint Under-Secretary has led us to believe that when the Commission is appointed it will contain at least one person who has practical experience of crofting. The hon. and gallant Member for Argyll (Major McCallum) said that we could all trust the Secretary of State. Let me put to him what he said in Committee. II: was this:
<q> We must ensure that whoever is appointed to the Commission must have knowledge of the subject with which the Commission is to deal, because, otherwise, I cannot see how the Commission is to work at all."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT. <i>Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 22nd February, 1955, c. 45.]</q>
If it is so necessary to have at least one person with practical knowledge of crofting conditions, surely Parliament not only has the right but the duty to say so in the Act of Parliament which provides for setting up the Commission.<br/>
If we do not say in the Act that there must be at least one person with practical experience of crofting, having regard to what the Joint Under-Secretary has said about binding a future Secretary of State, we are making it quite clear that a future Secretary of State will be free to choose six good men and true to serve on the Commission, not one of whom has any practical experience of crofting conditions.<br/>
These are the persons who are to supervise crofting. They are to see whether or not the crofter is cultivating his land according to the rules of good husbandry. They are the persons who are to deal with the absentee crofter, to deal with vacant crofts, and who are to enlarge existing crofts and take into account what is likely to be of benefit to the crofting area as a whole, without one single person among them with any practical experience of crofting. It is unthinkable that Parliament should give its blessing to the setting up of a Commission which did not contain one or more persons with practical experience of crofting<br/>
The closest analogy which we can get is an analogy with the agricultural executive

committee. Most of the agricultural executive committees are composed of people who, in the main, have knowledge and practical experience of agriculture. The agricultural industry would expect that to be so, mainly or wholly, but in most cases it could be said of the people serving on the committees that they are all knowledgeable of agriculture and all have practical experience of agriculture.<br/>
Those of us who are not in agriculture say that it is right that, with these great duties given to agricultural executive committees by statute, they should be composed mainly&#x2014;we do not say exclusively &#x2014;of persons with practical experience of agriculture. Why should the crofters not be so provided for in the statute, so that at least one person with practical experience and practical knowledge of their difficulties and their industry shall be a member of the Commission from which so much is expected?<br/>
If the Commission is to do the job which all of us expect it to do, it must surely have people with practical experience of crofting in its membership. Even the Taylor Commission, which was set up to make the inquiry, had among its members persons with practical experience of crofting. I am reminded that it was my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenock (Mr. McNeil) who set up the Taylor Commission. In any case, this Commission did not consist wholly&#x2014;one&#x2014;would not expect it to&#x2014;of persons of practical knowledge and experience of crofting conditions, but it had within its membership persons who were informed about crofting conditions and who could speak the language.<br/>
I am certain that the Taylor's Commission was more acceptable in the crofting districts, when it went round gathering evidence, because it had among its membership persons with knowledge of crofting conditions. I cannot believe that the Government take the view that the Commission which is to be set up by this Bill is calculated to win and hold the confidence of the crofters in the crofting areas if it does not have one or more of its members who are persons with experience in crofting.<br/>
The Joint Under-Secretary need not say that he will amend the Bill here and now. Let him tell us that between now and the Bill being considered in Committee in another place he will have another look


at it. He promised to consider this point in Committee between the Committee stage and the Report stage. He has told us that as a result of his further consideration he does not feel able to meet us and to provide that there shall be one or more persons with practical experience on the Commission. Let him now say that he will give this matter some further thought before the Bill reaches another place. Let it not go out to the crofters for whom we are legislating that we consider it would be fitting for the Crofters Commission to be set up without a crofter on it.</p>

Let me remind him that other Secretaries of State will not take the trouble to turn up the answer which has been made. If this is left as it is, they will be able to put just anyone on the Commission. I appeal to the Government to reconsider the position. We want to try to pass satisfactory legislation.

<p>No. not unless I am provoked.<br/>
Many of us would feel like going into the Lobby and voting against this Amendment were it not for the fact that the

concession about Gaelic speaking is involved. I ask the Secretary of State to make it easier for us by considering giving a further concession which we regard as right to be embodied in this part of the Bill, namely, to make sure that there will be a person with practical experience of crofting on the Commission, in terms of his own definition. Will the Secretary of State concede some form of wording which would bring in a person with practical experience of crofting? That person may be one who has been a crofter but is now a farmer, a schoolmaster, a lawyer, or a civil servant.</p>

<p>I assure the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. M. MacMillan) and those who have spoken on this stage of the Bill on this subject that since the Committee stage we have given very careful consideration to this point. I am, of course, quite willing to say that we will look at it again to see whether we can improve upon it in any way, but I would not be fair to hon. Members if I said I thought I could alter the wording which we now propose to insert in the Bill.<br/>
Although, as the House knows, I was not present during the Committee stage, I have read the Official Report of the proceedings of the Committee and I have it here. I am glad to say that I think we are now in agreement on the subject of the Gaelic-speaking member, but I am really nervous about fettering a future Secretary of State too much because the whole object must be to get the best men on the Commission. This Amendment does not exclude any working crofter or any man with practical experience of crofting.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Greenock (Mr. McNeil) has had experience of getting people to work on bodies like this. The Commission is a small body which will have important work to perform and it is vital to its success to get the right people on it. Not everyone whom one may want would be prepared to accept the job of sitting on a body such as this. I think the House would be well advised not to fetter whoever occupies the office I have the honour to occupy at present.<br/>
As I endeavoured to say in an interruption, we would welcome a man with practical experience on to the Commission. He would not be excluded; we would welcome more than one. But I


would rather not lay it down in an Act of Parliament that certain people with certain experience have got to be on a Commission such as this as it is not just a question of farming a croft. The Commission has to deal with much wider work and I think it very important that we should get the right persons for the job.<br/>
At the same time, I repeat that we will look at the matter again. I shall speak to my noble Friend who will be dealing with the matter in another place, and if we can devise any wording which we think will be more satisfactory to hon. Members opposite I shall not hesitate to adopt it.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 2, line 13, to leave out from " keep" to the end of line 19 and to insert:
<q>under general review all matters relating to crofts and crofting conditions, including, without prejudice to the foregoing generality, land

settlement, the improvement of land and livestock, the planting of trees, the supply of agricultural equipment and requisites, the marketing of agricultural produce, experimental work on crofting methods, the provision of demonstration crofts, the needs of the cofting communities for public services of all kinds, the provision of social amenities and the need for industries to provide supplementary occupations for crofters or work for their families; and to make such recommendations as they may think fit on any of the matters aforesaid.</q>
It will be recalled that the Opposition, in Committee, moved an Amendment to subsection (1) of Clause 2, which sets out the powers and duties of the Commission, adding the duty to make recommendations to the Secretary of State on all or any of 16 matters which were listed in a Schedule attached to the Amendment. The subjects covered in that Schedule were extensive and I do not think that the House would wish me to go over each item. We felt that the Clause as already amended met the intentions of the Opposition, but, in the light of very strong arguments, advanced from both sides of the Committee during our discussion, I undertook to reconsider whether it would be possible to meet the arguments that had been put forward.<br/>
The Amendment has given us considerable thought. At first, it seemed that it might be better to have a Schedule, but the later advice which I have received is that the best method is not to include a further Schedule, but that the more appropriate course is to put it in the Clause. In Committee, one hon. Member opposite used the expression " signpost " or " fingerpost," as pointing to something at the end of the Bill. We feel that it is much better to put these so-called teeth into the Bill in this Clause, which concerns the powers and duties of the Corn mission. We have done that and we indicate the matters which the Commission should keep under review and on which it should, as it thinks fit, make recommendations.<br/>
The Amendment substitutes a new paragraph <i>(a)</i> for the existing paragraphs <i>(a)</i> and <i>(b)</i>. The new paragraph covers the matters which were included in the proposed Schedule so far as they are appropriate for consideration by the Crofters Commission. If the Amendment is examined, it will be found that in some cases we have, in fact, strengthened what was proposed in Committee. We have


not only covered the matters that were proposed for the Schedule, but we have added other things.</p>

<p>We are indebted to the hon. Gentleman for the Amendment, which gives effect to a suggestion which we made in Committee. We put down an Amendment of a few words to the Clause and a Schedule at the end of the Bill. We are not ourselves competent to decide in which part of the Bill it is better to make the insertion. Before the Schedule appeared on the Order Paper originally, some of my hon. and hon. Friends had the whole thing written out for addition to the body of the Clause. Then we were advised that it would be tidier to do it in the form of a Schedule, so we did it in that way.<br/>
It matters little whether this provision is embodied in the Clause or is set out in a Schedule, with a signpost, to which the Joint Under-Secretary referred, in the Clause pointing to the Schedule. The important thing is that the Commission has now been given particular power in the Bill to do a lot of things which Parliament will be seen to have considered it desirable for the Commission to do.<br/>
It was at one time thought that the Commission could be trusted to do all those things without any signpost being put into the Bill. However, strong argument was advanced from both sides in favour of particularising many things upon which Parliament considered it necessary that the new Commission should focus attention. There might be argument whether, in some respects, the new proposals are stronger or less strong than the proposals contained in our Amendment in Committee, but, broadly speaking, the new Amendment does what the Opposition, in their Amendment, wanted.<br/>
It would be a waste of breath now to particularise too much and examine whether in relation to one service or another the hon. Gentleman's Amendment is stronger or less strong than our previous Amendment. I merely thank the Joint Under-Secretary for meeting us in the way he has done.</p>

There was considerable discussion on the Clause during the Committee stage, particularly as to whether any question of the validity of a bequest should ultimately be decided, if taken to court, by the Land Court or by the sheriff court. A Government Amendment was then introduced by the terms of which such a matter was to be remitted to the sheriff court or to the Court of Session.<br/>
On further consideration, we think that those words were not very appropriate. It is just conceivable that the will of the crofter might not be a Scottish will. It might conceivably be an English or Canadian will, or a will from a foreign country; and to meet that extremely unlikely eventuality, we propose the Amendment.<br/>
The House will notice also that in the Amendment we refer to
<q> the whole testamentary writings of the deceased crofter.</q>
The purpose of that is to ensure that the matter should go to a court of appropriate jurisdiction only when anything other than purely the croft itself is in issue.</p>

<p>The position is that the Land Court has been accustomed, since it was set up in 1911, to deal with a large number of matters, some of which were within the terms of the Act and within the Court's jurisdiction and others which it is arguable were outwith its jurisdiction, and it has been a great convenience that the Land Court should deal with those matters. It is perfectly arguable, certainly on the construction of the statute by the Land Court, that the Court is entitled to deal with the bequest of a croft, but it is much more doubtful whether it is entitled to deal with a will which bequeaths something over and above the croft.<br/>
If the Amendment is accepted, a testamentary disposition which includes something over and above the croft will have to be dealt with in a court of appropriate jurisdiction, which is not the Land Court. If the disposition deals only with a croft, the Land Court, subject to anyone disputing its jurisdiction in the matter&#x2014;which is unlikely at this date&#x2014;will continue to adjudicate. It has been very convenient to go to the Land Court for certain of these testamentary questions in the past, because it might well be that the parties were already in the Land Court because of other things such as the suitability of legatees. While the parties were having those matters considered, it was obviously desirable that the Land Court might consider other matters as well, but, as will be seen from Clause 10, the question of the suitability of legatees will be now considered by the Commission, and, therefore, the parties are not so likely to be in the Land Court in the future.</p>

<p>I take it that the Amendment bears out something which I said in the course of discussion on Recommittal, namely, that this presupposes that land which has hitherto been a croft will cease to be a croft because the Commission has declared the croft vacant under Clause 17 or has terminated the tenancy of an unsatisfactory tenant for bad husbandry under Clause 21. Therefore, in those circumstances, we shall find the Commission taking out of crofting husbandry land which has hitherto belonged to the croft. It is in those circumstances that buildings will be separated from the land. The Secretary of State will be required now to purchase buildings notwithstanding that he will have little use for them, since they are no longer going to be attached to the croft land.</p>

The House will remember that, when we discussed Clause 17 in Committee, the Opposition moved an Amendment inserting an additional condition which would have to be fulfilled before the Commission could terminate the tenancy of an absentee crofter. It was that the croft was not ordinarily cultivated by the crofter or a member of his family, with or without hired labour. The Opposition's general line of argument was that since the main purpose of providing power for the dispossession of absentee crofters was to ensure that the crofts were properly worked and that the tenants were people who took part in the life of the crofting community, the Commission should take account of the extent to which the croft was being worked and it should not have the power to terminate the tenancy where the crofter had made reasonable arrangements for a member of his family to work the croft on his behalf.<br/>
That argument was based on the formula that the general conditions of a crofting tenancy entitled a crofter to have the croft worked by himself or a member of his family. Anyone who pauses to think about this matter will see that there is a wide variety of cases to be considered. A crofter may be more or less a permanent resident abroad and have little intention of ever returning to this country, and it may well be that his brother is working the croft with no security of tenure at all. In such circumstances, it may be only right that the absentee

should be dispossessed and the brother who works the croft should have the croft.<br/>
The hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. M. MacMillan) drew attention to this question when he said:
<q> There have been some very hard cases where individuals have gone away and left the croft in the hands of somebody else who has cultivated it, and cultivated it well, and who then came back and dispossessed the genuine cultivator who lived on it."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 10th March, 1955, c. 262.]</q>
That is one case.</p>

<p>On the other hand, one has the case of a crofter who may well leave a township to earn his living somewhere else but, in doing that, may make a quite satisfactory arrangement for a relative to work the croft on his behalf, and the relative may be the crofter of an adjoining croft. Those are extreme cases. We know that in between there may be other cases. By and large, we feel that the right course here is to leave the decision to the discretion of the Commission. However, we agree that the points raised in Committee were of considerable importance, and we feel that the Commission should be given some guidance on this matter. The only possible way of doing that is that it should take these matters into account.</p>

<p>The Amendment provides that before making an order for dispossession of an absentee tenant the Commission shall take all circumstances into account. It is required to consider the extent to which the croft has been worked, and if the croft is being worked by a member of the absentee's family the Commission has further to consider the actual nature of the arrangements that have been made. I think we have in this way met the general point which was raised in Committee, and it is in the light of these considerations that the Commission will exercise its discretion.</p>

<p>The Joint Under-Secretary of State has shown that the Amendment covers most of the contingencies which my hon. Friend had in mind when another Amendment was discussed during the Committee stage. The difference between that Amendment and this one is that the present Amendment

gives direction to the Commission but leaves the Commission free to exercise its discretion as to whether it will terminate a tenancy; whereas the Amendment which my hon. Friends argued rather strongly during the Committee stage was calculated to provide that the Commission could not terminate the tenancy in certain circumstances.<br/>
For instance, it would not be free to terminate the tenancy if the croft was being reasonably well run by a member of the crofter's family who was living in the house, or if it was being well worked even by hired labour. My hon. Friends take the view that the tenancy ought not to be terminated unless the tenant of the croft is found to be guilty of bad husbandry; in short, that the main criterion should be whether the croft land was being worked properly.<br/>
I am sure my hon. Friends will agree that this Amendment, as explained by the Under-Secretary of State, will cover most of the contingencies we foresaw during the Committee stage. I suggest, however, that there might still be contingencies which will not be covered. I know that after I have mentioned these the hon. Gentleman may be able to say that they will be so rare that we need not provide for them. Yet the Government have provided by Amendments this afternoon for a contingency which they think will not arise, namely, that after a tenancy has been terminated under this Clause to make way for another person, the croft will still be vacant. They have provided, therefore, for a most exceptional contingency.<br/>
Dealing with the position of the members of the crofter's family, I myself argued during the Committee stage for the protection of the crofter who was necessarily absent from his croft house for a period in pursuit of his employment. I gave the example of an employee of the Forestry Commission. In this Bill we are asking Parliament to desire that afforestation in the crofting areas should be extended. The Forestry Commission may take a crofter into its employment because of this extension of activity in the crofting areas, and the crofter may go to another area, leaving his house perhaps for a period of years. If he leaves a member of the family in the house-his son or daughter, brother or sister, father or mother-whilst he is away


in employment with the Forestry Commission, and if that person is securing that the land is properly cultivated, we think that the new Commission should not terminate the tenancy of that man.<br/>
As the Amendment is drawn, I believe that the Commission would take into account the arrangement made between the tenant crofter and the member of his family. It may well be that it is better that the Commission should have discretionary power in this matter and should be free to take into account the arrangement under which a member of the family is cultivating a croft.<br/>
It may well be, as the Under-Secretary has said, that it would be better to terminate the tenancy of the now absent crofter and transfer it to the relative who is cultivating the croft, but I have in mind the contingency under which, having taken those things into account, the Commission would terminate the tenancy of a crofter, when a member of his family is cultivating the croft and living in the croft house under a most amicable arrangement with the tenant, and then the croft might be given to another less deserving application.<br/>
If we follow the contingency of the exceptional circumstances advocated during the discussion of an earlier Amendment, the croft may well be left vacant and the Secretary of State may be required by the landlord to purchase the buildings and the croft when all the time the tenant did not want to give up the tenancy at all and the croft land was being properly cultivated by a member of his family. It may be that that is a far-fetched contingency, but it is only a slight advance on the contingency mentioned by the Under-Secretary of State on an earlier Amendment.<br/>
I feel sure that the Government have gone a considerable way to meet us in the Amendment, although I am not altogether certain that they have gone far enough. Subject to what my hon. Friends say, I do not propose to oppose the Amendment.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1955-03-29a.237.0" hansard_membership_id="8754" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/17758" speakername="Mr. M. MacMillan" colnum="237" time="">
<p>I am somewhat in the same difficulty, in that I am not sure how far the Amendment has gone to meet the purposes of the Amendment which we moved in Committee. The Joint Under-Secretary quoted me not so much

against myself as against one part of an argument, for I think I was fair enough to put the two sides of the argument very carefully. The hon. Gentleman has taken a slight liberty in quoting one part against another with rather more force than that which I used myself in trying to be as impartial as I could. I forgive him for that, however, and I will not attempt to use the other part too forcefully against the part which he quoted, because to some extent I should be arguing against myself.<br/>
I visualise that a number of difficulties will still remain under the Amendment. I believe that in any case of dispossession, where a local sense of injustice exists, it is the most difficult place in the world to re-let the croft; and I am thinking of places like the Western Isles, in particular. There are loyalties even to the smalltime wrong-doer, if I may put it that way. The man who has been away but who is still regarded as a genuine crofter and who regards the croft as his home base will be forgiven many things if he genuinely wants to come home. Dispossession is regarded as a pretty rough thing, and it is still very difficult to find in the same village anybody who will take on the croft when someone else has been dispossessed and where a sense of injustice has been left behind.<br/>
That is the sort of thing, I know, which has to be left largely to the discretion of the Crofters Commission and we can only hope that it will have sufficient knowledge of the local conditions to deal with these cases, which I think the Joint Under-Secretary understands as well as I do, and a knowledge of what makes up the local feeling and public opinion in relation to crofting and the crofting way of life.<br/>
Where the difficulty arose, I think, for hon. Members who spoke critically from both sides of the House were the provisions of subsection (1, <i>a).</i> Where we have difficulties as Highland Members is particularly in trying to justify the distinction which was made, the apparent discrimination, against the crofter-absentee as compared with the farmer-absentee or the landlord absentee. That has still to be justified. If it is a case of bad husbandry, provision is made for it in the Bill, just as provision is made in the case of farmers, but this is not simply a case


of bad husbandry but also a case of absenteeism.<br/>
I know that the intention is to cover blatant absenteeism and neglect of the croft and of responsibility for the croft and its maintenance, but since cultivation and good husbandry are both covered elsewhere in the Bill in several ways, and since penalties are available under the good husbandry provision, it is difficult to justify the penal action here of virtual eviction and dispossession purely on the ground that a person has been away from what he or she still regards genuinely as the home base, especially as a crofter has to be away at times for the reasonable earning of his livelihood.<br/>
My right hon. Friend the Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn) made the point very well indeed in Committee when he explained that many crofters leave the croft to earn a living for a year or two, and perhaps longer, and that they are the very people to whom we owe a great deal, because they bring fresh capital into the crofting community which otherwise they could not provide from their own resources. My right hon. Friend made an extremely good point there.<br/>
As long as the crofter's family is resident on the croft and he is coming to and fro, provision is made for him. To that extent there is no change. It may be that he is a forestry worker, and again provision is made for him, even if he is away for a long period. But the moment he takes his family away with him, knowing that he is to be away for a fairly long period, the difficulty arises. Surely it is desirable in many cases that he should take his family with him. None of us could object to that. But the moment he does so his claim to residence and security of tenure as a crofter may well disappear. That, I think, worried hon. Members on both sides of the House when we were discussing the matter in another part of the building.<br/>
From that point of view, we are not yet covered. I know that a lot is left to the discretion of the Commission, and I argued elsewhere that we do not want to tie down the Commission in the greatest detail on every point. We have to give it considerable freedom, considerable elbow room. We have to assume

that the members will be intelligent people who will be able and anxious to work with local people and to some extent will fit into local conditions while trying to usurp local conditions for the greater purpose of improving crofting and the crofting way of life and making it generally more remunerative.<br/>
But we have these doubts, and there remains in the Bill the provision that a crofter must ordinarily be resident
<q> on, or within two miles of, the croft.</q>
We have not got away from that and it still remains a condition, subject to the discretion of the Commission, as one of the points which are mentioned in the Amendment.<br/>
We stressed that more attention should be given to good husbandry and cultivation&#x2014;that is all that is asked of every other cultivator, every farmer&#x2014;rather than to a man's physical presence on the croft or within two miles of it. On this side of the House, at least, we still feel that the important things are that the land should be kept in good heart and proper cultivation, not necessarily that the man should be resident
<q> on, or within two miles of, the croft.</q>
The Amendment is an excellent piece of draftsmanship, but I do not admit for a minute that it covers the point which we had in mind in our Amendment. I am sorry that it is not a good deal stronger, but I recognise that the Government can bring sufficient pressure to bear upon us in the counting of heads if we carry the matter into the Lobby. We will therefore not vote against the Amendment. I am grateful to the Under-Secretary and the Secretary of State for coming part of the way to meet us. The rest can only be left, and I hope and believe that ultimately it can safely be left, to the good sense and discretion of the Crofters Commission.</p>

<p>I hope that I will not abuse your patience, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, if I leave that topic and deal with another. This is a demand by the Government that the Commission must take account of an arrangement which a crofter may make by which a member or members of his family takes care of the croft. That is very reasonable, and anyone who understands that situation understands it to be reasonable. Our complaint is that it does


not take account of the whole length of the practice. An interesting point arises. If the crofter is entitled to do that, surely the crofter should be equally entitled to make arrangements about the habitation of his own house by members of his family.<br/>
That was the point I raised with the Lord Advocate during the Committee stage. He was kind enough to write to me, but it was not a very kind letter, saying:
<q>&#x2026;I undertook&#x2026;. to look into the question of sub-letting of crofts, which you had raised.</q>
<q>There is nothing to prevent a crofter from making arrangements to have members of his family staying with him, but, of course, he can only sub-let in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 5 of the Second Schedule.</q>
That was very decent of the Lord Advocate, but that was precisely the point about which we had been arguing. We have been trying to make the point that it was normal practice&#x2014;and in many cases a necessity&#x2014;that the crofter should have the right, without recourse to the landlord, to make such sub-letting arrangements in relation to his house on the croft for his family. I thought that the Lord Advocate would have admitted that necessity. Plainly, he is now in a peculiar position. Of course, the Government will tell the Commission to take account of the fact that it may be perfectly appropriate for a crofter to undertake that the care of the croft shall reside with a member of his family. But that same crofter will not have the right to say to that member of the family, " In taking care of my croft and maintaining the necessary standard of husbandry, you nevertheless cannot enjoy any part of my home."<br/>
It is obviously a <i>non sequitur,</i> and perhaps the Lord Advocate will undertake &#x2014;I shall be puzzled if he does not&#x2014;squarely to face my point, which is that if the crofter has the right to decide which member of his family will cultivate the croft, he must also have a right to see his house is sub-let in certain circumstances&#x2014;I hope in all circumstances&#x2014;to members of his family. We raised the point at some length in Committee of how in the case of bereavement, illness, domestic accidents, or of an ageing crofter, the best arrangement would be for the crofter to sub-let part of his house. I hope that the Lord Advocate will find it appropriate to reply to this point before we leave the Amendment.</p>

<p>May I add to the somewhat brief letter I wrote to the right hon. Gentleman? The position is that a crofter is entitled to sub-let to anybody with the leave of his landlord. That is one of the statutory conditions. I am not for the moment referring to summer visitors and the like. The condition of which we were thinking in the Amendment is the case where a member of the family has not got a sub-let from the crofter but has been acting on behalf of the crofter. The title to the croft is still in the crofter and there is a family arrangement between them which does not mean to sublet. A sub-let is different from a family arrangement, because in a sub-let the person with the sub-lease has certain legal rights as between the landlord and the tenant, and it is only right that the landlord should have an opportunity of having to consent to that. Any domestic arrangement between the crofter and any of his relations is certainly permissible, provided it stops short of sub-letting.</p>

<p>Why should a crofter's daughter, for example, forgo the right to which every other citizen has a claim, for example, rent in respect of National Assistance? Under this strange exclusion she cannot make an arrangement with her father no matter how aged or poor he may be. The Lord Advocate has taken us back to the point that there are certain conditions attached to a statutory tenancy. We are again arguing that these attachments are unjust and are a visitation upon the crofter. That is precisely what I am arguing, and I do not think it is an answer to speak of the conditions.</p>

<p>When dealing with this topic, which is important, in the Scottish Grand Committee, I posed a question about a crofter who was keenly concerned to increase his stock and make a good job of his crofting activities. In order to get more winter feed he managed to secure a croft which was more than two miles away from the croft in which he resided. Can I have an assurance that in those circumstances, with two


crofts or even three, two or more miles away from the croft in which he resides, he would be allowed to continue using the other croft to increase his store of winter feed and thus be able to keep a larger head of stock?</p>

<p>The Commission would, of course, take that into account. That is not the kind of person we are out to prevent.

This Amendment is to meet a point which was raised by the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Grimond) during the Committee stage. It is to enable an aged crofter who gives up his croft to have such rights of peat banks and access as may seem reasonable to the Commission. The hon. Member suggested that such provision might be put in the feu charter. I told him that although his Amendment was not acceptable in the form in which he moved it, we would accept the principle and endeavour to meet his point. We have done that in this Amendment, which retains for the aged crofter and his wife the right to cut peat so long as they continue to occupy the house. These words fulfil the object which the hon. Member had in mind.</p>

<p>I am very grateful to the Government for the Amendment. Naturally I do not want to make any difficulties about it, but there are two questions I should like to ask. The Amendment goes a little further than I had intended in my Amendment. I had tried to leave the Commission some discretion so that it could either allow the aged crofter to keep the whole of the

rights to peat or it could divide them between the aged crofter and the incoming crofter, because it is conceivable that the incoming crofter might also want some peat. I take it that the Government might answer that an arrangement could be come to between them and that possibly the aged crofter could sublet peat rights.<br/>
The second point is: what happens to the peat rights when the aged crofter and his wife are dead? Do they revert to the incoming crofter who holds the croft lands or to the landlord? I will not press for an answer now but I think that that is a point of importance. To whom do the rights go? Perhaps at some future stage an answer might be given.</p>

<p>This happens to be one of those little things on which crofters and grazings committees are particularly touchy. I do not know why, because in some areas where they cut hardly any peat at all this is still regarded as an extremely important right, to make sure that nobody else cuts it. I have almost painful recollections of its importance in my first election campaign in 1935 when the quite unscrupulous local Liberals of those days&#x2014;there are fewer Liberals today so there must be fewer unscrupulous ones too&#x2014;slyly organised a propaganda scare against me that because I lived in one village if I were elected the neighbouring village would be deprived of its peat banks.<br/>
That story, spread by the Liberals had, I have no doubt, its effect. We exposed the outrageous falsehood of the whole thing; and I am convinced their chicanery over peat-cutting was part of what led to the downfall of the Liberals in the Highlands generally. Nevertheless, it is an illustration of how seriously the matter of peat-cutting rights was taken even in the higher political levels of the Liberal Party.</p>

<p>The Liberals were worried lest I should set somebody else's, political peat on fire.<br/>
Unless there is the closest consultation by the Commission with the grazings committees then, even on small issues such as this, all sorts of little local complications can arise. If the Commission (start fiddling about with rights of this kind, then there may be difficulties. However, I have no doubt that the Commission will consult with everybody concerned. I hope that it will take into account the feelings of the grazings committees before new people are afforded any rights in the local peat banks.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 33, line 36, to leave out subsection (3).<br/>
The House will recall that in Standing Committee my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for South Angus (Captain Duncan), who is not in his place today, raised the question of the crofters' grazing rights. He was afraid that, because of the wording of this subsection, which mentions the Land Court, there might be a conflict between the Land Court and the Commission.<br/>
In reply, I pointed out that the Clause as a whole was a straight re-enactment and that on reconsidering it at that time we were of the opinion that it was completely out of date because it referred only to the cottar's traditional grazing rights, established over many years of custom. It did not go any further than that. We now find, on examination of the subsection, that all these cases have long ago been cleared up and the provision has fallen into complete disuse. Because of that, we feel that the best thing to do is to delete the subsection.</p>

<p>The Amendment will no doubt rejoice the heart of the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel). Its effect is to provide for cases where crofters have died before the Bill becomes an Act.

<p>I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.<br/>
Perhaps I ought to say that I am sorry that I was not present during the Committee stage, but I moved the Second Reading of the Bill and at that time I expressed the hope that it would not arouse any very serious party controversy but would be welcomed in general by all parties in the House. I am glad to say that discussions in Committee and on Report fulfilled this hope because, apart from a number of points of difference on which Amendments were put down, there has been a general measure of agreement about the objects of the Bill and the desirability of passing it into law.<br/>
On Second Reading, I expressed the Government's thanks and my personal thanks to Principal Sir Thomas Taylor and his colleagues for their labours on the Commission and for the admirable Report which they produced. I happen to know a little of the immense amount of work which the Commission had to undertake and I know, also, that Sir Thomas Taylor himself did a great deal of work in providing us with this excellent Report. I am glad to think that he will see some of the results of his labours having legislative effect so soon and so expeditiously.<br/>
It is not always the case that reports of such commissions can be carried into effect so expeditiously. I am glad to have been able to take some small part in bringing this about. I have heard it suggested, in this House and elsewhere, that Governments sometimes appoint commissions to waste time rather than to achieve results. I have even heard it suggested


that the reports of commissions have been known to find their way into pigeon-holes from which they have never managed to struggle out again into the light of day.<br/>
That has not been so in this case. Though the right hon. Member for Greenock (Mr. McNeil) was responsible for setting up the Commission, I am glad to think that we have been able to introduce a Bill so soon after the Commission reported. I hope that now we are taking the first step towards making this Bill law, subject, of course, to its having a fairly easy passage through another place which, I trust, it will receive.<br/>
As I have already said, I was not able to attend the meetings of the Standing Committee, and I should like to express my sincere thanks to my hon. Friend the Joint Under-Secretary of State-my hon. Friend the Member for West Perth (Mr. Snaddenk)&#x2014;and to my right hon. and learned Friend the Lord Advocate for the admirable job they did in Committee. It proves once again, if proof be needed, that no man is indispensable. On future occasions I hope that together they will be able to conduct many more Bills in Committee. I certainly wish them well, and thank them sincerely.<br/>
I should also like to express my gratitude to hon. Members of all parties who represent Highland constituencies. They have been able to make valuable contributions to the debates because of their special knowledge of the problems dealt with in this Bill. I am glad they have given such useful help, because these problems are not entirely free from an element of controversy. I appreciate, too, the helpful attitude adopted by hon. Members on both sides of the House. Having accepted the main principles of the Taylor Report, and of the Bill, they addressed themselves to endeavouring to improve the Bill and did not attempt to delay it. This helpful co-operation has resulted in a number of improvements to the Measure, and I hope that it will now be regarded as an effective instrument for implementing the report of the Taylor Committee.<br/>
The discussions both in this House and in Committee have served several useful purposes. They have brought before the public the problems of the crofting communities and have revealed the lines along which some of these problems may be

solved. They have also clarified many issues which will face the new Crofters Commission when it is set up. The Commission will have an onerous task to perform. I hope that our debates have done something to prove to the crofters that the Government, and Parliament, are alive to their problems and needs; that we are anxious to help, and desirous of strengthening and maintaining that contribution which the crofting communities can make to our national life.<br/>
If the Bill meets with the approval of the House, we shall be echoing the sentiments expressed in the Taylor Report, not only that the crofting communities deserve to be saved from extinction, but that their restoration can be brought about. I hope, as a result of this Bill, that new life and new heart will be put into these areas. The first step of course, is the passage of the Bill, and thereafter will come the most important task of setting up the Crofters Commission. I shall take careful note of the suggestions and remarks which have been made by hon. Members. I have read the reports of the proceedings in Committee and listened to what has been said today. It is essential that the Commission be composed of the right people and the best people and, so far as possible, of representatives with special knowledge of the conditions in the crofting areas.<br/>
I hope that the Commission may be assured that it will have the good will and good wishes of every right hon. and hon. Member. As we know, there is no magical remedy which may be applied to cure the problems which will confront the new Commission. What is required is a well-conceived policy which must be carried out and maintained resolutely over a period of years. In this Bill we have such a policy and I repeat that I am glad to think that it has been generally accepted by all parties. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

<p>I have no intention of adding much more now to the volume of advice offered to the Government and that which will be offered to the Commission when it is set up. There is, however, one last point which I think should be reiterated. I hope that the Government will persuade the Treasury to offer a good salary to the chairman of the Commission when they find him.<br/>
Secondly, I hope that they may be able to offer some assurance to the members of the Commission that they can settle down to this job knowing that they have sufficient time before them; that the Commission may be given some assurance about security of tenure. It is no use appointing a chairman of the Commission for a few years and asking him to live in Inverness, or wherever else it may be, with the feeling that he may possibly lose his job after having settled down there.<br/>
I wish I could share the high hopes for the Bill which have been expressed by the Secretary of State. I am doubtful whether the Bill alone will repopulate the very depopulated Highland glens, but, such as it is, I welcome it and wish to speed it on its way.</p>

<p>I am sure I shall be expressing the opinion of my hon. Friends if I thank the right hon. Gentleman for all that is best in this Bill. I consider that there is a lot of good in it provided, as we have said so often in this House, that the right people get down to the job and are supplied with adequate finances and armed with the right powers. Only time will tell whether all these needs will be fulfilled. We wish the right hon. Gentleman well in his task of appointing the members of the Commission and supporting them in their labours.<br/>
If I may strike a personal note, I think that all of us, on this side of the House at any rate, missed the right hon. Gentleman during our Committee discussions. But I can assure him that the Joint Under-Secretary carried out his duties as though the Secretary of State had not existed, and was not needed. Our relations with the Joint Under-Secretary throughout the Committee stage were of the best, in spite of the fact that many controversial arguments were raised, generally by hon. Members on this side of the House.<br/>
I should like to thank the Joint Under-Secretary for his helpfulness and the way in which he met us over a number of Amendments. I would also compliment him on the adept way in which he managed to get rid of some Amendments, and the manner in which he offered us a great many words without giving us any-

thing of substance. That may be an advantage to a man in his office.<br/>
In a few days I shall be going back to my constituency and my crofter constituents. There, I shall be answerable for the defects in this Bill. It is I who will suffer for anything which is wrong with this Measure&#x2014;not the Secretary of State, or the Joint Under-Secretary, or my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton (Mr. T. Fraser), or my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenock (Mr. McNeil). I shall have to explain to my constituents why we did not tear the Bill to shreds during the Committee stage. Hon. Members representing constituencies there will be answerable in the Highlands and Islands to the local crofters and grazing committees. Even the absentee crofters will turn up to criticise us.</p>

<p>When I saw the result of the last General Election in Greenock I had no doubt that my right hon. Friend must have many intelligent people from the Highlands in his constituency&#x2014;and we hope to see some of them appointed to the Commission in due course.<br/>
This is not the Bill that we in the Labour Party should have introduced. Ours, in the nature of things, would have been a much better one. I am sure that nobody, on either side of the House, would say that the Bill will do all the things which are necessary to solve the problems of the Highlands and Islands. They are many and varied, and involve long-term treatment and close attention over many years. They will also involve the expenditure of a great deal of money in respect of which we hope and believe there will be a greater return to the nation if it is properly applied.<br/>
Hon. Members have shown various degrees of enthusiasm about the idea of a Highland executive authority. I shall not raise that matter now, because it would not be permissible. Divisions of opinion have occurred between hon. Members on each side of the House as to whether we should have such an authority. Both parties are divided on it. I understand that even the Liberal Party


is divided against himself&#x2014;if I may say so in the light of its present representation in the House&#x2014;upon that issue; though that party supports Scottish Home Rule more directly than others. At least, I think he does.<br/>
We recognise that the Bill has a limited purpose, and, also, that it was skilfully drafted within its limits. Our criticisms were directed to trying to widen its scope and powers, to increase the provision of money, and to make sure, as far as possible, that people with the most appropriate and suitable qualifications were appointed to carry out its functions. All things considered, I, for one, am prepared to face my grazings committees and electors of all parties and tell them that I know that the purpose and intention of the Government upon this occasion have been wholly in the interests of the crofters and of Highland development. The novelty of such a statement from me ought to appeal to my constituents.<br/>
Whether the Bill will fall short of that purpose or fulfil it is something which only time can tell, but we wish it well and we wish the Commission well. With that intention, we have supported the Bill and tried to improve it by moving what we hoped were constructive Amendments during the Committee stage and again in our comments today. We hope that the Bill will succeed in its purpose.</p>

<p>I have no crofting problem in my part of Perthshire, but I think it is desirable that all hon. Members who are not directly concerned with crofting problems should support any action that may be taken to ease those problems. It has been said that the Bill may not do much to repopulate the crofting areas, and that may or may not be true, but one thing which is quite certain is that it will at least help to prevent their further depopulation, and if the Bill is successful to that extent it will certainly not have been a waste of time.<br/>
My hon. and gallant Friend the Member for South Angus (Captain Duncan), who also has no crofting problems in his constituency, has rendered signal service to the Bill by his efforts during the Committee stage. With great respect and diffidence I urge all hon. Members, whichever

constituency they represent, to associate themselves with the problem of keeping Highland life going in the crofting counties. Anything that we can say or do to help we should do. Although we are not directly concerned with the crofting counties we have an interest in the welfare of our country as a whole, of which those counties represent an important part.<br/>
I am sure that my right hon. Friend will take the utmost care over the selection of members of the Commission, upon which the success or failure of the Bill completely depends. I am sure we can rely upon him to do his utmost, because the job to be done is worthy of the best men.</p>

<p>I join with my hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles (Mr. M. MacMillan) in expressing appreciation to the Joint Under-Secretary for the manner in which he conducted the Bill during the Committee stage and the spirit in which he co-operated with us and showed a willingness to accept some of our Amendments.<br/>
I cannot help feeling that the Bill does not go very far towards what we should like to see done in the Highlands. It is true that it sets up the Crofters Commission and gives it wide powers over crofting matters such as the cultivation of land and the reorganisation of townships, but its success will depend upon the setting in which that work takes place and, therefore, upon the solution of a vast number of other problems.<br/>
During the Committee stage we tried to tackle those problems by inserting a schedule, the principle of which was accepted by the Government and is now incorporated in Clause 2 (1), but that subsection merely gives the Crofters Commission powers to make recommendations to the Secretary of State. The position, therefore, is that the Commission might be able to pursue a very energetic course in respect of those functions for which it has executive powers, but whether or not that does all that we require depends entirely upon the Government's attitude to the recommendations which will be made to them in respect of the large number of items detailed in Clause 2.<br/>
Some people looked forward to the establishment of a kind of development authority for the Highlands, but what we


have actually done is to make the Secretary of State a kind of development authority. The Commission is given powers to make recommendations upon a vast number of subjects which we have all agreed are necessary if the crofting community is to enjoy a degree of prosperity and the Highland areas are to be repopulated, but fundamentally the achievement of that aim will depend upon the Government and especially upon the Secretary of State and his ability to extract money from the Exchequer. I hope that the Government will act rather more promptly in connection with the recommendations which are likely to be made by the Commission than they have done in many cases in the past in connection with recommendations made by the Highland Panel and other bodies. My hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles would probably agree with that. A great responsibility is certainly placed upon the Secretary of State.<br/>
My next point concerns the introduction of the sheriff court and Court of Session into the procedure affecting the Highlands, and the taking away of certain powers from the Land Court and vesting them in the Commission. I can appreciate the reasons which made the Government transfer certain functions from the Land Court to the Commission, where such functions are concerned purely with the activities of the Commission; but I am not so happy about the introduction of the sheriff court and the Court of Session into the procedure affecting the Highlands, because that seems to be going back upon the attitude and outlook which led to the setting up of the Land Court, which was part and parcel of a scheme to enable crofters' problems to be dealt with without expense. Here, we introduce a procedure which entails expense.<br/>
I am particularly glad that the Lord Advocate seems to have changed his mind on the question of bequests and the Land Court. The idea that he expressed vigorously in Committee, that these were legal points that ought to be settled by the sheriff court and the Court of Session seems to be no longer valid. This afternoon we have changed the Bill, and introduced a new subsection which goes back to the old procedure. The arguments of the Lord Advocate do not seem to have been very good. If they were not very good in regard to this point I suggest that they are not very good in relation

to the other part of the Bill in which he has introduced the Court of Session procedure. His arguments in support of it were exactly the same as he adduced in support of the sheriff court and Court of Session procedure for bequests.<br/>
Replying to a question put to him about the new subsection, the Lord Advocate's answer was that the existing procedure was still to be carried out. He was asked specifically about that point. I hope he will look at the sheriff court and the Court of Session procedure again, and will decide to make a further change. Because somebody in St. Andrew's House thinks it is good to give jobs to some of the sheriffs in the Highlands is no reason for altering the principle that has been growing up of crofters getting their difficulties settled by the Land Court. That was a recognition of the fact that legal proceedings are expensive, and that in the case of the crofting community we should try to avoid expense. When the Bill goes to another place, the Government should look at this matter again.<br/>
I welcome the Bill because it does something for the Highlands. It will depend largely upon the Secretary of State whether the Crofters Commission proves a success or not, because he can determine the conditions within which it will work. I appeal to the Government to give the Crofters Commission conditions in which it can work to bring about the realisation of what we all wish to achieve.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) said that on the appointments made by the Secretary of State the success of the Bill would depend. That is what everybody realises throughout Scotland. Every crofter knows that the personnel of the Commission will make or mar the Bill.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman also mentioned the recommendations of the Highland Panel. The present Secretary of State and his predecessors did quite a lot in the way of accepting the recommendations of that organisa-


tion. I do not understand why there should be doubt about any Secretary of State now, or in the future, acting upon the recommendations of the Crofters Commission when it is set up.<br/>
I am convinced that the Bill will be a great success, but many crofters do not believe it. A leading journal in the Highlands was all against the introduction of the Bill. I shall be meeting people on that journal next week and shall have to account to them. I am convinced that the Bill will be a success and that it is necessary in order to obtain better conditions for the crofters.<br/>
During the passage of the Bill I have always said that in appointing people to replace casualties among members of the Commission any Secretary of State for Scotland would select people who were most suitable for appointment. On that ground we shall be able to convince the crofters that the Bill, far from being unnecessary, will improve their position, their security and their future in the Highlands. I welcome the Bill.</p>

<p>I agree with the hon. and gallant Member for Argyll (Major McCallum) that some people in the Highlands are rather lukewarm about the Bill and the Crofters Commission. We, who have been dealing with the Bill, recognise that great benefits can be achieved from it if we get a proper Commission. We all sincerely hope that the Commission will have great success, and that its work will be for the lasting good of the population throughout the Highlands. That is what we have all been attempting to do at all stages of the Bill.<br/>
I would ask the Government one or two questions, the first of which is about the new subsection (7) that we have accepted this afternoon to Clause 16, to deal with the situation where a croft becomes vacant, and, after six months, the landlord can give notice to the Secretary of State, who must then purchase the buildings on the croft. Is that not an unprecedented power of direction for any landlord to have? I do not know of any similar direction at the disposal of the crofters. Have the Government really made up their minds on this point?<br/>
It has been argued that the landlord will need to pay compensation to the out-

going tenant. Have the Government assessed the cheapest way for them to approach the matter? Are they to become the possessors of a lot of old buildings on a number of crofts in the crofting counties? What use are the Government to make of them?</p>

<p>It is a new principle for a landlord to direct the Secretary of State. If the hon. and gallant Gentleman says that it is in another portion of the Bill then the Secretary of State is twice directed by the same people. The crofter has not a similar power to direct the Secretary of State to purchase something from him.<br/>
The point was made about compensation being paid to the outgoing crofter. Has the cost of that been assessed against the cost of purchasing the buildings? Would not the latter be a better method? It would at least make some use of the buildings and the landlord would have some responsibility for them. Otherwise, what will the Secretary of State do with all these outbuildings?</p>

<p>It seems to me that the hon. Member has rather an exaggerated idea about this. The Amendment was put in to deal with the very remote contingency of a croft which, because of an action of the Commission, was unlettable. The landlord has, under the Bill, no control over what the Commission may do. All the Amendment says is that if by any action of the Commission the croft is found to be unlettable, the crofter's outgoing will be met by the Secretary of State.</p>

<p>And the landlord is protected. That is in the tradition of the Tory party. I do not expect anything else.<br/>
The Lord Advocate rather twitted me when he spoke to the Amendment in page 39, line 15, but he has added some further legal phraseology there to something which is already complicated. He will remember that in Committee I discussed subsection (4) with him at some length. I take it that that subsection now becomes (5), but all that rigmarole that was so criticised by both sides of the


Committee remains in its entirety. I do not intend to read the subsection again&#x2014; I inflicted it on the Committee once before. I will only say for the benefit of the Sassenachs now present, who do not know what it means, that it talks about
<q>&#x2026; any order, rule, regulation, record, application, reference, appointment, loan, agreement, finding or award made&#x2026;</q>
It goes on almost without limit; one would think that the subsection would never end.<br/>
I regret that this has not been simplified; that this unintelligible, legalistic jargon has been kept in its entirety. Nearly all the Bill is very acceptable to many of us but this subsection in its present form is unacceptable. I hope that the Lord Advocate will clearly explain why its present form is necessary. Quite frankly, he did not convey any feeling of confidence in his case when he spoke in Committee. I am quite convinced that no long-practising politician could have produced this subsection. It must have been produced by the Lord Advocate or by some other lawyer.</p>

<p>I remember that we did have some distinctly unintelligible things, but I was talking in a democratic sense. I know that before coming here the Lord Advocate did certain Government work in an office to which he had not been elected. I was fearful that he had been bothered with this in his digestive organs during the recent by-election in Edinburgh. If so, it is no wonder that he erupted it when he came here. He must have felt that he had to get it out of his system.<br/>
I am not sure what subsection (4) is intended to do. Can the Lord Advocate tell us that it does what it is intended to do? Is he certain that the subsection

covers every eventuality, incident, occurrence, affair, transaction, fact, phenomenon, advent, business, concern, circumstance, opportunity, casualty, happening, accident, adventure, passage, crisis, emergency, contingency and consequence? Is he certain that all the reiterations he has used cover all the events I have just listed?</p>

<p>I should like to give my blessing to the Bill and to congratulate the Secretary of State. He said this afternoon that the Bill at least brought Highland problems and affairs before the general public. I think he has done something in bringing those problems before the Cabinet and in getting the Bill through so expeditiously following the Taylor Report.<br/>
I should also like to congratulate the Joint Under-Secretary of State, because it is rather remarkable that during the whole passage of the Bill so far there have been no Divisions&#x2014;I must also congratulate the Opposition on that. I believe that it was my hon. Friend's diplomatic and able handling of the Bill, in Committee, and his open-mindedness, that made that possible.<br/>
I thank the Government for the Amendments which they have accepted, particularly my own and those of my hon. Friends. I believe that it is good that


the Land Court should have back, probably, some of the powers proposed to be taken from it when the Bill was introduced. The question of bequests has been mentioned. I hope the Lord Advocate has read the case of Donald v. Donald and that he is convinced that the Land Court should be consulted where bequests are involved.<br/>
This Bill brings new hope to the Highlands and I feel that the new Commission has a stimulating challenge which I hope it will accept. I am sure it will do a tremendous amount. Of course, it will not do all we want for the Highland areas but it should go a tremendous way towards stimulating new hope and bringing new life into the Highlands.<br/>
I will conclude by quoting what the Taylor Commission says at the end of its Report:
<q>But time is running very short and if the chance is not taken now it will be gone for good.</q>
I hope that the Commission will act expeditiously when it comes into being.</p>

<p>We have nearly reached the end of our consideration of this Bill, unless, of course, it is sent back to us from another place with some Amendments. I sincerely hope that it will be sent back with at least one Amendment.<br/>
The Secretary of State was very properly congratulated upon introducing the Bill and upon so readily showing his awareness of the problems and his willingness to give effect to the recommendations of the Taylor Commission. This afternoon he has said, very rightly, that Principal Sir Thomas Taylor should feel honoured that we in Parliament have so readily enacted his recommendations.<br/>
It has been said that we had no Divisions at any stage of this Bill. That is true, despite the fact that we have made many Amendments to the Bill. I think we have greatly improved it, and great credit is due to the Joint Under-Secretary of State, who handled the Bill in a most competent manner. Might I say to some of his hon. Friends that today and in the future they will be delighted that he was not over-influenced by their contributions in Committee, because after they had so vigorously opposed what was perhaps the

most important Amendment on the Order Paper, and the Under-Secretary himself had also rejected the Amendment, after further speeches were made some hon. Members opposite changed their minds about the Amendment. Indeed, one hon. Member opposite, after having rejected an Amendment on Thursday, on the following Tuesday apologised for not having had time to examine the Amendment before he made his speech. By this time he had made two speeches on the same Amendment and they were completely opposed to each other.<br/>
It is, therefore, greatly to the credit of the Under-Secretary that he considered all the Amendments objectively, that he listened carefully to the speeches which were made from either side of the Committee and weighed them and took a decision upon them on their merits and not by reference to the side of the Committee from which the recommendations came. That is why we did not have any Divisions. We considered it to be unwise and not very clever to have Divisions when we could see that the Under-Secretary was genuinely concerned to make this a good Bill rather than to make political capital out of it.<br/>
That we wish the Bill well goes without saying. We all agree that it is essential to the successful operation of this Bill that a good Commission should be appointed, that suitable persons are appointed to it. As the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Grimond) has said, it is important that we should pay these people adequately for the job which we are asking them to undertake. They have not been given an easy task. They should feel that we are behind them in tackling a problem which is now almost 200 years old. We have had this problem for about 200 years and it has been examined by successive Commissions for more than 150 years. Now this Commission has told us that this is our last chance. That is why we have the right and the duty to be careful in framing this legislation.<br/>
The Commission must have the confidence of the crofters. It cannot succeed in its work without that confidence. We have said in the course of our discussion on Report that the Commission can only have the confidence of the crofters if at least one member of the Commission is a person with practical experience of crofting. We genuinely believe that.<br/>
May I say to the Secretary of State that the crofters in all the crofting areas in the North of Scotland will read what we have said in Committee and in the House on this subject. They will know that we in Parliament have been discussing a proposal that one or more of the members of the Crofters Commission should be a person with practical experience of crofting. If they know that we in Parliament have decided against making this provision in the Bill, then the Commission will not have the confidence of the crofters from the outset. I beg the Secretary of State to bear that fact in mind and to ensure that when the Bill is considered in another place it is amended to provide that at least one member of the Commission shall be a person with practical experience of crofting.<br/>
The Bill by itself is not enough. The new Commission will only succeed, and this Measure will only succeed in bringing about the recovery of the crofting areas in the crofting counties, if, first, the Crofters Commission brings the right recommendations to the Secretary of State, and, secondly, if the Secretary of State has the authority and the approval of the Treasury to make generous grants to the crofters for land improvement, for the purchase of fertilisers and feedingstuffs, for the improvement of roads, for the marketing of produce and to assist the crofters in meeting the unduly high freight charges.<br/>
The Taylor Commission did not merely recommend the setting up of a Crofters Commission. It pointed to the need for the new Commission to have adequate funds at its disposal in order to finance the recovery of the crofting communities. We have had explained to us why the new Commission could not have the necessary finance for the purpose and that there must be someone accountable to Parliament. Therefore, it must be the Secretary of State.<br/>
The Bill will only be a success if, over the years, the Secretary of State, whoever he may be from time to time, has the approval of the Treasury to spend money

generously in seeking to give new heart to those people in the crofting areas who have lived in penury for so long.</p>

<p>May I ask a couple of questions? In line 40 we have the word " may." I take it that this is one of the terms of art which in fact means " shall." I never understand why we have to say " may " on a number of occasions when we mean " shall," and I should like an assurance that this means that in fact it will be done.<br/>
More important than that, in each of the paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) occur the rather formidable words:
<q> with such adaptations and modifications as may be specified in the rules &#x2026; </q>
In other words, as the Bill stands the Treasury has complete licence to alter or modify the rights of pensioners under these paragraphs in any way it wishes. I do not doubt that this is designed only to enable the Treasury to make minor changes which are necessary, but it seems to me that these are far reaching words, and I do not know whether the Government could find more limited words to give the Treasury power to do something which I am sure is intended shall be quite minor and limited. These are far-reaching powers, greater indeed than those which we have ourselves taken in the Bill.</p>

<p>It was used rather than the term " shall," which he would like to see in the Bill. I think that in any Bill of this type he will find that the word " may " is always used. The only consolation must be that those who put this word in the drafts will themselves enjoy the pensions and other rewards inasmuch as they are writing legislation which applies to themselves. In the same way I think that in the Civil Service leave is said to be a privilege and not a right, but few of this resolute body of men and women would carry on if they did not get their leave. Whatever the right hon. Member may feel about this, I think we can rest assured that these individuals will enjoy the benefit which we wish to give them under the Bill.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman also referred to the use of the words
<q> with such adaptations and modifications as may be specified in the rules&#x2026;</q>
When the Acts which are set forth in the Second Schedule were applied, they were Acts of universal application for this country. If under the Bill we applied them to all the individuals specified in other parts of the Acts, all would become entitled to all of the benefits, but it is specified earlier in the Bill that in fact the application is restricted to a group of individuals who are living in the United Kingdom or whose pensions are expressed in sterling. I refer the right hon. Gentleman to the Second Schedule, Part I (1).<br/>
This may be clearer if we refer to a similar Act, the Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1948, which the last Administration saw fit to apply to certain categories of Indian and Pakistan pensioners. Section 5 of that Act set out:
<q> This section shall apply to any pension payable in respect of service to His Majesty out of the revenues of India or Pakistan to any person resident in the United Kingdom, or, where the pension is expressed in sterling, in any other place&#x2026;</q>
In other words, the Government of the day saw fit to apply these provisions only to those who were resident in the United Kingdom or where the pension was expressed in sterling and not universally to all those who enjoyed a pension
<q> payable in respect of service to His Majesty out of the revenues of India or Pakistan.</q>
Similarly, in this case, it has been seen fit to insert these words so that these


Acts of Parliament, which will be applied to these individuals, will be applied to those who are set forth in other parts of the Bill.</p>

<p>I am in doubt about the meaning of this Schedule and the difference between Part I and Part II. Part I applies to pensioners in India and Pakistan and Part II to pensioners in Burma. I cannot understand why there are so many differences between the two sets of pensioners. Part I deals with the Pensions (Increase) Acts, 1944, 1947, 1952 and 1954, whereas Part II deals only with the Pensions (Increase) Act, 1952.<br/>
Secondly, a lot of people are set out who are entitled to these pensions under Part I&#x2014;quite an elaborate description&#x2014;whereas when we come to Part II we find that it is only,
<q> A pension payable to or in respect of a European warrant officer of the Royal Indian Marine.</q>
That is a very small category of persons. No doubt there is an explanation of why, on the face of it, there are these marked differences, and I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would explain.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for having raised these points. Part I refers to India, as he said, and we always refer to the 1944, 1947 and 1954 Acts together.<br/>
The parent Act was that of 1944, and these three Acts restored the cost of living cuts which were made in the pensions between 1922 and 1935. Whereas these cuts were made to certain categories of Indian pensions, they were not made to any categories of Burma pensions and therefore there is no need to apply the 1944, 1947 and 1954 Acts, which hang

together, to the second category, the Burma pensioners.<br/>
The Royal Indian Marine is a distinguished body of men which was not part of the Armed Forces. If it had been, it would have been covered by the prerogative. To make matters clear, it has therefore been thought best to insert these words in the Bill. On page 8 of the Second Schedule, Part I (4) reads:
<q> A pension payable to or in respect of a European officer of the Royal Indian Marine.</q>
These officers suffered cuts between 1922 and 1935 and therefore enjoyed restoration of those cuts under the 1944, 1947 and 1954 Acts.<br/>
In Part II it reads:
<q> A pension payable to or in respect of a European warrant officer&#x2026;.</q>
They were the lowest rank concerned and as they did not suffer any cuts between 1922 and 1935, it has therefore not been necessary to restore the cuts. It is therefore only the 1952 Act which applies in that case.</p>

I should, therefore, like to put one or two questions to the hon. Gentleman and I hope that he will be good enough to let us have a reply. I understand that up to now, when the Chancellor of the Exchequer makes certain changes to the Customs duties in his Budget, they are later, by a resolution of Tynwald, applied to the Isle of Man, and we then pass an Act in this House which gives them statutory authority.<br/>
That procedure is to be changed. In future the resolution of Tynwald dealing with changes in Customs duties will be validated by an Order in Council. I understand that that Order will, in fact, be a Statutory Instrument which will be presented to this House. I should like to know whether the Statutory Instrument, the Order in Council, is to require the affirmative or only the negative procedure.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman, on Second Reading, was pleased to indicate&#x2014;and we

share his pleasure&#x2014;that the Isle of Man will now be in a position to fix its own Customs duties. What does that mean? Does it mean that, although it has a right to fix the duties, it will, in effect, always fix them at the same rates as the Imperial Parliament does. Will they, as they now do, follow the opening of the Budget by the Chancellor of the Exchequer?<br/>
Are we also to understand that the Order in Council, when it is presented to the House&#x2014;whichever procedure is to be adopted with regard to it&#x2014;will be presented in draft? Otherwise it would appear that Parliament would be nothing more than a rubber stamp. It would be interesting to have the views of the hon. Gentleman on these points and such others as my hon. Friends may wish to put on this Clause.</p>

<p>I am glad to reply to the questions of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Colne Valley (Mr. Glenvil Hall). He asked about the procedure. He indicated that after the Chancellor of the Exchequer had presented his Budget in this House there might be resolutions passed by the Tynwald, and he asked whether those resolutions might depend on what the Budget contained.<br/>
I think he will agree that the interesting case is the one where there are changes in the Customs tariff of this country. It is normal for Tynwald then to pass resolutions which may not precisely repeat the changes in the United Kingdom Budget, because the Isle of Man tariff is not identical with ours, but which, in the past, have broadly followed those changes.<br/>
Under the 1887 Act, the Tynwald resolution could be given provisional effect so that a change in the tariff of this country might, if the Isle of Man authority thought fit, operate immediately in the Isle of Man and thereby not give rise, for instance, to the temptation of smuggling if there had been a sharp change here and no change there. I ought to explain that the Tynwald resolution, if it is to be given provisional effect under the 1887 Act, must receive the approval of the Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury here, and this Bill makes no change in those arrangements for a Tynwald resolution securing provisional effect.<br/>
What the Bill does is as follows. Hitherto, every Tynwald resolution has had, within a certain time, to be validated by an Act of Parliament here. In future, validation will not be done by Act of Parliament but by Order in Council. When Tynwald passes a resolution of any sort relating to Customs tariffs it will, in the normal course, be validated by an Order in Council made over here. That is the plan, but I want to make it quite clear to the Committee that this Bill in no way alters the arrangements by which the Tynwald resolution to make an immediate change in the Isle of Man tariff will have provisional effect pending further validation.<br/>
The right hon. Member asked about the right of the Isle of Man to fix its own Customs duties. The Isle of Man has a tariff it has fixed itself in the first instance, but which is incorporated in Acts of Parliament, and that tariff is not identical with ours. In future, the Customs tariff of the island will get transferred from being embodied in Acts of Parliament here to being embodied in a series of Tynwald resolutions which will have been validated by Order in Council.<br/>
The right hon. Member asked about the form of the Order in Council. As laid down in subsection (4), the Order must be laid before Parliament, but that does not include either the affirmative or negative procedure here. I should like to explain that there is a very sound and logical reason for that, as all the other legislation of Tynwald affecting the Isle of Man is given effect by a similar procedure. It is not customary nor statutory that Tynwald resolutions concerning matters far away from Customs operation or procedure should be confirmed by Orders in Council subject to Parliamentary procedure. In this Bill, we are simply following the broad precedent the House of Commons has accepted and enacted in other Isle of Man legislation.</p>

<p>The statement of the Financial Secretary might be read as meaning that in future the resolutions of Tynwald with regard to Customs and Excise become effective when, as he says, they are validated by the Privy Council without this House being able to intervene.<br/>
I imagine that that is not really what the hon. Gentleman intended to convey,

for is it not a fact that these resolutions are not sent direct from Tynwald to the Privy Council but to the Privy Council through the Secretary of State for the Home Department? In this case, and in the case of the Channel Islands&#x2014;which sometimes are facetiously alluded to in the Civil Service as " The Home Office Colonies "&#x2014;the Home Secretary has to assume some responsibility for recommending the resolutions to the Privy Council.<br/>
On occasions when he has found it rather difficult so to commend them, whether in respect of the Isle of Man or the Channel Islands, he has made representations first to the authorities of the island concerned that unless the resolutions are modified in a certain way he will find it difficult to submit them to the Privy Council for validation.<br/>
I take it that it will be the responsibility of a member of Her Majesty's Government&#x2014;presumably still the Secretary of State for the Home Department, but possibly in the matter of Customs either the Chancellor of the Exchequer, or the Home Secretary after consultation with the Chancellor&#x2014;to examine these resolutions to make quite certain that they are not so outrageous as to offend the susceptibilities of this House.<br/>
I do not want to suggest that such a thing is likely to happen at the moment, but, after all, here we are dealing with a constitutional principle that goes back very far into the mists of antiquity and stretches forward into what the Prime Minister this afternoon described as " the obscurity of the future." I think that the Committee will want to be assured that there is still some power of making representation to the islands, both before and after the resolutions of Tynwald have been passed, should the necessity arise. I hope we can have an assurance from the hon. Gentleman that that is the case.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1955-03-29a.270.0" hansard_membership_id="1728" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29704" speakername="Mr. H. Brooke" colnum="270" time="">
<p>I should like to clarify this matter. As regards representations made before a resolution of Tynwald is passed, it is a little difficult to define the situation. I think that perhaps what the right hon. Member is most concerned about is that a situation should not arise in which Tynwald was seeking to do something which, on the face of it, appeared thoroughly unacceptable to the United Kingdom and yet it might appear


from this Bill that it had to be automatically validated by the Privy Council. I am sure the right hon. Member will agree that in view of our past experience and friendly relations with the island it is to be regarded as most unlikely that such a situation would arise.<br/>
I entirely recognise, however, that the possibility exists and I think it is right that I should state what would happen in such circumstances, even if it is an entirely theoretical contingency. For instance, to take a simple case, it might be that Tynwald, completely inadvertently, passed a resolution which would seek to alter the island tariff in a way inconsistent with our international obligations. I think that that is as good an example as one could imagine.<br/>
Let me tell the Committee clearly that there is nothing in this Bill which would compel the Government of the United Kingdom to advise Her Majesty to confirm any particular resolution by Order in Council. A position might conceivably be reached&#x2014;I emphasise " conceivably " &#x2014;where the Government felt unable to advise that such an Order in Council should be made. Further, as I explained on Second Reading, nothing in this Bill derogates from the right of this Parliament, if it thinks fit, to pass legislation on any Isle of Man matter. But we all hope that these difficulties and differences will not arise.<br/>
We all hope that matters will go as smoothly and amicably in the future as they have gone in the past. I hope that now I have explained the situation as fully as I can, the Committee will agree that United Kingdom rights are safeguarded and we can properly take this step, which I am sure the right hon. Member will support me in saying will be a source of pride to the island.</p>

<p>I have no desire to hold up proceedings, or to keep the Committee sitting unduly long, particu-

larly as there are other important matters to which we desire to proceed, but there are one or two questions which, I think, should be put on this Clause.<br/>
The Financial Secretary dealt broadly with what is contained in the Clause and indicated that a formula has been negotiated. I gather that it has now been accepted by the Isle of Man authorities. It would be interesting to the Committee if we could be told, briefly, what that formula is. At the moment, under the 1866 Act the Isle of Man pays us &#x00A3;10,000 a year and, under an agreement come to, I think, in 1949, it agreed to step that amount up, but we were not able to accept the extra money because of the provisions of the 1866 Act. For about four years that money has been put into cold storage.<br/>
As I understood the hon. Gentleman when he moved the Second Reading, there is now about &#x00A3;300,000 lying ready for the Imperial Exchequer immediately this Bill is passed. That works out at about &#x00A3;75,000 to &#x00A3;80,000 a year. Can we, therefore, take it that under the formula, we shall be getting at least &#x00A3;100,000 a year for the future, and possibly more?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1955-03-29a.272.0" hansard_membership_id="1728" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29704" speakername="Mr. H. Brooke" colnum="272" time="">
<p>I welcome the opportunity to explain to the Committee the working of the formula. First, I must weary the Committee with an explanation of the Common Purse arrangements, because the formula depends on that.<br/>
To the best of my knowledge, there are no cases where the Isle of Man Customs duty is higher than the United Kingdom Customs duty, but there are certain instances where it is lower. The Committee will readily understand that on any commodity for which the Isle of Man duty is lower, the importer takes care to see that the article has not borne the United Kingdom duty, or that if it has paid that, drawback has been secured. In those cases, therefore, the duty is paid on importation into the island at the lower rate and the island retains the proceeds of all those duties. But there are other articles on which the duty is identical, and in those cases what are called the Common Purse arrangements operate.<br/>
The whole of the duty on those articles, wherever it is collected, whether in the


United Kingdom or in the island, is paid into the Imperial Exchequer, and the island is subsequently credited with the amount of duty payable on its estimated consumption of such articles. The estimated consumption is calculated by multiplying the resident population of the island, plus an artificial fiscal equivalent, so called, in respect of visitors, by the average consumption per head in the United Kingdom. That is the Common Purse.<br/>
Hitherto, the contribution to the United Kingdom, as the right hon. Member for Colne Valley (Mr. Glenvil Hall) has said, has been &#x00A3;10,000. In 1949, an agreement was reached with the Isle of Man authorities and a Tynwald resolution was passed on the basis of this agreement that for a period of five years beginning 1st April, 1950, the island's contribution, instead of a fixed sum of &#x00A3;10,000, should be an amount equal to 5 per cent. of the Common Purse proceeds. This has had the effect of increasing the contribution from &#x00A3;10,000 to about &#x00A3;90,000 a year; but only &#x00A3;10,000 of that has been payable over to us, because the 1866 Act stipulates &#x00A3;10,000 no less and no more. That is how, since 1st April, 1950, these additional sums have been accumulating. As I explained on Second Reading, at the end of the last financial year the accumulation was in the region of &#x00A3;300,000, and a further sum, which may be about &#x00A3;80,000, will have accumulated at the close of the current financial year, which ends this week.<br/>
The purpose of the Clause is to make it possible to pay into the Imperial Exchequer both these additional sums and any future contributions which, subsequently, it may be agreed that the island should make.</p>

<p>I beg to move,
<q>That the Draft National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) (Colliery Workers Supplementary Scheme) Amendment Order, 1955, a copy of which was laid before this House on 10th March, be approved.</q>
Under the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Act, there is a scheme known as the Colliery Workers Supplementary Scheme, which, in respect of colliery accidents and diseases, provides supplementary benefits for persons receiving benefit under the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Act. The payment is not made from the Exchequer or the Industrial Injuries Fund. It is made from moneys provided by the Fund, which is formed by contributions from the National Coal Board&#x2014;which gives 4d. a ton on the total saleable tonnage of deep-mined coal&#x2014;and of 4d. a week from male employees. The Government Actuary, who acts as the actuary for the scheme, is satisfied that the Fund can carry this burden.<br/>
Payments under the scheme have always borne a certain relationship to Industrial Injuries benefits. As the House knows, those benefits have recently been increased. The Order, therefore, increases the supplementary benefits under the scheme to bring them into line with those now current for Industrial Injuries benefit. In other words, it preserves the same relationship and proportion. The representative national committee is responsible for the scheme and has asked for this change. It is uncontroversial and, I think, acceptable and agreeable to the whole House.</p>

<p>We are obliged to the Parliamentary Secretary for his explanation of the Order. On behalf of my hon. and right hon. Friends, I am glad to say that we not only agree with it but welcome it. As the Parliamentary Secretary has said, this is a national scheme operated by the Coal Board and by the National Union of Mineworkers, and it is subscribed to by both those bodies.<br/>
It might be appropriate for me to mention that this is the only supplementary scheme under Section 83 of the 1946 Act. While there are altogether more than 20 million Class I insured employees, this is the only industry with less than 750,000 employees to have taken advantage of that Section of the Act.<br/>
It was said in another place last week that these proposed increases in benefits from the supplementary scheme would cost about &#x00A3;400,000 in the first year. That gives some idea of the high incidence of accidents in mining. I know that both the National Coal Board and the National Union of Mineworkers are anxious that this change should come into operation when the increased Industrial Injuries benefits take effect on 19th May. Can the Parliamentary Secretary assure us that the administrative arrangements in his Department are so far advanced that the operative date for these payments from the supplementary scheme will be 19th May, the same as in the case of benefits under the Industrial Injuries Scheme? Having made those few observations, I repeat that we on this side welcome the Order and agree with it.</p>

<p>It is proposed, as from 19th May, that most of the benefits will be paid and, as from 25th April, 1955, it is also proposed to increase the rate of supplementary widow's pension. I think, therefore, that the answer to the hon. Member is that the majority of the benefits will be paid on 19th May.</p>

<p>I think that I can help the Committee. This is not an ordinary Money Resolution in Committee of the whole House. This is one of the rare occasions when a Resolution has to be considered in Committee of Ways and Means. As the right hon. Member for Colne Valley (Mr. Glenvil Hall) knows, there is a difference in that case, and the Financial Secretary to the Treasury is the Minister in charge of all Ways and Means Resolutions of this character. The right hon. Member has asked me to speak, and I gladly respond by explaining how this matter arises.<br/>
The Committee will see that the Order Paper contains a Motion by my right hon. Friend the Minister of Housing and Local Government to re-commit the Requisitioned Houses and Housing (Amendment)


Bill as amended, in respect of certain Amendments. One of these Amendments, which I believe <i>is</i> of interest to hon. Members on both sides of the Committee, would be out of order if a Ways and Means Resolution of this character had not been previously carried in Committee of Ways and Means and reported to the House, because the purpose of that Amendment is to put beyond doubt that certain sums received by the owner of a house from the local authority shall be liable to Income Tax in his hands.<br/>
I do not think that there is any dubiety anywhere that they should be liable to tax. I do not want to prejudge that Amendment. All that I say now is that it is desirable that if the Bill is recommitted the Committee should have an opportunity to consider that Amendment. Unless the Committee of Ways and Means agree to the Resolution this evening, it would be impossible for the Committee to do that because it would be out of order.</p>

<p>This is rather an odd business. If this Resolution means anything, it means that the hon. Gentleman is committing the supreme sin for a Financial Secretary of anticipating his right hon. Friend's Budget. I strongly suspect that the real truth of the matter is that these payments would have been liable to Income Tax anyhow. Perhaps, as has been suggested, the Resolution is only to put the matter beyond doubt, but in fact the doubt, if there is one, or the tax, if there is one, does not arise because of any amendment of the Bill. It is merely concerned with the question of the times at which payments should be made.<br/>
If there is now any doubt about the matter, there was exactly the same doubt when the original Bill was introduced. The Treasury watchdog must for one moment have been sleeping in his kennel, since when, he has no doubt awakened and we hear his bark tonight. What it comes to is that the Treasury were asleep.

<p>I beg to move in page 2, line 1, after " information " to insert " on oath."<br/>
This is a very small Amendment which, I think, will not keep the Committtee for more than a few moments. It may be that the Government will be able to clear up quickly the doubt in my mind which led to my putting the Amendment on the Order Paper.<br/>
Clause 3 (1) seems a little peculiar because, as far as I can see, information can be laid before the justices which can lead to the issuing of a warrant to arrest a person without such information having to be laid upon oath, whereas a little later the same subsection provides that there must be written information, substantiated on oath before a search warrant can be issued in order to search premises and obtain copies of the materials about which there is complaint.<br/>
It seems to me rather peculiar that the provision " on oath " should be specified in one case and not in the other. I am sure that the Government wish to avoid any frivolous proceedings of any kind arising under the Bill and it appears to me that that object might be achieved by inserting " on oath " in the first line of the Clause.</p>

<p>The Amendment in its present form is not really satisfactory since it might imply that the original information must be on oath even where a summons is issued and there is no intention of applying for a search warrant. Under the law it is not necessary that information on which a summons is issued should be on oath, and there is no justification for departing from that general rule in this case.<br/>
But the hon. Member has put a point of interest. If the object is to ensure that in any case where an application has to be made for a search warrant the original information on which the summons is issued should also be on oath, I think that he has put a valid point and one which shall be looked into between now and the next stage of the Bill. I will give an undertaking to that effect if the hon. Member is prepared to withdraw his Amendment.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his undertaking to look at this point again, but it seems to me peculiar that if, in accordance with the general practice of the law, information must be laid on oath before a search warrant can be issued, it should be thought unreasonable that it should be laid on oath before a person could be arrested. That is a point which occurred to me, and I hope the Under-Secretary will bear it in mind. However, in view of what he has said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 2, line 23, to leave out from " work " to " and " in line 25.<br/>
As hon. Members will see, the effect of this Amendment would be to leave out the words:
<q> and any copies of any other work which the constable has reasonable cause to believe to be one to which this Act applies&#x2026;</q>
It seems to me that the whole of this Clause gives powers of search to a police constable which are too wide in the circumstances.<br/>
Let me say straight away that I do not think my Amendment can in itself stand, but it is put in this way so that

the Government will have an opportunity to look at the Clause again. The difficulty which arises in this. Under Clause 3 (1) information is to be laid before a justice of the peace in respect of a work which is described as a relevant work, and if he is satisfied by written information on oath that there is reasonable ground for suspecting that a person has in his possession or under his control that relevant work or any other work to which it applies, then a search warrant will be issued.<br/>
So off goes the police officer in pursuance of his duty to find the work which has been laid down in the information. But he is not allowed to have a free roam around the publisher's premises. When he arrives at the premises, it seems to me that what he will be able to do is not merely to seize the work which is the subject matter of the information, but also he will have the opportunity to roam round the publisher's premises and at the same time seize anything else which he wishes to take. <i>[Interruption.]</i> My hon. Friend&#x2014;and I am surprised at him &#x2014;says " Why not? " It is the whole essence of the system of Government in this country that we do not allow people into private premises to seize anything other than that about which there is reasonable and proper suspicion and about which information has been laid on oath.<br/>
The whole purpose of the Clause is that written information must be given and substantiated on oath that there is a reasonable belief that there exists a work of a relevant nature or any other work to which the Bill applies. I should like to give this example. It is one thing for a police constable to seize horror comics, but it is quite another thing to go to premises and seize dirty postcards or something else which a police constable may think is wrong.<br/>
What I am venturing to submit is that we are not going to be bound by what a police constable thinks is wrong material. The proper criterion is what a justice of the peace thinks to be wrong material. I suggest that this Clause is too wide. I may be wrong on this. It may be that the Government can satisfy us that the powers of search are not wider than are required, but of one thing I am quite sure&#x2014;and one would have the support of the Home Secretary in this&#x2014;that if the powers are


too wide and will catch within their ambit not merely horror comics but also other material, then this Clause needs to be looked at again If we can convince the Home Office of that, I am certain that we shall elicit the sympathy of my right hon. and gallant Friend. So I am moving this Amendment by way of exploration more than anything else.</p>

<p>Are not the fears of the hon. Member unfounded, because Clause 3 (1) (i) says:

<p>I have considered that point. If we look at the first paragraph we see that subsection (1) lays down that information has to be laid before a justice of the peace about a person who is suspected of committing an offence in order to issue a warrant. That is the first matter.</p>

<p>Oh yes, but it seems to me that it is the police constable's test which is applied and not that of the justice of the peace. I am putting forward this Amendment with no absolute certainty. I may be wrong about this. I say that quite freely, but I say that it would be quite a serious matter to give a police constable powers which are wider than are required. I want the Home Secretary to look at it and see that we are not doing that. It is for that reason that I am putting the Amendment forward.<br/>
I will conclude with these points. If it is not the relevant work, then I am not altogether sure why we need the words:
<q>&#x2026; or any other work to which this Act applies.</q>
That, of course, is contained in Clause 3 (1, <i>a)</i> and is again mentioned in this paragraph (i). It will be seen that it says:
<q> any copies of the relevant work &#x2026; </q>
which is the subject matter of the information. We are going to give a justice of the peace the right to issue

a warrant if there is a suspicion that a person has in his possession or control any copies not only of the relevant work but of
<q> any other work to which the Act applies.</q>
On that a search warrant can be issued, and it seems to me that the power is rather wide. So I invite the Government to look at the Clause to see whether the powers are not wider than are necessary.</p>

<p>If this Bill becomes law, the distribution of harmful publications, if it is carried on, will be done in secrecy, and it will be difficult for the police to obtain evidence on which to base proceedings in respect of a particular work. The whole object of the powers of search and seizure given by this Clause is to enable the police, once proceedings have been initiated, to search the premises of the person concerned and to prevent the further circulation of the horror publications by seizing any other copies of a particular work, and, of course, copies of any other works to which they have reasonable cause to believe that the Bill applies.<br/>
No copies seized can be destroyed unless the person concerned is convicted in respect of each individual work. There are, therefore, ample safeguards against any abuse of the power of seizure. I may add that the</p>

<p>I think that the point has entirely escaped my hon. Friend. Suppose a police officer arrives at the premises and, when he is there, finds that the owner is a purveyor of pornography, which is quite different from horror comics; and that the policeman says, " I am going to seize the Decameron,' because I think he is going to try to introduce a pornographic edition of it." Would my hon. Friend deal with that point?</p>

<p>The hon. Member is making his speech twice over. 1 have not yet had an opportunity to answer that point. I was proposing to mention another matter before dealing with that.<br/>
The powers provided by Clause 3 are much less drastic than those in the Obscene Publications Act, 1857, which enable premises to be searched and articles to be seized without any criminal proceedings being brought against the person concerned. My hon. Friend said


that the words he proposes to leave out might refer to dirty postcards. Of course, they could refer to no such thing. The words are
<q> any other work to which this Act applies.</q>
In other words, a work within the definition in Clause 1 of the Bill. That certainly does not mean dirty postcards.<br/>
My hon. Friend went on to suggest that notwithstanding that the Bill does not apply to such works, nevertheless they may be seized. Of course, in seizing works, the police would first have to have reasonable cause to believe that they were works to which the Bill applied. They would also have to see that the Bill did apply. If they did not do so, they would not be covered by this Measure and their seizure would not be made lawful by this Bill. I do not think that my hon. Friend should press his Amendment.</p>

<p>I hope that the hon. Member for the Isle of Thanet (Mr. Rees-Davies) will withdraw this Amendment. I wish to support the views advanced by the Joint Under-Secretary. The books at which the Bill is aimed appear periodically, and different issues are generally to be found on the same stall or in the same bookshop. If we have to specify the January issue, or the February issue, or the August issue, and so on, before these works can be seized, I think that we should be putting a hindrance in the way of the police in dealing with notorious offenders, which is something we should not wish to do.<br/>
An officer might go to premises in the first instance to see, for example, the January issue of a publication.which was the one that he was after. He might notice a pile of such publications in some obscure corner of the shop&#x2014;because, as the hon. Gentleman says, this will be carried on with some degree of secrecy. Before getting to the January issue he might have to examine several others which would be immune from action. I can visualise that his activities might be hampered and an unnecessary amount of extra work created for him.<br/>
I do not think that the fears expressed by the hon. Member are justified, and he might find that he is supporting the people whom, I am sure, he does not wish to support. I am convinced by what has been said by the Joint Under-Secretary

that this is a reasonable arrangement to make the Bill workable.</p>

This Amendment deals with the situation after seizure. It is quite a simple Amendment with, I think, quite a reasonable purpose. The object is to make sure that, having seized a work under this Bill, the police and the authorities will act quickly in bringing a prosecution. It may well be, through some dilatoriness on the part of the police, or some doubt which may have overtaken them about whether the publication is one on which proceedings should be instituted, that they may drag the matter on for weeks, perhaps months, during the whole of which time the Sword of Damocles is hanging over the publisher&#x2014;it may be quite unjustly.<br/>

<p>This Amendment is unnecessary for the following reason. So far as England and Wales are concerned, the Police Property Act, 1897, provides that where any property has come into the possession of the police in connection with any criminal charge

The person whose property is seized by virtue of a warrant granted under Clause 3 of this Bill could, therefore, make an application to the court if proceedings were not brought within a reasonable time.

This, also, is a very simple Amendment, and I do not know whether the Joint Under-Secretary will say that it, too. is unnecessary.

I believe that in the Obscene Publications Act, 1857, there is a provision similar to that intended in this Amendment, and if there was any very strong feeling about it, it would be possible to put in some provision of the kind in this Bill.

<p>I think that this is a point which the Government might consider in the light of what the Joint Under-Secretary of State has just said. Mistakes do happen, even with the police, and material might disappear. I speak as one who a few years ago used to see a great deal of gambling material brought into the Epsom Magistrates Court on the day after the Derby. I make no allegations against the Metropolitan Police, for whom I have the greatest respect, but I know that some of the machines brought in disappeared very shortly after the case had been heard, without the unfortunate defendant who had lost them being given any opportunity of considering whether he would add to the fortunes of lawyers by appealing.<br/>
Some of these things might be very tempting to have privately, and I suggest that this is the kind of thing concerning which it would be wise for the Govern-


ment to consider putting an express provision into the Bill so that nobody could be in any doubt that a wrong would be committed if the property were not available during the days stated.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 3, line 6, at the end, to add:
<q>(2) The Customs authorities shall within twenty-eight days bring proceedings under this Act against the person from whom matter was seized, or in the case of non-personal seizure shall within a reasonable time bring proceedings in the appropriate court of law to decide whether the seized matter falls within the provisions of this Act. If such proceedings are not brought within twenty-eight days such seized matter shall be returned forthwith to the person from whom it was seized, or in the case of non-personal seizure to the consignee.</q>
This is an Amendment of some importance and deals with the proceedings where a seizure is made of publications objected to by the Customs authorities. It also deals with a point which was raised by the hon. and learned Member for Northwich (Mr. J. Foster), in his speech on Second Reading, when he pointed out, as I readily admit, that the point here raised is one which certainly concerns this Bill, but which goes a little wider inasmuch that it affects the whole procedure of Customs seizure of objectionable literature.<br/>
In this Bill, we are giving the Customs authorities a new power which, up to the present, they have not possessed, and it is,

therefore, appropriate that we should consider how that power should be exercised. The objection to the procedure which applies to obscene literature&#x2014;and which would apply to these harmful publications if this Amendment were not accepted&#x2014;is that if matter is seized by the Customs authorities there is no onus on them to initiate a prosecution against the people from whom such matter is seized, or to take any court action at all, and the matter only comes before a court if the initiative is taken by the person from whom the matter is seized or to whom it is addressed.<br/>
That seems to me to be putting the initiative the wrong way round. One ought not to put the Customs authorities into a position in which they can decide whether or not a matter is objectionable, thus leaving such judgment, in the great number of cases, not to be decided by a court. I suggest that where the Customs authorities think it appropriate, under the terms of this Measure, to seize matter coming into the country, they should initiate a prosecution in the same way as in the case of matter seized by a police officer.<br/>
I speak with some hesitation on this point, and I am sure that the hon. and learned Solicitor-General will correct me if I am wrong, but I think that this provision might actually strengthen the Bill in some respects. 1 am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Kirkdale (Mr. Keenan) will be glad to hear me say that, because, as the Bill stands, there might be a difficulty in taking action on a criminal charge against an importer who might be an important person so far as the dissemination of such literature is concerned.<br/>
This Amendment, like so many others, is not, I agree, perfectly drafted. But the intention is to allow such criminal proceedings to be taken against the importer, and also to move away from the undesirable position in which Customs authorities can take action without having that action decided in a court of law.</p>

<p>I should prefer to discuss this matter with the hon. Member for Stechford (Mr. Roy Jenkins) in the wider context in which he is particularly interested when the discussion has reference


to the wider context. I cannot advise the Committee to accept the Amendment, for reasons which I am not sure the hon. Member has in mind. I am not referring to the actual words of the Amendment, but to the pattern which he proposes to set up by it. He is dealing with two different kinds of seizure, one of which is personal, and which relates to the finding of a horror comic upon a passenger arriving somewhere, and the other non-personal, which deals with the normal case of imported goods.<br/>
The difficulty which this would raise in connection with a passenger is that proceedings would have to be instituted under Clause 2, and it would have to be proved that that passenger had the work in his possession for the purpose of selling it or letting it upon hire. That would obviously be an extremely difficult matter for the prosecution to prove. On the other hand, the mischief to which we are all directing our endeavours is performed once the work comes into the country. The Amendment would, therefore, not be very satisfactory in that respect; it would provide a small let-out in relation to that kind of seizure.<br/>
An entirely different procedure seems to be proposed in the case of non-personal seizure. It is rather difficult to visualise what is involved, because the Amendment does not suggest any power by which the defendant should appear in court, and there is no power in law, under the Customs and Excise Act, 1952, or the Magistrates' Courts Act. In the case of a non-personal seizure, if the person who has had certain works seized wants to protest he can do so but, as the hon. Member will appreciate, in the vast majority of cases concerning the kind of traffic at which we are now aiming the importer does not want to protest; he is only too glad to keep quiet, in which case the works are, in due course, condemned by a court or left seized.<br/>
It does not seem to us to be a good idea to use up the time of the courts by making it necessary to institute proceedings against a person who is only too anxious to leave things alone, rather than have his name mentioned in connection with the importation of such works.</p>

<p>Such persons would be caught, because they would be offending a Customs regulation. The hon. Member will see that the last words of Clause 4 provide that publications of the kind with which we are dealing come into the category of prohibited importations, and a person importing them will be liable to the usual penalties for trying to evade Customs and Excise provisions.<br/>
If the person whose works have been seized wishes to challenge the seizure there is no difficulty about his doing so. He has a month in which to do so, and he can claim that his goods should not be condemned. The effect of the Amendment would be to create a privileged and completely unique position for horror comics. There does not seem to be any good reason for putting traffickers in horror comics in an especially privileged position.<br/>
The experience of one hundred years has shown that the only sound method of controlling prohibited imports is to give the Customs authorities the power of seizure. This process has been working for a great many years and was last approved by the House when it consolidated the various Customs enactments in 1952.</p>

<p>I could not fully enlighten the hon. Member without reference, but he will be aware that goods are seized by the Customs authorities upon an enormous variety of grounds, such as public safety, national security and smuggling. There does not seem to be any valid reason for distinguishing publications which this House desires to keep out of the country from other matter that might be smuggled.<br/>
There is yet another point to be considered. At present, the would-be trafficker in such publications can take a chance on their not being caught at the docks or on their way into the country. The hon. Member's Amendment would give him another chance. The Customs authorities would then be obliged to bring them before a court, and that court might not feel justified in condemning them. That would seem to provide an additional encouragement to such people.</p>

<p>I hope that the Solicitor-General will tell the Committee that he will give this matter some further thought. His first objection to the Amendment was that it would necessitate the institution of proceedings under Clause 2, which would entail the necessity to prove the intention to sell. I thought that he gave the answer to that objection in the latter part of his speech, when he pointed out that the prosecution would not be instituted under Clause 2 but under the appropriate provisions of the Customs and Excise Act, 1952.</p>

<p>The Solicitor-General quite properly pointed out that the Committee should in no sense be wedded to the wording of the Amendment, and should pay much more attention to its purpose. That is the usual practice in this House. He also said that there was really no case for making a special exception with respect to this kind of publication.<br/>
I do not hold any brief for such publications, but a great deal of the argument which we have heard has been upon the footing that we are here trespassing&#x2014;no doubt perfectly justifiably and, indeed, necessarily&#x2014;upon the complete freedom of publication. I repeat that this is a necessary Bill, but that does not prevent us from making changes where changes are necessary.<br/>
The case for the Amendment is that these types of publication should be differentiated from the wider categories of commerce which are imported in contradiction to the provisions of the Customs and Excise Act and other relative enactments. We say that it is not in the public interest that the Customs authorities should be able to pass judgment upon certain imported publications and that that judgment should, in effect, remain unchallenged, as it virtually does, so long as the onus for testing the validity of the action of the Customs authorities rests upon the importer.<br/>
We say that the condemnation by the Customs authorities is an important matter, which should not take place as a matter of course. If the Customs authorities elect to say that a certain publica-

tion offends against the provisions of the Bill, public interest requires that that decision should be tested. As the Solicitor-General has pointed out, it will not always be so tested if the onus rests upon the importer, because he may want to keep quiet about the matter.<br/>
We say that the Customs authorities ought, therefore, to be put to their election. Either they are prepared to back their judgment by a prosecution in the courts or they are not&#x2014;and if they are not the automatic result ought to be that the supposedly offending articles are returned to the importer. There is a case for treating these publications in a different way from that which is accorded to the wider category of imported goods which are prohibited. I simply ask the Solicitor-General to bear in mind the fact that we really have some feelings about the Amendment, which, in the first place, was proposed not by an hon. Member from this side of the House but by the hon. and learned Member for Northwich (Mr. J. Foster). I put it to the Solicitor-General that this matter requires consideration. I hope he will think about it again and see whether effect cannot be given to the Amendment.</p>

<p>The Amendment, as the Solicitor-General says, is in two parts, the first part dealing with personal seizure. We should consider the poor foreigner coming into this country. He does not know the law. Under the Amendment, as I understand the matter, the Customs would have to bring an action against anyone from whom they seized one of these papers.</p>

<p>I wonder whether the foreigner would wish this to happen. He would much rather sacrifice one or two publications which he came in with, not knowing that they were contrary to the law, and he would not want to have an action brought against him. We ought to consider the convenience not only of persons who know the law of this country but of persons who will not know the law, whether foreigners, or British subjects who have been abroad for some time.<br/>
I quite understand what the Amendment is driving at, and I agree with something in the second part of it, although I am not certain that this point is not already covered in the Bill. The first part suggests a most cumbersome form of procedure to deal with what is likely to be a very small matter.</p>

<p>I cannot agree with what was said by the hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. N. Macpherson). He is very worried about the foreigner's feelings, but the foreigner is not entitled to better treatment than anybody else. One who travels to another country has to do what is expected of him, or accept the consequences. We have to do it when we go abroad. There is no case for consideration there.<br/>
Two points worry me. I am not anxious to make the Bill less effective, but I am not satisfied that the Customs authorities are in a very strong position. I should like to see the position strengthened. It does not seem that action will be taken promptly by the Customs. It may be rather delayed action of the kind about which we have often complained. I agree that there should be a time limit. Where the Customs authorities have made a seizure and proceedings can be taken, the position should not be left there indefinitely. There ought to be a period during which action could be taken. The time that has been suggested is reasonable, and the Government should look at the matter again from that point of view.</p>

<p>If we are to extend censorship by Customs, as this proposal undoubtedly does, let us see precisely what will be brought in. Importers with criminal intent will try to bring in not publications, but plates. Plates will be what the Customs will have to detect. The Customs will have to ascertain what is in packages, and which cannot easily be seen. If films or plates are brought in, the Customs will be put into difficulties. I do not think it is practical to ensure the seizure of this class of goods at the moment of entry.<br/>
We are in danger of opening the door very widely to censorship by Customs officers. They are not only to deal with plates of publications, but of other people, since photography is very widespread.<br/>
My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Northwich (Mr. J. Foster) made a very wise speech on this subject during the Second Reading. He said:
<q> I am not sure whether somebody who imports a work of this kind is open to punishment under the Bill "&#x2014;</q>
he is not, as I see it, open to punishment in the first place&#x2014;
<q> If he is open to punishment under a Section of the Customs Act, I should have thought that that was inadequate and that the Bill ought to provide that anybody who imports a work of this sort should be caught by Clause 2.</q>
That is strengthened. My hon. and learned Friend went on to say:
<q> It is also undesirable that when these works are imported the machinery of prosecution should be started by the Customs and that, in a sense, the person who imports them should have the onus of having to object to the seizure.</q>
He was asked by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Central (Mr. McInnes) a question in these terms:
<q> The hon. and learned Gentleman has referred to the importation of these publications, but surely it is not so much the importation of the publication as of the plate or film. Would he seek seizure of the plate or film? </q>
My hon. and learned Friend replied:
<q> Yes, but I would like the Bill to say that if the plates were seized the person importing them should be prosecuted. Most of the prosecutions have occurred under the procedure by which the Customs judge whether the plates infringe an Act of Parliament. They then seize them."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 22nd February, 1955; Vol. 537, c. 1090 and 1091.]</q>
I will just stop there.<br/>
How can they judge, until they have seized the plates first They seize them, and put them under the proper processes in order to see what they are. Then the Customs has to set itself up as deciding whether this is or is not a horror comic. How can it be<br/>
<q> wholly or mainly a story told in pictures,</q>
as Clause 1 requires This is an individual plate and it cannot come within the ambit of Clause 1.<br/>
This is why I think there will be difficulty about this procedure. It certainly will not be easy. I am by no means satisfied that the Amendment has been properly drafted. We are on rather dangerous ground here. I invite the Government. while not giving way to the Amendment, to say that they will look at the matter from that point of view, and


find something better before the Report stage.</p>

<p>If my hon. Friend thinks I was trying to insult him he is wrong. I was trying to compliment him. If he thinks my compliments are insults I had better try my insults. I genuinely wanted to pay a tribute to him for his speech, in which he appealed to the Government to exercise a liberal spirit about the Amendment and to recognise the validity in what was proposed. In all fairness to my hon. Friend, I was saying&#x2014;I know he feels strongly about the rest of the Bill&#x2014;that it did him credit that he was prepared to support the Amendment. Although I respect his opinions but dislike them very much, I wanted to compliment him.<br/>
I also wanted to illustrate the topsy-turvy situation we have got into on the Amendment. Not only have we had my hon. Friend, I will not say giving the views of Liberalism this time but certainly contradicting what he has said on previous Amendments, but we have had the Opposition Front Bench pressing the Government very hard to accept the Amendment. I am altogether in favour of that slight modification of previous proceedings.<br/>
Even more remarkable, we have had a speech from the National Liberal Party. It is a welcome innovation. I thought we were going to have a full burst of Free Trade doctrine. The hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. N. Macpherson) spoke for the rights of foreigners, but would not like the protections which we would give them. He thought that this was a good Amendment on that account. Then we heard an hon. Member opposite, who has been a most consistent contributor to these debates, giving better reasons why the Government should accept a different point of view than the Government have been able to advance against

it. I hope that the Government will accept the technical arguments which have been put forward.<br/>
I confess I was a little dubious about the merits of the Amendment when I heard of it. I was not sure that it was really necessary. When I heard the Solicitor-General I was absolutely convinced of its necessity. The Solicitor-General argued against the Amendment on grounds which really make a laughing stock of a large part of the Bill. He does not seem to understand what we have been arguing about all along. I am glad that we have plenty of time in which to discuss the rest of the Bill, because we may be able to educate the right hon. and learned Gentleman as to what we are concerned about.<br/>
What some of us on this side, and many on the other, have been arguing throughout is that we really think there is some difference between dealing with the publication of ideas, in whatever form, and dealing with other commodities. The main case of the Solicitor-General against this Amendment is to say, " Why should we give special treatment to people who happen to be publishing ideas, however monstrous? "</p>

<p>That is prejudging the issue.<br/>
The Bill is trying to decide which ideas should be denounced as monstrous and damnable and which should not. Here we are dealing with a commodity&#x2014;the expression of ideas, whether evil or not &#x2014;and that is a different commodity from soap, coal, coffee and the other things which we import. The Solicitor-General says, " What is the difference? Why should we make any distinction with regard to the printed word or to pictorial representations?"</p>

<p>This is the reason why many of us have wished to scrutinise this Bill carefully. It is precisely because we do believe that in dealing with the printed or spoken word, or the expression of ideas in any form, different principles should apply than would be applied to the exchange of other commodities. If my hon. Friend does not recognise that distinction he will not be able to accept any case for free speech or freedom of


the printed word which has been expressed anywhere. The whole case for a different treatment of free speech, the whole case against censorship rests on the fact that the argument for free speech and free opinion&#x2014;</p>

<p>I am perfectly well aware of that, Sir Rhys, but the Solicitor-General rested his case exactly on the ground that if the importers of alleged horror comics were to be distinguished from those of other commodities it would be most unfair.

<p>I take the old-fashioned view that good Liberal arguments are always relevant, and that such arguments are particularly relevant when the Solicitor-General says, " I do not draw any distinction between people who are selling ideas, whether good or bad, and people who are selling uranium or nylon stockings."<br/>
I am sure that many of us have had differences with the Customs authorities on many matters. It may be very regrettable, but one of the cases in which the standards of public honesty are perhaps lower than they should be is when a person goes through the Customs. It may be very regrettable, but there are large numbers of people who, although in other matters are law-abiding, when they face the Customs authorities think, " If I can get past here it will be clever."</p>

The Amendment has been moved in the most reasonable fashion. The only response is an argument from the right hon. and learned Gentleman that none of us would accept. I should have thought that it would hasten the whole procedure were the Solicitor-General now to withdraw his argument and say that since there has been such a powerful case put from the Opposition Front Bench he is prepared to accede to their demands, particularly in view of the assistance that the Opposition Front Bench has given to the Government in getting the Bill through as speedily as it is going through.</p>

<p>I was born a Liberal. I developed into a Socialist because I saw no other end for Liberalism. I am quite certain that Socialism without Liberalism can be the most appalling tyranny.

Documents that may fall within the prohibition of Clause 4 will be seized merely because the Customs think those documents fall within that prohibition.

It is the general view of the Committee that any one who brings these things into the country should receive punishment, and if the Government are not prepared to accept an Amendment on these lines, although not necessarily in these words&#x2014;for I see that we cannot very well proceed under Clause 2 for importation&#x2014;then we ought to have a very full explanation of how proceedings can be taken under existing legislation.</p>

<p>I do not pledge myself to having considered this aspect in detail at the moment, because the Amendment as it stood did not raise it, but clearly somebody evading a Customs prohibition would be subject to Customs penalties, in a bad case going literally as far as imprisonment. Such penalties are, of course, seizure and the usual series of penalties which attach to persons ordinarily called smugglers. After all, this is what the smuggler is doing&#x2014;importing something to which a statute attaches a prohibition on imports.<br/>
I hope the right hon. Member for South Shields (Mr. Ede) and the right hon. and learned Member for Neepsend (Sir F. Soskice) will accept at once that if they say they are serious in their belief about the Amendment, then the Government will of course accept that proposition, as I should accept it personally, and in consequence would look very carefully at the matter. We will do that. But I do not want to hold out false hopes about it because I feel that in speaking about " censorship " by the Customs in this context one is perhaps being a little artificial &#x2014;and I use the word " censorship " in


inverted commas. We have all lived with and not disapproved of " censorship " by the Customs in relation to things like obscene publications or, to take an example admittedly far away, dirty postcards. We have all submitted for a long time to the Customs " censoring " those in the sense in which we are now speaking.<br/>
I assure the hon. Member for Devon-port (Mr. Foot) first of all that I can never conceal my delight at listening to him in the House or elsewhere and secondly, that so far from failing to understand what he has been talking about in the discussion, that has not been my difficulty at all. I understood very well. My difficulty was to understand what it had to do with the kind of publications which we are dealing with in the Bill. That is rather a different matter. I hope and believe that the Customs officer trying to do his best does not want to be a censor of ideas or great works of art or to frustrate creative artistic products. He is only doing his best to try to catch something which we all regard as a horror comic.</p>

<p>How can the Customs officer determine that this is a prohibited article under the Act without having examined the whole of it? It must " as a whole," if we read Clause 1, tend to corrupt, and we shall therefore have Customs officers allowing every one to get through smuggling watches and nylon stockings while they are looking at a horror comic in order to be certain that the whole of it would corrupt.</p>

<p>I hope that by curing one evil we shall not encourage the practice of bringing in watches in one's socks or wherever people do bring them in. I am not giving the hon. Member any tips.<br/>
These publications, in the ordinary way, are delivered in bulk. The matrix case is a different one and is a serious one. I do not think that the question of the publication " as a whole " is a worry, because it conies in " as a whole " in bulk if it comes in printed. The matrix is different. I think one is going a little far in thinking that the Customs officer will make himself the censor of serious literature or of the disseminator of serious ideas. I doubt whether, when he says that, the hon. Member for Devonport (Mr. Foot) has

had time&#x2014;I was going to say to read, but that is the wrong word to see enough of these horror comics to visualise the object at which we are aiming this Bill.<br/>
It is true that the Lord Chamberlain is allowed to censor, but the difference between the Lord Chamberlain and the Customs officer is that when the Lord Chamberlain says that a bit of strip-tease goes too far and shall not happen, one cannot send him a notice and challenge him in the courts, whereas if the Customs say, " Your publication is a horror comic " and one desires to say that it is not, it is only necessary to send the Customs a notice to make them take proceedings before they can condemn it.<br/>
For these reasons, I do not want to raise false hopes. I would desire to deal with the matter in courtesy, because this is a Bill which has no inter-party element about it at all. We are only trying to get rid of an evil. The right hon. Gentleman has suggested that this matter should be looked at again, and I will, of course, look at it again. But I do not want to create false hopes because it creates great difficulties in relation to Customs practice. I do not believe that there is any grave danger that we should be having our ideas censored by Customs officers as opposed to having horror comics provisionally condemned by them.</p>

<q> No provision of this Act, other than the provisions of the last foregoing section, shall extend to Northern Ireland.</q>
I have no particular desire to extend this Bill to Northern Ireland, or indeed to anywhere else. I certainly do not want to press this Amendment at all hard, but I should like to know what the Government have in mind about it.<br/>
The provisions of the last foregoing section are specifically applied to Northern Ireland because no doubt it is thought that there may otherwise be a


loophole in the ringed fence so far as Northern Ireland is concerned. These publications could be bought in Northern Ireland and shipped from there, thus getting round the provisions in that way. What is the Home Secretary expecting? Is he expecting that the Northern Ireland Parliament might take some parallel legislative action? If that is not so, what is the position in the horror comic industry which uproots itself from Leicester or Glasgow, or wherever it has been firmly established, and takes itself to Belfast or London? What then happens? Has the Home Secretary considered the possibilities in that event?</p>

<p>I can briefly tell the hon. Member the purpose of lines 17 and 18. It is shortly this. If the Amendment were accepted, the effect would be to apply the Bill as a whole to Northern Ireland. Legislation on this kind of question in Northern Ireland is, of course, the constitutional responsibility of the Government of Northern Ireland, except in so far as the prohibition of importation is concerned. That is one of the matters reserved for the United Kingdom Parliament.</p>

Whether or not the Northern Ireland Parliament passes legislation to deal with this sort of publication, the Clause is needed to make the Customs fence effective without at the same time encroaching on the legislative functions of the Northern Ireland Parliament. Without it, it would be impossible to take effective proceedings against a person in Great Birtain for having imported works in his possession because he could always say he got them from Northern Ireland. I do hope the hon. Member will not press the Amendment.</p>

The reason we selected ten years was this. One knows that the publishers of these publications in this country have temporarily gone out of business, but they have threatened what they will do if this Bill does not become law. We thought it would be as well to give them notice clearly that the House was determined to stamp out these publications. A period much less than ten years might not achieve that purpose.<br/>
Ten years would give any Government that was in power various Governments may be in power within ten years&#x2014;ample opportunity of seeing how far this trouble has totally disappeared. It is unlikely that people who are hoping that with a short interlude they could start again would feel that they could hold their forces in reserve for ten years and start again. Of course, if a Government came to the conclusion, during the ten years, that the evil had disappeared they could quite well come to the House and ask for the repeal of this Measure. What we are concerned to do is to give the evil doers stern notice that we do not intend that this harmful traffic shall be allowed to continue.</p>

<p>I am sure that this Amendment, which I am willing to accept, is the one the Committee would prefer. I should like to add a word to what has been said by the right hon. Member for South Shields (Mr. Ede). My hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Mr. N. Macpherson) thought that perhaps 10 years was too long. We think three, or even six, years is probably too short. I agree with the right hon. Member that we want to make it perfectly plain that we really mean to do away with these publications. I have no doubt that if this Bill had not been brought in the publications would have been resumed. The bringing in of the Bill has practically stopped them. At the same time, we are anxious to make it perfectly plain that the Bill is aimed only at the publications which we have in mind. That is why I am glad to accept the right hon. Gentleman's Amendment.</p>

<p>I am extremely glad that the Government have accepted one of these Amendments. It deals with one of the main concerns which many of us on this side have discussed during the debates on the Bill: that is to say, we feared that

an Act introduced for an entirely different purpose might, after a number of years, be distorted for a quite opposite purpose.<br/>
When my hon. Friend said earlier that he was desirous of trying to stamp out horror comics, and only horror comics, I accepted that that was what he had been seeking to do throughout, although what many of us have feared is that the Bill was not drawn sufficiently sharply to achieve that result and only that result, and we might have had differences of opinion on the matter.<br/>
Personally, I should prefer the Government to limit the period to a shorter term. It is a fantasy to think that in five or six years' time, if the evil of horror comics is stamped out, the Government would come along one fine day and say, " Here is a Bill which is not in operation and is not having any value. Therefore, we think we will wipe it off the Statute Book." It would be all the more unlikely that the Government would wipe it off if the Act were being improperly used at that time. I should, therefore, prefer a shorter period.<br/>
One of the main demands made during Second Reading was that the Government should fix a period. If they are prepared to accept this proposal, it makes a great difference to the rest of the Bill. I hope that the way in which this pressure was exerted during Second Reading, and the way in which it has influenced the Government, will make the Government understand&#x2014;and, 1 would have hoped, make the courts understand when they operate the provisions of the Bill&#x2014;what is the feeling of Parliament about it.<br/>
Although many of us on this side have been criticised by the Government and by the Leader of the House, who has expressed his disappointment that the Bill has not proceeded more rapidly, we have very considerably improved the Bill. We have not been perfectionist in our demands. We have not tried to make a silk purse out of the cow's ear that the Government have offered to us. [HON. MEMBERS: " SOW'S ear.") I am sorry&#x2014;we have not tried to make a silk purse out of the sow's ear that the Government have offered us. I am sure everyone understood exactly what I meant. Nevertheless, we have done our best. Therefore, the Government ought to be extremely grateful to those who have imported some Liberalism into a Bill


from which, when it was originally presented, that quality was absent.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That the Clause be read a Second time.<br/>
We seem to have been getting on so well and in such a friendly fashion that one can hardly recognise the Committee when one compares today's sitting with our previous sittings. We have had the Under-Secretary telling us that it was perfectly reasonable to move Amendments in Committee. We were very glad to hear that surprising view expressed from the Treasury Bench. We followed that up with a general good feeling all round, with support from the Government Front Bench, to whch my hon. Friend the Member for Devonport (Mr. Foot) referred, and by the Government accepting the last Amendment.<br/>
That concession and the concession about the consent of the Attorney-General are important. I am not underestimating the importance of either point. I am grateful to the Home Secretary for going as far, but I feel that those concessions have not completely cleared up all the possible difficulties in relation to the Bill. The proposed new Clause deals

with perhaps one of the main points of outstanding importance. The provision in the Clause is a very reasonable one indeed. There can be no question at all of the Clause in any way weakening the Bill or in any way making it more possible for people to disseminate horror comics or objectionable publications of any sort.<br/>
The Clause tries to provide against one of the difficulties which has existed in the law relating to objectionable literature up to this time. That is the position in which action is taken against the bookseller but not against the author or publisher, or perhaps against the bookseller and publisher and not against the author. In each case the bookseller is the most likely person to choose to plead guilty in order to avoid trouble to himself. There is then no possibility of the person whose good name is more directly involved than the bookseller's having the opportunity of offering a defence for the book.<br/>
This is a difficulty which I can illustrate by giving one example. I hope that I shall not be accused, not by the Chair but by the Government Front Bench or the Opposition Front Bench, of taking the matter too wide, but in considering how the law works in practice in a comparable field we have to refer to the law in relation to obscene publications. There was an example in relation to the sale of Havelock Ellis's book " Sexual Inversion," in which Havelock Ellis prepared an elaborate defence which he could not present because the bookseller pleaded guilty and the author's case was prejudged. The fact that we are here dealing with a smaller and narrower issue is no reason why it should be dealt with in an unfair and unreasonable way.<br/>
Those who draw, write or in any way produce horror comics may be highly undesirable people, but that is no reason why, if the work for which they have been responsible is made the subject of a criminal charge, they should not be given an opportunity to come before the court to say why, in their view, it ought not to be the subject of a charge. That seems to me an absolutely elementary principle of British justice. I hope that the Clause will not be rejected on the ground, to which the Solicitor-General came very near on a previous Amendment, that because this is not the position


with regard to the whole law relating to obscene publication, we cannot put this provision in the Bill. We can make a small start here, and I make no secret of the fact that I hope that it will be extended over a wider area.<br/>
This is a provision which cannot weaken the Bill, but which can give people who may have their good names besmirched a reasonable chance to deploy before the court the defence which they wish to put for their work.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Stechford (Mr. Roy Jenkins) points out that the matter of grief in the sense of causing some person to be aggrieved in this context has really arisen in the wider field of obscene publications. But I want to make the point to the Committee that that is really a different case for this reason. This Bill is creating a criminal offence by the selling, letting for hire and so forth of these publications, but under the Obscene Publications Act no offence is created at all. The retailer is not defending under that statute. All that happens is that the particular publication is seized, and one well knows from professional experience how exasperated is the author of a publication which has been seized because he cannot go before the magistrate and say how admirable a work it is because he has no status to be there.<br/>
But with this kind of prosecution the position is different, because here a publication cannot be condemned unless there is somebody before the court who is being challenged on the ground that he has committed a criminal offence by, as the case may be, selling or letting for hire or printing or publishing the publication. He has got to be there. I would suggest that there is much less risk dealing with the publications we are here dealing with than with some work of art or of literary merit.<br/>
But there is this difficulty in practice. Under this new Clause, the prosecution have got to give an opportunity to the person who drew or composed one of these horror comics to be there in person. That would be very difficult in some cases because the creators of these masterpieces of offensive art are not so proud of their work that they sign it. We would have the greatest difficulty in finding out who they are. How on earth one is to provide

an opportunity for these people to come before the court to defend their works I do not know.<br/>
I cannot provide an opportunity to defend the work unless I notify about the prosecution. But supposing the artist of one of these series of horror pictures happens to be in Philadelphia. I make no accusation against any particular place in the United States, from which I understand many of these publications come. But how can I afford an opportunity to such a person to gratify his desire if I am dealing with the matter on a police basis if I do not know who he is because he does not own his work? Therefore, what is the good of this provision if I do not know the artists concerned?<br/>
There is another difficulty. Suppose we are dealing with works where there are stories told in pictures. I speak rather in ignorance of the matter, but I believe it is found that only one artist relates to one story, but there might be found a number of artists relating to a number of stories and there would be some delay at getting them all identified and giving them the opportunity of gratifying the desire to which this new Clause relates. Under what status do they come?<br/>
In the ordinary kind of case which would arise one would expect that the retailer, having had his stock of what were thought to be obvious horror comics seized, would prefer to plead guilty than advertise that he sold such wares. Is the court not to be able to accept that plea of guilty until it has found and given an opportunity to a variety of American artists to come and explain that these are not horror comics at all? Are proceedings in justice to be held up until that is done?<br/>
I do not at all mock at the underlying idea <i>in</i> this Clause in relation to the wider field to which the hon. Gentleman spoke, which is not here in question. But I submit it would be most impracticable to apply a Clause of this kind which is really unworkable to the kind of publication with which we are dealing. For that reason, I do not advise the Committee to accept the new Clause.</p>

<p>I think that the learned Solicitor-General is quibbling. The purpose of my hon. Friend's new Clause is very simple. It is that if an author or an artist wishes to defend


himself, and feels that he ought to be able to do so, he should not be prevented because the newsagent, or someone else being prosecuted, pleads guilty.<br/>
Is it beyond the legal ingenuity of the Government and the Solicitor-General to devise means whereby a man so smeared should have the right to defend himself? I do not think that it is. I have no exaggerated opinion of the legal department of the Government, but I believe that if the Government desired to give the man this protection they could do so. Instead of even discussing this new Clause, to decide whether some words might be changed in order to provide this protection, the Solicitor-General has said, " Oh, no, the thing is entirely impracticable."<br/>
It is a perfectly simple purpose which my hon. Friend has in mind, and one which is desirable; as is illustrated by the law on obscene libel, the only experience we have in the operation of this kind of law. Yet the Solicitor-General does not make any attempt to discover whether there is some way to protect a man charged with having engaged in this kind of act, if he wishes to defend himself. The illustration given by my hon. Friend is exactly apposite. Havelock Ellis's book was put in court and a charge made against the bookseller, who pleaded guilty. Havelock Ellis was unable to defend himself, because the bookseller pleaded guilty. An author has no protection, and we are asking that he should be protected.<br/>
If these people are guilty of these horrific crimes, they should have the right, at any rate, to defend themselves, if they wish. To say that it is impossible to devise any legal method by which they can be secured seems to me to be an outrage on commonsense. It would be much better were the Solicitor-General to apply himself to the case which has been put, and to say that if a man's work is to be judged in this way, he should be able to defend himself if he wishes.</p>

<p>So far as we know, the artists and authors do not live in this country at all, and we cannot prosecute outside this country. We do not

<p>In the early 19th and late 18th Centuries one of the ways in which books like " The Age of Reason " and " The Rights of Man " were suppressed was by prosecuting the wretched booksellers, and even their assistants. I have no doubt that we all have a pretty low opinion of people who thought that those works were worthy of prosecution.<br/>
From what the right hon. and gallant Gentleman has said, I take it that the reason he does not expect to prosecute any of the authors and artists concerned is because he believes that they live outside the jurisdiction&#x2014;</p>

<p>The Home Secretary cannot do so under Clause 2, where it states:

<p>I am very grateful to the hon. Gentleman for drawing my attention to that. If, in fact, it is the position that even if they were in this country they could not be proceeded against, that might in certain circumstances, well throw an unwarranted singleness of prosecution&#x2014;if I may use that phrase&#x2014;on the wretched bookseller or his assistants, who, presumably, would be liable for aiding and abetting the sale of the documents.<br/>
I hope it will be made quite clear that if either an author or an artist concerned with these publications can be found within the jurisdiction, and the Attorney-General finds that there is a case against the publication written or drawn by such a person, steps will be taken to see that proceedings are taken against him and that the wretched bookseller or the librarian is not left to bear the whole brunt of the matter.</p>

<p>I rise because I am sure that there has been some confusion on this point, and because I wish to support every word which my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General has said. Clause 2 is directed at the printer, the publisher and the retailer only. There is a reason for that. The author has not


been included, because, in practice, he is quite unable to be found.<br/>
What happens in practice is that the person who wants to purvey this muck gets hold of a number of young artists who are willing to draw this class of material. They do the drawings from which the matrices or the plates are made. Those may well be in foreign countries or in this country, but mainly abroad. Therefore, from the purely practical point of view, I can conceive of no person who had written, drawn or composed the material on those plates wanting to appear before the court.<br/>
I agree with every word of the principle put forward by the hon. Member for Stechford (Mr. Roy Jenkins). I can imagine nothing worse than the case in which an author of repute has signed his name to a book and is not allowed to appear in court because another person has advised the publisher to plead guilty. Though I am entirely with the hon. Gentleman in this, we should not confuse this Bill and the circumstances in which such a case would arise with the case of the author who may be proceeded against under the Obscene Publications Act.<br/>
There is such a sharp divergence that I cannot agree that in this instance there is any case for putting it into this Clause. Quite frankly, I do not believe that any counsel would find it of any asistance in this case.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That the Clause be read a Second time.<br/>
This Clause, as its language may indicate, is to some extent analogous to an Amendment to Clause 2 which was moved at an earlier stage in the Bill, though it covers a slightly different point, to which I shall refer in a moment.<br/>
As I understand the position from the arguments adduced upon the previous Motion, there are two alternative lines of approach to this question. The first is that no publication which can possibly be brought under the Bill can have any merit of any sort and the second is that if it has any merit it becomes the more damaging, and one must be especially careful of works which may be well drawn and have artistic merit, because they may nevertheless be corrupt. I suggest that those are two contradictory points of view.<br/>
The point about expert evidence is a fairly simple one. In considering whether a publication is objectionable there ought always to be a possibility of rebuttal on the ground that although the publication might be held by some people to have certain undesirable effects upon some other people, nevertheless it has certain substantial advantages. It would certainly be legitimate to argue that witnesses who had expert knowledge of the subjects dealt with, knew the publication, and were prepared to testify in its favour, should be allowed so to do.<br/>
Under the existing provisions of the law of obscene libel no such evidence is admissible; neither would it be under the provisions of the Bill. I freely admit that the new Clause applies with much greater force to the wider issue which we have had in our minds throughout our discussions. For that reason I shall not press the new Clause nearly as strongly as I should if we were dealing with that wider issue, but it is conceivable that the question may arise in the case of matter proceeded against under the Bill, and I therefore ask the Joint Under-Secretary to consider whether it is not reasonable to insert such a provision.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1955-03-29a.314.2" hansard_membership_id="8037" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/18719" speakername="Sir H. Lucas-Tooth" colnum="314" time="">
<p>The proposed new Clause is unnecessary. In view of the type of publication with which the Bill is concerned and the fact that no proceedings


can be taken without the consent of the Attorney-General, it is most unlikely that a court would ever require to hear evidence about the sort of matters referred to in the new Clause. I apprehend that in any circumstances in which it was thought necessary to call evidence of this kind, such evidence would clearly be admissible, even without the Clause. I do not think that that evidence could possibly be relevant to the question, but if any relevant evidence of an expert kind were required I imagine that it would be admitted in the ordinary way.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1955-03-29a.315.0" hansard_membership_id="6950" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/11654" speakername="Mr. Jenkins" colnum="315" time="">
<p>I think that the hon. Member is under a genuine misapprehension, which I should like to clear up. Here again we come to the borderline between the law of obscene libel and the law which the Bill would institute, but I should have thought that it would be within the knowledge of the hon. Member that in at least one of the cases in which action was taken in relation to the offence of obscene libel during the last year, expert evidence of the highest calibre was available to the court but was held to be not admissible.<br/>
Why does the hon. Member think that if such evidence existed it would be held to be admissible under the Bill without the new Clause, whereas, during the last year, it has been clearly held not to be admissible in cases relating to the offence of obscene libel?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1955-03-29a.315.1" hansard_membership_id="8037" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/18719" speakername="Sir H. Lucas-Tooth" colnum="315" time="">
<p>The law relating to obscene libel is quite different from that which would be enacted by the Bill. I do not say that any such evidence as the hon. Member suggests might be brought would always be admissible, but what I do say is that if, in some circumstances which I find it difficult to envisage, such evidence were relevant to the question whether or not the publication tended to corrupt, I apprehend that the court would admit it.<br/>
In any event I must therefore tell the Committee that the proposed alteration is unnecessary and for that reason the proposed new Clause should not be added to the Bill.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1955-03-29a.315.2" hansard_membership_id="6950" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/11654" speakername="Mr. Roy Jenkins" colnum="315" time="">
<p>The remarks which the Under-Secretary of State has made show&#x2014;and I do not say this disrespectfully&#x2014;an astonishing ignorance of the problem with which we are dealing. I understand that expert evidence has been

held to be admissible under the general law because the test of corruption is purely objective. We can only have this objective test where there is a tendency to corrupt. That is repeated in the Bill and it becomes irrelevant that the work has other merit.<br/>
I was shocked to hear the Under-Secretary of State say that he does not appreciate that point, and that the Amendment is unnecessary on that ground. One of the main burdens of our complaint against the Government is that, even having got the consent of the Attorney-General, we cannot think that he might make a mistake. We are continually having to accept that if the Attorney-General says that a prosecution must take place it is inconceivable that anything other than a highly undesirable work is involved. That is not in line with all past experience of the law, and I therefore ask the Under-Secretary to look closely at the matter again in case there is a possibility, which, I admit, is rather remote, that he will correct his previous statement.</p>

<p>Lord Justice Denning has said that everything that is relevant is admissible and everything that is irrelevant is inadmissible. The only reason why the evidence that the hon. Member for Stechford (Mr. Roy Jenkins) wishes to adduce might be ruled out is on the ground that it tends to usurp the functions of the court and to answer the very questions which the court itself must answer. It wishes to produce an expert in morals among other things who will decide what it is the court's function and sole function to decide. I am not sure whether that is the reason why such evidence is inadmissible under the law of obscene libel and I do not know whether it applies to this question.<br/>
The hon. Member has at least made out a case of doubt, and I would ask my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State to look at it again and consider whether the reason why the proposed new Clause is unnecessary or objectionable is for the reason I have suggested, that it seeks to usurp the functions of the court. We all know how dangerous experts are if they seek to dictate what the court shall decide. If that is the reason why the proposed new Clause is objectionable, then I should be against it.</p>

<p>In the absence of the Attorney-General, the Committee should be able to dispose of this matter quickly. Surely the Under-Secretary would be willing to say that he will look at the proposed new Clause in view of what has been said on both sides, and will make a statement on the Report stage. The Amendment previously moved was concerned partly with the same subject. The Under-Secretary might see whether on a question of law he was correct in what he told us, and whether he will reconsider the whole matter and make a further statement at a later stage.</p>

<p>From what my hon. Friend the Member for Darwen (Mr. Fletcher-Cooke) said I understood that he put the case as I tried to put it, but in a slightly different way&#x2014;although I think that I agree with what he said. It amounts to this. If the evidence is relevant it will be admitted. If it it not relevant it is no good saying that by law it shall be admitted. As it will be irrelevant it will be quite unnecessary to admit it. There is no point, therefore, in saying that the court shall admit evidence which is not relevant.</p>

<p>To clarify the position perhaps the Joint Under-Secretary will answer a question. We have necessarily to deal with a hypothetical case. If proceedings were taken against a book on the grounds that it was an obscene libel would the court admit as relevant <i>evidence</i> that it had been reviewed by the " Observer," " The Times Literary Supplement," the " Spectator," the " New Statesman " and even the " Tribune "?</p>

<p>I think it would be to the advantage of the House because, owing to what to outsiders seems a strange procedure, my only object in moving a Prayer against the second Regulations is to show how much better they are than the first.<br/>
The first Regulations deal with the problem of the interference caused to television by electric motors. I should like to say at the beginning that I am not one of those who adopt a somewhat superior attitude towards television. I am myself a television fan, and I also have in my house a number of radio sets which are in fairly frequent use and, as far as I know, fully licensed. Therefore, I approach this matter from a perfectly sympathetic point of view, appreciating the difficulty and appreciating also the importance of people behaving like good neighbours and not making a nuisance of themselves to other people. But the acceptance of that general approach does not settle the question whether or not these Regulations are necessary or whether, if they are necessary, they are the kind of Regulations that ought to be laid before the House.<br/>
It is possible that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Supply, who I understand, in the unfortunate absence of the Assistant Postmaster-General, is going to answer some of these points, may be inclined to say that this is all rather a fuss about very little and that there is not really very much involved. Of course,

that is a very old and well-worn excuse, and I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary's baby is as small as are most Ministerial ones.<br/>
The difference between these Regulations and the ones that follow is this. The second set of Regulations dealing with refrigerators refer to what is to be done in the manufacture of refrigerators, and that is a reasonable thing to do. It is reasonable to say that if somebody is going to put on the market an electrical apparatus, it ought to be made in such a way that it will not be a nuisance to other people. I do not think anyone can quarrel with that.<br/>
The present Regulations do not deal with that at all. They deal with the position of private citizens who in their own homes have got electrical apparatus which they have bought in perfectly good faith on the open market and which they have been using in many cases for quite a long time. Therefore, it is a serious matter. I hope that one of the things that the Parliamentary Secretary is going to tell us is precisely what the powers taken under these Regulations are, what the penalties are, what the procedure is as regards enforcement of them and what the right of entry into a house and the right of search are.<br/>
I think I know the answer. I think it is contained in Sections 11, 14 and 15 of the Wireless Telegraph Act, 1949, but I think the House and the public are entitled to know precisely what are the duties which have been laid upon them and what are the powers which the Government are taking in order to enforce those duties. They get precious little information from reading the Regulations and that is really the first point I want to make.<br/>
These Regulations are not technical Regulations dealing with professional and technical men who, in the normal course of their business, are able to cope with the problem. This is the position of the ordinary member of the public&#x2014;the enormous numbers of people who have got some type of electrical apparatus and who need to know to what type of apparatus the Regulations are going to apply, what precise test is going to be applied and what they have got to do to comply with the Regulations.<br/>
If they try to find out what is involved, most of them, and certainly I, will find it


somewhat difficult. The Regulations apply to electric motors
<q> having a continuous rating of less than 1 horse power per 1,000 revolutions per minute.</q>
How many housewives who have a vacuum cleaner or a refrigerator know whether or not it has
<q> a continuous rating of less than 1 horse power per 1,000 revolutions per minute "?</q>
What about the electric shaver&#x2014;a very important and necessary piece of apparatus? I have not the foggiest idea how many horses it takes to shave my five o'clock shadow, and I do not know that I or any other member of the public can be expected to know whether that matter comes within the ambit of the Regulations.<br/>
Having ascertained the matter to which it is to apply, it has to conform to a requirement, and the requirement is defined in Regulation 3. This is where the human emotion of the Regulations begins to come out, because it reads:
<q> The requirement hereinbefore referred to is that when the electric motor is used:</q>
<ol>
<li>(a) the voltage of electro-magnetic energy at the electric supply line terminals of the electric motor, as measured and computed in accordance with regulation four, shall not exceed:&#x2014;</li>
<ol>
<li>(i) seven hundred and fifty microvolts where the measurement is made at any frequency between forty and seventy megacycles per second; ".</li>
<li>That is not the only point. It shall not exceed:</li>
<li>" (ii) one thousand five hundred microvolts where the measurement is made at any frequency between two hundred kilocycles per second and one thousand six hundred and five kilocycles per second; and</li>
</ol>
<li>(b) the field strength of electro-magnetic energy radiated in any direction from the electric motor, as measured and computed in accordance with regulation four, shall not exceed."</li>
</ol>
and so on and so forth. That may cause a certain amount of difficulty to the conscientious housewife or the gentleman who is contemplating his electric shaver.</p>

<p>I was warming up to the question of measurement. The next stage in the preparation is, having as it were isolated the matter and having dis-

covered the requirement, we have to find out whether or not, as law abiding citizens, we are conforming to these Regulations; and in order to do that we have to use a " calibrated radio receiver " and we read that:
<q> attenuators calibrated in decibels shall be provided in the input circuits of both R.F. and 1.F. amplifiers.</q>
Of course the Parliamentary Secretary knows what a decibel is, but in case there should be anybody who does not know what a decibel is the Regulations kindly explain, as follows:
<q> The term ' decibel ' (abbreviated db) expresses the logarithmic ratio of two voltages or e.m.f's. The ratio of two voltages V<sub>1</sub> and V<sub>2</sub> expressed in decibels is 20 times the logarithm to the base 10 of V<sub>1</sub>/V<sub>2</sub>&#x2026; </q>
One could go on picking out these points, and I know that it is perfectly easy to get a little amusement out of pulling to pieces the technical jargon of many Orders, but I again emphasise that these are not Regulations passing through in the ordinary course of business to be dealt with by technicians. They vitally affect every householder and every lay person, and if those of us who are sent here by our constituents to represent them have not the foggiest idea as to what most of this means and what a calibrated attenuator is or a decibel or a sine wave. we cannot expect other lay people to know. It is important to know that references to the voltage of a sine wave are to its
<q> effective or root mean square value,</q>
and therefore we must keep that in our minds while contemplating our vacuum cleaner.<br/>
That is the first point to which I want the Parliamentary Secretary to address himself. To what does it all apply; how do we find out whether it applies to our own piece of mechanism; what do we do when we have found out whether it applies to it?<br/>
The second point I want to make concerns penalties. Is it right, as I think is the case, that the Wireless Telegraphy Act allows a right of search? It may be&#x2014;I do not know&#x2014;that there is a strong case and that this kind of interference is so vital that it may be the sort of horror comic of the electric world&#x2014;something for which we must drive a coach


and horse through our civil liberties. I do not know.<br/>
I do not know what evidence there is that this is necessary, but it is a pretty serious thing when one is quietly using one's electric shaver and contemplating oneself in the mirror if there suddenly pops up a little gentleman in a bowler hat and pin-striped trousers, with an attenuated calibrator or a calibrated attenuator, as the case may be, and starts telling one that the decibels are excessive. <i>[Laughter.]</i> It is all very well for hon. Members to laugh. We are here legislating against the liberty of the subject, and I venture to say that not even my right hon. Friend in his most fervid planning moments would have lightly undertaken something like this.<br/>
I am an ardent and fanatical planner, and I am perfectly well aware that where the public interest demands it may be necessary to interfere with the liberty of people and to enforce Regulations of this kind, but I do not believe in snooping and that sort of thing and I ask the Parliamentary Secretary why a Conservative Government, which has set the people free and stands above all for the fact that an Englishman's home is his castle, has found it necessary to prevent one shaving in peace in one's own home and should have the right of search and the right of inspection, not only of one's shaving, but of whether one is using the right amount of decibels.<br/>
There is a further point which arises out of these complications. I know that the Parliamentary Secretary may be inclined to say that this is all rather exaggerated stuff and that what will happen is that a nice gentleman from the Post Office will come and tell us that we are causing a little trouble with our Hoover and we had better have something done to it, and that he will himself have the right measuring instruments and so on.<br/>
But there is a very real danger here of the exploitation of these Regulations by people with dubious technical qualifications and by the kind of small-time spiv who likes to bluff simple people into thinking that he knows something about this matter. It would be very easy for someone to come knocking at the door, saying, " There have been complaints in the street of your interference. I know a lot about this, and I am very willing to

help you." He has a look round and says, " Obviously it is your refrigerator that is causing the trouble." He then tries to sell some kind of phoney and perhaps unnecessary piece of apparatus at considerable expense.<br/>
The Parliamentary Secretary may say, " This can be done for a few shillings, but it is easy to convince people that in their case it is a very complicated type of decibel and therefore will have to have a very complicated piece of machinery. There is a danger that because ordinary members of the public cannot understand what the Regulations are about, they are open to exploitation by unscrupulous people. If the Government want legislation on a private and domestic matter like this, it is up to them to make the legislation perfectly clear, plain and simple.<br/>
Finally, there is one other point which I want to raise. I am told in my constituency that one&#x2014;not, perhaps, the most important but a very significant and important&#x2014;cause of interference to radio is in fact television itself. I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary why is there not a <i>quid pro quo.</i> I am a television fan, and I am not trying to crab television at all, but if it is necessary to interfere with people's private domestic life in order that their neighbours may have decent television reception, why should a <i>quid pro quo</i> not be provided so that people whose radio is interfered with by television can have some kind of protection? That is not provided, I understand, in these Regulations.<br/>
I am told that interference is caused to the Third Programme by television. To a Government which wants to desecrate our cultural standards by commercial television, that may seem a matter of very little importance, but I think that my hon. Friends&#x2014;who always listen to the Third Programme&#x2014;will agree that this is a matter in which we want to preserve the standards of those who take their listening seriously. Some hon. Member listening quietly to a talk on " Mithraic sex customs " may suddenly find the whole thing distorted and interfered with by the oscillations of the television next door. If there is a real danger of interference by television, surely the Parliamentary Secretary can include that in his Regulations.<br/>
I have tried to make the case as best 1 can on this subject because, as I say, it


might be a small matter. I should have thought that in the passage of time most electrical apparatus would have the necessary protection automatically put on at the manufacturing end. Surely that is where the advantage of the second Regulations comes in&#x2014;refrigerators should be tackled in the factories.<br/>
In the process of time old electrical apparatus will wear out and be replaced and the problem will become increasingly smaller. I should have thought that with the two great weapons to protect television&#x2014;that the old-fashioned apparatus will gradually diminish and the fundamental decency and good neighbourliness of most people&#x2014;this problem would be dealt with. If advised what to do, most people would be most anxious to prevent interference with other people's enjoyment. Approached in the right way, they would do what was necessary perfectly willingly. But, brandish Regulations at them and start rushing around with attenuated calibrators, with decibels and sine waves, quite rightly we put people's backs up. A right-thinking householder does not want a snooper to tell him what to do.<br/>
I think the Government are defeating their own ends; they would have been wiser to have left the matter alone, or tackled it in a more tactful way. If we have a law giving the right of search and right of entry into a private house, we must first have an overwhelming need for it and, secondly, make quite certain that the law we are enforcing is so crystal clear that the ordinary layman, the decent citizen, can understand what it is all about. These Regulations are a mockery which ought never to have been laid on the Table of the House.</p>

<p>If I remember rightly, it was the Labour Government who passed the Bill which gave powers to the Post Office to make Regulations of this kind. I was one of the very few in this House who

objected to that Bill at that time. I remember saying that I thought it was up to those who made television sets and who transmit television so to design it that it achieved its purpose without causing inconvenience to millions of householders.<br/>
It seems strange that opposition to this set of Regulations should come from hon. Members opposite. If there is any blame in this matter it ought to be squarely placed on the Postmaster-General of five or six years ago, who obtained the powers which are now being criticised. I do not want to make a party <i>point&#x2014;[Laughter.]</i> &#x2014;I really do not&#x2014;but to deal with the merits of this matter, to which there are two sides.<br/>
I suppose it is almost impossible to transmit a satisfactory television signal to a fringe area 50 or 60 miles away from the transmitter against a strong wave of local interference. Unless a very good neighbourly attitude is developed among our people, or unless powers of advice or persuasion are available, I suppose that large numbers of people will have their television sets spoilt.<br/>
Some of the spoiling is done by public authorities, owners of vehicles&#x2014;who can quite well afford to fit suppressors&#x2014;and by railways. In my constituency, an electric railway runs alongside a number of streets, and when it came into operation a few months ago, having been suspended for the war period, it interfered with literally hundreds of people trying to watch their television. I made representations and the Post Office did very well in helping to cure the trouble. No doubt public authorities will take a public interest view about such matters.<br/>
I do not think it is really wrong that there should be some power to deal with the matter. What I am not quite so sure about is the power to compel the little person, who does not understand what it is about, to fit apparatus to common household articles.<br/>
There is a little lady in my constituency who wrote to me about this very matter. She said, " Am I to be compelled, for the sake of a rich neighbour with a television set, to look at my electric iron, to fit something to my vacuum cleaner, and to consider whether the fan in my kitchen will interfere with his television set? He is rich and I am poor, and if he wants to see better in his television set, let him pay for the suppressor."<br/>
There is something to be said for that point of view. Why should the poor little person, using his accustomed appliance that he has had for years, be made to pay for the rich neighbour who has a television set? That is the other side of the matter. The Government should hesitate before taking powers to interfere with little people in their homes and their private domestic apparatus.</p>

<p>I have great sympathy with what has been said in support of the Prayer. I feel that in this matter we are getting ourselves into a completely absurd position.<br/>
We are extending the field of regulations for all sorts of electric apparatus, and it seems to me that that is quite absurd when one considers that one of the greatest means of interference with television reception is the aeroplane. I live in Hendon, not far from the Hendon aerodrome, where aircraft are continually taking off and landing. There is constant interference from those aircraft. I am informed by my technical friends that it is quite impossible to do anything with an aircraft engine which would stop that interference.<br/>
If that is so, it strikes me as quite absurd that any Government, of whatever complexion, should be indulging in what I am bound to regard as petty restrictions, which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Morecambe and Lonsdale (Sir I. Fraser) said, may well bear heavily on the small person. I should have thought that the proper way was to turn the whole position the other way round.<br/>
I am informed by my technical friends that it is possible to attach a gadget to a television set to screen it and so prevent any interference. If that is correct, and I am told on very high authority that it is, I should have thought that that is the way to tackle this problem. I hope that the Government will look at the matter again on the lines which I have mentioned.</p>

<p>It might be for the convenience of the House if, at this point, I explained the purpose of the Regulations and answered some of the points which have been put

in debate. I am sure that the whole House regrets the absence through illness of my hon. Friend the Assistant Postmaster-General. I am glad to say that he is recovering and that he should be back with us after Easter. I should like to thank the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. MacColl) for the very agreeable manner in which he moved the Motion. In view of his earlier remarks, I might say that I have neither marital nor parental responsibility.<br/>
These Regulations have been made by virtue of powers conferred upon my noble Friend the Postmaster-General by Section 10 of the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1949, as my hon. Friend the Member for Morecambe and Lonsdale (Sir I. Fraser) correctly said. Part II of the 1949 Act requires the Postmaster-General to set up advisory committees to advise him on the substance of any regulations which he may wish to make for dealing with interference from various types of electrical apparatus. As the House will be aware, Regulations have already been made with regard to the ignition systems in motor cars. All new motor cars have had to be fitted with suppressors by the manufacturers, as from 1st July, 1953. There has been pressure on more than one occasion to make this requirement compulsory for old cars as well, but this pressure has been always resisted, for reasons which are outside the scope of this debate.<br/>
I pass on to the two sets of Regulations which are being prayed against tonight. I deal, first, with the Regulations relating to refrigerators. Under these Regulations, every electric refrigerator manufactured, assembled or imported after 1st September this year must be fitted by the manufacturer with any necessary suppressors. What about the many thousands of refrigerators sold before 1st September this year? There will be no obligation on any manufacturer with regard to those, but if they cause interference they will come under the other Regulations dealing with small electric motors, which I am about to explain.<br/>
Statutory Instrument No. 291, which contains the other Regulations, lays it down that, after 1st September this year, the owner of any new or old appliance which contains a small motor and causes any interference with television or radio sets can be compelled to stop the interference. I will give examples, for which


the hon. Member for Widnes asked, of some of the appliances which are most likely to cause trouble. In the home there are vacuum cleaners, sewing machines, hair driers, egg beaters, cake mixers, electric washing machines and electric floor polishers. In industry there are electric drills and tools of that kind.<br/>
In passing, I might say, on the point of publicity, that there was a normal Post Office " Press Notice " of these Regulations on 1st March this year. As far as I know, there has been no difficulty in the Press and the general public discovering the main lines of the Regulations. We shall do all we can to see that they are generally known.<br/>
The House will have noticed one important difference between the two sets of Regulations. The hon. Member for Widnes alluded to it. Whereas Statutory Instrument No. 292, relating to refrigerators, places an obligation upon the manufacturers, Statutory Instrument No. 291 applies to the users of apparatus which incorporates a small motor. Hon. Members may reasonably ask why we are dealing with refrigerators differently from other apparatus incorporating a motor. The reason is quite simple.<br/>
It is that a refrigerator may often be in use throughout the 24 hours of the day and, therefore, can cause much more constant trouble than, for example, a small motor working a sewing machine or a hair drier, which is used only occasionally. Suppose it is a hot summer day, and the family think they would like to watch the television broadcast of the Test Match. It is then quite possible to arrange not to use the hair drier on that day whereas it may be disastrous to turn off the refrigerator. That is why these two sets of Regulations are rather different in form.<br/>
I think the House might like to know to what extent refrigerators and small motors have been causing trouble up to now and what action we have already taken. I understand that 2,800 complaints were received about refrigerators during 1954. Most of these complaints arose from old types of refrigerators, and all that was necessary, in the vast majority of cases, was the simple operation of inserting a suppressor.<br/>
The figures for interference caused by small motors are interesting. During 1954 there were about 10,000 complaints

about sewing machines, 7,500 complaints about hair driers, 4,300 complaints about vacuum cleaners and 3,500 complaints about electric drills. The vast majority of these complaints related to television reception, but quite a substantial number of these small motors affected ordinary sound radio reception as well; and in this connection I should like to emphasise that the Regulations which we are discussing this evening relate to sound broadcasting as well as to television.<br/>
This may seem a rather large number of complaints, but it is worth remembering that the sales of these electrical appliances have been extremely large during the past year. For example, I understand that during this period vacuum cleaners have been sold at the rate of 70,000 a month, and electric sewing machines at the rate of about 4,000 a month. All these cases of interference were duly investigated by my noble Friend's Department, and in the majority of cases all that was needed was for suppressors to be fitted. With very few exceptions this was done without any demur, but I should like to make it quite plain that the sole purpose of these two sets of Regulations is to give my noble Friend the Postmaster-General the power to deal effectively with those relatively few cases where the spirit of co-operation has been lacking.<br/>
Before I go on to describe how these Regulations will work there are just two other points which I should like to clear up. First, there are, of course, many kinds of electrical appliances which do not use small motors such as electric lamps and electric blankets and the diathermy apparatus which means the sun-ray lamp on the top floor. These have not yet been covered by Regulations, and my noble Friend will receive the necessary advice from the Advisory Committee at a later date.<br/>
The same applies to neon signs, about which the hon. Member for Bristol, Central (Mr. Awbery) asked my hon. Friend on 2nd February. My hon. Friend pointed out, in reply, that neon signs accounted for about 1 per cent. of the interference cases which the Post Office has investigated.<br/>
Secondly&#x2014;and I think this takes up a point which was made by the hon. Member for Widnes&#x2014;these Regulations do not cover the question of interference


caused by television sets to radio sets. Indeed, this type of interference does not come within the scope of Part II of the 1949 Act, but as we are on this subject of interference perhaps I might be allowed to make this very brief comment. One of the conditions under which a person takes out a receiving licence for radio or television is that he does not cause interference with any other radio apparatus. If a man with a television or radio set does cause such interference then, in the last resort, the Post Office would withdraw his licence. If he then continued to use the apparatus without licence he would be committing an offence under Part I of the 1949 Act, and be liable to prosecution. The House will be glad to learn that the Post Office has had to withdraw only three licences for this reason.<br/>
This is, clearly, a problem which should be tackled at the manufacturing stage and my noble Friend's Department is discussing it with the radio industry.</p>

<p>I have not got those figures because they are not strictly relevant to the debate tonight, but if the hon. Member would like to have them I will see that he gets them.<br/>
I should explain briefly to the House how these Regulations will work. Let us suppose that a complaint is received by the Post Office that interference is being caused to a television set or a radio set. Inquiries are made and, let us imagine, the trouble is tracked down in due course and found to be caused by a hair drier. Before the Post Office ask the owner of the hair drier to take any action at all&#x2014;and certainly before he is asked to spend money&#x2014;the Post Office would make absolutely sure that all reasonable steps have been taken by the man making the complaint to minimise the interference. I think that that takes up a point made by one of my hon. Friends.<br/>
If it becomes plain that the trouble is due to the hair drier and nothing else, the owner would be asked not to use the

apparatus at a time when it caused interference or, alternatively, to insert suppressers. In 99 cases out of 100 that would be the end of the matter, but in the hundredth case where the owner of the hair drier, or whatever it might be, refused to co-operate, the Post Office has to serve a notice upon him giving him not less than 28 days in which to put the matter right.<br/>
During that time he has, under the Act, the right of appeal to a special tribunal. If he does not appeal, or if his appeal is rejected, then, and only then, if he continues to use the appliance without inserting suppressers, he is committing an offence under the 1949 Act and is liable to prosecution; with a maximum fine of &#x00A3;10 for the first occasion and &#x00A3;50 on any subsequent occasion. Incidentally, the tribunals have already been set up. There is one for England and Wales, one in Scotland and one in Northern Ireland. They can meet in any part of the Kingdom, indeed the Act lays down that they should deal with any particular case at a place reasonably near where the interference occurred.<br/>
The hon. Member for Widnes asked about the question of search. There is no automatic right of entry. It is strictly limited by Section 15 of the 1949 Act. If the hon. Member examines that Section, he will see that the right of entry is dependent on the granting of a search warrant by a justice of the peace or in Scotland by a sheriff. It is rigidly circumscribed.</p>

<p>I ought to say a word about the cost of fitting suppressers to existing equipment. I hope that the House will not press me to give exact figures, because the charges are likely to vary considerably. They will depend on the kind of appliance to be suppressed; whether suppression is to be obtained for sound, or television, or both, and, not


least, whether the owner fits the suppressors himself or, alternatively, gets a retailer to do the job. Shortly after these Regulations were laid, a spokesman of the raido industry remarked that suppressors for most domestic electrical appliances would cost from 15s. to 30s. I understand that that cost includes the cost of fixing the apparatus, but not what is known technically as " travelling time."<br/>
Anyone who possesses a television set knows very well how annoying it is to have the picture continuously cut up by lines splashed across the screen; just as anyone with a radio set knows how exasperating it can be to have a good programme spoiled by loud scratches and crackles caused by a neighbour's electrical apparatus. The only comparable type of annoyance which occurs to me is when a long-playing gramophone record, with what looks like a perfect surface, suddenly develops a noise like a log fire just getting going.<br/>
On the other hand, my noble Friend fully recognises that the owners of electrical apparatus have their point of view. The principle of these Regulations is simply to stop interference&#x2014;or, at least, to reduce it to a low level&#x2014;when it is unreasonable and when the owner will not take action of his own accord. As I have already stated, I believe that it is only in a small minority of cases that it will be necessary to invoke these Regulations. I hope that, in view of that explanation, hon. Members opposite will feel able to withdraw their Motion.</p>

<p>I am quite sure that the whole House would wish to thank the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Supply for the very courteous and full way in which he has answered the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Widnes (Mr. MacColl). I do not wish the Assistant Postmaster-General any but I hope it will be conveyed to him that his place has been particularly well filled on this very difficult occasion.<br/>
The Parliamentary Secretary seems to live in a rather different world from mine, because he said, " Suppose it is a hot day and the family think they would like to watch a Test Match." But when was a Test Match played on a hot summer's day? If I could feel certain that there would be a hot summer's day on which a

Test Match was being played, I should look forward to watching it with great deal more pleasure than I have been able to contemplate doing so during the last three or four years when Test Matches have been played in this country.</p>

<p>When one recollects what happened during the whole of that Test series until Laker and Lock were allowed to play on a wicket which Jupiter Pluvius had prepared for them, it just shows the relevance of the observation which I made on the hon. Gentleman's supposition.<br/>
The thing about which I complain in these Regulations is their extreme tech nicality. As the hon. Member for Spelthorne (Mr. Beresford-Craddock) said, these Regulations cannot be understood by anybody but a person who is either in the fourth form at a secondary school or who is a technical expert with an expensive training. I have no doubt that small boys would be able to arrange that the Regulations should be complied with at home and would find a good many excuses for staying up late to see that the family did not get into any difficulty through any breach of the law in this respect.<br/>
However, I should not have thought that it was necessary to be so highly technical in the matter, which was really the main burden of my hon. Friend's complaint. After all, when we were in office we may have passed the Act, but, at any rate, we did not draft these Regulations, and, in spite of what the hon. Member for Morecambe and Lonsdale (Sir I. Fraser) said, it is the Regulations against which we are praying.<br/>
I also wish to emphasise what has been said by the critics of the Regulations and by the Minister himself. In this modern world, with the various forms of domestic apparatus that depend upon the understanding and, at any rate, the application of scientific principles, the habit of good neighbourliness is more than ever important. One must hope that that will be developed.<br/>
Just as the raucous loudspeaker tuned in a great deal too loud for the comfort of the neighbourhood is now recognised


as a form of social misbehaviour and one to be generally deprecated, so failure to comply with reasonable requirements that one's own apparatus shall not interfere with one's neighbours will come to be regarded as one of the essential social duties in a world where much pleasure can be obtained by the exercise of good neighbourliness and much annoyance caused where that habit is not cultivated.</p>

<p>I shall detain the House only for a minute. I disagree with my right hon. Friend, not in wishing ill to the Assistant Postmaster-General, but in my view that the way in which these Regulations have been defended by the Parliamentary Secretary shows that a reasonable approach to the House in these matters enables a reasonable answer to be given by it. The Parliamentary Secretary, who certainly had the advantage of not being in the House in 1949, when the original Act was objected to in such stringent and violent language, has shown that the House can face these technical problems.<br/>
Despite what my hon. Friend the Member for Widnes (Mr. MacColl) has said, I think we have taken a sensible view in this matter, and I hope that when the party opposite find themselves back upon these benches in the near future they will continue to take the reasonable view which has been adopted by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Supply tonight.</p>

<p>In December, 1917, General Allenby captured the city of Jerusalem, and in so doing became the first Christian commander to capture the Holy City by force of arms for 980 years. He did not leave so many memorials as the Crusaders, but he left a large and beautiful cemetery to the British dead who had fallen in that campaign. It lies to the north-east of the city, near, if not on, Mount Scopus, and throughout the period of the Mandate it was well tended and a credit to us.<br/>
I fear that since the mandate came to an end it has fallen into a state of decay, it has not become a wilderness, through no immediate fault of ours. Since the troubles in Palestine between the Israelis and the Arabs, and since the line between them was crystalised so many years ago, this cemetery has been, if not in " NoMan's-Land," at least so near it that it is apparently dangerous for the British to tend it as it should be tended. I was in Jerusalem this January, and many people of all nations and religions commented to me upon this sorry state of affairs and wondered why it was that in an area where there were so many religions the Christians seemed to care so little about their fallen dead that they were apparently not prepared to make their will felt both against the Jewish and Arab contenders.<br/>
One of the tests of a nation, and even of a religion&#x2014;at least in the eyes of strangers or foreigners&#x2014;is the way that it looks after its fallen dead. If this cemetery, which was something of a showpiece for so many years, is allowed to remain in what I am informed is its present condition&#x2014;I admit that my information may be out of date, because it is two or three months old&#x2014;it is inevitable that both Jews and Arabs will feel that we do not care, particularly as we adhere to the United Nations Resolution that Jerusalem is, for many purposes and certainly for this sort of purpose, an International City and that the Christians


have rights. This should be said more often than it is said in arguments about the Holy Land. If we do not enforce our rights, other religions will think that we do not care. In a sense, it is not only Britain but Christianity that is on trial.<br/>
I would first ask my hon. Friend the Joint Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs if I was right in what I said, that this large and famous cemetery, bearing in it the dead of our great and glorious campaign, is in this state of neglect and decay and, if that is so, what it is proposed to do about it. It is not quite enough to say that we cannot do anything because we are no longer the mandatory Power and have no status there. The resolution of the United Nations is clear to all the world that Jerusalem is, in its language and in the language used in that part of the world, a <i>tertium quid;</i> it is in our view neither Arab nor Israeli. Therefore we have a legal, and certainly a moral, right to see that the plot of land is preserved against the sort of outrage of neglect from which I am told it is at present suffering.<br/>
I am told that we have well-wishers in Jerusalem and that at some risk to life and limb boys and men who have served with the British Government when we were the mandatory Power, or have served in the R.A.F., or were trained under the British in one way or another, creep up to the cemetery and put a few flowers there and do what they can in that way. They break in almost against all corners, and with the possibility of being sniped at from one side or the other.<br/>
We have a position there which we must maintain, and I seriously suggest that we should consider mounting some sort of guard while the plots and graves are being tended and put into decent condition. I dare say the international legal and political complications would be very great&#x2014;I do not know&#x2014;but I should think we might get some agreement from both sides. Perhaps General Burns, United States head of the Armistice Commission, might be asked whether he could proceed under the protection of his authority. It may be outside the scope of his authority, but he has great moral power.<br/>
I should have thought that something might be arranged, but even if it cannot be arranged by agreement, I seriously

suggest we should consider doing it without agreement. We should, if necessary, go in there with some volunteers&#x2014;because I feel that we have been rather shamed by those boys and men who have gone in at the risk of their own skins&#x2014;to protect our people while they are trying to put the cemetery in order, and then withdraw in an orderly way.<br/>
The position of the cemetery is very unfortunate in that it is in the most strategic place on the frontier between the two sides&#x2014;but so is almost every other place on that frontier. I do not think that that excuse is good enough. It is information and encouragement that I seek. I do not wish to attack the Government. Obviously I could not do that &#x2014;the Government are in a position of great difficulty&#x2014;but I would end by urging, with all the sincerity I can summon, that this is a matter of very great comment in Jerusalem, in Israel and in Jordan.<br/>
This matter is being watched. The people there do not understand why Britain has neglected something of which she was very proud. They regard our actions in this regard as something of a test of our position, and indeed of our belief in the sincerity of the cause in which our men fought, and of our position generally, down indeed to the point of our belief in our own faith.</p>

<p>This is a lugubrious subject and one on which I do not wish to speak for long. If, in fact, conditions at the cemetery are as my hon. Friend the Member for Darwen (Mr. Fletcher-Cooke) states, he has done a public service in raising this matter tonight. I remember that when fighting was going on out there one of the British graveyards was actually fought over. I do not know whether the one at Jerusalem is the one. If so, it is very regrettable, but I do not wish to say anything to exacerbate feelings between Israel and Jordan and the other neighbouring Arab States which, we know, is not the best.<br/>
Jerusalem means something to people of so many religions. Those of us who have been there perhaps feel more deeply than those who have not. This matter should not be regarded purely as one of British prestige. The important thing is


that we should try to regard the final resting place of our glorious dead in the same light as we should expect other nations to regard theirs. I should have thought that the right approach was not, as my hon. Friend seemed to suggest, a matter simply of upholding British prestige&#x2014;although that is involved&#x2014;but rather to say to both Israelis and Arabs, " You would not like your dead treated in this way; we do not like the resting place of our dead treated like this either. Will you co-operate to the extent of allowing this resting place to be put in order again?"</p>

<p>This is a shameful matter. I confirm all the facts which my hon. Friend the Member for Darwen (Mr. Fletcher-Cooke) mentioned in describing the condition of this cemetery. I am grateful to him for raising this and to my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for the Isle of Ely (Major Legge-Bourke) for supporting what has been said.<br/>
In this cemetery there lie the graves of about 2,500 men killed in the First World War; and the names of 3,400 other men whose graves have never been found are recorded there. The vast majority of those 6,000 men came from the United Kingdom, although there are graves and names of men from Australia, South Africa, New Zealand and the British West Indies. It is, therefore, a Commonwealth concern that this cemetery should be cared for in a proper manner, and that it should be a thing of beauty, as the British war cemeteries are throughout the world, in all the battlefields of the last two wars.<br/>
Unfortunately, that is not the case with the Mount Scopus cemetery. The cemetery lies in the Mount Scopus demilitarised zone. Under an agreement between the Arab and Jewish commanding officers of 7th July, 1948, it was assigned to United Nations protection, and was to be policed by Israeli and Jordanian police, both responsible to the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation. The cemetery itself is in the part assigned to the Israeli policing.<br/>
During the fighting that has taken place mines were laid by both sides. In the case of the Israelis, mines were laid by

them in the cemetery itself, in the case of the Jordanians, just outside the cemetery, but neither side has removed those mines since the fighting stopped. In consequence of that the Imperial War Graves Commission has been unable to maintain the cemetery, and both Her Majesty's representative and the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation have failed in their attempts to persuade the two sides to allow workmen to go into the cemetery and carry out repairs. For six years the state of tension between Israel and Jordan has prevented any improvement in the situation.<br/>
In July of last year, Her Majesty's consul and the Israeli officer commanding the Israeli area of Mount Scopus inspected the cemetery. The Israeli officer noted the condition of the cemetery, the damage to the chapel, and the dilapidation inside the chapel, and seemed at that time prepared to give orders for his men to tidy up the cemetery and to clear the minefield. Then the Imperial War Graves Commission sent two representatives to Jerusalem, and it was then hoped to arrange an agreement between the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation, the Imperial War Graves Commission and the Israelis for the repair and maintenance of the cemetery.<br/>
In January of this year, however, the Israeli Government announced that they would be prepared to negotiate only an agreement covering all British war cemeteries in Israel, including Mount Scopus. As I have explained to the House, this cemetery does not lie in Israeli territory. It lies in United Nations protected territory, and any agreement affecting the cemetery must be negotiated with the Jordanians as well as the Israelis, and must be dealt with quite separately from other cemeteries in Israeli territory. The Jordan Government, in February, 1955, sent General Burns a reply which expressly refused to allow any Jews or Jewish relatives of the dead commemorated in that cemetery to have access to it. I hope the House will realise that, bearing in mind that those men died to obtain freedom for the Arab world.<br/>
We are, naturally, very dissatisfied with this position, and I am indeed surprised that two States which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Darwen said, are both deeply religious and have great respect for


their own dead, do not feel that this situation reflects great discredit upon them. Her Majesty's Government intend to approach the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation and the Israeli and Jordan Governments with further proposals for the clearance of the mines and the repair and maintenance of the cemetery. I hope very much that all the Commonwealth countries represented in Israel and Jordan will join in this approach, which affects them as well as us.<br/>
This is a United Nations zone. Therefore, we must&#x2014;and, indeed, we gladly do &#x2014;use the United Nations machinery to deal with this problem. That is my answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Darwen. Let me say again how

grateful this country is for the persevering efforts that General Burns has made to try to resolve the problems that lie in this area arising out of the bitter tension between the two sides. I hope that this debate will serve a useful purpose and will have brought home to the Israeli and Jordan Governments that if they desire friendly relations with the Governments of this country and the Commonwealth they must show due reverence to our dead soldiers who are commemorated in the cemetery at Mount Scopus.</p>
