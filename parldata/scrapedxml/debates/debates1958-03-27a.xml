<p>I have been asked by the Trustees of the British Museum to present a Petition, which they have to submit to this House each year, explaining their financial position and praying for aid. The Petition recites the funded income of the Trustees, and points out that the establishment is, necessarily, attended with an expense far beyond the annual production of the funds and the Trust cannot, with benefit to the public, be carried out without the aid of Parliament. It concludes with this Prayer:
<q>Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray your Honourable House to grant them such further support towards enabling them to carry on the execution of the Trust reposed in them by Parliament, for the general benefit of learning and useful knowledge, as to your House shall seem meet.&#x2014;[<i>Queen's Recommendation signified.</i>]</q></p>

<p>These accidents result from experiments with chemicals which are not themselves explosive and of which, as they are in common use, the sale cannot be controlled. In the Guy Fawkes season, my Department issue Press and broadcast warnings of the dangers of home-made fireworks and explosives; and the last Report of Her Majesty's Inspector of Explosives calls attention to them. I hope that this Question and Answer will help to impress parents with the need to see that they are heeded.</p>

<p>Whilst thanking the Minister for that Answer, may I ask her whether it has been considered that it might be a wise step to ask the trade journals that circulate amongst purveyors of some of these proprietary chemicals if they could draw attention to these dangers? The Minister is aware that this has been done by the Pharmaceutical Society in relation to chemists. I gather that the Minister is also aware that most of the purchases are not made from pharmacists, and, therefore, if some attention could be drawn to the sale of items in other types of shop, it would be helpful.</p>

<p>I am sure that we have the same purpose in mind as the hon. Gentleman. One of the difficulties is that if we give too much publicity to such items we may encourage the very people to acquire them that we do not want to encourage. I assure the hon.

<p>In view of the fact that explosions are ruled out but it is now admitted that radioactive elements fatal to life may be distributed over a considerable area, is it not desirable to supplement any R.A.F. teams, because the planes in this country would fly over largely populated areas, whereas in America they would fly over deserts?</p>

<p>About 2,000 refugees, of whom some 900 are in hostels,

are still being assisted by the Anglo-Egyptian Resettlement Board. The total without employment includes children, housewives and others who look after families at home, and persons too old or infirm to work. Some of these have limited private means. The number registered for work is about 250. Every effort is made to help those able to work to find employment. In addition grants or loans for various purposes are made to adults to assist them to resettle here: and it is hoped that homes will be established for aged people who would be unable to look after themselves.</p>

<p>I appreciate all my hon. Friend and her Department have done to help these unfortunate people, but can she say how many of the hard core of refugees are of Maltese nationality?

<p>I cannot tell my hon. Friend without notice exactly how many of the residue not resettled are Maltese. If he cares to put down a Question, I shall be delighted to give him an Answer. It is true to say that the Board is now getting down to the more difficult cases, and amongst those, as my hon. Friend will appreciate, are the Maltese who find our language difficult or who, in some cases, do not speak English at all or are in the process of learning it. The Board intends to publish a further report, when it has made more progress with resettlement and it has been established how many of the total number can be resettled in this country.</p>

<p>None, Sir. The Metropolitan Police intervene in eviction cases only so far as may be necessary to prevent a breach of the peace, except in rare cases under the Small Tenements Recovery Act, 1838, when they may be authorised by the court to enter the premises.</p>

<p>In order to preserve the good relations which normally prevail between Londoners and the London police, will the right hon. Gentleman give an assurance that, next October, the police will not be used under the Rent Act, 1957, to help landlords to evict tenants unless, at the least, there is a court order for possession obtained by the landlord beforehand? We do not want the police mixed up with these things any more than absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>It is normal for the police, if officers find that there is a dispute about the existence or terms of an order made by a rent tribunal, to refer the parties to the rent tribunal.

<p>asked the Secretary of State for the Home Department, since magistrates' courts are reluctant to impose maximum fines, if he will introduce legislation to treble all maximum fines because of the depreciation of money, and so encourage more realistic monetary punishments to be inflicted.</p>

<p>I thank my right hon.

<p>Is the Home Secretary aware of the view that the great increase in the number of detainees is a handicap in fully implementing the hopes of rehabilitation implicit in preventive detention? Will he have regard also to the gross disparity of sentences inflicted in different courts&#x2014;for example, ten years for stealing a chicken worth 16s. 2d.&#x2014;and endeavour to find a way whereby there can be greater uniformity of sentence and the spirit and the letter of the Act can be carried out?</p>

<p>It is not for me to comment on the sentences. I can only comment on the result, which is that the long-term sentences are bringing about, partly, the result to which the hon. Gentleman refers. As regards preventive detention as a whole, we are making some


special research into the effects of it, and I would rather await the result of that research before giving final answers.</p>

<p>Does not the right hon. Gentleman recognise that there is no anomaly at all?

Therefore, there is no anomaly. [An HON. MEMBER: "That is the anomaly."] Then may I ask the right hon.

Similarly, in general there would be a need to define an offender, which would be a difficult matter. There are some major schemes, notably some embraced by Miss Margery Fry, which we have also considered. They are all schemes which are good from the idealist point of view but they are hard to carry out. We are doing our best to study them but to say that this problem was easy to solve would be an overstatement.</p>

<p>Is not the Parliamentary Secretary aware that there are now between forty and fifty of these pioneering schools, and that there is tremendous interest in them and also widespread controversy about them?

<p>Yes, Sir. The business for next week will be as follows:<br/>
MONDAY, 31ST MARCH&#x2014;We find it necessary to ask the House to consider a timetable Motion for the Local Government and Miscellaneous Financial Provisions (Scotland) Bill, which is now before the Scottish Standing Committee.<br/>
The terms of the Motion will appear on the Order Paper tomorrow morning.<br/>
It is hoped to dispose of this business in time to allow the Second Reading of the Disabled Persons (Employment) Bill to be moved at a reasonable hour.<br/>
TUESDAY, 1ST APRIL&#x2014;A debate will take place on Malta, on a Government Motion.<br/>
Consideration of the Motion to approve the Import Duties Antimony Order.<br/>
WEDNESDAY, 2ND APRIL&#x2014;Third Reading of the Life Peerages Bill [<i>Lords</i>], which it is hoped to obtain by 7 o'clock.<br/>
Concluding stages of the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Bill.<br/>
Consideration of the Motions to approve the Draft Police Pensions (No. 2) Regulations, and similar Regulations for Scotland.<br/>
THURSDAY, 3RD APRIL&#x2014;It is proposed to meet at 11 a.m. and take Questions until 12 noon.<br/>
Adjournment for the Easter Recess until Tuesday, 15th April.</p>

<p>The subsection which we propose to amend would introduce a new factor for the consideration of the Boundary Commission, that is, the inconveniences that are attendant upon alteration of constituencies and the breaking of local ties as the result of such alteration. As we said on the Second Reading, we welcome the recognition of that factor in the rules. Its introduction is one of the things that the Boundary Commission must take into account.<br/>
The form in which it is introduced in the subsection seems somewhat unfortunate. It was described by the Leader of the House as a presumption against making changes unless there is a very strong case for them. I doubt whether it goes quite as far as that. What is proposed is that the Boundary Commission is not to be bound to give full effect in all circumstances to the rules that are already in the Second Schedule, but is to take account so far as it can of the new factor, except as regards alterations made to boundaries. These are the alterations which occur in the rule four mentioned in the subsection. That is extremely difficult to follow, and I must for a moment trouble the Committee with a reference to the rules.<br/>
They begin with three unqualified rules. One is about the number of constituencies; another is about single-Member constituencies, and the third is a peculiar rule about the City of London. It is very hard to see what effect this new factor will have on the strict carrying out of those rules.<br/>
We then come to Rule 4, the one to which the new factor is not to have the same application. It begins by saying:
<q>So far as practicable, having regard to the first three rules",</q>
and it goes on to deal with the question of boundaries. In Rule 5, we get to the question of the electoral quota. Here again the Boundary Commission may depart from the strict application of the last foregoing rule in certain circumstances.<br/>
If, on top of this "so far as practicable" and "departure from the strict application" and all the rest of it, we add a further exception in the form in


which it appears in subsection (2), we have left the matters that the Boundary Commission has to take into consideration exceedingly confused. We have alighted on the one rule to which it ought to have some particular application, that is, the boundary rule, as the one to which it is not to have any particular application.<br/>
What is left? What are the rules to which it has to have application? Three rules, to which I should have thought it could hardly apply at all. The one rule to which it really ought to apply is the one about the size, not of the electoral quota, since this rule seems clear enough already. We might try to think out what we are doing in relation to it, and not seek to apply this sort of thing to the question of single-Member constituencies, and so on, to which it has no application at all, but to apply it in relation to the electoral quota.<br/>
The proposal in the Amendment is to change the application of the rule and to make the subsection run like this, taking the two Amendments together:
<q>It shall be the duty of a Boundary Commission, in discharging their functions under the said Section two"&#x2014;</q>
that is, the general Section&#x2014;
<q>and in giving effect to the rules set out in the Second Schedule to the principal Act, to take account, so far as they reasonably can"&#x2014;</q>
of the new factor&#x2014;
<q>and Rule 5 of those rules shall be amended accordingly.</q>
That seems to me to put this new factor in its proper place, and not to introduce the quite unnecessary confusion that appears to arise from the present form of words in the subsection.<br/>
What I have said relates to the first two Amendments. The third Amendment is, broadly speaking, aimed towards the same sort of point, but does not go quite so far. Assuming that, for some reason or another&#x2014;I hope, a good one&#x2014;the general wording of the subsection is preferred to my suggestion; that the Government prefer, at any rate, as I see it, to increase the obscurity of the rules by adding this new factor in this curious way, I still see no reason for the exception made in relation to the fourth rule, which is the boundary rule.<br/>
If this factor is to be taken into account and allowed to weigh against the strict application of the rules, why should the

rule about boundaries be specifically excepted? I quite fail to see any reason for that, and I could not collect one from the Second Reading debate. I suggest, therefore, that if we cannot have the wording that I prefer, we might, at least, leave out the words in line 30
<q>&#x2026; other than alterations made for the purposes of rule 4 of those rules &#x2026;</q>
Perhaps I may conclude by making two observations. The first is to repeat, lest there be any uncertainty about it, that we, on this side, welcome the introduction of this new factor. We think that it is quite right that it should form part of the rules. All we are anxious about is that its effect should be clearly stated. We believe that it is stated more clearly by putting it into Rule 5, where it belongs, and by not making this exception in favour of Rule 4. We think that that will give it not only a fuller, but a clearer effect.<br/>
If I have to repeat my second observation in the course of our debates today, I shall do so only because I think that we have to keep it constantly before us. It is that Clause 1 does have the effect of making an alteration in the position of the Boundary Commission. We are now dealing with rules that are the guide&#x2014;and, as I see it, the only guide&#x2014;for a Commission with a judicial head and two other official members. It is, therefore, extraordinarily necessary that the rules we have to consider should be recognised as what they are&#x2014;the guide for that Commission&#x2014;and should be as clear as we can make them.<br/>
I have referred to what I consider to be the lack of clarity in the form proposed in the Bill. That need for clarity is the more apparent when we reflect on what, at any rate, has been previous experience&#x2014;and I would not differ too much from it. On the last occasion, we found that the Home Secretary had not thought it proper to interfere at all with the reports made by the Commission. I fully appreciate the difficulty of any Home Secretary in seeking to interfere with those reports, or to make recommendations to vary them in some way or other; that, although he has a power to do so under the Act, he runs into the difficulty, the inevitable difficulty, of some confusion between his political and party position and his duty to see that the rules are carried out effectively. For that last


reason, again, I say that it is most important that we should get these rules clearer.</p>

<p>It might be for the convenience of the Committee if I were to reply to the hon. and learned Member for Kettering (Mr. Mitchison) straight away, particularly as he has said that he is in agreement with the main purpose of Clause 2 (2), and that his difficulty arises from its drafting and not from any difference of view, in substance, as to what degree of flexibility the subsection is proposed to achieve.<br/>
I would agree with him, too, that it is very desirable that these rules should be as clear as possible. I must confess that from the very beginning, when they were first formulated, the rules were not of obvious clarity on a first perusal. I have had, perhaps, more occasions to consider them than has the hon. and learned Gentleman, and though I do not think that they in any sense lack clarity as they stand now, I must admit that they may not be too easy, as I have said, to comprehend on a first reading.<br/>
Clause 2 (2), as it stands, quite clearly admits of the departure to a greater degree from the strictness of the rules as they now stand, and the hon. and learned Gentleman is obviously correct in saying that its impact does not really arise in relation to the first three rules, but primarily in relation to Rule 4. By this Clause, it will be possible to avoid the kind of thing to which the hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Leicester, North-East (Sir L. Ungoed-Thomas) drew attention, namely, the transfer of about 17,000 electors from one part of Southampton to another to secure an adjustment of about 1,000 in the electorate of each constituency within Southampton. I am sure we would all think that that kind of change was really not very desirable.<br/>
The matter raised by the hon. and learned Member for Kettering really relates to the reference in line 30 to Rule 4:
<q>&#x2026; other than alterations made for the purposes of rule 4 of those rules &#x2026;</q>
The reason for the use of those words is this. We may get the case in which borough boundaries are extended, or

boundaries are altered, with the result that the boundaries of the parliamentary constituency do not coincide with those of the local government area. It is, in our view, desirable that where that sort of change occurs, effect should be given to Rule 4 by extending the parliamentary boundary. The obvious case is the extension of a borough boundary. The part to which the extension applies then falls within the borough for all local government purposes.<br/>
4.0 p.m.<br/>
I know that the hon. and learned Gentleman has expressed a somewhat different view, but we believe that there is great value in trying to preserve the same boundaries for local government areas and parliamentary constituencies. That is why, in line 30, we have deliberately excepted from Clause 2 (2), and from the power of the Boundary Commission to take account of inconveniences attendant on alterations of constituencies, alterations made for the purpose of Rule 4 of the rules, that is to say, alterations made for the purposes of securing coincidence between local authority boundaries and Parliamentary constituency boundaries. We feel that that is something which should, if possible, be achieved.<br/>
Of course, there will remain under the rule as it stands, when the subsection is passed and becomes part of the Statute Law, a certain measure of flexibility, because Rule 4 is governed by the words "so far as is practicable". But, in relation to that particular aspect, we are not enlarging the degree of flexibility by Clause 2 (2). I hope that I have made that clear to the hon. and learned Gentleman. I know his view on local authority boundaries. I myself feel that the Committee could probably discuss that more usefully when we come to some of the later Amendments. I hope that the Committee will agree not to embark on a discussion of that aspect, which is an important one, at the present time.<br/>
I hope that I have made clear to the hon. and learned Gentleman the reason for the reference to Rule 4 in the subsection and the reason, in our view, that it should remain.</p>

<p>We are grateful to the right hon. and learned Gentleman the Attorney-General for what he has said. May we


take it that the kind of alterations which took place in London on the last occasion will not recur? At that time, there were, I think, alterations to 16 constituencies in order to create one new one, and, in the end, Hammersmith Town Hall was placed in the Fulham Parliamentary constituency. May we take it that, as a result of the Clause we are discussing, plus the retention of Rule 4, that kind of thing will be almost impossible? An assurance from the Attorney-General would be of help.</p>

<p>I do not think that I could say it would be impossible, because one cannot say what the results of a consideration of particular facts in particular localities may be. But I can say that it is our intention&#x2014;I think the Clause adequately provides for it&#x2014;to give the Boundary Commission power to depart from strict conformity with the rules so as to avoid the inconveniences which arise from the rupture of local ties or associations which may have considerable importance.</p>

<p>If I am wrong, perhaps the right hon. and learned Gentleman will make clear what he means. Let me restate it and see whether it appeals to him more in this form. It then applies the new factor as something reasonably to be taken into account in all cases. When one looks at the new factor, it is certain things attendant on alterations of constituencies. The only alterations of constituencies which are not to be considered for those purposes are alterations made by reason of Rule 4.</p>

<p>The right hon. and learned Gentleman still shakes his head. I shall give way in a moment. I hope he will realise that I am not, if I may say so, completely half-witted. If I find this

difficulty in what he meant just now, and in what is meant by what is on the Notice Paper, it is possible that others may find a similar difficulty.<br/>
The Attorney-General will agree that Rule 4 is treated in an exceptional way. He will agree, because he said so, that this has no real application to the first three rules. There remain Rules 5 and 6. He objects to it being put into Rule 5, and nobody has suggested that it has much to do with Rule 6. What is the point of putting in a particular matter which is intended to refer to Rule 5, which treats Rule 4 as exceptional, and which does not apply to the other rules anywhere than in the place to which it does apply?</p>

<p>I realise quite well that these rules are difficult to comprehend, on first consideration, and I hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman will not think that I am seeking to be discourteous when I say that the short answer to his question is that he is, I think, paraphrasing incorrectly&#x2014;unintentionally, I know&#x2014;what is in the subsection. He says again and again that this gives a degree of flexibility in relation to all rules other than Rule 4. That is not what the Clause provides. It provides for flexibility in relation to Rule 4 and in relation to the very cases about which I was asked just now. The words are:
<q>they shall take account, so far as they reasonably can, of the inconveniences attendant on alterations of constituencies"&#x2014;</q>
that gives a slight presumption against alterations&#x2014;
<q>other than alterations made for the purposes of rule 4 of those rules</q>
that is to say, if I may paraphrase, correctly, I think, other than alterations made to existing boundaries of parliamentary constituencies to secure conformity with Rule 4, that is, to secure, where borough boundaries have been altered, that the Parliamentary boundaries are extended to coincide with those.<br/>
With great respect to the hon. and learned Gentleman, the difficulty which he has seen arises, I think, from his taking the view that this Clause contains an exclusive reference to Rule 4, when it does not. It refers to all rules including Rule 4, except in this very limited instance where we want to preserve the


power to extend a parliamentary constituency boundary to coincide with an extended borough boundary. I cannot go further than that in trying to make it clear.</p>

<p>I now understand what the right hon. and learned Gentleman has in mind, but I still find it exceedingly obscure and I cannot welcome a subsection which applies a new factor to rules generally when, so far as I can see, it can apply only to a very limited class of case. But this is, after all, a point of intention, and I doubt whether there is sufficient difference between the intention of the Attorney-General and the Government and our intention to justify pressing the point too far.<br/>
There is, I think, another slight difference. We would have preferred a more nearly equal place to be given to the new factor than is given in the wording of the subsection, but, in view of what has been said and the explanation given as to the limited character of the reference to Rule 4, we need not press it.</p>

<p>I will, of course, consider all that the hon. and learned Gentleman has said about it. There is really no difference apparent in the Committee as to the intent. It is merely a matter of language. I agree with the hon. and learned Gentleman as to the desirability of making the language as clear and precise as possible.

<p>I am much obliged to the right hon. and learned Gentleman. He used the phrase just now, "a slight presumption". That is the way I would read the subsection, and I hope that I may be allowed, without disrespect, to say that the phrase used by the right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the House, on Second Reading, seemed to me to go a little too far. He said that there is a presumption against making changes unless there is a very strong case for them. Those were a few words spoken in the course of a long, eloquent and useful speech.<br/>

<p>I beg to move, in page 2, line 34, at the end to add:
<q>(3) For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding any previous practice, it is hereby declared that nothing in the said rules enjoins or justifies any difference between the application of sub-paragraph (<i>a</i>) (i) of paragraph (1) of rule 4 of those rules to the inclusion of a county or any part thereof in a constituency which includes the whole or part of any other county and the application of that sub-paragraph to the inclusion of a county or any part thereof in a constituency which includes the whole or part of a county borough or metropolitan borough.</q>
This is one of four Amendments on the Notice Paper intended to call attention to the fact that certain practices which have been followed by the Boundary Commissions in the past are not justified by any of the rules. I repeat what I said just now&#x2014;that if a judicial and official Commission is sitting with, in practice, something very like the last word in these matters, and if it is governed by a set of statutory rules, it is highly undesirable that matters not in those rules should be introduced, because that means, in effect, handing over to the Commission a discretion which the Act does not justify and which, if it were to be handed over to the Commission, ought to be fully debated and considered in the House. I therefore see no reason why the Commission should ever depart from the rules.<br/>
I recognise, of course, as anyone must recognise in dealing with these rules, that the subject matter with which the Commission has to deal is of such a character that there are bound to be conflicts between the rules and bound to be cases where one rule must be given more weight than another. It is on that account that the rules were put in a certain order. A preference was given to the first three, as I see it the second place was given to the fourth, the third place to the fifth and the fourth place to the sixth. The order in which the rules occur is of significance when we look at the character of the calculations involved.<br/>
One part of Rule 1 deals with the question of the respect to be paid to the boundaries of counties and county boroughs.


All that the Amendment seeks to do is not that this importance or some other importance should be given to county boundaries or county borough boundaries, but simply, as is the case with the rules, to make no distinction between county boundaries and county borough boundaries.<br/>
Lest I should be accused of summarising incorrectly, let me read Rule 4 (1, <i>a, i</i>):
<q>no county or any part thereof shall be included in a constituency which includes the whole or part of any other county or the whole or part of a county borough or metropolitan borough;</q>
4.15 p.m.<br/>
If it were absolute, this would prohibit the Commission from ever crossing any county or county borough boundaries, but it is not absolute; it is absolute only as far as is practicable, having regard to the preceding rules. The practical difficulty is that in its last Report the Commission paid a religious regard to county boundaries and crossed them only in cases such as Rutland, where the county area is too small to make a complete constituency&#x2014;it had to cross a neighbouring county for that purpose&#x2014;or in cases where there was a constituency and, if I may say so, obviously had to be a constituency which involved the crossing of a county boundary.<br/>
This was not the case with county borough boundaries. The Commission, instead of making five or six constituencies from a city, did not hesitate to make five-and-a-half, adding half a constituency from the county outside. The result was to bring in housing estates which lay outside the county borough boundary altogether and to tack them on to a county borough.<br/>
I am not for the moment on the question of how far we ought to do that. All I am saying is that if the Commission does it in the case of county boroughs, and if it sticks to the rules, there is no reason why it should not do exactly the same with counties. If it finds that in a part of a county there is a market town which serves an area largely in a neighbouring county, or something like that, it should hesitate no more and no less to cross a county boundary than it should hesitate when it is dealing with a borough boundary.<br/>
I do not suppose that it will be disputed for a minute that this has been the practice of the Boundary Commission. I do not want to go into a long discourse to prove it. The cases are mentioned at the beginning of paragraph 15 of the Report:
<q>We have recommended a continuance, for parliamentary purposes, of the union of the Administrative Counties of Rutland and the Parts of Kesteven; the Administrative Counties of Northamptonshire and the Soke of Peterborough and the Administrative Counties of East and West Suffolk.</q>
Coming to the borough constituencies, we read:
<q>we have recommended the intersection of the boundaries of 28 boroughs and I urban district:</q>
The urban district does not matter for this purpose. Not all of these boroughs will necessarily be county boroughs but most of them will. If we go through the constituencies in detail there is not the least doubt about it.<br/>
It may be said that there is this difference: outside a county borough there are areas which in due course will be absorbed into the county borough. If that is a matter which ought to be taken into account it must be stated in the rules. We are now to have a judicial chairman, and I hope and believe that he will pay attention to the rules and nothing but the rules and will not rely on Parliament making the changes, which, in fact, Parliament refused to make on the last occasion, in the recommendations of the Commission.<br/>
We must remember that a widespread review of local boundaries, including county and county borough boundaries, will proceed in the next few years under the Local Government Act, assuming that right hon. Gentlemen opposite remain in office long enough to get the Local Government Bill on to the Statute Book.<br/>
There is no one who does not accept the fact that a review of that sort is required, a review which, in all parts of the country, will enable the Local Government Commission to look at both county and county borough boundaries, and in all parts of the country which contain a very large part of the total population will not only enable the Commission to do that but will enable new forms of local government to be started.<br/>
The continuous county contemplated by the Local Government Bill is a new and strange object. It may have its uses, but I do not want the boundaries of that legislative experiment to be treated any differently from, or with any less or more respect than the other boundaries referred to in this rule.<br/>
The Amendment is purely declaratory but it is declaratory of something which undoubtedly is in the rules and equally without doubt has not been followed by the Boundary Commission in the past.</p>

<p>The hon. and learned Member for Kettering (Mr. Mitchison) began by making some references to the statutory provisions of the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act, 1949. I should like to follow his example. I do not think that I part company with him in any real degree in what he said, though I differ with him in one respect. When one considers the provisions of paragraph 4 of the Schedule, there is nothing as a matter of construction of the Statute to lead to the view that paragraph 4 (1, <i>a, i</i>) is to take preference over paragraph 4 (1, <i>a, ii</i>) or paragraph 4 (1, <i>a, iii</i>) or paragraph 4 (1, <i>a, iv</i>) as a matter of legal construction, but, of course, as a matter of practical importance I am sure that the hon. and learned Member would agree that it would be less objectionable to depart from a county district boundary than it would be to depart from or alter or go across a county boundary or a county borough boundary.<br/>
I can agree with the hon. and learned Member that there is no distinction drawn in paragraph 4 (1, <i>a</i>) between a county being included in the whole or part of any other county and a county being included in the whole or part of a county borough or a metropolitan borough. They are dealt with in the same subsection of the same paragraph. No distinction is drawn there, but, as the hon. and learned Member said, those provisions are subject to the stipulation that they ought to be adhered to so far as is practicable. That is in the 1949 Act, and if the Bill reaches the Statute Book that must be read in the light of Clause 2 (2).<br/>
Where I must part company with the hon. and learned Member is on the facts. It is not right to say that the Boundary

Commissions can be assumed to have read this statutory provision wrongly, having regard to the discretion given to them. They are to have regard to these rules so far as practicable, and I want to deal with that point. The hon. and learned Member concluded by saying that this rule had not been followed by the Commissions. I do not think that there are grounds for saying that and, to go back to the subject matter of the Amendment, I do not think that there is any room for doubt about the meaning of the provision. In my view, therefore, the Amendment is quite unnecessary for the removal of doubt. One does not want to include in a statute provision for the removal of doubt when there is no doubt.<br/>
The hon. and learned Member's argument is based on the submission that the Boundary Commission for England has departed from that rule in more cases in relation to county boroughs than it has in relation to counties. I agree that it has, and I submit that it was right to do so having regard to the circumstances which it had to consider. One starts with the desire to preserve all local government boundaries and to avoid having Parliamentary constituencies cutting across those boundaries, but it is not the case, as the hon. and learned Member conceded, that the Boundary Commission has regarded county boundaries as entirely sacrosanct.<br/>
There is the case of the Sudbury and Woodbridge Division, which takes in part of East and West Suffolk. There is the administrative county of Rutland, which takes in part of Kesteven, and there is, perhaps, the borderline case of Northamptonshire and the Soke of Peterborough. I say that that is a borderline case because it is not beyond dispute that the Soke of Peterborough does not form part of the county of Northampton.</p>

<p>Certainly, for many purposes, but, I think, not for all. I am sure that I can have the agreement of the right hon. Gentleman that it is a constituency which is very well represented by my hon.

Nicholls), the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Works, whether it is part of the Soke of Peterborough or part of the County of Northampton that he represents.</p>

<p>Those are the three examples which I quoted. The point is that they exist already and the Boundary Commission did not interfere with them, but it created no new examples, though it made many in connection with county boroughs.</p>

<p>I was coming to deal with that. I apprehend that the reason why the Commission created no new examples was that there was no occasion to do so. The objective must be to preserve these boundaries and make them coincide with Parliamentary boundaries, but when one comes to the boroughs there is a very real difficulty and a position quite distinct from that of counties as a whole.<br/>
The real problem arises when there are boroughs which have electors in excess of the electoral quota. There are three possible methods of treating these boroughs. The first is to give them more seats. That would result in a large number of cases in which the seat in such a borough would represent considerably less than the electoral quota. That would be bound to mean that there would be fewer seats available for the county areas, and, consequently, county constituencies would be more oversized.<br/>
That is one way in which the matter could be dealt with, but I have not heard it suggested by anyone that county constituencies which have long travelling distances should be treated unfavourably compared with boroughs. That would be the result if a borough were divided into two seats with the electorate for each being far below the electoral quota. That is a method which I am sure the Committee would think would be wrong for the Boundary Commission to adopt.<br/>
The second method would be to let those borough constituencies remain with their electorates higher, and maybe considerably higher, than the electoral quota. The Boundary Commission's Report for 1947 took that course and Parliament, at the behest of a Socialist Government, then over-rode the Commission's recommendation and provided for 17 more constituencies. Therefore, that recommendation on the part of the Commission did not take effect. But that was a course of treatment of this problem which arises not in relation to counties, but in relation to boroughs.

4.30 p.m.<br/>
The third possible way of dealing with it is to reduce the electorate of a borough by including some of its electorate in a neighbouring county seat or to take from a county constituency and include in a borough seat, where we are dividing the borough into, say, two seats, a sufficient proportion of the county electorate to raise the electorate within one of those borough seats to a figure near the electoral quota. That was the method broadly adopted by the Boundary Commission in its last Report and which has been the subject of considerable criticism and led to the introduction of Clause 2 (2), which has been welcomed on both sides of the Committee.<br/>
It is not the case that there is any ground, as far as I can see, for saying that the Boundary Commission gave an interpretation different from that which the hon. and learned Gentleman has given and with which I agree, but in the exercise of the discretion that it is given under these rules it thought it right, having regard to the problem which arises in relation to boroughs, to depart from that part of Rule 4 (1, <i>a</i>).<br/>
It is significant that every time this House has drafted rules we have had a conflict between local associations and the desire for securing a higher degree of mathematical accuracy. The 1944 Act, which was passed after the Speaker's Conference, got into difficulties, as the right hon. Member for South Shields (Mr. Ede) will remember, because of the rule that constituencies should conform to the electoral quota, with a margin of 25 per cent. up and 25 per cent. down.<br/>
That provision led to such extraordinary results that the right hon. Gentleman rightly introduced a Bill in 1946 to give the Boundary Commission a greater degree of flexibility. The right hon. Gentleman said:
<q>The Third Schedule had been enacted &#x2026; too closely to a merely mathematical formula. Now representation in this House is something more than a matter of mere mathematics. This House, except for the University Members, is based on a territorial organisation and many of us are very proud to represent communities that are integral, human entities which have both a history and a very lively sense of corporate feeling. This purely mathematical formula, so harsh and unyielding in its effect, meant that in certain cases wards were lopped off a borough and put with an adjoining county division. I have been astonished, as I moved


about the country during the last two or three months, at the number of places which will be under-represented if they get only one Member which have said that they prefer to be slightly under-represented, and to have one Member, and remain a unity, rather than have a few of their wards lopped off and put in with some other groups of people with whom they have no very great community of interest."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 13th December, 1946; Vol. 431, c. 1559.]</q>
If I may respectfully say so to the right hon. Gentleman, I think that what he said was absolutely accurate and is as well founded today as it was then.</p>

<p>I shall not withdraw the word "respectfully", but leave it where it stands.<br/>
Throughout the country there exists a view that communities should be preserved. The provisions in Clause 2 (2) of the Bill will enable more effect to be given to that view. That means, to my mind, that the likelihood of having a repetition of those discrepancies as a result of a future review will be diminished.<br/>
I hope I have not taken too long in dealing with the Amendment. In conclusion, I come back to this point. One cannot argue, judging from the Commission's treatment of the problem relating to boroughs with an electorate in excess of the quota, that the Commission has misinterpreted the very clear and precise provisions of Rule 4 (1, <i>a</i>.) I do not think that there is any ground for saying that or that there is any doubt about the meaning of that provision. This is one of the occasions on which I have been able to entirely agree with the right hon. Gentleman's view of the law.<br/>
In those circumstances, I must advise the Committee that, instead of removing doubt, the inclusion of this provision might conceivably add to doubt about the meaning of the original provision.</p>

<p>We on this side agree with what the Attorney-General has said. There is something to be said for maintaining the entity of

boroughs, for the reasons that the right hon. and learned Gentleman has given. But this does not get over one of the great problems, namely, the under-representation of England. This is a point which must be looked at.</p>

<p>This is a narrow but, I think, important point.<br/>
Both the right hon. and learned Gentleman and I have no doubt that this rule treats borough boundaries and county boundaries in the same way. In both cases it is not an absolute treatment, but is subject to qualifications. I agree that the qualifications may apply more in one case than in another. But no change whatever was made to cross a county boundary. The only cases in which it was crossed or in which more than one county was included in a given area were where that was the position before the Commission reported. The Commission merely continued what existed already. I assure the right hon. and learned Gentleman that the opinion that it gave a different treatment to county borough boundaries and to county boundaries was widespread.<br/>
The complaints of people who found that part of an adjacent housing estate in the county had been added to their nice county borough constituency were numerous. They took the view&#x2014;and, in spite of what the Attorney-General said, I share it&#x2014;that they regarded these two types of boundary differently. I agree that it is to some extent a matter of doubt whether the different treatment that the Commission gave arose from a different view of the law affecting the matter or from a differing effect in the qualifying circumstances. The latter is the right hon. and learned Gentleman's suggestion. But, on his own showing, the only difference between us is that he says there is no doubt, and I feel that there is doubt. I do not put it merely on my own feeling. I am sure that there has been a great deal of doubt as to whether the boundaries have been treated in the same way.<br/>
Let us have no misunderstanding about it. I am not saying anything whatever about the proper treatment or the effect of these qualifications. All I am saying is that there is no distinction to be drawn between the one type of boundary and the other. It may well be that the qualifications will apply differently. That is a matter to be decided in each case, and there will be differences between one county borough and another county borough, and between one county and another county. I am certain that there has been doubt about the treatment of these two types of boundary.<br/>
The Amendment could do no conceivable harm and is simply to avoid doubt. It should be included for that purpose, and for that reason I hope that the Committee will accept it.</p>

<p>I must apologise to my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr. Mitchison) for not being present when he moved the Amendment.<br/>
I stand by every word which the right hon. and learned Gentleman the Attorney-General quoted. The first problem is that no scheme can be devised by which the Boundary Commissioners will please everybody. Let us make a start by making that open confession. As one who had three shots at trying to do it, I am willing to admit that for a start. At the time I made the speech which the right hon. and learned Gentleman quoted, I did not know that when the first review took place my seat would be one which would be involved in just that controversy.<br/>
The trouble is that the Boundary Commissioners do not give reasons for their decisions. If they did, it might be possible to understand their decisions. There was undoubtedly a feeling, after the review which took place when Lord Tenby was Home Secretary, that in too many cases what my hon. and learned Friend described took place.<br/>
What happened in my constituency is a good example. Four wards were lopped off the Borough of South Shields for Parliamentary representation and put in with the Borough of Jarrow. That had an astounding effect in the County Borough of South Shields. All political parties and all social organisations in the borough said, "We want to remain a borough and to have one Member of Parliament and not one and a bit and

then find, on issue in which we are in conflict as a borough with our neighbours on something which comes before Parliament, that we shall possibly not count in the House of Commons because our two Members cancel out one another."<br/>
That feeling is understandable and the right hon. and learned Gentleman did not say anything to vitiate its validity. That view was so strongly held that when the inquiry was conducted a recommendation was made and this proposed alteration was wiped out and the Parliamentary borough and the administrative county borough of South Shields are co-terminus with one another.
4.45 p.m.<br/>
There is the difficulty that there may sometimes be strong feelings in the non- county boroughs, parishes, urban districts, or county districts which are added to a bit of a county, borough that what happens in Parliamentary representation may very well guide those who have to decide on extensions of county boroughs. It has been denied, and quite rightly, that the two things have anything to do with one another, but one occasionally finds, when a case for an extension of county borough is being made, that there is an indication that administratively they are regarded as a unit and a community&#x2014;in one particular only&#x2014;and that that is prayed in aid of the extension of the county borough.<br/>
Not knowing the reasons&#x2014;and even when I was Home Secretary I did not know the reasons which actuated the Boundary Commissioners&#x2014;adds to the difficulties. As far as I know, the Home Secretary has no right to say to the Boundary Commissioners, "This appears to be a curious constituency which you have arranged. As I have to defend your recommendation in the House of Commons, I should like to know why you have reached this conclusion." Viscount Tenby stood at the Box defending the recommendations, but never said why the Boundary Commissioners had made them, not even in the case of Hackney and Bethnal Green, which was an astounding division.<br/>
When discretion is exercised, everyone is entitled to his opinion about whether it has been exercised wisely. However, I am not sure that the Home Secretary is not put in a difficult position, because he has to tell the House, "These people


have decided this. I have listened to the arguments, but they have settled it and we might as well go into the Division Lobbies." I do not think that that is the right way to deal with this matter.<br/>
On examination of what has happened, I feel that in all too many cases the discretion was used in favour of bringing what one might call at the highest the suburbs of a county borough into a county borough for Parliamentary purposes. The doctrine of community of interests could not have been given very much weight when that was done. I had hoped that the Amendment would be carried, because county borough boundaries, as much as county boundaries, are the boundaries of an area administered by a county council. Even if the Amendment is not accepted, I hope that that idea will appeal rather more to the Boundary Commissioners in future than it appears to have done in the past.<br/>
I am not very much wedded to the belief that we will ever get anything for pure administration which can be justified on merely arithmetical lines. It would be very much more convenient if one could take the figure of 57,000 and always be able to get a ring fence of the dots on the map around units of 57,000 without going over any boundary. However, after that, it is largely a matter of discretion when we are trying to make up the numbers who are to sit in the House of Commons.<br/>
It will always be left to somebody's discretion and reasons for the way the discretion has been used would be a help. It is no use saying that the House of Commons retains control of this matter after what we saw happen with the review when Lord Tenby was Home Secretary. I do not blame him for what occurred. He had the reports and, clearly, if the Home Office said, "They have not made much of a job of it, so we will try to do better", we would be involved in all kinds of considerations and suggestions as to why one bit of the map has been redrawn. However, I hope sincerely that in future county boundaries and county borough boundaries will be regarded as equally important in this consideration.<br/>
We are a long way from what happened before the Representation of the People Act of 1918. In those days a borough constituency was included in the

county, even where the borough was a county borough, for the purposes of giving ownership votes in the county to people whose property was within the borough. Until 1948 the county constituency of Wimbledon included all the ownership votes, which have now disappeared, in that part of the County of London which, prior to the 1888 Act, was in the ancient County of Surrey.<br/>
There may be still the feeling that a county borough is a part of the county. The county borough itself would not admit it in these days, and I have known cases where there is such a state of armed neutrality, at the best, between the county and the county borough as to make it doubtful whether the county would recognise it either.<br/>
This is important. I think that the doubt exists. If the right hon. and learned Gentleman will not accept the Amendment, I hope that one effect of today's discussion may be that, when the next review is made, a county borough will be regarded as having as important a boundary as a county.</p>

<p>I want to reinforce the pleas made by both my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr. Mitchison) and my right hon. Friend the Member for South Shields (Mr. Ede). First, there is the over-riding consideration that there are likely to be some changes in boundaries both as a result of the Local Government Bill now being discussed upstairs and possibly as a result of the findings of the Royal Commission for the Greater London area. Therefore, I think that this is a subject where perhaps even more care than usual is required because of the many interests involved and the uncertainty of the future of local government boundaries.<br/>
The Attorney-General said that as a matter of legal interpretation there was no difference between the categories of boundaries specified in Rule 4. Respectfully, I am sure that that is correct, but our doubt and the reasons for this Amendment arise largely from our experience of what happened on the last occasion. As my right hon. Friend said, a large number of the changes were not explicable on any basis of reason or, indeed in many cases, of mathematical equality. One could not discover the reasons, and it is much to be regretted that none were given by the English


Commission, unlike the Scottish Commission, which gave its reasons and so made its decisions somewhat more acceptable than otherwise they might have been.<br/>
Whether or not the status of the different boundaries is legally the same, it is clear that the English Commission, on the last occasion, proceeded to redistribution county by county. It was not a decision of the Act, it was a decision of the Commission, and it caused a good deal of offence to many interests and a great deal of unnecessary interference. The Commission also adopted for England an English electoral quota which was also not specified in the Act.<br/>
The result of these two decisions, which were decisions of the English Commission and not of the House of Commons or of the Act, resulted in the infringement of a large number of all the other local government boundaries except the boundaries of counties. One thing we want to assure ourselves about on this side of the Committee is that this will not again be the position when this Bill becomes law.<br/>
There were 540 changes as a result of the proposals in the 1948 and 1949 Acts and then 252 further changes which were recommended in the last review. The latter figure was slightly reduced by the time the orders came to the House, as there were only 181 of them, but that was enough. The right hon. and learned Gentleman quoted what my right hon. Friend has said about mathematical equality and the results of the 1948 review, but what happened in the latter review was far worse from the point of view of disturbance. There was far more disturbance last time than previously, in the sense of small alterations of boundaries which could not be justified either on the grounds of logic or on any principles of Parliamentary representation.<br/>
In London, the Boundary Commission, using this unauthorised English quota, divided that into the electors, at that time 2,300,000. As a result of that sum there were to be 42 seats for London instead of 43, with the result that the boundaries of four Metropolitan boroughs had to be merged and eight constituencies altered, in addition, to get rid of one constituency. Really, no one could have said that the principles of Parliamentary government would be seriously harmed if there

were 43 Members for London instead of 42. And they did this not only in relation to London. They did it also in the case of the West Riding, where the sum reached by their artificial formula again produced a reduction of seats from 42 to 40.</p>

<p>Sometimes these things seem to ocur in areas in which we have stronger interests, at any rate, when we are sitting on this side of the House. To reduce the 42 seats to 40 again 20 constituency boundaries were interfered with, and eight local authority areas.<br/>
That is the recent experience we have suffered. We want to be certain&#x2014;and we should be failing in our duty if we agreed to this Clause going into the Bill unless we were certain&#x2014;that this unnecessary interference with local government boundaries will not take place on a future occasion. With respect, although I am sure the Attorney-General believes that this will not happen, we want greater safeguards, which ought to be incorporated in the Bill. I hope, therefore, that he will see fit to add the words proposed, or similar words, which all make certain that this can be secured.</p>

<p>The greater safeguard which the hon. Gentleman wants is the safeguard given by Clause 2 (2). In my view, this Amendment does not provide any safeguard. I appreciate from what has been said that the doubts felt arise from what the Commission did, and particularly from the fact that it did so without giving any reasons therefor. I endorse what the right hon. Member for South Shields (Mr. Ede) has said about the difficulties that arise from the absence of reasons.
5.0 p.m.<br/>
This House has power to over-ride the decisions of the Boundary Commission, but the position of the Home Secretary of the day must be extremely difficult in deciding whether to recommend to this House an alteration in the recommendations of the Commission when he does not know, and is not told, the reasons for which the Commission acted. I have well in mind the difficulties that arose when Lord Tenby was Home Secretary and I remember taking part in those


debates, when the position was one of acute difficulty.<br/>
It is not for me to say, and the Act does not provide for it, but if I may express a personal view I feel that it would sometimes help if an indication of the reasons could be given. One can only speculate, but we can, I think, speculate here on fairly valid grounds why, in the cases to which the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (Mr. Skeffington) referred, departures were made from county borough boundaries. They were made, I think, to secure greater equality of electorates in the various constituencies.<br/>
The hon. Member has attacked the application by the last Commission of what he called the English electoral quota. In fact, that has been used each time by the Boundary Commission, the reason being that having regard to the fixed number of seats for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and the population in those areas, the electoral quota for the whole of the United Kingdom provides an entirely inadequate and wrong yardstick for the determination of the correct size of the English constituency. That being so&#x2014;and that is one of the matters dealt with by Clause 3, upon which I do not want to anticipate discussion&#x2014;and it also being obviously desirable that as nearly as possible English constituencies should have the same electorates, the Commission, I think rightly, applied what the hon. Member called the English electoral quota.<br/>
It was not that, however, which led to the disturbances to which the hon. Member drew attention, in the sense of small alterations of boundary. Nor do I think that it was any doubt as to the meaning of Rule 4 (1, <i>a,</i> i) that led to the situation to which the right hon. Member for South Shields drew attention. What led to it was, I believe, the fact that the Commission felt that under the rules as they then were, it did not have sufficient</p>

<p>liberty to depart from the objectives, clearly revealed by the rules, of securing as near as possible a degree of mathematical equality in rural areas. That, I believe, was the real reason.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1958-03-27a.624.1" colnum="624" time="">
<p>I agree very much with what the right hon. Gentleman said about the sense of unity and the feeling of a community that it should not be separated, whether inside or outside a county borough. I disagree with him in one respect, in that I hops that the cases where there is strong feeling between a county borough and the rest of the county are not very numerous. Certainly, in my part of the country there is the closest possible association.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1958-03-27a.624.2" colnum="624" time="">
<p>The course followed by the Commission last time does not, in my view, show that there is any reason to suppose that there is the slightest doubt as to the interpretation to be placed upon the existing rule or the slightest need for the introduction of a rule headed, "For the avoidance of doubt", because there is, to my mind, no doubt on this matter of legal construction. It has been said already that the chairman of each of the Commissions will now be a judge.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1958-03-27a.624.3" colnum="624" time="">
<p>I cannot advise the Committee to insert into the Statute a provision "For the avoidance of doubt" when there is no doubt as to the legal interpretation of the Statute. The application of that Statute is another matter. Its application in the past has, as I have sought to indicate, been due to the difficulty created by the boroughs having electorates in excess of the quota and the feeling of the Boundary Commission that it was compelled by the rules to make adjustments to secure more uniformity in electorates. It is given greater discretion by subsection (2) as it stands and I can only advise the Committee that any further Amendment of this nature is wholly unnecessary.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 2, line 34, at the end to add:
<q>(3) For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding any previous practice, it is hereby declared that, subject to the application of rule 6 of the said rules to any constituency to which by reason of special geographical considerations that rule relates, nothing in those rules enjoins or justifies any difference between the average electorates of urban and rural constituencies, as such, or the average electorates of borough and county constituencies, as such.</q>
This is another Amendment designed to remove doubt. The question of practice in this case is a litle more clear than it was in the previous one. Let me begin by stating what the difficulty is and how I believe it has arisen. In terms, the rules provide for one exceptional case&#x2014;mostly, from its nature, a rural case. Rule 6 provides that
<q>A Boundary Commission may depart from the strict application of the last two foregoing rules"&#x2014;</q>
and I would add that the last two foregoing rules are themselves grafted on to the first three&#x2014;
<q>if special geographical considerations, including in particular the size, shape and accessibility of a constituency, appear to them to render a departure desirable.</q>
I suggest that it is obvious to what type of case the rule applies. It applies not merely to a rural constituency, but to a special type of rural constituency. Some instances are obvious, the most obvious being the crofting counties in Scotland and some similar areas in Wales. We can all argue whether or not there may be other cases; it is arguable that one or two English constituencies might be regarded in the same light. However, that is a matter for the Commission, because special geographical considerations have to appear to the Commission to render a departure from the previous rules desirable. It is not a matter which was intended to be decided in the rules themselves; on the contrary, it was expressly left to the Commission.<br/>
Of one thing there can be no reasonable doubt. The rule is not intended to

make any general distinction between the country and the town, or between a county and a borough constituency; it is wholly inappropriate for that purpose. In the ordinary case of a county constituency, in Surrey, for example, it is pretty obvious that the rule will not apply. If we take the County of Northampton, one division of which I have the honour to represent, it is quite clear that none of its constituencies are of that type. If the Boundary Commission chooses to apply the rule rather more widely or narrowly than other people, that does not matter; the point is that it is a rule for special cases.<br/>
Subject to the application of the rule, which applies only where there are special geographical considerations, there is no distinction between urban and rural constituencies, or borough and county constituencies. Accordingly it follows that, as such, no distinction is made in the rules with regard to their average electorates. It could be put in, but it certainly is not in. The trouble is that in this case, at any rate, the Commission certainly acted as if there were such a distinction. The passage of the Report which I have in mind is that at the beginning of paragraph 14, which says:
<q>In our initial Report we express the view, that, in general, urban constituencies could more conveniently support large electorates than rural constituencies and our recommendations were framed so as to enable recognition to be given to this view.</q>
Then, the Commission refers to the addition of the borough constituencies in 1948, and continues:
<q>The modification by Parliament of those recommendations, resulting in the creation of additional constituencies in a number of the larger boroughs, had the incidental effect of upsetting the balance that we had thought appropriate between the electorates of urban and rural constituencies. We have given considerable thought to the treatment to be accorded to the areas thus affected.</q>
The Report goes on to deal further with the matter. It is perfectly clear that the Commission believed that it carried in its mind an appropriate balance between


the electorates of urban and rural constituencies. There is nothing whatever in the rules to justify anything of the sort, and it is open to one very obvious objection.<br/>
If, in fact, the Commission was trying to strike a balance of that sort and to consider how far recognition should be given to that view, then it ought to have considered the facts about the constituencies concerned, and ought to have taken evidence&#x2014;not only as regards this, that and the other constituency, but generally&#x2014;as to the position between rural and urban areas. Of course, the Commission did nothing of the sort, and the balance which it had in mind was a general balance. It has the incidental effect of upsetting the balance that we had thought appropriate between the electorates of urban and rural constituencies. It is not a particular case, but a general balance, and that general balance was something which the Commission devised in its own mind, and, so far as I can see, by no light whatever, except, remarkably, an intuitional one.<br/>
That really will not do. The Commission is not set up to form opinions on general considerations of that nature. It is not set up to take account of factors which are not in the rules. It is particularly not set up to take account of factors the weight and quantitative effect of which cannot be within the knowledge of the members of the Commission, and must be a matter of highly individual opinion, in so far as it is not a question of actual evidence.<br/>
It is for a very good reason that the Statute does not require this balance to be struck or this view to be formed, and it is not because it is a matter that has been omitted, for in the different, but not wholly dissimilar, case of the special areas&#x2014;the places where special geographical considerations have to be taken into account&#x2014;there is a direction, and this has been followed out. If we look at the average electorates of the crofting counties in Scotland and corresponding areas in Wales, we see that they are very definitely below the average, and I hope that nothing I say today will be taken to indicate that I find any fault with that. I see a very good reason for what is in the Statute&#x2014;for instance, the special treatment of an area like the County of Argyll, which I know well. To get from

one end of it to another is an extremely difficult matter, and this is what the word "accessibility" means.<br/>
On the question of size in relation to population, I should guess that it is much bigger in relation to its population than any constituency in England. It is certainly bigger than most. As regards its shape, if anybody ever tried travelling along the coastline of Argyll, he would go an extremely long journey to arrive at a point not nearly so far distant from that from which he started as the devious ways he will have followed&#x2014;up one sea loch and down another, round this bend and that one&#x2014;along one of the most rocky and indented coasts of the country. If we wanted to convene the County Council of Argyll, it would be no use expecting the members to use railway trains. They would come by a strange diversity of routes and a strange variety of methods of carriage, some by air, some by sea, some by road, and occasionally, but only very occasionally, with a little help&#x2014;and no more&#x2014;from the railways.<br/>
This is exactly the type of constituency to which Rule 6 is intended to relate; but to try to apply it to justify striking some balance between a county constituency in Surrey or in Northampton and an urban borough constituency within the same geographical area would be to apply a complete misreading of what the rules are about and of the directions which they give to the Commission.<br/>
I must at once not only admit but assert something. There is not the least doubt that, on the political balance in this country, hon. and right hon. Gentlemen opposite are much more listened to and heeded in the remote countryside, where ideas, perhaps, penetrate rather more slowly, than they are among the more quick-witted&#x2014;I think I may say, with all respect to the countryside&#x2014;inhabitants of the towns. On political considerations, the balance is quite obviously in our favour in the urban districts, and, by and large, in the borough constituencies, and in favour of the party opposite in the county constituencies and the rural areas. From our political point of view, to look at the Home Counties is occasionally a trifle depressing; not so when we look at the large industrial centres, or even at London itself.<br/>
That being so, it is the more necessary that the party opposite, being in power at the moment, should be completely frank on this matter, and should make certain that the directions to the Commission by these statutory rules should be followed. If they have been misunderstood or misapplied that should be corrected, for there is a duty on the Home Secretary of the day to have a measure of impartiality in this matter.
5.30 p.m.<br/>
I can see no justification whatever for one vote in the country counting for more than a vote in a town. The actual figures show a difference of a few thousand. The difference at present is an average of about 4,000; but I do not think that is the point. It may very well be that, for other reasons, there was some difference between the two averages. I am interested only that, in the name of justice as between one electorate and another, and between one political party and another, we should declare clearly that to strike a general balance of some sort and to make a general distinction between urban or rural constituencies&#x2014;or their more strict counterparts, borough and county constituencies&#x2014;is not justified by the rules and is not enjoined by them and is, in fact, quite wrong.<br/>
From the passages which I quoted, there can be do doubt that the last Boundary Commission did it. There can be no doubt that if we look at the electorates for England there is a discrepancy, part of which may possibly be explained on other grounds. I am not concerned with that. I am concerned that we should indicate clearly and simply to this judicial and official Commission that these are the rules; that they must be carried out, and that they do not justify any distinction between the average electorate of one type of constituency and that of another.<br/>
Of course, there may be differences in the electorate as between one borough constituency and another. Equally, there may be a difference between one county and another or between a borough and a county. I am not concerned with that. I am concerned that an error into which in this case the Commission indubitably fell shall not be repeated. That it has been done once should not serve as an excuse or reason for it being repeated.</p>

<p>I wish to support my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr. Mitchison). It is important that this difference because of size between county and borough constituencies should be terminated. I agree with what was said by my hon. and learned Friend about the remote parts of the Highlands or Wales, and the need to have constituencies there with smaller electorates to ensure that the people are adequately represented in this House. But in considering the greater part of the English countryside one realises that it is not difficult to get from one part of a constituency to another. In fact under modern traffic conditions in some cases it may be easier to travel by rural roads rather than by main roads through industrial areas.<br/>
This idea of the county areas having a smaller average electorate than that of the towns is based upon the conditions prevailing in the pre-motor car age. I should have thought that in these days, when political speakers go about by car from one part of their constituency to another, whether they are fighting an election or attending functions in the ordinary work of a constituency member, there is no need for that distinction in size to be maintained. Even more important is the feeling among many of us that this is a form of political discrimination in favour of one party.<br/>
At the last General Election when the present Government came to power there were a larger number of constituencies where the number of votes for the Government dropped than there were in the 1951 Election when the increase in the Government majority was due mainly to the fact that the Labour Party dropped more votes than the Conservative Party. It is important to realise that in the 1951 General Election the Labour Party won a larger number of votes in the country than did the Conservative Party, yet the Conservative Party secured a majority of seats in this House. That was due partly to the fact that the Labour Party votes were more concentrated than those of the Conservative Party. There were many constituencies like my own with a large majority of Labour votes while the Conservative votes were spread over a wider area. That was to their advantage and it gave them more seats. The areas over which the Conservative votes were spread tended to be county areas, and a


bias in favour of the county areas would be to the electoral advantage of the Conservative Party&#x2014;as it was in 1951 and as it has been throughout General Elections. That, of course, may not be so at the next Election.<br/>
We should not, however, look at this matter from the point of view of whether a General Election gives an advantage one way or the other, but with the idea of ensuring that the political forces are adequately represented in this House. I think it a disadvantage to our political system if we frequently have General Elections which lead to a majority in the House of a political view different from that of the majority of the electorate. In the last century, under a two-party system, that rarely happened. Once or twice there was a majority of voters whose views were not in accordance with the majority of those elected to the House. One famous occasion was when Mr. Disraeli came to power with a minority of the electorate behind him, but generally speaking, that did not happen, and under a two-party system it is not likely to happen.<br/>
At present, however, with a three-party system, it is a distinct possibility that a party may come to power, but that a second party may have received more votes. That should be avoided. We should have normal-sized electorates in constituencies of approximately the same size all over the country and bear in mind the point about them coinciding so far as possible with local government units. We should give instructions to the Boundary Commission&#x2014;as we should if the Amendment were accepted&#x2014;to see that in future when drawing up the constituency boundaries it does not give an advantage to county areas as opposed to urban areas.</p>

<p>Before replying to the hon. and learned Member for Kettering (Mr. Mitchison) I wish to challenge a statement by the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Parker). From personal experience I can say that the use of a motor car does not enable one to serve a rural constituency with the same facility as one can serve an urban constituency. In a three-week Election campaign in Huntingdonshire I have to travel over 1,000 miles, and in order to visit less than half of the committee rooms I must

travel over 100 miles. It takes the best part of two or three years for me to get round the constituency, which includes eighty villages and half-a-dozen small towns. I do not know how many weeks it would take the hon. Member for Dagenham to get round his constituency but I can assure him that his is a very different problem. I think that should be stressed because it is fundamental to our discussions.<br/>
The hon. and learned Member for Kettering based his case strictly on the interpretation of the rules, and I will endeavour to deal with the matter in the same way. I have no quarrel with the hon. and learned Gentleman about Rule 6. That rule applies, not to the average run of rural constituencies in England, for example, but to those constituencies where there are geographical considerations. It is interesting to read the rules and note that it is not size, shape, or accessibility, but a combination of all three factors, that must apply before the rule can be brought into operation. I mention that because it emphasises the somewhat narrow scope of Rule 6.<br/>
The intention of the Amendment which the hon. and learned. Gentleman has submitted is clear from its emphatic wording. The essential meaning is&#x2014;to paraphrase it&#x2014;that nothing except special geographical considerations justifies any difference between the average electorates for urban and rural or borough and county constituencies.</p>

<p>If the hon. and learned Gentleman would add the words "as such" that are in the Amendment he would be nearer. There are other circumstances to be taken into account. All I am saying is that the Boundary Commission did make a distinction between them as such.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1958-03-27a.634.1" hansard_membership_id="11335" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20028" speakername="Mr. Renton" colnum="634" time="">
<p>That brings me immediately to what the Boundary Commission did and why it did it. It found, in the period up to 1947, that there was a disparity&#x2014;I think there has always been one&#x2014;between the electorates of urban and rural constituencies since the rationalisation brought about by the Reform Act. In 1954, there was a disparity of about 1,700. As the result of the review of that year the disparity, as the hon. and learned Gentleman mentioned earlier, reached nearly 4,000. What he may not


know and what it is material for the Committee to consider, is that the disparity on the 1957 register has readjusted itself to 1,625.<br/>
Therefore, when the hon. and learned Gentleman speaks about the Boundary Commission having offended the rules by creating a disparity, we have to bear in mind that there has always been some disparity and that the greatest disparity which it created was just under 4,000, which, in an average electorate of 57,000 in England, gives us a difference between an average of 55,000 for rural constituencies and of 59,000 for urban constituencies. Neither figure is unreasonable.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1958-03-27a.635.0" hansard_membership_id="9373" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/18429" speakername="Mr. Mitchison" colnum="635" time="">
<p>It tried to create a disparity of 6,000 but Parliament stepped in and gave the seats to the boroughs. The hon. and learned Gentleman's party complained.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1958-03-27a.635.1" hansard_membership_id="11335" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20028" speakername="Mr. Renton" colnum="635" time="">
<p>Perhaps it is material to consider what was said by the hon. and learned Gentleman's party, which was in power at the time. It is true that in 1948 the party considered that the Boundary Commission's 1947 review contained undue weighting for county constituencies, but none the less the right hon. Member for South Shields (Mr. Ede), when he was Home Secretary, said that the Government accepted the view that there was a reason for giving some advantage in numbers to county divisions.<br/>
In 1954, when we were discussing the orders following the review of that year, the right hon. Member for South Shields said that he had contested both rural and urban constituencies and knew the extra strain placed on a candidate in a county division. This year, in the Second Reading debate on the Bill, he said he stood by that. He said there was ground for some slight weighting where there was a genuine county constituency. I do not wish to take the right hon. Gentleman's case any further than he wished it to be taken on that occasion. He went on to qualify this statement by adding that some county constituencies were more urban than rural.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1958-03-27a.635.2" hansard_membership_id="3892" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/14480" speakername="Mr. Ede" colnum="635" time="">
<p>I could illustrate that by the Surrey constituency in which I live, which consists of the Borough of Epsom and Ewell and the urban district of Leather-head. It might just as well for all

practical purposes have been called a borough.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1958-03-27a.636.0" hansard_membership_id="11335" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20028" speakername="Mr. Renton" colnum="636" time="">
<p>I fully accept that, but the right hon. Gentleman's intervention does not in any way destroy the validity of his earlier statement which I have quoted, to the effect that there are genuine rural constituencies in which, for one reason or another, we may expect to find a slight weighting. From the figures I have given, I do not think the weighting can be said to be other than slight; 1,625 on an average of 57,000 is very slight weighting indeed.<br/>
The hon. and learned Gentleman made the point which, on the face of it, is technically good, that there is nothing in the 1949 Act or in the rules made under it, which justifies a disparity between urban and rural or county and borough constituencies, as such. I accept the force of those words "as such", because they are important in this context. That seems to be so, and if it is, there is no need for an Amendment starting with the words:
<q>For the avoidance of doubt &#x2026;</q>
Let us consider not merely the rules but the way in which they have come to be operated. In operating the rules, the Boundary Commission has clearly acted in accordance with Rule 4, and in accordance with the kind of sentiment discussed on earlier Amendments today it finds itself obliged to follow local government boundaries where possible. When dealing with the boundaries of rural local government areas it necessarily has to embrace quite large territories which are sparsely populated. That reason alone accounts for the very slight weighting between rural and urban areas and fully justifies it.<br/>
I was prepared, in case the matter should arise, to make a most impassioned speech saying that, quite apart from what is in the rules, it was clearly right and just, in order that our constituents might be properly served, that the representation in rural areas should not be as heavy as in urban areas, but the case is so clearly understood and has been so clearly put by the right hon. Member for South Shields in the past, that there is no need for me to do so. I come back to the point made by the hon. and learned Member for Kettering, in relation to what the rules contain.


5.45 p.m.<br/>
The rules themselves are plain enough. Rule 6 makes special provision, and Rule 4 says that local government boundaries have to be followed. The necessary and, indeed, inevitable result of that, coupled with other factors which it might not be in order to discuss on this Amendment, leads to a disparity. The disparity itself can be justified on broad, historical and practical grounds. Surely the Commission, in exercising what is, after all, a discretion in the interpretation of these rules, is not only entitled but obliged to bear in mind the historical and practical reasons.<br/>
I wish to assure the right hon. and learned Gentleman&#x2014;</p>

<p>The hon. and learned Gentleman has so often the prestige of a Privy Councillor when he speaks that one tends to make that mistake. I assure him that this matter has received the most careful consideration, and that neither from the point of view that he expresses, nor in order to achieve greater clarity in the Bill, nor in order to put forward the point of view that I was tempted to deploy but did not, is his Amendment necessary.</p>

<p>I have been a Parliamentary candidate in the rural area of Holland with Boston. I agree, of course, that candidature in such a rural area is very hard work, but I do not think that that rules out the argument that in the days of the motor car there is no justification for special representation there. That particular seat, of course, is in one of the most prosperous agricultural parts of the country. It has an electorate of about 70,000, as well as covering an enormous area. It must have about the largest agricultural electorate but I do not think that that fact justifies a bias in favour of agricultural areas.<br/>
The point has been made about the bias now being only 1,625 instead of 4,000 to the advantage of the county constituencies as opposed to the urban, but I should have thought that that change was largely due to the growth of industrialisation in a limited number of county seats; and that if some of the seats&#x2014;such as Epsom, which was mentioned by my right hon. Friend the Member for South Shields (Mr. Ede)&#x2014;

were transferred from the county to the urban list the difference would be very much larger, and much closer to the 4,000 that previously existed.<br/>
We may still find more industrialisation taking place in the seats round the big towns which would, on figures, possibly abolish the distinction altogether, whilst still leaving a very real bias in favour of what I would call the real rural areas. That fact should be borne in mind when the figures are considered.</p>

<p>It was my misfortune to come in rather late to what has all the character of a somewhat esoteric discussion, but perhaps I might support the proposition just advanced by my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Parker).<br/>
I understand that the disparity of 1,600 is that between the average electorate of the county constituency and of the urban one. It seems to me, and I appreciate that this is really my hon. Friend's point, that if that is the basis of calculation, its significance may be very nearly entirely destroyed if it be the fact that some of the county constituencies are urban constituencies in all but designation and name.<br/>
So far as I have followed the argument, I should have thought, bearing in mind that factor, that a case had certainly been made out that it would be appropriate to take steps to ensure that a disproportionate overweighting in favour of county constituencies was something to be avoided.</p>

<p>The hon. and learned Gentleman the Under-Secretary, in what he said was not the impassioned speech that, in certain circumstances, he might have delivered, quoted me as having made pronouncements on this subject in the past. Of course, when quoting me, he did not give due weight to the word "slight". He quoted it and then proceeded to assume that it could be ignored. My own view is that an average difference of 1,625 is not slight. I should have thought that the Boundary Commission could have got a great deal closer if it had regarded this from the urban and rural point of view rather than that of county and borough, because the words are not quite interchangeable. All borough seats are not entirely urban, and, certainly, a large number of county seats are not, in any sense of the word, rural.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman the Member for South Shields (Mr. Ede) has sought to make a distinction between what he said about a previous position and that with which we are faced today by defining the word "slight." It is entirely a matter of judgment and opinion, but, with all respect, we do not agree with him. We consider that in relation to an average of 57,000, 1,600 is a slight distinction, and that, in all the circumstances and all the difficulties with which the Boundary Commission has been faced, it has done a good job if it has managed to get the averages within 1,600 of each other.</p>

<p>I should like to liven up this discussion a little, as I regard the defence put forward by the Government as absolutely scandalous. The 1949 Act clearly states that
<q>Each Boundary Commission shall keep under review the representation in the House of Commons of the part of the United Kingdom with which they are concerned and shall, in accordance with the next following subsection"&#x2014;</q>
and that is the subsection relating to time, and so on:
<q>submit to the Secretary of State reports with respect to the whole of that part of the United Kingdom, either &#x2026; showing the constituencies into which they recommend that it should be divided"&#x2014;</q>
and for what purpose:
<q>in order to give effect to the rules set out in the Second Schedule to this Act &#x2026;</q>
and for no other purpose.<br/>
The idea that some sentimental association of the hon. and learned Gentleman's with Huntingdonshire or general considerations of the balance to be struck between countryside and town should enter into the matter at all strikes me as conferring on the Boundary Commissions a distinction and a duty which the Act that constituted them has not conferred on them&#x2014;</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1958-03-27a.639.2" hansard_membership_id="11335" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20028" speakername="Mr. Renton" colnum="639" time="">
<p>As the hon. and learned Gentleman has mentioned my representation of Huntingdonshire, perhaps I may tell him that I happen to represent the whole of an administrative county which had an electorate of 45,000 last time and may have one of about 50,000 next time. Does he say that, for the sake of some mathematical provision, the boundaries of that parliamentary constituency should be extended so as to take in part of

some other county? If so, I should have thought that there were very few people who would agree with him.</p>

<p>So should I, and that is not what I was saying. If the hon. and learned Gentleman would pay a little more attention to the substance of the matter and a little less to the metaphysical deductions that he chooses to make from perfectly clear statements, we should get on a little better. After all, Oliver Cromwell came from those parts, and his language about this sort of thing would have been very forthright.
6.0 p.m.<br/>
Unless or until the House alters the law, the Government should carry it out. The law lays down that the Boundary Commission has to carry out the reviews in accordance with the rules. What the Government are trying to do is to add on top of the rules a number of quite different things. When he gets up, the right hon. and learned Gentleman the Attorney-General will, no doubt, manage somehow or other to engraft them into the rules. I wish him all success. But, in fact, the Boundary Commission did not do that.<br/>
What the Boundary Commission did was to try to strike a balance, to give weight to its own views as to the relative convenience of a rural constituency or an urban constituency, or, if one likes, of a borough and a county constituency. The difference is smaller. No doubt it may exist. I do not say that it does not. All I say is that it is not a matter upon which the Boundary Commission had any ground for forming a view at all. It is not a matter upon which it took any evidence. It is not a matter it was charged to consider by the terms of the rules, and the Commission was thereby giving to itself a discretion and duty which it cannot justify in the terms of the Act.<br/>
All I ask for in this Amendment is that this should simply be stated. I defy the right hon. and learned Gentleman to get up and tell me that there is any distinction in the Act either between urban and rural constituencies&#x2014;neither of which, of course, is mentioned in the Act&#x2014;or between borough and county constituencies. What there is is a wholly separate point, which I am glad to hear the hon. and learned Gentleman on behalf of the Government accept so unreservedly, that Rule 6 does provide for


some special cases. I share his view as to what those separate cases are. There is no doubt about that. Apart from that, there is no distinction at all.<br/>
The fact is that, in this instance at any rate, there can be no doubt that the Boundary Commission acted on a distinction and sought to strike a general, not a particular, balance between rural and urban constituencies and to form its own view, on a matter of policy, as to what the balance should be and what advantage in votes should be given to those who live in the countryside as against those who live in the town. I am not asking for mathematical exactitude. I am not asking for similarity in all these points. All I am asking is that it should be made quite clear that even the Government and the Boundary Commission must carry out the law.<br/>
Finally, we have the somewhat startling defence, the classic defence about the poor illegitimate child&#x2014;"It's only a little one". And this from the Home Office! I should have thought that the Home Office would be the last place to produce that particular defence. It really puzzles me. If the Home Office or the Boundary Commission is going to break the law, does it matter whether the breach will be a large one or a small one? In fact, the numbers have fluctuated. They were up to 6,000 as an average, if the Report of the Boundary Commission had been accepted by the House. It was not, and the seats were given to the boroughs. Then the figure came back to 1,900, then up again to 4,000, and now it is back to 1,500 or 1,600. Obviously, it may vary one way or the other.<br/>
Equally obviously, as my hon. Friends have pointed out, these figures do not touch the reality of the matter. It is not a question of whether a constituency is one of a large number of constituencies that are county constituencies or of similar ones which are not county constituencies. It is the substance of the thing which matters, and the substance is that the yokel in the countryside has more value for his vote than a workman in the city.<br/>
There is another matter of substance, a very important one, which I do not want to have neglected. The Conservative Party profits by this anomaly. However small or however large the illegitimate child may be&#x2014;and this is an

illegitimate child to the extent that it exists at all&#x2014;the Conservative Party profits. The Government ought not to hesitate to put matters right in the Bill. There is no doubt that it has not been acted upon. There is no doubt that we are now to have a judicial and official Commission which will look at its rules.<br/>
The trouble is that it may also look at the doings of previous Boundary Commissioners, some of whom themselves have had legal and official associations. The Commission may say that this repeated illegality, this succession of little bastards coming along one after the other in this manner, may result in the practice acquiring the force of law. Really, some of the contentions of the hon. and learned Gentleman were quite remarkably like it&#x2014;"It has been done before," "It is a reasonable thing to do"&#x2014;and, therefore, he suggested, the Boundary Commission ought to do it.<br/>
The Boundary Commission is bound by these rules. If it is sought to put something else into them, the right thing to do is to put it in in terms, and to have the matter properly argued, not to let illegalities creep in, to the advantage of one political party, by mere repetition.</p>

<p>The hon. and learned Member for Kettering (Mr. Mitchison) said that he wanted to liven up the debate, and he has strained very hard to achieve that object. I must say that I cannot congratulate him upon the arguments that he has advanced to do so. He sought to make some reflections upon the Home Office and its attitude to what he regards as a little breach of the law, and he sought to make a substantial attack upon the Boundary Commission, praying in aid what he conceives that Oliver Cromwell might or might not have done in Huntingdon. Really, his argument cuts right across the arguments he has advanced on previous Amendments. There is no ground whatever for his unwarranted attack upon the Boundary Commission and how it operated.<br/>
I ask the hon. and learned Gentleman to pay attention to this particular factor. If one preserves the local communities, the boroughs, where the population is in excess of the electoral quota&#x2014;and we recognise and agree that that should be done&#x2014;it is quite impossible that one should maintain as high an average for


the county constituencies as one does for the boroughs, unless one makes county constituencies of a size which it would really be quite impracticable for an ordinary Member, of whatever party, adequately to represent. It follows from the proposition that one should depart from mathematical accuracy in having regard to local ties and community interests that one encounters the impossibility of achieving a precise equality of average electorates between counties and boroughs.<br/>
It is very easy to say that the workman in the county has more value attached to his vote than the workman in the town. But that must follow inevitably if one accepts the proposition that, because in a borough all people want to vote in that borough and nowhere else, the electorate in the borough is kept above the electoral quota. It must happen. But, as I see it, it does not follow that the Boundary Commission, which has a duty and discretion, was in any way guilty of a breach of the law. If it had been, it would have been possible to take proceedings in the courts with regard to it.</p>

<p>The difficulty is that, although the Boundary Commission did not give many explanations, it did explain, in the passage I read out before, what it did in this respect, and it was not what the right hon. and learned Gentleman says that it did. The Commission did make a distinction of kind between the two types of constituency.</p>

<p>We have all read the Commission's Report. I am trying to point out that there is no escape from this fact if the hon. and learned Gentleman insists on the average for the county divisions being the same as the average for the borough divisions. That is the point of the Amendment.</p>

<p>I seem to be succeeding, where the hon. and learned Gentleman did not, in enlivening the proceedings, although I do not wish to do so.<br/>
The efforts which we have made in past years to secure the acceptance of a mathematical principle have always landed us in difficulties. Here again, one cannot

completely match the average for counties and the average for boroughs if one gives preference, as I submit that one should, to the community interest and local ties which the Bill recognises. In both its Reports the Commission has acted in precisely the same way in this respect.<br/>
May I give another reason why the Committee would be most unwise to accept the Amendment? The rules apply to England, Scotland and Wales, and the Amendment says:
<q>Nothing in those rules enjoins or justifies any difference between the average electorates of urban and rural constituencies, as such, or the average electorates of borough and county constituencies, as such".</q>
That being so, the provision has a general application. That means, as a matter of interpretation, that throughout the United Kingdom we should have to have the same average electorate for borough and county constituencies, and for urban and rural constituencies. Because the provision for the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland membership is in Rule 1, this would mean that one would have to depart from the rules&#x2014;that is to say, reduce the Scottish, Northern Ireland and Welsh representation in the House&#x2014;to secure the maintenance of this average between borough and county constituencies.<br/>
There is nothing in the Amendment which limits its application to England. We have three different Boundary Commissions, but the rules which they have to apply are the same for each Commission. If it is to be declared that there is nothing in the rules at all which justifies any difference, it seems to me to follow that this would open up the whole question of Scottish, Northern Ireland and Welsh representation.<br/>
For this and other reasons, I cannot advise the Committee to accept the Amendment. In my belief there is no need whatever for a provision of this sort. Indeed, a provision of this sort might well cause very great difficulties for the Boundary Commission, having regard to its possible impact on the other rules.</p>
</speech>

<p>if the construction put forward in his last observation is the construction which the Attorney-General puts on the Amendment, he had better think again. What it says is perfectly clear. It refers to the average electorates of those types of constituency as such.


It is clear that it applies in the same way to England, Scotland and Wales and that it would have no effect whatever on any differences between averages in England, Scotland and Wales.<br/>
I will not argue with the right hon. and learned Gentleman about it, partly because of the distinguished office which he holds and the respect which, for that reason, I am compelled to pay to his opinions, and partly for another and simpler reason, which is that he knows quite well what the Amendment intends. If he chooses to say that it does not have the intended effect, he must answer the question: does he agree with the intention or not? If he does, then, on Report he should put down an Amendment which, in his opinion, is more suited to the purpose.<br/>
It is complete nonsense to say that the Amendment has any connection whatever with other factors which will no doubt affect the average when we get them. The point is that the Boundary Commission not merely gave effect to those factors, but said, in terms, that it had struck a</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1958-03-27a.646.0" colnum="646" time="">
<p>balance between rural constituencies as such and urban constituencies as such. It said that it had struck a general balance. Apart from the circumstances which may affect many rural constituencies in one way and many urban constituencies in another, the Commission drew a definite general balance and made a general distinction&#x2014;and that we say it had no right to do on the rules.</p>

<p>All we wish is that the clear meaning of the rules should be stated&#x2014;and it is stated, notwithstanding previous practice. We think it the more necessary because the excess of authority in this matter has clearly inured to the benefit of one political party as against another. We ask for fair treatment, the law as laid down in this Statute, and no more illegitimate excursions defended by the Home Office on the ground that they are only little ones.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 2, line 34, at the end to add:
<q>(3) Sub-paragraph (<i>a</i>) (iv) of paragraph (1) of rule 4 of the said rules (which provides that, so far as is practicable, no county district shall be included partly in one constituency and partly in another) shall cease to have effect.</q>
The intention of the Amendment, which has not attracted very much visible support, is purely exploratory, to find out what is in the Government's mind about a point which I hope to develop.<br/>
The latter part of Clause 2, as drafted, refers to Rule 4. Its effect would be that all parts of Rule 4, other than those which the Committee has amended so far, will continue to apply. The effect

of my Amendment would be to cancel Rule 4 (1, <i>a, iv</i>) which refers to county district boundaries. I understand that under Section 11 of the Local Government Act, 1933, it lies with the counties, if they consider it necessary, to initiate county district boundary reform or readjustment. They can make representations, accordingly, to the Home Secretary and, during a six weeks period, objections may be lodged.<br/>
The effect of this can be that it will lie with a county council completely to alter the political complexion of a county constituency. I think I am right in saying that this applies fairly exclusively, though possibly not entirely, to county constituencies. The kind of case I have in mind


is where the detachment of a large parish from one county district and its attachment to another, with the consequential boundary adjustment, can substantially alter the political complexion of two Parliamentary constituencies. That is, of course, on the assumption that the present present Rule 4 (1, <i>a, iv</i>) continues to apply.<br/>
My point, therefore, is whether it is the intention that political initiative in the matter of the political complexions of counties can lie&#x2014;and I use the expression "can lie"&#x2014;with a county council. I hope that I have made my point clear, though I should like to record that in my judgment it would be wrong to take away from county councils the right to readjust boundaries of county districts. I only want to ascertain whether it has been realised what could be the political consequences should a county council get into extremist hands at that level.</p>

<p>The Amendment will have the effect of deleting from Rule 4 the provision that in England and Wales no county district shall be included partly in one constituency and partly in another so far as that can practically be avoided. In practice, it has been avoided nearly always. Only in the rarest cases has it had to be done. It would be a pity to strike it out altogether, because there might be very rare cases where it would be the only way of resolving a great difficulty in deciding among a group of constituencies exactly where the boundary should be.<br/>
That is the substance of the hon. Gentleman's Amendment. But he has raised a separate point. I hope that I may be in order in reassuring him about his question whether county councils will still have the power which they have under local government legislation to alter the county district boundaries within their own areas. May I give that assurance to the hon. Gentleman? We are dealing with legislation for Parliamentary boundaries, and that does not in any way affect the rules or laws relating to the boundaries of local government.</p>

<p>I feel that I have either not made myself clear, or that the Minister has not taken my point about the question of political initiative on Parliamentary divisions by county councils.</p>

<p>The position is that an individual or a local authority may at any time make representation to the Parliamentary boundary commission to suggest that a particular Parliamentary constituency needs review. That right is present, and it will remain.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1958-03-27a.650.1" hansard_membership_id="12607" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20773" speakername="Mr. Snow" colnum="650" time="">
<p>I feel that I must persevere with this point. It is true that the initiative is present and, so far as I can see, should remain with a county council to alter its own district boundaries. What I do not understand is this, and perhaps the Minister can explain. Suppose, for example, that it is desirable to transfer a tightly knit and well populated parish from one county district to another. The effect of that transference can completely alter the political complexion of one of the districts concerned. I gather that the Minister agrees with me so far. Since a Parliamentary constituency should normally only comprise whole county districts, and not parts of county districts, does it not follow that a county council can initiate a change in the political complexion of a constituency?</p>

<p>The county council can initiate a change which may affect the political complexion of constituencies, but it would not be right for any county council to seek to make such a change in local government areas solely for the purpose of altering the political complexion of Parliamentary representation. I trust that different considerations would prevail in relation to a change of parish, for instance, from one district to another district. But the hon. Gentleman is right when he says that, if that change is made, then, so far as is practicable, the Boundary Commission would try to make the Parliamentary boundaries accord with the county district boundaries and thus avoid having part of the county district in one constituency and part in another.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1958-03-27a.650.3" hansard_membership_id="9782" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29603" speakername="Sir Godfrey Nicholson" colnum="650" time="">
<p>I am not satisfied with that explanation. The Attorney-General says that it would be entirely wrong for a county council to attempt to alter district boundaries for reasons of political prejudice or partisanship. Would it not be right and proper that the Parliamentary boundaries, having been decided and laid down, should not in any case be altered except by the Boundary Commissioners?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1958-03-27a.651.0" hansard_membership_id="8886" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30786" speakername="The Attorney-General" colnum="651" time="">
<p>The Parliamentary boundaries will not be altered except upon a recommendation of the Boundary Commissioners. The point put to me was whether, in view of the rules, the recommendations of the Boundary Commission would follow so far as is practicable the local authority divisions. It depends on the circumstances, but the answer would be "Yes" for the reasons that I have given.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1958-03-27a.651.1" hansard_membership_id="12607" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20773" speakername="Mr. Snow" colnum="651" time="">
<p>We are indebted to the learned Attorney-General for putting on record, as I hoped he would, that it would be improper for a county council to alter deliberately the political complexion of a constituency. I take it from that observation that, in any representations that might be made by county councils to the Home Office, that sort of danger would be taken into consideration.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1958-03-27a.651.2" hansard_membership_id="8886" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30786" speakername="The Attorney-General" colnum="651" time="">
<p>Any representations from a county council would no doubt be considered on their merits. While it is open to any county council to advance any arguments that it likes for a change, it would have to be borne in mind that one could not properly condemn a county council for what we might call political partisanship without that charge being conclusively established.</p>

<p>May I ask a question? It may be completely irrelevant because of my lack of knowledge of the Act. I can envisage a position where there might be redistribution, and it might be thought that the only way to solve the problem would be to take a part of one county and a part of another county to make a Parliamentary constituency. That is still possible under the original Act and I believe that it is possible under this Measure. But would the Attorney-General tell me whether that is possible, for instance, with regard to parts of Staffordshire and parts of Derbyshire?</p>

<p>I could answer that question if I were in order, but it has no relation to the Amendment. If I may be permitted to be out of order, under the Act as it stands&#x2014;and it will remain when this Bill is passed&#x2014;the Commission can recommend a constituency which consists of part of one county and part of another.</p>

<p>As I understand the Attorney-General, we now have it on

record that it would be appropriate to object to a county council's allegedly partisan proposals for boundary readjustment and that such objections would have to be established; but that, nevertheless, they would be considered.

<p>When the Second Reading debate took place, Clause 3 was dealt with in rather summary fashion by the Home Secretary. He dealt with it in a few lines in col. 231 of the OFFICIAL REPORT of 11th February, 1958. It is true that my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr. Mitchison) dealt with the principle of electoral quota at greater length. Unfortunately, I was not given the opportunity to take part in the Second Reading debate, and, although my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kettering dealt with the point, I find myself at complete variance with him.<br/>
The argument that he then adduced was that on a consideration of the electoral quota it would be desirable to increase the number of hon. Members representing English constituencies. It is true that he said&#x2014;and I agree with him fully on this point:
<q>Therefore, I say that the discrepancy between Scotland and Wales, on the one hand, and England, on the other is too large."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 11th February, 1958; Vol. 412, c. 235.]</q>
That, of course, is true, and the figures that he gave bear out his point. The English electoral quota at the moment is 56,564, the Scottish quota is 48,011 and the Welsh quota is 50,363. In those circumstances, he is putting it mildly when he says that the discrepancy is obviously very large.<br/>
The whole idea of the electoral quota was to obtain an approximation towards numerical equality. If we want to apply so far as we can the principle of numerical equality, my submission is that the number of hon. Members in this House should be reduced and not increased.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1958-03-27a.653.0" hansard_membership_id="9373" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/18429" speakername="Mr. Mitchison" colnum="653" time="">
<p>On a point of order. I am sorry to rise in this way, Mr. Diamond, but we are now considering Clause 3, which relates to the electoral quota. As far as I can see, it does not relate to the number of constituencies, but the first new Clause does.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1958-03-27a.653.1" hansard_membership_id="7864" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/17279" speakername="Mr. Lipton" colnum="653" time="">
<p>Further to that point of order. Whereas the first new Clause refers to English constituencies, it does not refer to Scottish and Welsh constituencies. To that extent, what I may have to say on the subject of the Scottish and Welsh constituencies on the Question, "That the Clause stand part of the Bill," may be completely out of order on the new Clause. I do not wish my rights to be unnecessarily truncated if the submission of my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kettering is accepted.</p>

<p>Further to that point of order. I submit, Mr. Diamond, that as the Clause contains nothing which has any effect whatever on the number of seats in Great Britain, whether in England, Scotland or Wales, any debate upon the number of seats there should be would be out of order in relation to the Clause.</p>

<p>In that case, Mr. Diamond, I reserve such comments as I may be allowed to make until we reach the new Clause, when, apparently, according to the points made by the Attorney-General and by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kettering, these comments would be in order, subject, of course, to your ruling.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That the Clause be read a Second time.<br/>
This new Clause raises the question not only of the discrepancy between the number of electors per constituency in England, in Scotland and in Wales, but also of the number of Members that there could conveniently be in this House. The present position is that the rules provide for a fixed number of Members for Northern Ireland, a minimum for Scotland and a minimum for Wales. There is no question about Northern Ireland. Scotland has the minimum exactly. Wales has the minimum and one more; and it may be that the provision that we have just passed about Monmouth will add another seat. Nevertheless, substantially Wales is on the minimum.
6.45 p.m.<br/>
England is dealt with in this way. Great Britain as a whole has to have a total not substantially greater or less than 613. What happened on the last occasion when the Boundary Commission made its Report was as follows. Having ascertained the position as regards Scotland and Wales, the Commission was left with a number of 506 for England. It applied the electoral quota as it understood it, and the result would have been 519 seats for England. The Commission, however, took the view that that was substantially greater than the number in the Bill and accordingly, in the result, its recommendations were for 511 seats.<br/>
I am not for the moment quarrelling with that. I merely say that it was a rather unsatisfactory result because, on the limited equality which the Commission would have considered advisable, it was only the number of seats being substantially greater than the total derived from the provisions of the Bill that prevented it from giving effect to that. It had to allot England fewer seats than it thought right.<br/>
When we come to actual figures&#x2014;I produced them on Second Reading, and I shall not produce them at great length again&#x2014;there is a distinct discrepancy. There is a reason for some discrepancy, but on the existing position, taking the electorate as it was when the Report was issued, the figures were 56,564 in England, 50,363 in Wales, and 48,011 in Scotland. Those understate the discrepancy a little because of the Rule 6 constituencies, the ones with exceptional geographical considerations. We all recognise that they are apt to be distinctly smaller than the average in electorate. Consequently, if we left them out of the picture, the discrepancy would not be so large. Nevertheless, it exists, and it is quite definite. It is larger between England and Scotland than as between England and Wales.</p>

<p>I cannot give the answer. I could give a guess as to what I thought the exceptional considerations were, and over Scotland, if I took the seven crofting counties, I do not think I should be far wrong. It is much harder to calculate for Wales, because I am not sure to which of the counties Rule 6 would, in the opinion of the Commission, apply. No one, however, will deny that the discrepancy exists if we take the average, leaving out any reasonably assumed Rule 6 cases.</p>

<p>Not so great, but distinct and definite. The question is whether we ought not to ask for some more seats in England. No one wants to attack the number of seats in Scotland or Wales; I certainly do not. I appreciate that the existence of the crofter county seats in Scotland, for instance, makes it a little

more difficult to try to reduce the number of Scottish seats and therefore to increase the average of non-crofting Scottish seats. It lends colour to a somewhat smaller electorate in neighbouring parts of Scotland, even though those parts are not Rule 6 cases. Still the discrepancy is there. I do not know whether the right hon. and learned Gentleman or the Joint Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department can give us any more accurate figures than I have given, but I feel certain it will not be denied that the discrepancy exists and that it is distinct and recognisable. I suggest that there is no reason for it at present.<br/>
There is, moreover, another factor, namely, that the English population is growing much faster than the Scottish. I cannot give electoral figures, I do not think they are generally available, but the population figures show a much more rapid increase, and, indeed, it is what one would expect. There has been a general trend southwards for some time past, not merely of people who come to manage English affairs and then return to Scotland when they have finished, but of people who, for reasons of occupation or of choice, come south. I am not making any comment on it, and I cannot for the moment see any Scottish Members about, but even if they are not, I still make no comment. The position tends to be the same as regards Wales.<br/>
In those circumstances, we are dealing with a period that cannot be before November, 1964, and may go to November, 1969. Therefore, we ought to make an allowance not only for the increase that has occurred since the figures I have referred to, which are those used by the Commissioners in their November, 1954, Report, but also for the increase which is almost certain to continue until sometime between 1964 and 1969.<br/>
Though, of course, one can vary the figures, I suggest that what we have asked for in this proposed Clause is, from the English point of view, a moderate request. We have asked for 530. The figure at which the Boundary Commission jibbed, if I have it aright, was 519 and the increase would more than allow for that. Even so, when that has been done, owing to the way in which the Boundary Commissioners applied the quota arrangement, I doubt whether we would be up to the Scottish average.<br/>
It may be said that we ought not to add even nineteen extra Members to a House where many of us often feel that there is a considerable lack of accommodation already. This is not the moment to ask the Government to carry out recommendations of reports on that subject, but we used to have the Southern Irish in this House, and when they were here the number was 30 or 40 more than it is now. Though, of course, the building is not the same, the accommodation was meant to correspond, and I doubt whether an addition of this kind would seriously hinder the work we have to do here, or whether that is a good reason for accepting an English inferiority in numbers which seems to me in this case to go beyond a justifiable reason.<br/>
Therefore, the form of the proposed Clause is to substitute 530 as the figure for England, not substantially greater or less, instead of the Great Britain figure of 613. I do not think much turns on whether we do it that way, and I would not regard that as a matter of great importance, though it has always seemed to me simpler in the actual circumstances of the case to have a separate English figure. What is important is that we are asking for nineteen extra English Members on the substantial ground that the English representation is too unfair by comparison with the Scottish and Welsh figures.<br/>
Finally, I would not object to a certain advantage for Scotland and Wales, although I find it hard to give the reasons for that. I believe there are historical reasons one could give as regards Scotland and I have mentioned the point of the crofting counties. All I say at present is that this would still leave that advantage to Scottish and Welsh boroughs.</p>

<p>My hon. and learned Friend has put forward an unanswerable argument for this proposed Clause. It seems to me that where we commence the inquiry by providing, as I understand the existing procedure does, for a minimum number of seats for Scotland and also for Wales, and then put a ceiling on the total representation, there is obviously a risk that England may become seriously under-represented. That risk is all the more serious when the movement of population is increasingly in the direction of England.<br/>
Speaking early in the discussion on this Clause, may I say that what would appear to be a relevant piece of information for the Committee to consider in this connection is the number of Rule 6 cases in England. For all I know there may be none, but it is a relevant factor how many of those cases, if any, there are in England, how many there are in Wales, and how the proportion of those cases between England and Wales compares with the proportion of population.<br/>
Representing an English constituency, I am greatly impressed by this discrepancy between 56,564 for England and 50,363 for Wales. It seems a very large discrepancy. As my hon. and learned Friend indicated, the figure of 48,011 for Scotland may not have the same relevance on this matter because of the influence exerted by the crofting constituencies, but surely that factor is far less important in Wales. I think that in considering this matter it is the discrepancy between the English figure and the Welsh figure that calls for the most searching examination.<br/>
This is not a matter on which I believe there could be a very strong difference of opinion in the Committee, because the objective which we all have is quite clear. We desire the fairest distribution of representation, bearing in mind that there will always be anomalies created by Rule 6 cases. On the other hand, we want to know more than I know at the moment about the operation of Rule 6 and we need a further explanation of the very striking discrepancies between the figure for England and the figure for Wales.</p>

<p>I suggest to my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Edge Hill (Mr. A. J. Irvine) that the discrepancy between the position in England and the position in Wales is probably not more marked than that between England and Scotland because of the application of Rule 6. My hon. Friend referred to the seven Scottish crofting constituencies. There are possibly three or four constituencies in Wales in that category, and having regard to the fact that the population and electorate of Wales are almost exactly half those of Scotland, the qualifying incidence of the crofting counties is similar in both countries.<br/>
May I turn to a more general point about the comparison between the quotas in the three countries? Some hon. Members seem to think that the differences in the three quotas are excessive, but, personally, I do not think they are. I recall that between the Act of 1885 and 1918 the country tolerated electorates which varied from a few hundreds in some of the small historic boroughs to 30,000 in Walthamstow. That situation was not put right in 1918.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Parker) has repeatedly drawn the attention of the House to similar but not identical numerical anomalies between the wars and since. I do not think that we can avoid these anomalies, nor can we pare down the so-called quota discrepancies between the three countries much more than we have already done. The figure for England is rather over 56,000, that for Wales is rather over 50,000, and that for Scotland is about 48,000. I think that the relative identity of representation is rather good.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Edge Hill, who is sitting next to me, suggests that the ratio was metaphysical.</p>

<p>I do not think the Scottish quota was unduly metaphysical.<br/>
I do not think we need worry unduly about the quotas. We have achieved a reasonable parity between the three countries in the figures which I have given, having regard to the very wide disparity in local conditions in the outlying parts of the community.<br/>
I hope that in considering the Amendment we shall not over-argue in favour of mathematical identity of quotas. This does not mean that I, as a Welsh representative, am in any way opposed to increasing the number of English representatives. I think that it can be done without injury to either the Scottish or the Welsh representation. It should proceed, however, less on the mathematical basis and more on the practical basis as related to the local difficulties in England, Scotland and Wales.</p>

<p>I was not here on Second Reading, and I hope that it is in order now to refer to what would have

been in order then. I think that it is in order to do so on the Amendment.<br/>
The difficulty about the Amendment, with whichever prejudice we approach the subject&#x2014;either prejudice from this side of the Committee or prejudice from the other side of the Committee&#x2014;is quite clear. Most of us who are here now have taken a considerable interest in this matter on one or more previous occasions, and on each of those occasions, and certainly upon the last, it was quite plainly admitted that the situation as it then stood, or rather the distribution as it was then proposed, was in some respects intolerable and the proposal was then driven through.<br/>
It therefore becomes impossible to amend this Bill, which leaves those intolerabilities, so as to make it seem fair to both sides of the Committee. I think some gleam of hope was given by the hon. Member for Caernarvon (Mr. G. Roberts). The difficulty with which the hon. and learned Member for Kettering (Mr. Mitchison) was trying to deal was the difficulty of not increasing excessively the number of Members in the House and yet not being excessively unjust to England, a very odd, if not unique, ambition, the second part of it, if I may say so, but one with which I sympathise.<br/>
I believe that the hon. Member for Caernarvon showed how it could be done. He mentioned that it made no difference at all whether the average quota was 50,000 or 56,000. Very well; let us have the average quota for Scotland and Wales 56,000 and the average quota for England something not much more than 50,000, thus saving on Scotland and Wales enough seats to enable us to do justice to England.</p>

<p>I will dispense with the preamble, which is already on record, and deal with what I think is the fundamental point, which has been made by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr. Mitchison). He has slightly departed from what he said on Second Reading, because on that occasion he said
<q>The discrepancy is, obviously, very large".&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 11th February, 1958; Vol. 581, c. 234.]</q>
I do not think he stands by that now, because tonight he said that the discrepancy is undesirable or greater than it should be.<br/>
As the hon. Member for Carlton (Mr. Pickthorn) said, it all depends what we take as our starting point. My learned Friend said that the representation for Scotland and Wales was more or less correct, and that the representation of England ought therefore to be increased. It is just as logical to take the view that Scotland and Wales are over-represented and that the number of hon. Members representing English constituencies does not need to be increased.<br/>
If, for example, at some time or other the Boundary Commission or such authority as may exist decided that the total number of Members should be 500, that would give an electoral quota of about 69,000 over the whole of Great Britain, and it would mean that there would be ninety-nine fewer English Members of Parliament, twenty-two fewer Scottish Members, and nine fewer Welsh Members. The Northern Ireland representation is already related to that quota, and would not change. Nobody can tell me that the work of the House could not be done just as effectively by 500 Members attending to their duties as it is at present by 630, of which 130 do not attend to their duties.<br/>
If we examine the situation in other Parliamentary assemblies, we find that whereas in France the average number of electors per representative is 49,000&#x2014;which is too few from our point of view&#x2014;in the United States of America the figure is 236,000 and in the German Federal Republic, 70,000. The German Federal Republic carries on its business with reasonable efficiency.<br/>
I know that the right hon and learned Gentleman is getting a little impatient and wants to take part in the discussion in order to give us the benefit of his views, but I must ask him to exercise his patience for a further few minutes.</p>

<p>I apologise unreservedly. I mistook the interest he was taking in what I was saying for an impatience at what I was saying. In those circumstances, I unreservedly withdraw my

remark and hope that what I am saying is having some effect.<br/>
I suggest that we ought not immediately to come to the conclusion that the only solution of the problem is to increase the number of parliamentary representatives in this House. In the German Federal Republic, members find no difficulty in representing 70,000 electors each, and the hon. Member for Hornchurch (Mr. Lagden) carries out his duties as well as any other Member while representing about 80,000 electors. I have not noticed that by reason of the fact that he represents such a large electorate he is any less efficient or active than other hon. Members in the discharge of his duties.<br/>
I should like my hon. and learned Friend to think about what he is saying. I do not believe that it is necessary to increase the number of hon. Members in order to ensure the efficient carrying out of our Parliamentary duties. If we have to make any change it should be by way of reduction. I know that in the case of Scotland and Wales all kinds of geographical and historical considerations enter into the matter, but it is rather ridiculous to say that because there are some crofting counties in the north of Scotland the number of Members of Parliament representing English constituencies should be increased.</p>

<p>It might be to the convenience of the Committee if I said something about the Amendment now, and so help hon. Members to reach a conclusion. The hon. and learned Member based his argument upon the existence of a discrepancy between the electoral quotas of England, Wales and Scotland. Whether the hon. and learned Member's views are well founded, or whether the view of the hon. Member for Brixton (Mr. Lipton)&#x2014;who has said that we should not immediately come to the conclusion that there is only one solution of the problem&#x2014;is well founded, I submit that although, technically, the proposed new Clause is within the scope of the Bill, it is not within the scope of its intentions.<br/>
In 1944 there was the Speaker's Conference, which was attended by representatives of all parties. That Conference favoured the acceptance of certain rules,


among which was Rule 6, referring to the total number of Members of Parliament, which said:
<q>The total number of Members of the House of Commons for Great Britain shall remain substantially as at present, (i.e) 591, excluding University seats.</q>
That figure was then incorporated in the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act, 1944. It is important to bear in mind that the Conference seems to have reached the conclusion that for the proper conduct of the business of the House of Commons the target figure should be 591, not taking into account the university seats which then existed.</p>

<p>Including Northern Ireland. It also recommended that there should be the following special provision for Scotland and Wales&#x2014;which is Rule 7:
<q>There shall be no reduction in the present number of Members of the House of Commons for Scotland or for Wales and Monmouthshire.</q>
That is where we get the present statutory stipulation of not fewer than 71, 35 and 12 Members respectively. That recommendation was clearly accepted by the Socialist Party when it formed a Government, because it was embodied in Rule 1 of the 1944 Act, which was passed during the time of the Coalition Government, and remained until it was altered by the 1948 Act. The Committee will remember that at that time, contrary to the Boundary Commission's recommendation, 17 seats were added, bringing the figure up to its present level.<br/>
The new proposal is that there should be a further 19 seats, and if I understand it right the object is to narrow the discrepancy between the electorates of England and the electorates of Scotland and Wales respectively, so as to try to make the weight of an Englishman's vote correspond more nearly to the effect of a vote of a Scotsman in Scotland, a Welshman in Wales and a Northern Irishman in Northern Ireland. That discrepancy between the electorates originated in the recommendations of the Speaker's Conference, if not before.<br/>
Whatever may be the view of what ought to be done, and what is the right size of the House, it follows that if we accept the view that it should not be less

than 71 Scottish seats, 35 Welsh seats and 12 seats for Northern Ireland, and also the conclusion that the House should remain at more or less its present membership, we must accept a discrepancy between the electorates in the different parts of the United Kingdom.<br/>
This is not the place for making any further alteration in that respect. An attempt to correct the balance between the different parts of the United Kingdom should not be made by means of the addition of a Clause of this character, providing a particular solution, in a Bill of this character. I suggest that that certainly should not be done without careful consideration of the whole problem again by another Speaker's Conference.</p>

<p>I appreciate what the right hon. and learned Gentleman is saying, but I wonder whether he could tell us one thing. The trouble seems to me to be that the discrepancy that existed then was smaller than the discrepancy that exists now. Can he give us any figures on that point?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1958-03-27a.664.1" hansard_membership_id="8886" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30786" speakername="The Attorney-General" colnum="664" time="">
<p>I do not think I can; I do not think I have them in my possession. Nor can I answer the question put to me by the hon. Member for Edge Hill (Mr. A. J. Irvine) as to how many constituencies Rule 6 would apply, for the simple reason, as has been said before today, that the Boundary Commission does not give reasons in its Report for its conclusions. One can only speculate, and I do not think that speculation would be very helpful.<br/>
The point I am seeking to make is that the correction of the discrepancy between the different parts of the United Kingdom is a subject not for these Bills, but for consideration at another Speaker's Conference, when the time comes for such a conference. It may be&#x2014;one does not know, and cannot predict&#x2014;that there will be further shifts of population in one direction or another, but I am quite sure that we ought not to alter the balance between the respective parts of the United Kingdom without giving very careful consideration to the whole problem. One ought not lightly to depart from the accepted recommendations of a Speaker's Conference which have stood for so long.<br/>
May I add a further word? Various suggestions have been made. It was said, for instance, on Second Reading by the


right hon. Member for South Shields (Mr. Ede) that we might have the same quota for England as now exists for Scotland. I quote the right hon. Gentleman's words:
<q>If we took the same quota for England as exists at the moment for Scotland, we should redress the balance and be able to feel that we were still preserving the Act of Union."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 11th February, 1958; Vol. 582, c. 262.]</q>
Of course, we would in one respect, but the consequences of this would be that England alone would have 607 seats in a House with a total membership of 726. We ought not to provide for that eventuality, I submit, by adding a Clause of this character to a Bill of this character, and it is for these reasons that I advise the Committee not to add the Clause to the Bill.<br/>
I have intervened now because I felt that perhaps these considerations might enable the Committee to reach a fairly speedy conclusion on this matter. It has been an interesting discussion. It is quite obvious that it is not being conducted entirely on party lines, but that some difference of attitude seems to depend upon from which part of the United Kingdom one may come.</p>

<p>I do not wish to prolong the discussion unduly, but I think there are one or two things that need to be said, and I hope that the right hon. and learned Attorney-General will give some further consideration to them.<br/>
I believe that if there were an offer of or suggestion for a Speaker's Conference, that would indeed be the best way of dealing with this point. Nevertheless, I do not think that the new Clause is out of keeping with the Bill. The Clause does not raise a matter of fundamental constitutional importance; it is merely an attempt to get some greater equality between the representation from different parts of the United Kingdom. This is merely an alteration of a comparatively minor character.<br/>
Before I develop the other points, I wish to say to my hon. Friend the Member for Brixton (Mr. Lipton) that I do not support his argument. I wondered why, when there is some unemployment already in the country as the result of the Government's policy, my hon. Friend should suggest that we should increase it still further by putting Members of Parliament out of work. Then, again, if my hon. Friend thinks that the number

of Members here could be reduced, I do not know what he would have thought about the composition of the House of Commons a hundred years ago, when there were 700 Members, but when the electorate of each constituency was a few hundred and the population of the country was much smaller.<br/>
I should have thought also, in reply to another point made by my hon. Friend, that a comparison between the responsibilities of British Members of Parliament and, with all respect to them, the responsibilities of Deputies in the West German Republic, was irrelevant. In addition to our responsibilities for the United Kingdom in this House, we also have responsibilities for the 60 million people in the Colonial Commonwealth who look to us. I think that, for all these reasons, there is no serious case for cutting down representation here.<br/>
I think it was the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation who said something the other day with which I agree. It was that when one looks at certain problems, one sometimes wishes that we had a Secretary of State for England to look after our interests. Certainly, I think in the matter of the great difference in the size of electorates between the English constituencies and the Welsh and Scottish constituencies, that sort of consideration arises. Why should an English Member have to represent so many more electors? One of the reasons why English Members have to represent a larger electorate is undoubtedly the use last time of the electoral quota which has now been authorised under this Bill for future redistributions. It is, incidentally, a tribute to those of us who believe that the Commission was, in fact, working upon an unauthorised quota that powers have been taken in this Bill to legalise the special quotas for different parts of the United Kingdom.<br/>
If one takes the number of constituencies which must be reserved to other parts of the United Kingdom, which on the last occasion totalled 107 for England and Wales and 12 for Northern Ireland, we are bound to get, unless there is some increase in English representation, a very much higher electorate for English constituencies. I do not know whether my hon. Friend the Member for Edge Hill (Mr. A. J. Irvine) realised that the comparison was very much worse than


even he suggested. He quoted the British quota of 55,670 which, in fact, was not the quota used. Indeed, I do not know whether the figures of the electorates now are different, because we have not been given any figures so far in the debate, but in 1953 the English quota worked out at 57,000, and the difference in the representation is that the average for Scotland in 1953 worked out at 50,353, a difference of about 7,000. In the case of the Welsh seats in 1953, the average was 48,000 electors, as compared with an electorate of 57,000 for the English constituencies. I think it will be rather difficult to justify that magnitude of difference of 9,000 between constituencies in the two countries, and I would still hope that further consideration might be given to this point.<br/>
I think there are two further arguments in support of the Clause. In the first case, from 1801 to 1918, this House was composed of about 700 Members. It did fluctuate from time to time, and at one period it was slightly less and at another slightly higher. The proposal in the Clause would not mean any more seats than the House has had for nearly 100 years.<br/>
Secondly, it appears from the movement of the electorates and populations that the English electorates are going to increase. If so, this is the time to make some concession to prevent the considerable difference in the electorates&#x2014;which in the case of the Welsh and English constituencies is nearly 10,000&#x2014;from becoming even bigger. I hope that the right hon. and learned Gentleman will give some undertaking about this. If he cannot accept the Motion, he may indicate that some further consultation can take place.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Carlton (Mr. Pickthorn) and myself are the only two hon. Members present in the Chamber who were at the Speaker's Conference, and I should like to raise various points regarding that conference with the Attorney-General. When we discussed this subject in 1944 there was a basic assumption that the population would remain roughly the same, and that the proportion of the population as between England, Scotland and Wales would remain roughly the same. But that

has not been the case. There has been an increase in the population of the United Kingdom as a whole, and particularly in the population of England. That rise is going on steadily, so that the solution arrived at in 1944 is not relevant today and will become less relevant as time goes on.<br/>
I agree that in 1944 we decided it was right and reasonable that Wales and Scotland should be given a larger representation than the numbers justified. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Caernarvon (Mr. G. Roberts) that there should be a continuing bias in favour of Wales and Scotland. The question is, how large should it be. I suggest that we should stick to the 1944 position and not differentiate further. That would be a reasonable solution. Let us keep the Welsh and Scottish figures as they were, but if we find, as is the case, that the population of England is increasing, there is a strong argument for increasing the representation and bringing it up to the same proportion as that decided in 1944.<br/>
I do not see why we cannot have a few extra Members in this House to represent English constituencies, if that would appear the right way to solve the difficulty. As has been said, there were times over a long period of history when the number of hon. Members was larger than it is today, and I do not think that a small increase, say to 650, or even another 10 or 20 more than that, would matter very much. We could have that number of Members without upsetting the arrangements of this House. I suggest that we go back to the 1944 position and add a number of extra English Members to keep the same sort of ratio from a population point of view.<br/>
If the population of England continues to increase, it might be necessary to examine the matter again; but I should think that in the long run the population of the United Kingdom will stabilise itself and there will not be need for a further drastic increase of Members. If in, say, a hundred years the number were unmanageable the matter might be examined again, but that problem is not likely to arise for a long time. I ask the Attorney-General to go back to the 1944 position and be prepared himself to bring forward some Amendment to enable the English representation to be


increased to bring it to the 1944 proportion. I do not think there is need for a Speaker's Conference on that point. We are merely suggesting that we stick to the 1944 position. I do not think there is any strong feeling in the Committee that we should move away from that position.</p>

<p>Originally I had no intention of inviting the Committee to come to a decision on this matter, but I am finding it increasingly difficult to resist the temptation put before me by the right hon. and learned Gentleman the Attorney-General. This new Clause has been on the Order Paper for some time. This subject&#x2014;including the disparity and the question of the growth of the population&#x2014;was mentioned more than once during the Second Reading debate. I can understand the Government saying that they do not think this is the right time to deal with it, but I do not understand the Government refusing to equip themselves with the necessary information which hon. Members obviously are entitled to have in order to form an opinion on the subject. The right hon. and learned Gentleman says, "I should like another Speaker's Conference, if I am to deal with this at all, and for that reason I have not equipped myself with the information."</p>

<p>I am sure that the hon. and learned Gentleman does not desire to misrepresent what I said. I did not say anything of the sort he is suggesting. I said that last time there was a Speaker's Conference on the matter, and that we should not make a change of this character in this Bill without the matter first being considered by another Speaker's Conference. It was not on the ground that I had not equipped myself with the necessary information, and the hon. Gentleman has no reason for making that allegation.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1958-03-27a.669.2" hansard_membership_id="9373" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/18429" speakername="Mr. Mitchison" colnum="669" time="">
<p>I assure the right hon. and learned Gentleman that if I said, or if he understood me to say, that he said he had not equipped himself with sufficient information for the purpose, I withdraw it unreservedly. I had no intention of saying it. I said that the right hon. and learned Gentleman asked for another Speaker's Conference and he also admitted, in the state of affairs which I have mentioned&#x2014;the new Clause having been on the Order Paper for some days

and the whole matter having been discussed during the Second Reading debate&#x2014;that he had not the obviously relevant information about it. I regard that as unfair to the Commission since that information must have been readily available at the Home Office and could well have been produced.<br/>
The point is, as has been said by my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Parker), that the Speaker's Conference came to the conclusion, on the state of affairs existing at that time, as I admitted when moving the Motion, that there is a case, apart from the Rule 6 question, of there being some disparity in favour of Scotland and Wales. We admit that, but the point is that the disparity has grown and is still growing. I gave the figures so far as I could get them as at the date of the Report of the Boundary Commission. I added during the Second Reading debate, and I repeat again now, that since then the English population&#x2014;I have not got the electoral figures&#x2014;has been increasing twice as fast as the Scottish population. Clearly, the electoral position must reflect the same sort of change.<br/>
For those reasons there is no inconsistency whatever in saying now that on the principles agreed by the Speaker's Conference, and even on the proportion agreed, some figure or other ought to be allowed by way of an increased number of seats for England. There is no inconsistency about that. On the contrary, the inconsistency lies in the mouth of the Attorney-General who not only wants to go back on the conclusions of the Speaker's Conference, but also takes no account of the fact that since then the House has added an additional number of Members.<br/>
Clearly, the only conclusion I can draw from the Speaker's Conference is that it recognised the wisdom of some discrepancy and, further, that it gave attention to the matter and laid down minimum figures for Scotland and Wales which, unlike one of my hon. Friends, I would not wish to alter.<br/>
The right way to deal with the matter is to give some, not very large, English increases. The Government have always known that if they refused the necessary information it would be extraordinarily difficult to say what the right figure was. I should not be justified in asking the


Committee to come to a decision on the Clause, when the figure of the additional votes must so largely be guesswork. I am trying to resist the temptation to ask for a decision because of the right hon. and learned Gentleman's reply. I think I have succeeded. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Motion.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That the Clause be read a Second time.<br/>
This Clause contains a new device designed to bring flexibility into distribution arrangements where the Commission either does not take any action about a change which occurred during the period between reviews or at a general review. I am all in favour of the Boundary Commission not being active. I have always been against having a permanent Boundary Commission because it will tend towards justifying its existence and unnecessarily interfering with boundaries. There is, however, a case where responsible opinion inside a constituency feels that there is an anomaly to be investigated and it would like to suggest a change to deal with it.<br/>
The purpose of the Clause is to make it possible for a local authority, as defined in Section 144 of the Local Government Act, 1948, or by Section 145 in relation to Scotland, to pass a resolution, which could then be forwarded to the Secretary of State. We suggest in the Clause that such a resolution should be called a "constituency resolution" and that it should recommend a change in the boundaries of the constituency when any part of it is in the area of the local authority.<br/>
It is suggested that such a resolution should be sent to the Secretary of State, who would then send it to the appropriate Boundary Commission. When the Commission receives the constituency resolution it shall consider it and make a report on its proposals to the Secretary of State, saying that it feels there is a case for a change, or that it does not recommend the change, or that it proposes other changes to deal with that and other constituencies.
7.45 p.m.<br/>
It has been suggested that this might start a chain reaction of changes very dangerous to other constituencies. There is something in that point, but equally the procedure could act as a safeguard against irresponsible resolutions being passed, because the local authority would know that it was not a matter of the


Commission accepting the resolution but of considering the whole circumstances of the anomaly in the area in question and of making to the Home Secretary recommendations which were not necessarily in the resolution. The local authority would be careful and would be likely to act only in cases where it could make a fair and sensible suggestion. The Secretary of State would lay before Parliament any constituency resolution, together with any report of a Boundary Commission.<br/>
There are at least two comparable powers given to groups of individuals or local authorities and where they can ask for an inquiry. There is a provision in the London Government Act that a Metropolitan Borough or a group of responsible people or electors can suggest that there is a <i>prima facie</i> case for an inquiry for an alteration to ward boundaries. They can send to the Secretary of State proposals, and if he feels that a case has been made out he can order an inquiry, at which the group of electors or the borough council or both can put forward proposals and be examined about them.<br/>
This procedure has not been used extensively, but it has been useful on some occasions. A re-warding of the Borough of Camberwell was carried out in 1952 as a result of a petition to the Home Secretary from a group of electors suggesting the need for changes in the wards which had existed in their then state for more than fifty years. There had been a considerable movement of population in the intervening period. In due course, a special commissioner was appointed to hold the inquiry and made a report. The result was incorporated in an order by the Secretary of State, and new and better boundaries were created.<br/>
There is also provision in respect of parish councils whereby a group of electors can ask for an inquiry in relation to boundaries. Although I said that this was a new device it has, in fact, been used in the case of local government boundaries. It is within the experience of hon. Members that anomalies occur from time to time in constituencies. It would seem to be fair for a local authority to have the right to bring anomalies to the attention of the Secretary of State direct. I can quite imagine that the hon. Member for Hornchurch (Mr. Lagden) would like to present a petition

about his own constituency. It does not follow by any means that if a local authority passes a constituency resolution that there would be any change. It would simply mean that attention has been drawn to the difficulties in that constituency. The addition of this Clause would give a responsible local authority the opportunity to present to the Secretary of State in a direct and proper manner problems affecting the Parliamentary constituency with which it was concerned.<br/>
I do not believe that local authorities would use this power irresponsibly. There is the sanction that the Boundary Commission need not consider such a proposal and would suggest other proposals. The very fact that some avenue of appeal was open to responsible local opinion would introduce some flexibility into our system of redistribution. Generally speaking, if one can get an agreed change&#x2014;because the resolution would have to be passed by a majority of the electors in the constituency, probably following some sort of local activity&#x2014;put to the Secretary of State, it is very much better than having imposed on a locality a decision of other people, however eminent and fair they may be. A change that emanates from those in the area is much more desirable and often more satisfactory than one that is imposed from without. I hope, therefore, that the Committee and the Government will give serious consideration to this proposal.</p>

<p>I rise only to ask the Government to try to be a little more helpful about this than they have been about previous propositions put to them. They have combined immobility and infallibility to a degree that is rare even for a Government towards the end of their existence. There is a real point of substance here, and I hope that the Government will assist the Committee by making some positive proposals for meeting it.<br/>
Let me explain the point. It is that we are legislating for a period of from ten to fifteen years from the time of the last Report; that is to say, 1964 to 1969. Presumably, we shall go on in that sort of way. I am not in the least objecting to that; on the contrary, I welcome it. The disturbance that these changes make, not only to those of us who are engaged in parliamentary work but to ordinary


people all over the country, is quite considerable. I am sure that after the last Boundary Commission Report, and its results, we all felt that we did not want that to happen too often.<br/>
There is another side to it, however. Some of us, like the Fat Boy&#x2014;I think it was he&#x2014;are "swelling wisibly," and go on swelling, and swelling until things reach a difficult stage where we are asked to represent an inordinate number of electors&#x2014;to take one obvious point. Equally, there can be difficulties the other way. Nowadays, there can be changes in the disposition of population owing to the movement of industry, and so on, that make representational changes worth consideration. I say no more than that.<br/>
This point was put to the right hon. Gentleman the Home Secretary during the Second Reading debate. His reply was that it could be done under Section 2 (3) of the principal Act, and there is no doubt that in that subsection there is power for the Boundary Commission to make an interim report. In fact, that power has been exercised, but exercised only for quite minor boundary changes.<br/>
The difficulty now is that we are appointing a Boundary Commission, with a judicial deputy chairman, to act over quite a long period, and nobody knows how to get the Commission to take action where it may be required. That question was asked of the right hon. Gentleman, and we never had an answer. I do not say that it is an easy question to answer. It is difficult.<br/>
What is proposed in this new Clause is that local authorities should do it, and I see at once that there are objections to that. It is only too easy to think of objections. For instance, in my own constituency I have seven local authorities. Some of them are a bit on the small side, and we do not know what may happen to them in these days. Nevertheless, by this new Clause, any of them would have the power to start the ball rolling.<br/>
One could think of doing it by basing the power to propose on a given number of electors. That, too, presents difficulties. It makes it rather easier to organise what might be a factious objection or petition. It could be done, perhaps, automatically&#x2014;that, too, we shall have to consider in due course. I hope that

the Government will be able to provide some suggestion as to what should be done if things approach the intolerable&#x2014;let us put it that way&#x2014;during the ten to fifteen years between these Reports.<br/>
This new Clause is very carefully worded. It does not oblige the Commission to make a report under the Act and, of course, if it makes a report under the Act, it can make a nil report, and say that nothing needs to be done. All that happens is that&#x2014;</p>

<p>I am anxious to understand the new Clause. I take it that the hon. and learned Gentleman's words must be taken very literally when he says that the Commission can say that "nothing needs to be done." Does it not mean that the Commission must, in fact, show cause why it does not intend to hold an interim review on the lines indicated in the application?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1958-03-27a.676.1" hansard_membership_id="9373" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/18429" speakername="Mr. Mitchison" colnum="676" time="">
<p>I am sorry that I did not, in the nature of the case, take a note of my exact words, but if the hon. and learned Gentleman looks at the new Clause he will see that it provides for the constituency resolution to go to the Home Secretary, and for the Home Secretary to send it to the Boundary Commission. What the Commission then has to decide is whether or not to make a report under the Act. It has to report to the Home Secretary whether it is to make a statutory report. I hope that I have made myself clear, because it is rather difficult to avoid using the same word twice, and it is used twice in the new Clause.<br/>
The Boundary Commission, therefore, is not obliged to make a statutory report which itself might be a nil report. It is merely obliged to consider whether or not it should look into the matter and report. It is about the minimum obligation that one could put on anybody. It is really no more than pulling the coat of the Commission, as it were, and reminding it that there is a certain place which it might perhaps look at.<br/>
I agree that it is quite easy to pick holes in this sort of proposal. One can say that a local authority might be captious and it might do this too easily. In my own constituency, as I say, there are several local authorities. One very small local authority might do it, yet might not represent a lot of public opinion or anything else.


8.0 p.m.<br/>
All that is true, but on the other hand, if we do not do it at all, look at the position. The Boundary Commission is there for a period of ten to fifteen years. The deputy-chairman, with great respect to Mr. Speaker&#x2014;it is well recognised that he cannot do much of this sort of thing&#x2014;is a High Court judge He is in office notionally. He is the deputy-chairman, but it is too much to suppose that he is going into these electoral questions continually or even at frequent intervals; there is nobody to stir him up, and there is no duty on the other members of the Boundary Commission to look into the matter.<br/>
While I feel that a provision of this sort might not be used often, while I feel that it is extraordinarily easy to pick holes in any sort of provision that is suggested, I still feel that it is rather dangerous and foolish to leave matters entirely to chance&#x2014;because that is what it seems to me to come to&#x2014;for so long a period as ten to fifteen years. The net result of that, without moving the Boundary Commission in the interval, may be that the pack of troubles one has to pick up at the end of the ten to fifteen years would be very much larger than they would be if they had been dealt with at the time.<br/>
May I add one other point. I understand, as I am sure my hon. Friends do&#x2014;and I expect every hon. Member understands&#x2014;that this is hardly ever a case of a single constituency. Other constituencies may very well be affected, too, and for that reason I am very anxious not to do more than just tug the coat of the Commissioners and remind them that there is something that might be looked into. Within those limitations, I suggest that this new Clause provides a workable means of giving the tug, that it does not do and does not pretend to do more than that. If the Government do not like it, let them tell us some other way of reminding the Boundary Commission of the real things that need attention.</p>

<p>I support this proposed new Clause to which I added my name. I did so because it seems to me to raise an important matter of principle. The matter of principle to which I attach importance is that the local authorities should have the right to make representations to the

Boundary Commission. I do not put it any higher or any lower than that.<br/>
I would ask the Joint Under-Secretary of State to bear in mind that there is a principle of historic importance involved in this new Clause. Parliament has existed for 600 or 700 years, and historically, I am sure the Minister will agree, representation in this House is based on local boundaries. When a Royal Commission is read in the House of Peers we hear the traditional and age-old recital, whereby the Royal Assent is given to Bills and reference is made to burgesses, knights of the shires, citizens and so on. It reminds us always that representation in this place is based on local boundaries. Local authorities are, therefore, interested in the basis on which representation is made, whether it is representation in the shires or in the boroughs.<br/>
It seems to me that apart from all other considerations&#x2014;and I endorse everything that has been said by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr. Mitchison) and my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington (Mr. Skeffington)&#x2014;on the principle that we have moved into a sphere in which the regulation of boundaries is to be decided by a Boundary Commission, the definition and alteration of boundaries and the constitution of constituency areas should be regarded as a matter in which local authorities&#x2014;the lineal descendants of the ancient shires and boroughs&#x2014;are entitled to take an interest and, therefore, are entitled to make representations to the Boundary Commission. What the Boundary Commission may do about it when such representation is received is a different matter. That depends upon the instructions which Parliament gives to the Boundary Commission.<br/>
I hope the Minister will accept this new Clause in order to enshrine in our constitutional arrangements what seems to me to be a fundamental principle of historical importance, that local authorities should be entitled to make representations. It was always a matter of interest to them, even when they were rotten boroughs, like Old Sarum, also when county authorities like Cornwall or Devon were intensely populated compared with the modern industrial areas, at times when


historically they were entitled to far greater recommendation than the more populous counties or shires. It was a matter of concern to them whether they lost their historic representation.<br/>
I do not dissent from the proposition, which is now accepted on both sides of the Committee as being almost axiomatic, that representation should be based on numbers&#x2014;numerical representation. I am sure, however, that my right hon. Friend the Member for South Shields (Mr. Ede), with his great sense of history, will agree with me that local considerations of historical significance also have a part to play, and I support this new Clause because I hope that in passing this Bill we shall not drift into a position in which we become so benumbed with mere arithmetic propositions that we ignore and depart entirely from the historical associations from which this Parliament is descended. Therefore, it is not unreasonable to write into this Bill that local authorities should be entitled to make representations to the Boundary Commission with regard either to the size of the area or to how the boundaries should be drawn.<br/>
The whole subject of local government is in the melting pot, and particularly so in view of the present Bill on the subject which is now being considered in detail by a Standing Committee. But whatever may be the pattern of local government organisation in the future, whatever may be appropriate for the administration of local government as such, that should not detract from the inherent and traditional right of any local authority, whether a county council or a borough council, a rural council or even a parish council, to make representations to this Boundary Commission, with suggestions derived from their own local knowledge and experience of how the boundaries should be drawn.<br/>
On that broad basic principle, I support this proposed new Clause and I hope it will be accepted.</p>

<p>I am sure that we would all agree with the hon. Member for Islington, East (Mr. E. Fletcher) when he says that local authorities should have the right to make representations to the Boundary Commission, especially with regard to the need for the holding of an interim review.<br/>
As the background to this discussion there are, I think, three other things on which we can all agree, first, that it is a good thing that general reviews will be rather less frequent than under the old Act; secondly, that it is important that interim reviews should be held where necessary; and thirdly, that we do not want interim reviews to be too frequent or too extensive, for the reasons which the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (Mr. Skeffington) put forward on 15th December, 1954, when, after complaining that a considerable number of interim reviews had taken place in Kent, he used these rather powerful words:
<q>It is quite unjustifiable to suggest that this sort of change is either necessary or achieves any useful democratic purpose. In the meantime, the individuals affected do not know who their Member of Parliament is, because there have been so many changes. We really must put a stop to that kind of nonsense."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 15th December, 1954; Vol. 535, c. 1828.]</q>
I therefore assume, in favour of the hon. Gentleman, that the last thing he would wish as a result of this Clause is that there should be unnecessary interim reviews.<br/>
As he has pointed out, and as I shall emphasise in one particular, local authorities, like any other individual, already have power to make representations to the Boundary Commission, and the Boundary Commission, under Section 2 (3) of the 1949 Act, has power to
<q>from time to time submit to the Secretary of State reports with respect to the area comprised in any particular constituency or constituencies in the part of the United Kingdom with which they are concerned, showing the constituencies into which they recommend that that area should be divided in order to give effect to the rules set out in the said Second Schedule.</q>
That is the power of interim review.<br/>
That being the present position what we have to consider is, what does the Clause really add to it? It does not add to the power to make representations to the Boundary Commission. It does not add any power to the Boundary Commission to make representation to the Secretary of State. All that it does, so far as I can see, is that when a local authority passes a resolution and makes a recommendation to the Boundary Commission the Clause will require the Boundary Commission to show cause why it will not hold the review if it decides not to do so; and then, of course, the


matter is forwarded by the Commission to the Secretary of State, who can be required to lay before Parliament a report from the Boundary Commission as to why it decides not to hold a review.<br/>
That is the main effect. I shall be very glad to be corrected if I am wrong, as, perhaps, I may be, because this is a long new Clause which requires a lot of study. If I may say so, it has been most thoughtfully worked out, to try to cover the situation which hon. Members opposite have in mind. However, if that is all that this Clause adds to the present position, what we have to consider is whether it is really necessary to go through a rather elaborate procedure like that? I hope I shall not be considered to be provocative&#x2014;although the hon. and learned Member for Kettering (Mr. Mitchison) was inviting me to be as provocative as possible&#x2014;if I say that I think that it would be rather over zealous to impose that procedure upon the opportunities which already exist.
8.15 p.m.<br/>
The hon. and learned Member for Kettering said very fairly indeed that if there were a case for revision of a single constituency the matter would hardly ever end there. Of course, I would agree with him, and the Clause recognises that. We might very well find that, owing to all the encouragement given by this new Clause to local authorities to pass such resolutions, and the feeling on the part of the Boundary Commission that it had to lean over backwards to do all it can do to consider the views of local authorities and, perhaps, to avoid having to make reports showing cause why it would not recommend alterations, we should be led into just that difficulty which in 1954 the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington deplored&#x2014;the difficulty caused by too many interim reviews.<br/>
If we are extending the period between general reviews, there might of necessity&#x2014;perhaps, according to circumstances&#x2014;have to be rather more interim reviews. If the circumstances dictate that I should think it is hardly necessary for us to have a procedure of the kind suggested by the Clause.<br/>
Just suppose, however, that we accepted the principle and the spirit of this proposal, the question is, could we accept the Clause itself? There is at

least one point in the drafting which, I am afraid, would vitiate it completely from our point of view, and that is subsection (8), which says:
<q>This section shall not apply to Northern Ireland or to any constituency in Great Britain, which appears to the appropriate Boundary Commission to be one to which rule 6 of the rules set out in the Second Schedule to the principal Act applies.</q>
An obscurity arises there, because although the decision is left with the Boundary Commission, one wonders, naturally, whether the Boundary Commission is expected to get out a list of those constituencies in which the local authorities would not be allowed to make recommendations under this Clause. If the Boundary Commission were to get out such a list I have a horrible feeling that it might arouse a certain amount of controversy in the minds of members of such local authorities. That certainly would be a matter to which we should have to attend.<br/>
One is very hesitant to mention Northern Ireland on an occasion like this when we have been discussing broad principles, but this Clause expressly excludes Northern Ireland, and although the number of seats for Northern Ireland is at present fixed in the Second Schedule as twelve, it might very well be thought by a local authority in Northern Ireland that it should have at least as good rights as local authorities anywhere else.<br/>
However, as I say, that is a drafting matter.<br/>
I would say to the hon. and learned Member that we do consider these as House of Commons matters. We have considered all the Amendments most carefully. The Home Secretary has considered the matter personally and in very great detail. If we felt that this Clause or any of the others would be likely to facilitate the work of the Boundary Commission, or to grant rights to local authorities or individuals which ought to be granted, then we should most certainly have conceded the Clause.<br/>
For the reasons I have given, we do not feel that we can accept the Clause. As I say, our main reason is that we do not think that it adds to the opportunities which already exist and that we feel that it would unnecessarily introduce a somewhat cumbersome procedure.</p>

<p>I agree that this is not an easy matter, but the Commission is to consist, besides Mr. Speaker, of the deputy-chairman and two members, one of whom is to be appointed by the hon. and learned Gentleman's right hon. Friend. At least, that is how I read it. It says:
<q>appointed by the Secretary of State</q>
and I think that must mean the Home Secretary in that context. I am thinking of England and Wales for the moment.<br/>
Would the hon. and learned Gentleman consider it the duty of the Home Office appointee on that Boundary Commission to keep an eye on the constituency position over the country, or, if not, would he regard it as the duty of the deputy-chairman, the High Court judge? It would help me a great deal&#x2014;I am speaking personally&#x2014;if I knew that the Home Secretary took the view that it was the responsibility of the Home Office appointee to keep an eye on the constituency position and to let the Boundary Commission know from time to time that there was a possibility that it ought to think of something or other. I do not see how, in practice, the High Court judge can do that. That is the point.</p>

<p>I would certainly agree that the Home Office appointee would have such a duty, but not for the reason that he was the Home Office appointee. I should have thought that the members of the Boundary Commission, having been appointed to fulfil statutory duties, would be individually and collectively responsible for seeing that they performed those duties. It will be their duty to scrutinise the population figures as produced by the Registrar-General, who will be an assessor, and to consider all representations made to them from time to time, and, generally, to keep their ears to the ground, in order that they may properly perform their statutory functions. I must stress, however, that I would not agree that the duty of a Home Office appointee would arise merely because he was a Home Office appointee, but would arise for the reasons I have given.</p>

<p>It comes to this, does it not, that the Home Secretary of the day takes no questionable responsibility, if the hon. and learned Gentleman knows what I mean, for the action or inaction

of his appointee on the Boundary Commission? Therefore, so far as I can see, there is no Parliamentary responsibility. Because the Boundary Commission has power to make these interim reviews, it seems to be under the obligation to do so. I think that is the position.<br/>
I hope that the Government will consider the question. I agree that it is a difficult question and that, in practice, cases may not be very frequent. I agree, above all, that it is most inadvisable to have these interim reviews too often, but I am a little uneasy about this long period with nobody taking the responsibility for attending to what might be quite an abnormal growth of population, or something of that sort, in a constituency during the period.</p>

<p>Let us be a little realistic about the matter. I think the hon. and learned Gentleman quoted "Pickwick Papers" and the Fat Boy. He said, "The Fat Boy is swelling wisibly." There is a further quotation about the Fat Boy. It is, "The Fat Boy has gone to sleep again." No doubt the hon. and learned Gentleman remembers that. I think that if the hon. Member of Parliament who represents the Fat Boy keeps awake, the matter will right itself very quickly indeed.</p>

<p>I should like to thank the hon. and learned Gentleman for his courteous and patient reply, although, naturally, I found his rejoinder very disappointing. To some extent, I thought that his argument about frequent reviews and the quotation of my speech were not quite relevant, because the cases in Kent which I mentioned were not the results of interim reviews but the results of comprehensive reviews which were authorised by different Acts.<br/>
One case I had in mind was a place which, before 1945, was in one constituency, which was then placed by the 1944 review in another, then altered by the 1948 Act to another, and altered still further by the 1953 review. These were not interim reviews but the main general reviews, and it was that about which I was complaining. I do not quarrel with the general proposition that, in general, one does not want frequent reviews. The cases I mentioned were unnecessary changes as a result of the comprehensive reviews carried out by the various Commissions.<br/>
The real point at issue, and the point on which the hon. and learned Gentleman has not satisfied me, is that the Clause gives the right to a local authority to initiate a proposal direct to the Secretary of State. A local authority has not that right under the existing law or under the proposed changes in the Bill. That is very important. I do not think it is right to say that because a local authority can get in touch with the Boundary Commission, the power given to it under the Clause would add nothing. Getting in touch with the Boundary Commission may mean a lot or nothing.<br/>
Some of us and some local authorities had very unfortunate experiences in trying to get in touch with the Boundary Commission during the last review. One would not necessarily suppose, of course, that the difficulties which then arose would arise in future. A great many reviews were taking place, and the Boundary Commission was no doubt very considerably overworked. But representations were made by local authorities, and there was no indication that any attention at all had been paid to their proposals. That was particularly the case when no inquiries were held. As the Committee will be aware, there were only seven inquiries for the whole of England. It is, therefore, a rather poor bone to offer the local authorities to say that they can get in touch with the Boundary Commission. No doubt they will get their representations acknowledged, but there is no guarantee of anything more.<br/>
A representation to the Secretary of State is worth very much more. He is bound by constitutional practice as well as, I am sure, by general desire and courtesy to make a reply. Furthermore, he can be questioned in the House. The Boundary Commission cannot be questioned in the House. It may be right that it should not. Therefore, the really fundamental additional power which the provisions in the new Clause give is a right of direct representation to the Secretary of State. With respect, I do not think that the hon. and learned Gentleman met that point.
8.30 p.m.<br/>
If Rule 6 is the difficulty I am quite prepared to drop it. It is a very minor point indeed. I realise that it might be difficult legally. It was included in the Clause because, obviously, where there

are special geographical considerations, one would not want to prejudice the electors there. I do not, in fact, think that representations would be made; any area which was very much over-represented, in the sense of its population being small, would have little desire to change. Such areas are usually only too glad to hang on to the representation they have. However, I am very willing, and I am sure that my supporters also would be willing to drop it. For the sake of peace and quiet&#x2014;no doubt, unusual in this context&#x2014;I should be glad also to embrace Northern Ireland, if that would help.<br/>
I hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman will reply to the main point I have made about the right of direct access to the Secretary of State. If he cannot concede the principle of the Clause, will he give some undertaking that the matter might be reviewed at a later stage? Rather than have nothing, I and my hon. Friends would be content with, at least, the right to present to the Home Office a case for a <i>prima facie</i> inquiry. If it went no farther than that, I think that it would be better than nothing. But without some powers of this kind, we shall be left with no responsible body being able to make direct representation to the Secretary of State. I regard that as a <i>lacuna</i> which should be filled.</p>

<p>I am glad that the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (Mr. Skeffington) has raised this further point. During our discussion, the matter has really been fined down to the question of what parliamentary responsibility there is. The hon. Gentleman is contriving a procedure which, he hopes, will of certainty engage the responsibility of the Secretary of State. Earlier, the hon. and learned Member for Kettering (Mr. Mitchison) asked a question which corresponded broadly with that. He asked what duty there was on the part of members of the Boundary Commission to keep the state of constituencies under review so as to see whether any particular interim review was needed.<br/>
The first answer to the hon. Gentleman and to the hon. and learned Gentleman is that the Act of 1949 begins, apart from the Short Title and Preamble, with these words:
<q>For the purpose of the continuous review of the distribution of seats at parliamentary elections, there shall be four permanent Boundary Commissions.</q>


Those words place upon the Boundary Commission, I suggest, the duty of continuous review, because that is the purpose of their existence.<br/>
As regards the position of the Secretary of State, my right hon. Friend has said that, although he has no right whatever to interfere with the work of the Boundary Commissions or to dictate to them how they shall do their work, he is quite prepared to pass to the appropriate Boundary Commission any representations which he may receive from, for example, any Member of Parliament or any local authority. A Question can always be put to the Secretary of State as to whether he has forwarded such representation. If that is not coming very close indeed to engaging parliamentary responsibility for the work of the Boundary Commission, I do not know what is.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That the Clause be read a Second time.<br/>
This Clause deals with a very short point, and I hope that the Government will accept it. I have no ground for supposing that they will, and some ground for supposing that they will never accept anything. But, none the less, let us hope. I see the hon. and learned Gentleman looking a little puzzled. The ground to which I refer is previous experience today. So far, they have accepted nothing.<br/>
At the end of the proceedings the operative instrument under the principal Act is an Order in Council and, as far as I am aware, it operates immediately. When we had the last review and the last heated discussion in the House about the Order in Council which emerged from

that review, the final results came into operation much too soon to be convenient before a General Election. I cannot believe that that is to anybody's advantage. Not merely the electors, whose political connections and political activities may be abruptly transferred from somewhere they know to somewhere they do not know, but also the officials who have to deal with this matter from the electoral point of view, and, indeed, everybody concerned, must deplore a short interval between the Orders in Council and a General Election.<br/>
I see no practical means of avoiding the difficulty except by allowing an interval between the time when the Orders are made and the time when they come into operation. I am sure that the Government are well aware of this practical difficulty and I cannot believe that they want it to continue. They have not put an Amendment down to meet the point, but no doubt they have read the new Clause. In those circumstances, I earnestly hope that they will accept it.</p>

<p>The hon. and learned Member for Kettering (Mr. Mitchison) has moved the Motion most persuasively. We all recognise the difficulties which arise from too short notice after an Order has been presented for the division of an area into constituencies. On the other hand, there is a contrary danger. It would be possible for too long to elapse before an Election took place, because if the Commission completes a review in the early life-time of a Parliament we shall have a considerable movement of population in the period before the next Election takes place. One has to strike a balance.<br/>
I suggest to the Committee that the mere fact that we are increasing the period between reviews will give the Boundary Commission considerably more latitude as to the time it chooses for submitting a report. The Commission itself should be able to select the time in such a way that the Orders can be made without leaving too much time to elapse before the next General Election, while within the ambit of the period within which a review can be made&#x2014;between ten and fifteen years. That time should not be too long, on the one hand, and should not be too short, on the other hand.</p>

<p>Perhaps I moved the Motion too shortly. I do not think that the hon. Member understands its purport. The point is that these Orders do not come into operation until a General Election. The only point is to provide for the case when there is less than six months between the Order and the General Election.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1958-03-27a.689.1" hansard_membership_id="8772" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/17802" speakername="Mr. Macpherson" colnum="689" time="">
<p>I was coming to that point. The Order in Council giving effect to a Commission's recommendations on the division of any area into constituencies may come into force on such date as is specified in the Order. That provision is in Section 3 (6) of the 1949 Act. As the hon. and learned Member has said, that Order does not effect any change in constituencies until the next General Election, so that any by-election would be conducted under the old rules, as things are at present. If we made a definite rule that the new Order would not come into effect until six months, at least, after it was published, should an Election take place in the intervening period, it would have to take place on the old register.<br/>
I put it to the hon. and learned Member that if that were done it would surely create grave political prejudice. Can he imagine what would be said about the Government party at an Election held in those circumstances? It would be said that they were hurrying to the country before the new register came into force.</p>

<p>I can answer the hon. Gentleman's question about what would be said. Nothing worse would be likely to be said than was said about the Conservatives getting the Rochdale by-election on the old register, but is this the point? Surely, the point is that if we allow a shorter interval than six months in this type of case we will make the whole thing impossible and unworkable for everybody. I am not convinced by anything that I have heard so far.</p>

<p>I should have thought that the mere case of the Rochdale by-election which the hon. and learned Member has quoted proves the point that grave political prejudice would undoubtedly be created.<br/>
We might well have a snap Election in the period. The Government might

he defeated and have to go to the country, or they might decide to have a General Election because they conceived that it was in the national interest to have one. But, surely, the effect of an Order of this kind would be almost to put a complete ban on General Elections taking place until six months had elapsed, no matter what the conditions were. I suggest that this ought to be left to circumstances and that we should not tie this matter down.<br/>
We recognise, of course, that serious difficulties are involved if it so happens that the time that elapses between the Order and the General Election is short. In the last case, four to five months elapsed. Perhaps that was not long enough. Perhaps the hon. and learned Member for Kettering is right and that it would be more convenient to have a longer period, but I suggest to the Committee that this is not a suitable provision to write into the Bill.<br/>
If we tie this arrangement down, all that will really happen will be that we shall virtually be putting a ban on the holding of a General Election, whatever the circumstances, until six months after the Order has been made. I do not think that that necessarily would be to the advantage of the country as a whole. Therefore, much as we should like to accept it, after the hon. and learned Member has tried so hard and moved so many Amendments with such grace, I fear that we cannot accept the new Clause.</p>

<p>I hope that the hon. Gentleman will do a thing that I find very difficult to do, and that is to read his own speech in HANSARD tomorrow.<br/>
I do not understand the hon. Gentleman's answer on this matter. Every time one of these Orders is made it involves the shifting of the electoral


position of a number of electors. If it is a substantial Order it involves the reorganisation of the machinery inside the constituencies by all the political parties involved. Some people have to get into a quite new orientation with regard to their political friends in other parts of the new constituency, which takes some time, and they find themselves cut off from people with whom they were formerly associated. In 1950, in the general review that brought up to date constituencies that had existed since 1918, these changes were very considerable, and there had been a substantial movement of population which added to the difficulty.<br/>
I suggest that six months is not long enough for that process, even when only one Order dealing with, perhaps, two or three constituencies is involved. I cannot think that this problem is involved with the date for holding a General Election. I am thinking now about the conditions created when an interim Order is made, possibly owing to an adjustment of local Government boundaries, which I think has been the cause of all the interim Orders up to date. Any Government that contemplated having a General Election immediately after an interval of ten or fifteen years would be very blameworthy if they held it within six months of the Orders being made.<br/>
This is a sensible Amendment in view of our general knowledge of the difficulties that are created inside a constituency when an interim Order is made. There may be difficulties about the register. It will all depend on the time of the year whether the register that is in print is applicable to the new constituencies that have been created, not merely with regard to the constituency as a whole, but with regard to wards or parishes within the constituency.<br/>
This Clause ought to have serious consideration, because those of us who every now and then have to engage in an Election know the difficulties that are created if we have a register which was not designed for the constituency which is now the subject of an election contest.</p>

<p>I am sorry that I did not hear the introductory remarks of the hon. and learned Member for Kettering (Mr. Mitchison) in introducing the new Clause and I apologise to him.

I agree entirely with the right hon. Member for South Shields (Mr. Ede) concerning the difficulties that are likely to ensue to the electors of an area from a change of the electoral boundaries. I have had experience of it myself. At one time, as Member for a county constituency, I had the honour of representing part of the Borough of Northampton, which was formerly represented by my father. It was a highly inconvenient arrangement. The electors within the borough who objected to the hon. and learned Member for Northampton (Mr. Paget) could not understand why they did not have the opportunity to record their votes against him. I could not explain it to them either. I was much relieved when the boundaries were adjusted and the electors were accorded that facility. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will not feel that we do not fully appreciate all these difficulties.<br/>
The interim Orders to which the right hon. Gentleman referred do not take effect until the next General Election. Therefore, one is in the position that the Clause would affect the situation only at a General Election. While I think that any Government should have great regard so far as it can to the situation, it depends in large degree upon the Boundary Commission, which ought also to have great regard to the situation so far as it can be foreseen. Both the Government and the Boundary Commission should have great regard to trying to avoid any such changes with a General Election imminent.<br/>
While I appreciate all that the right hon. Gentleman has said, the difficulty is that although six months' notice may be given, it may so happen that the General Election takes place immediately on the expiration of the six months or, possibly, before the six months has expired. One cannot tell how many Orders would fall to be made&#x2014;it depends on the work of the Boundary Commission and may depend on the work done under the Local Government Bill&#x2014;towards the end of the life of a particular Parliament. That being so, there might well be a situation, which would be highly unsatisfactory, whether it was open to party political criticism or not, of a General Election being fought with a large number of constituencies remaining unaltered when, according to the Report of the Boundary


Commission, accepted, perhaps, by the Government and by this House, those constituencies should have been altered to secure a fair representation.<br/>
Having regard to the circumstances, we cannot accept the Amendment. We feel, however, that regard must be paid, by whatever Government there may be and by the three Commissions, to the points that the right hon. Gentleman has urged concerning the necessity of giving an adequate opportunity for adjustment by those affected by these changes.</p>

<p>It was the day between the Derby and the Oaks, my right hon. Friend tells me. That may be, but it was within less than six months. They were changes that made things extraordinarily difficult for people.<br/>
I am well aware that the Government, especially nowadays, never know when the next crisis is coming. There was Suez. There was the foreign exchange crisis and rescuing the &#x00A3;. I do not know what we may have to rescue next time. The Rent Act caused a bit of a crisis too. We never know what there will be by way of crises. We live in lively times and they get livelier and livelier from the crisis point of view the longer the Goverment stay in office.<br/>
All that is profoundly true, but at the end of the day what is the right thing to do? Is it really better to have a General Election on top of changes of this kind, or is it better to continue on the old register and do it that way? I believe the Government capable of any iniquity, but I really do not think they would so organise a General Election as to work it on the old register deliberately They know their own minds and their own virtues and vices better than I do. It occurred to them; it did not occur to me. They know, and perhaps they really are capable of so arranging matters that if this Clause is accepted the whole of a General Election can be done <i>&#x00E0; la</i> Rochdale on the outgoing register.<br/>
Perhaps they think they had better keep on the safe side and risk all the inconvenience of a very short interval between the Order in Council and the General Election; risk all the inconvenience to the electorate, to the officials, to everybody else concerned, in order at all costs to remove this insistent temptation to work the whole of the General Election on an out-of-date register. It is clear they have it in mind. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Motion.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That the Clause be read a Second time.<br/>
In asking the Committee to accept this Clause I have Hornchurch particularly in mind. I understand that the electorate there is already 88,000, although in 1955 it was about the normal for other constituencies. There is every chance that by the time the next General Election takes place, under this Bill, say, in 1964,


the electorate in that area may be well over 100,000, possibly 120,000. The population is growing rapidly and there is plenty of room for building houses. I would have thought it undesirable that we should have an anomaly of this kind perpetuated for such a long time, and I suggest that we ought to take a decision upon it tonight.<br/>
I speak with feeling on this matter, having represented a large constituency before 1945. From 1935 to 1945, I was Member for the old division of Romford, which, in 1918, was a normal-sized constituency. Thanks, however, to the building of L.C.C. housing estates especially, and to other developments in the area, when I was elected for the area in 1935 the electorate was already 169,000 and it rose during the ten years to 1945 to 207,000. It had to be divided into four separate constituencies.<br/>
I suggest that there is a danger, not only in Hornchurch but elsewhere, of that kind of anomaly arising. New towns are under construction. Some of them may grow rapidly. I think, therefore, that we ought to take a decision about this example and also about the principle of the matter.<br/>
This Clause proposes that the Boundary Commission should be able to look at such a constituency&#x2014;in fact, should be ordered to do so&#x2014;when the electorate reaches the figure of 80,000. In this case, it could divide the constituency, here and now, into two constituencies of approximately 44,000 each. If it did that, both seats would be larger than many now existing. If it were possible to do that, the Boundary Commission could look at the matter again at the time of the next general review. What I am suggesting is that in such a case we should ask the Boundary Commission just to deal with that particular anomaly, to provide for an extra Member for the time being, and then to review the whole position when the general review takes place.
9.0 p.m.<br/>
Having an extra Member in the House for a few years would not matter very much, because it might be later decided to bring down the number to what it was before. The advantage of my proposal is that it would prevent having to alter the boundaries of all sorts of constituencies in order to find an extra seat for one group of constituents. That

is what we want to avoid and it is the purpose of the Bill to avoid altering boundaries all over the place and inconveniencing many Members by the sudden alteration of boundaries. My proposal would enable that to be avoided in a very practical way.<br/>
I ask the Government to tell us what they propose to do about the Hornchurch constituency, with its 88,000 electors and a growing electorate, and whether they could provide for an extra Member for that area, possibly taking into account immediately surrounding constituencies, but not others, and whether that would not be a sensible way out of the difficulty. I also ask the Government to say what they want to do on the principle of the matter as a whole.</p>

<p>I associate myself with most of the remarks of the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Parker). I, too, would like to know what is to be done about the constituency of Hornchurch. At the outset, I want to thank the hon. Member for Brixton (Mr. Lipton) for his appreciation of the manner in which the people of Hornchurch are now being represented. I agree with him entirely.<br/>
The new Clause will bear serious consideration by the Government. Hornchurch is the perfect example of a constituency which has grown very rapidly since the war. Immediately after the war, there were 45,000 electors and there are now 87,000 out of a population of 116,000. If sixteen years are allowed to elapse before any attempt is made to deal with such a constituency, it must be generally admitted that the burden placed on the Member is nothing compared with the burden placed on the constituent trying to get representation through his Member. That is a great deal more important.<br/>
This afternoon, the Committee has given too much consideration to the Member and what he has to do and too little to the plight in which a constituent finds himself when he wants assistance from a Member who has to represent a number so large that he is precluded from giving personal attention to an individual case.<br/>
I was delighted that on Second Reading the right hon. Gentleman the Member for South Shields (Mr. Ede) expressed the opinion&#x2014;and his opinions in these


matters are always valuable, because of his long experience&#x2014;that a constituency such as Hornchurch could be dealt with under existing powers. I believe that that is so and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland said that he was of the opinion that the Bill did not in any way take away the powers from the Act of 1949. It therefore seems that there is a power for the Boundary Commission to deal with a division such as mine.<br/>
So long as I can be assured that the assessors, to which the Secretary of State referred on Second Reading, will refer to the Boundary Commission the facts as they exist, then I am confident that Hornchurch will get a second Member. There is no difference of opinion in Hornchurch between its political parties, its Member of Parliament and its local council, so none of the alarming fears which have been mentioned previously today is justified.<br/>
I hope that the Minister will make it clear that the Boundary Commission has power to act. We are so often told by Ministers&#x2014;of Governments of both parties&#x2014;"There is nothing to worry about; the Boundary Commission", or whatever body it is, "will know exactly what its powers are, and it can act under those powers and all will be well." When the Act is on the Statute Book, however, and the people concerned ask for action and write to the Boundary Commission, or whoever it may be, they are told, "Unfortunately, we are precluded from acting." It is found that a phrase in the Act allows them to sit back and say, self-righteously, that they are prevented from acting.<br/>
It is the duty of a Member such as myself to make sure that that position does not arise when Hornchurch, either through its local council or myself, asks the Commission to consider sympathetically the matters which will undoubtedly be brought before it.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Hornchurch (Mr. Lagden) has a very acute appreciation of the inspissated obscurantism and ineluctable obstinacy of all Governments. The question that we now have to consider is whether, in the light of those well-known facts, the Clause is necessary, like the journey in

the railway train. The Joint Under-Secretary has told us that it all depends, in practice, upon the operation of Section 2 (3) of the principal Act.<br/>
Although the Bill is now going through, that subsection has always been up there, watching over us. If it is not operating; if we have been watched without knowing it; if the Boundary Commission, in the active and continuous discharge of its functions has not been quite so invisible to the naked eye as it should have been, we are given cause to wonder whether it might not require what I called a tug at the coat, or the kind of inducement given it by the existence of a constituency swollen to the size of Hornchurch.<br/>
In short, if it is to act as wonderfully as we were told it would, despite the obstinacy of the Government in refusing every attempt to give it a prod, impulse, reminder, or whatever one likes to call it, how comes it that over all these years Hornchurch has been growing and growing and growing, and nobody has done a thing about it? Not a thing has been done; not even by the member of the Boundary Commission nominated by the Home Office; not even by the member of the Boundary Commission nominated by another Government Department; not even by the technical gentleman the Registrar-General, and what-not, who, till today, had been sitting as part of the Commission. They may have registered many things, but they have not registered the need to take any action about Hornchurch.<br/>
There it is. It has been always with us. Hornchurch has been growing; nothing has happened. Can the Government tell us, conclusively and finally, that such a change of heart has come over the institutions of this country, including, in this case, the Boundary Commission, that, for once in a way, it will do its continuous job without being prodded? I hope that they can tell us that; otherwise, it seems that much that they have been telling us in the past has been drawing wool over our eyes and deceiving us as to the extent of inertia inherent in all Governmental institutions.</p>

<p>When I saw this proposed new Clause on the Notice Paper, I little thought it was but a convenient way of pressing for another Member for Horn-church, but as the need of Hornchurch


for another Member has been suggested in the debate perhaps I should mention it.<br/>
One of the reasons, perhaps, why Hornchurch has not had a second Member as soon as it might have is the energy and ability displayed by my hon. Friend in representing with very great skill no fewer that 80,000 people. I feel that it was to a very large extent modesty on his part which caused him to join the clamour which has been raised on this new Clause, which itself has a very much wider purpose.<br/>
As I have been challenged to say something about what is to happen so far as Hornchurch is concerned, let me, first, reassure my hon. Friend that there is abundant power under the 1949 Act for the Boundary Commission to make an interim review. The fact that that power has not been used so far is no indication that it will not be used in future.<br/>
Those who are so anxious for the power to be used have had the procedure explained to them by me on an earlier Amendment. All that they have to do is to make representations to the Boundary Commission, and if they care to make them through my right hon. Friend, he will be glad to forward them.<br/>
I presume that, in spite of the fact that Hornchurch has loomed so large in this discussion, I must deal with the merits of the proposed new Clause, lest the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Parker) should think I was in any way discourteous, especially when he has taken a certain amount of trouble. At first sight, it is rather tempting to deal with what the hon. and learned Member for Kettering (Mr. Mitchison) called the "Fat Boys" in this way, but we would be highly selective if we decided that one particular reason for holding an interim review should be made the subject of this special procedure, when there are various other examples which have been mentioned in the course of the discussion on earlier Amendments, and which might

very well have been made the subject of special procedure, had such procedure been necessary.<br/>
My contention on this proposed Clause, as it was on a previous Amendment, is that no such procedure is necessary. The obligation of the Commission, as I said earlier, is a continuing one, as is clear from Section I (1) of the 1949 Act. The power to hold an interim review is an unfettered one, the opportunities provided for the Commission are unlimited, and, in these circumstances, there does not appear to be any need for the special procedure which the hon. Gentleman has suggested to the Committee.<br/>
My duty is to advise the Committee to reject the Clause, but, as I believe that this is the last proposal for amendment of the Bill that we shall be discussing this evening, may I say with great humility that, so far as I recollect, no Committee stage of any Bill of this kind dealing with the distribution of seats for the House of Commons has ever taken place in such an equable and pleasant atmosphere, nor, if I may say so with humility to the Chair, with such a tremendous regard for the rules of order. May I say, on behalf of my right hon. and learned Friend and myself, what a pleasure it has been to us to take part in such proceedings.</p>

<p>I wish to raise a constituency matter and, as we have just been hearing about the importance of constituency matters being represented in this House in the case of large constituencies, I hope that hon. Members will bear with me while I deal with this subject.<br/>
A firm in my constituency, Messrs. Hampson Industries, manufactures articles of great importance to the aircraft industry, and as long ago as July, 1955, it was invited to tender for a 20-kilowatt serving trolley. This is used in servicing aeroplanes to see that the electrical equipment is in proper condition. In September of that year Ministry of Supply officials visited the firm and said they found the work satisfactory. In fact they were impressed by the design which they saw. On 9th November Messrs. Hampson were told that the Ministry of Supply would decide later whether to give an order. Apparently the Ministry could not make up its mind at that time.<br/>
The Ministry continued in correspondence with the firm without saying that it had actually given the contract to another firm. That is rather a curious procedure. I do not know whether it is something which the Ministry often does&#x2014;give a contract to one firm without telling the other firm and keep up correspondence with a firm which apparently had been rejected and give it the idea that it was still in the running.<br/>
After a time Messrs. Hampson objected to this and asked whether something could be done. They were told unofficially by a high-ranking civil servant that it would be to their advantage to make a unit as soon as possible. It seems a strange way of going about matters, but that was what the firm was told. Accordingly, a unit was made, but nothing happened. Some months elapsed and the next thing was that in early October, 1956, fifteen months after the firm was first asked to tender, the matter was mentioned, in conversation, to the present

Paymaster-General who at that time was the Minister of Supply.<br/>
As we know, the right hon. Gentleman is a man of great force and drive and he at once took action. He said that the unit was to be accepted as an alternative to the competitor's unit. That was something which had never been done before. On 30th October the Ministry of Supply, having, apparently, been prodded into this action by the Paymaster-General, asked Messrs. Hampson what they wanted. That would appear to be a curious request after all this time. Messrs. Hampson said that what they wanted was an order and that they had been trying to get their machine tested for months. The Ministry of Supply might well have been aware of this. Still, nothing happened until 6th December.<br/>
Then the Paymaster-General again looked into the matter. This time he met the managing director of the firm, as a result of which meeting he said that the firm was to go ahead and produce the machine and have it tested later. On 31st January, 1957, the unit was tested and found to be satisfactory. During the months that followed, the machine, which might have been of great service to the R.A.F., was not being produced. On 5th April, after agreement on prices, instructions were issued to the Ministry of Supply to collect the unit from the works. All tests were completed by the end of May. The R.A.F. was quite satisfied with them although the Ministry of Supply officials had previously given the impression that the machine was of no use at all.<br/>
Meanwhile a new Minister had arrived at the Ministry of Supply. The Paymaster-General had gone. No doubt the new Minister was occupied in settling in, and going into a number of other matters, besides the question of this machine. The matter was allowed to drop, and again there was delay. The next thing that happened was in August, 1957, some months afterwards, when Messrs. Hampson were asked for specifications and prices. The Ministry of Supply already had those in its possession, but again asked for them. The firm was asked to quote for certain additions, which it did. In October, 1957, the firm asked what had happened and was told that its tender would be accepted strictly on grounds of price and that it must reduce its price. This it did.<br/>
On 10th December, 1957, the firm was informed that its tender was declined, not on price at all but on delivery and on technical grounds, something quite different, which the firm had never been told about before. To say that the rejection was on technical grounds was rather curious, because the unit had previously been approved by the Ministry's own design department, and as to delivery it was the Ministry which had been responsible for two years' delay. It was equally strange therefore to turn down the offer on grounds of delivery.<br/>
In December, 1957, Hampson's approached me and I wrote to the Minister. The Minister replied:
<q>You wrote to me on 16th December about the disappointment which Hampson Industries feel at the loss of the contract for a relatively small Air Ministry requirement of electrical servicing trolleys.</q>
I suppose when one is running anything as big as a large Ministry, like the Ministry of Supply, one feels that a small firm and a small unit are of no importance. This is only a small firm; it has only 100 employees, but to the firm this was a large order, even if it was not so to a Minister of Supply, sitting at the head of the Ministry. Hampson's had spent no less than &#x00A3;8,000 on developing the trolley, and it kept the production space open all this time while the Ministry was making up its mind.<br/>
The Minister made a very curious remark in his letter. He said:
<q>It would, I think, be undesirable, from all points of view, for the firm to be represented at our meeting.</q>
In other words, I, the Member of Parliament, was not to take these gentlemen to the Minister because it would be undesirable. The curious thing is that the Paymaster-General had been willing to see them without the Member of Parliament. Why should it be undesirable for the present Minister to see them with their Member of Parliament. This is something very strange about which I should like to have an answer. The date for the meeting was fixed but then the meeting was postponed. I have no doubt the Minister was busy. He wrote to me and explained the situation.<br/>
I thought that the time had come when the matter should be brought to a head, and brought to a head in public. It is a lamentable state of affairs. It is true

that it concerns only a small order, but it is an order related to the safety of aeroplanes and should, therefore, be of great importance to the Ministry of Supply. Nearly three years have gone by. Why? I can only suppose that it is due to a lack of co-ordination not only between the Air Ministry, the R.A.F. and the Ministry of Supply but between the different departments in the Ministry of Supply itself.<br/>
So far as I understand the matter, the Ministry of Supply design office has the last word in all these things. At the head of that office there are two men, one of whom has admitted to Hampson's directors that he is unfamiliar with the unit concerned. So we are left with one man upon whose word, apparently, the fate of this order was to depend. This is, as I have said, a small machine. The Minister implies that it is unimportant but, though it is small, it is of great importance to aeroplanes.<br/>
If this happens in the case of a small machine, how are we to know that it does not happen in the case of large machines? If this happens with a servicing trolley, what happens with a bomber? This has revealed a state of affairs so unsatisfactory that something should be done about it. It points to something in the Ministry which might spread from small things to the very largest machines for which that Department is responsible.<br/>
The Prime Minister is a very busy man and has plenty to occupy him, but I think that he might take time off for at least an hour. Having gone into the affairs of the Ministry of Supply, I think that he would find that it well worth his while to order an inquiry into its organisation, to make quite certain that it is an organisation capable of dealing with such matters as this, and not, as many of us think it is today, an organisation that is defective in many respects.</p>

<p>Whatever the right hon. Gentleman meant he certainly conveyed the impression that there had been unfair discrimination against this firm in the allocation of contracts. I repeat that that is a most serious allegation to make against a Government Department, and one that can be answered only after a most thorough-going investigation. I have made such a thorough investigation into all the facts of this case.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman, some months ago, drew the attention of my right hon. Friend to a number of contracts about which the firm had complained. I have personally studied the circumstances in which each contract was placed, and the facts that I shall lay before the House tonight are based on the result of this careful and impartial examination. Before I do that, I should like to make one or two references to the implied charge of discourtesy on the part of my right hon. Friend and of officials of the Ministry that have been made by the right hon. Gentleman.<br/>
First, I should like to dispose of the suggestion that my right hon. Friend or my Department treated either the right hon. Gentleman or the firm with discourtesy. As the right hon. Gentleman said, the firm wrote to the Minister on four occasions last year, and I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman, with his experience of Ministerial office, would not suggest for a moment that a Minister should reply personally to every firm which is dissatisfied with its share of Government contracts. Each of these letters, with the exception of the last, received an acknowledgement or a reply of some kind from the Department, although I must admit&#x2014;and I have read the correspondence&#x2014;that those replies were not of a nature which could bring any comfort, in the circumstances, to Hampson Industries Ltd.<br/>
The answer to the final letter was on the point of being despatched when the right hon. Gentleman took up this matter with my right hon. Friend. He made an appointment to discuss this case in January of this year with my right hon. Friend. Unfortunately, at the last moment this appointment had to be cancelled because of pressure of urgent

business. I apologise to the right hon. Gentleman for the fact that it was not possible to arrange another appointment before he went on a trip abroad, but he was told that my right hon. Friend would be glad to see him as soon as possible after his return from India.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman has not taken advantage of that offer and, if I may say so with all due respect to him and to the House, I think it is rather a pity that he did not do so, because I feel strongly that it is desirable that complicated and technical matters of this nature should not be discussed on the Floor of the House of Commons and that Departments should not be asked to justify in this way their judgment on tender competition before a Member has used every other means that he has at his disposal of obtaining satisfaction.<br/>
This is, as the right hon. Gentleman said, rather a small firm as firms go, in the national picture. Hampson Industries Ltd. is a small private company with an issued capital of &#x00A3;1,000 and it employs a labour force of about 100. It manufactures generating sets, water pumping sets and other electrical equipment of this type. During the last six or seven years the Ministry of Supply has placed a number of contracts with this firm for the repair, development and production of equipment to a total value of &#x00A3;90,000. I understand that the firm has also had other work for other Government Departments. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will agree that &#x00A3;90,000 worth of work which this firm has done for the Ministry of Supply is not an unsubstantial volume of work, having regard to the size of the firm.<br/>
In the correspondence, the right hon. Gentleman sent us details of seven tenders in which the firm considered that it had been treated unfairly. Let me say, at the outset, that in judging this tender competition, the Department is under no, obligation to accept the lowest tender, although, of course, we aim to do so where other factors are evenly balanced. Nevertheless, the form which is sent with each invitation to tender and which was sent to Hampson Industries Ltd. in each of the cases which we are discussing tonight, contains the following words:
<q>The authority"&#x2014;</q>
and that means in this case the Minister of Supply&#x2014;
<q>shall be under no obligation to accept the lowest or any tender.</q>


The Ministry of Supply, like any other purchaser, has to bear in mind such other factors as technical merit and dates of delivery.<br/>
I have referred to seven tender competitions which the firm has complained about. In one of these the firm has complained because it was not invited to tender. This was the case of a requirement for a large and complicated set. We restricted the competition to those firms with the greatest facilities for and experience in the work involved. In four of the remaining six cases the prices quoted by Hampson's were not the lowest. In some of these the firm's equipment did not meet the specification in that it was over weight, and the delivery dates were unsatisfactory. In the remaining two cases the equipment was required urgently by the Air Ministry and the only way of obtaining deliveries in time was to place the orders with the firms whose equipment had already been developed and tested to the required standards. Hampson's had no suitable equipment available at that point of time.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman went into some detail about the big order, the order for the 20 kW ground service trolleys for aircraft. One of the last two competitions was for the 20 kW ground service trolley. This is the firm's main grievance, I believe, and the right hon. Gentleman went into it in some detail, and I think I ought to give him the full facts about this equipment. He went through the whole story as he has it, with the dates and the state of development, the competition, alternative equipment, and so on, and I hope he will follow me when I give him the details as I have sifted them out of this long and complicated record.<br/>
This trolley is a mobile generator which provides the power and testing equipment for servicing Javelin all-weather fighters. The story goes back to 1955, when the Air Ministry's technical requirement called for the development of a prototype to be completed before Javelins came into service. Tenders were received in August, 1955, of which only those by Hampson's and one other firm were technically acceptable, Hampson's quoting, in this case, the lower price. First deliveries were, however, required urgently by the Air Ministry, and since the other firm had offered better delivery dates it was decided to accept its tender.

The development was completed satisfactorily by this firm and a production order was subsequently placed with it.<br/>
Secondly, in May, 1956, Hampson's informed the Ministry of Supply that it was developing a trolley to meet this requirement as a private venture. That means that there was no Ministry of Supply or Government money involved in the undertaking. The firm foresaw, by developing this private venture, considerable prospects of worldwide business. It was, of course, made clear to the firm that the Department was under no obligation to order this equipment at any stage. It was purely a venture on the firm's part, freely entered into in the ordinary way of private enterprise in an effort to improve the firm's business.<br/>
Hampson's development went on for another year after that, and the set did not become available in a form suitable for trials until April, 1957. Works tests and service trials were then carried out during the following months and completed by August, 1957. These proved that the equipment Hampson's had submitted would, subject to minor alterations, meet the requirement, but I cannot agree that the Service trials proved that the Hampson trolley was in any way superior to any other trolley produced at that time, a claim which has often been made by the firm.<br/>
These trials showed, in fact, that there was very little, if anything, to choose technically between this trolley and the one already on order. A specification framed to include the Hampson design was drawn up and Hampson's and the firm already in production were invited to tender, each to its own design, for a production order in September, 1957.<br/>
The other firm which had previously received a development and production contract from the Department submitted a lower tender, but before the contract was awarded Hampson's represented to the Department that it had tendered to a higher quality than the other firm. To meet Hampson's, both firms were given an opportunity of revising their tenders. I must say, as one with some experience of these matters, that that seems to me to be going quite a long way after a tender has been received. The firm can clearly read what is involved in the specification. To be given an opportunity to go back and resubmit a tender to fit in with some


other competitor seems to me to be going rather further than I personally would have been prepared to go with any firm with which I was connected before I came to this House.<br/>
As I have said, both firms were given an opportunity of revising their tenders. The other firm confirmed its previous tender, but Hampson's introduced lower standard components and submitted a slightly lower tender. However, the revised Hampson set provided for a large number of new components and would have required at least four months' further trials before production could start. The Air Ministry said that it was unable to accept further delay, so the contract was given to the other firm.<br/>
The conclusion to which I have come after a very careful study of all this rather complicated evidence is that the officials of the Ministry of Supply confirmed have been scrupulously fair in the decisions they have made. Indeed, I might almost say that they have gone out of their way to meet Hampson's and to ensure that firm getting a square deal in our tender considerations.<br/>
Since the right hon. Gentleman has been frank in making his allegations against the Department&#x2014;he was not very kind at the end of his speech&#x2014;I hope he will not mind if I am equally frank. Hampson's has complained to the Department every time it has been unsuccessful in tendering for our orders. We have endeavoured to satisfy the firm by explaining the grounds on which its tenders have been rejected. I am sorry that the firm remains dissatisfied. I have been engaged in the engineering business for many years and, in my time, have submitted a great many tenders. I have also missed a great many orders. Indeed, I should have been better off if I had missed some of those I received. However, few of us are fortunate enough to be able to guarantee success in everything we do. We cannot be successful all the time. That is really the short story of this case.<br/>
Of course, it is disappointing when a tender is rejected, but one has to learn to accept these disappointments and to take them with good grace. It is no good making accusations of discrimination or unfairness every time one loses a tender. I suggest to the right hon. Gentleman that it is unfair to the officials concerned

to make very vague allegations without the slightest evidence with which to support them. If he can produce real evidence as to individuals, dates and times which bears investigation, or calls for investigation, I shall be very glad to look into the matter further. But I can find not a shred of evidence of favouritism or discrimination in our dealings with this firm.<br/>
As I said before, Hampson's has, in the past, received a substantial amount of work from us, and we shall continue to consider the firm for future contracts on its merits. I can only express the hope that, in the light of our debate this evening, the right hon. Gentleman will accept my assurance that our relations with the firm will, as far as we are concerned, continue to be friendly, and I hope that we may proceed in future to do business in a happy and amicable spirit. I should like to add that if this kind of matter were taken to a logical conclusion and every contract was the subject of discussion here, we should get into a really intolerable situation.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman asked me a specific question. Why, he asked, did the former Minister of Supply, the present Paymaster-General, see the firm without a Member of Parliament, and why did my right hon. Friend refuse to see the firm with a Member of Parliament? I repeat that if every firm which had dealings with the Ministry of Supply sought personal interviews with the Minister, with or without their Members, life would be quite intolerable. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will not take it amiss, or feel in any way offended because of the quite reasonable actions my right hon. Friend has taken in this case.</p>

<p>I hope so, too. Nothing I have said could give any offence to the Paymaster-General. It is merely a question of personal judgment. The Paymaster-General judged it in one way, and my right hon. Friend judged it in another. I meant nothing which could give offence to my right hon. Friend.</p>
