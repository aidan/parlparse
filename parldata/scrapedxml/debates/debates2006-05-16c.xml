<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-05-16c.849.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1678" speakername="Andy Burnham" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Department of Health"  colnum="849"  time="015:32:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060516/debtext/60516-0003.htm#06051658000347">
	<p pid="c.849.1/1">With permission, Mr. Speaker, and in the unavoidable absence of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, I should like to make a statement on primary care trusts and NHS ambulance trusts. Detailed information for each area has, for the convenience of hon. Members, been placed on the Board since 1 pm.</p>
	<p pid="c.849.1/2">In my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State's written statement of <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-18">18 October 2005</phrase>, she explained that strategic health authorities had been invited to submit proposals to the Department of Health on how to streamline SHAs and strengthen primary care trusts. Four clear criteria underpinned that exercise: the need to improve health and reduce inequalities; to strengthen the PCTs' commissioning function; to improve co-ordination with social services through greater coterminosity between PCT and local authority boundaries; and to deliver at least a 15 per cent. reduction in management and administrative costs.</p>
	<p pid="c.849.1/3">In the intervening period, SHAs have consulted local people, staff and clinicians, partners in local government and a range of other local stakeholders on the proposals for SHAs, PCTs and ambulance trusts. Many right hon. and hon. Members on both sides of the House have offered their views and I am very grateful to them. After local consultations, SHAs submitted their reports and recommendations to the Department. An external panel, established to advise Ministers on the proposals, has since met to consider in detail each proposal for PCTs and SHAs. After receiving its advice, we announced on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-12">12 April</phrase> that the numbers of SHAs would reduce from 28 to 10.</p>
	<p pid="c.849.1/4">Ministers have now considered the recommendations and the panel's advice on PCTs. I can now inform the House that the number of PCTs will fall from 303 to 152, and that the new organisations will be established on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-01">1 October 2006</phrase>. The population covered by each PCT will rise from an average of around 165,000 at present to an average of just below 330,000. About70 per cent. of the new PCTs will be coterminous with the boundaries of local authorities with social services responsibilities, which compares with about 44 per cent. of PCTs that are currently coterminous with their local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="c.849.1/5">In some areas, concerns have been expressed that larger PCTs could lose a locality focus and divert resources away from deprived areas or that smaller PCTs could lack commissioning power. We acknowledge those concerns and have sought to strike a careful balance between those conflicting demands. In response, we propose that four general conditions be applied: first, that all PCTs retain and build on partnership arrangements; secondly, that a strong locality focus must be retained and, where necessary, that local structures should be put in place; thirdly, that all PCTs must deliver their share of the 15 per cent. management cost saving, strengthen commissioning and ensure robust management of financial balance and risk; and fourthly, that the new PCTs and SHAs should consider how any further conditions relating to issues that arose during the consultation could be applied.</p>
	<p pid="c.849.1/6">In some areas, the new proposals differ from those suggested by the SHA and the external panel. Having taken into account all the evidence and sought local consensus wherever possible, we have judged that in those circumstances, the alternatives could better satisfy the &quot;Commissioning a Patient-led NHS&quot; criteria and have the best possible chance of success.</p>
	<p pid="c.849.1/7">On PCTs as providers of services, let me restate the Secretary of State's clear commitment to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-25">25 October 2005</phrase>. She said that</p>
	<p pid="c.849.1/8" class="indent">&quot;district nurses, health visitors and other staff&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.849.1/9">delivering clinical services</p>
	<p pid="c.849.1/10" class="indent">&quot;will continue to be employed by the PCT unless and until it decides otherwise.&quot;&mdash;[<i> Official Report,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-25">25 October 2005</phrase>; Vol. 438, c. 152.]</p>
	<p pid="c.849.1/11">Our aim in making these changes is to benefit both patients and taxpayers. Fewer, more strategic PCTs will be better placed to ensure effective commissioning of services for patients, and to support the development of practice-based commissioning among GPs and other primary care staff. Patients will receive the right care and treatment in the right place, and at the right time. The taxpayer will see the release of &pound;250 million worth of savings annually, through the merging of back-office functions and a reduction in administrative costs, for reinvestment in front-line services from 2008-09. That could pay, for example, for roughly 50,000 heart operations or major improvements in services for people with long-term conditions, especially older people. The changes will also build stronger partnerships between the NHS and local government.</p>
	<p pid="c.849.1/12">The reconfiguration of PCTs is the first stage in strengthening the commissioning function. The next stage is a development programme for all PCTs, which will ensure that they are strong, confident organisations fit for driving forward the NHS reforms that we are implementing.</p>
	<p pid="c.849.1/13">On ambulance trust reorganisation, in June 2005 the Government accepted the recommendations set out by Peter Bradley, our national ambulance adviser, in the review entitled &quot;Taking Healthcare to the Patient: Transforming NHS Ambulance Services&quot;, which set out a vision for ambulance services. In future, they will provide more care in the home and more treatment at the scene, give better advice to patients over the telephone and ensure faster response times to save more lives. The review made it clear that in order to ensure that ambulance trusts have the right strategic capacity, infrastructure and staff to deliver these improvements in patient care, there should in future be fewer, larger ambulance trusts. These changes will enable standards within the new trusts to be levelled up to those of the best.</p>
	<p pid="c.849.1/14">In her written statement of <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-14">14 December 2005</phrase>, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State set out our intention to consult and to ensure that the benefits outlined in the ambulance review can be fully realised. Following this consultation, the Secretary of State has now decided that from <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-01">1 July 2006</phrase>, most of the existing 29 NHS ambulance trusts will merge into 12, with separate management arrangements for the Isle of Wight. For now, Staffordshire ambulance service will remain a separate trust, working in partnership with the new West Midlands ambulance service, but will eventually merge at a later date.</p>
	<p pid="c.849.1/15">Feedback from most areas was supportive of our proposals. However, we have decided to address the public's concern that local responsiveness and flexibility could be lost through having larger trusts by requiring ambulance trusts to ensure that their services are meeting the needs of all localities and populations within their boundaries. Those changes should mean more investment in front-line services as trusts identify savings in back-room functions; improved patient care through providing an opportunity to raise the standard of the service provided by all trusts to the level of the best; better emergency planning, with greater capacity and the capability to respond to major incidents of all kinds; more integrated services; and better career opportunities for staff.</p>
	<p pid="c.849.1/16">Changes of this kind are inevitably difficult. We have not sought to impose a single blueprint on the NHS; instead, we have listened carefully to representations from all Members and from local communities and organisations. Wherever possible, we have responded positively to them. We have one aim above all: to deliver better health care to patients. I commend this statement to the House.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-05-16c.852.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1567" speakername="Stephen O'Brien" colnum="852"  time="015:32:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060516/debtext/60516-0004.htm#06051658000350">
	<p pid="c.852.0/1">Indeed, it does say it here, because that is what I wrote.</p>
	<p pid="c.852.0/2">First, let us look at ambulance trusts. Peter Bradley's review concluded that there should be fewer of them, but that they should be larger, yet no evidence for that major change was contained in the report, or made available since. Ministers then decided to reduce the number of strategic health authorities to align with their obsession with regions, notwithstanding the electorate's rejection of the idea in the north-east. With sleight of hand, Ministers have used the reorganisation as an excuse to reduce the number of trusts to 12, and then they have ducked the flak by suggesting that that was Peter Bradley's idea and recommendation all along. Will the Minister therefore undertake to place in the Library of the House any evidence that relates specifically to claims that creating large trusts will lead to improvements in patient care?</p>
	<p pid="c.852.0/3">How does the reorganisation achieve closer integration of all the emergency services? Will the Minister explain how a north-west regional ambulance service will integrate better with the newly merged Merseyside and Cheshire police force&mdash;a merger that will be carried out in the teeth of maximum hostility and objection? How will it integrate better with contingency planning in Cheshire, or with the Cheshire fire service's move to sub-regional control rooms?</p>
	<p pid="c.852.0/4">Will the Minister comment on proposals to reduce control room numbers by co-aligning them with the police and fire services? The House should bear it in mind that in Warwickshire, for example, the fire service responds to some 3,000 emergency calls a year, whereas the ambulance services respond to some 100,000.</p>
	<p pid="c.852.0/5">Who is co-ordinating the reorganisation across Government? Co-ordinated is the last thing that it is&mdash;perhaps the Deputy Prime Minister has been devoting his time to this matter recently. It is shambolic, inconsistent centralising by an arrogant Government who claim to listen but who choose not to hear the views of those who work on the front line and who know best.</p>
	<p pid="c.852.0/6">The official consultation on ambulance trusts lasted from the middle of September last year to near the end of March this year, yet the NHS appointments commission sent out letters on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-30">30 January</phrase>&mdash;in the middle of the consultation period&mdash;asking for nominations for men and women to chair the new NHS ambulance trusts. The question arises&mdash;was not the decision therefore a foregone conclusion?</p>
	<p pid="c.852.0/7">I have had a letter from Roger Moore, the chief executive of the appointments commission, in which he stated that the recruitment began</p>
	<p pid="c.852.0/8" class="indent">&quot;at the request of the Department of Health&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.852.0/9">I am pleased that concerted work by MPs across Staffordshire and by the shadow health team, supported by huge amounts of work by the people of the county, has caused Ministers to backtrack on axing Staffordshire ambulance service for up to two years. That 24-month period was set out in the handout on the Board in the Members' Lobby, but not in the statement. That is a classic fudge, as it puts Staffordshire ambulance trust in the departure lounge. However, will the Minister give the House an assurance that unless the west midlands service is brought up to the standard of Staffordshire there will be no hint of a merger, whether in two years or beyond?</p>
	<p pid="c.852.0/10">Given today's statement, any right-thinking person is entitled to regard the Government's consultation as a sham. Constant change will undermine what has already been achieved; for example, by turning round the East Anglian ambulance trust. The Buckinghamshire and Northamptonshire service is about to complete the process of splitting; now they will have to go through the upheaval of being merged again.</p>
	<p pid="c.852.0/11">We are not against the restructuring of PCTs per se&mdash;[Hon. Members: &quot;Ah.&quot;] The Under-Secretary of State for Health, the hon. Member for Bury, SouthMr. Lewis suggests that the whole statement was about PCTs; clearly he was not listening, as much of it dealt with ambulance trusts. On PCTs, as distinct from ambulance trusts, we are not opposed to restructuring, but we have always said that future functions need to be defined before such restructuring takes place.</p>
	<p pid="c.852.0/12">In 2002, the Department of Health abolished the 11 regional offices of the former NHS executive and about 100 health authorities. Today, the Government are bringing back that map. Has the Minister estimated the cost of that U-turn, which takes us back to the position four years ago? He may talk of the Secretary of State's clear commitment in October 2005 about the functions of PCTs, yet three months before that the DOH was equally clear, in &quot;Commissioning a patient-led NHS&quot;, when it called for PCTs to become</p>
	<p pid="c.852.0/13" class="indent">&quot;patient-led and commissioning-led organisations with their role in provision reduced to a minimum&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.852.0/14">by 2008. The Secretary of State backtracked on that commitment, without reassessing whether the proposed structures would be fit for purpose. Now, no one is clear.</p>
	<p pid="c.852.0/15">As the Health Committee said in January, when it attacked the Government's indecision,</p>
	<p pid="c.852.0/16" class="indent">&quot;we are appalled at the continuing lack of clarity about whether or not PCTs will eventually divest themselves of provider functions.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.852.0/17">The Department of Health's NHS operating framework for 2006-07, published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-26">26 January</phrase>, offered little further clarity, stating:</p>
	<p pid="c.852.0/18" class="indent">&quot;Where PCTs do continue to provide services, they will need to put in place clear governance procedures that ensure that there is no undue influence from the provider side on commissioning decisions.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.852.0/19">Will the Minister detail how 15 per cent. management cost savings can be made when the Government are calling for each PCT to have two sets of managers&mdash;one for commissioning and one for direct services?</p>
	<p pid="c.852.0/20">The problem for the Minister is that all this restructuring has gone on without putting in place the necessary precondition for its having a realistic chance of success: defining the future functions of PCTs. Will the Minister tell us how many PCTs are predicted to be direct providers of services in two years' time? New organisations can hardly be expected to deliver unless and until they have clarity of purpose.</p>
	<p pid="c.852.0/21">In his statement the Minister said that in some cases the new proposals differ from those suggested by the strategic health authorities and the external panel. Will he tell the House how many PCTs the expert panel proposed should be created overall; and will he publish in full the panel's advice so that we can see to what extent the Government arrived at different decisions and the implications of the variations?</p>
	<p pid="c.852.0/22">The Government seem only now to be waking up to the cost of the reconfiguration and the redundancies that go with it. Can the Minister confirm that the estimated cost of this latest round of NHS reconfiguration, which will merely take us back to where we were four years ago, will be &pound;320 million? Will he also confirm that at &pound;250 million&mdash;the figure he gave in his statement&mdash;the savings will be less than the cost? Is he confident even of that amount, or was the Health Committee right when it said that savings of between &pound;60 million and &pound;135 million were nearer the mark? Are those estimates gross or net, given the cost of the redundancies that will be inevitable to deliver on that Government promise?</p>
	<p pid="c.852.0/23">What is the time scale? The House is entitled to have that crucial information in a year when the Government's financial control of, and credibility with, the NHS is shot to pieces and the NHS is in confusion and plunged into at least 10 months of uncertainty and chaos at PCT level. This is no way to run an NHS.</p>

	<p pid="c.867.1/1">On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, of which I have given you notice. What can you do to help us to restore the reputations of our constituents once they have been badly maligned in this House? I give you the example of a debate on the Child Support Agency on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-17">17 January</phrase>, when <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1982" name="John Barrett">the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (John Barrett)</phrase> referred to my constituent, a Miss Eva Peterson, as a Russian internet bride. He then went on to catalogue the failures of her partner for failing to provide for the child of a constituent of his. Miss Peterson is as far from being a Russian internet bride as it is possible to be. She is a professional woman, a PhD and a former mayor of a major city in Russia. The Petersons are also subject to a campaign of harassment from the hon. Gentleman's constituent, which has resulted in a court order barring her from making further contact. What can you do, Mr. Speaker, to help us to restore that reputation; and is it not a convention of this House that if our constituents are going to be criticised by an hon. Member we should be informed in advance?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-05-16c.872.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1588" speakername="Mark Harper" colnum="872"  time="016:43:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060516/debtext/60516-0007.htm#06051680000090">
	<p pid="c.872.2/1">New clause 2 aims to inject a shot of transparency into the Bill. It provides for a report on the operation of the Act. It follows recommendation 2 of the Regulatory Reform Committee's report on the Bill, which stated</p>
	<p pid="c.872.2/2" class="indent">&quot;We reaffirm the recommendation of our predecessor Committee that Departments should be assessed on their progress in removing unnecessary regulations and controls and not simply on their progress in simplifying measures. We recommend accordingly.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.872.2/3">Transparency is something on which we all agree. Allowing the greatest possible visibility for a process encourages good government and sound decision making; allowing decisions to be made behind closed doors in Whitehall has the potential, as we all know, to have the opposite effect. Deregulation and better regulation are such important agendas that we must shine the light of scrutiny into the dark recesses of departmental decision making.</p>
	<p pid="c.872.2/4">In the Committee debates, in which I participated, the Minister was very proud of the Government's agenda. He said on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-02">2 March</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="c.872.2/5" class="indent">&quot;As a Government, we have committed ourselves to one of the most radical regulatory reform packages anywhere in the world&quot;.&mdash;[<i> Official Report, Standing Committee A, </i><phrase class="date" code="2006-03-02">2 March 2006</phrase>; c. 125.]</p>
	<p pid="c.872.2/6">and he specifically talked about the culture change that he wished to inculcate in Whitehall. It seems to me that the best way of doing that is to ensure that as much light as possible is shone on the measures in the Act in respect of reducing regulations and burdens on business.</p>
	<p pid="c.872.2/7">The Regulatory Reform Committee suggested that one of the key reasons why the regulatory reform orders introduced under the Regulatory Reform Act 2001 had been far from successful was the lack of political will within Whitehall. The Committee claimed that low political importance was attached by Ministers and civil servants to propose areas ripe for regulatory reform as compared with bringing new legislation before the House. As the Minister acknowledged in Committee, a culture change in Whitehall is necessary and it should not be viewed as preferable for civil servants and Ministers to pin their careers on creating regulations and legislation rather than tidying up existing rules and scrapping obsolete or disproportionate burdens. Indeed, the latter is of far greater benefit to business than the former.</p>
	<p pid="c.872.2/8">The new clause would help to bring about the necessary culture change. It would require the Secretary of State to publish an annual report and lay it before Parliament, which would provide the opportunity for the House to debate what Ministers would view as the Government's success in reducing burdens. The report would detail what orders had been made and to what effect; what burdens had been removed, what simplified and what other progress had been made. The Government would therefore have to set out in stark detail exactly how deregulatory or regulatory they have been. That should provide a strong incentive for Ministers to encourage and prioritise measures that deregulate and reduce burdens on business, rather than the opposite, which seems the case at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="c.872.2/9">I shall deal now with new clauses 7 and 24. New clause 7 is effectively a sunset clause, which suggests sunsetting the Bill after five years. We make too little use of post-legislative scrutiny in the House and in this country, although we are getting better at employing pre-legislative scrutiny. The new clause would represent an important step forward in allowing Parliament and interest groups to input into legislation before it is finalised. We do not do enough to monitor the effectiveness of laws after they are on the statute book. A sunset clause is one form of post-legislative scrutiny; it is clearly not desirable for all legislation to include it because the increased work load on Parliament would be prohibitive. In certain cases, however, there is a clear argument for having sunset clauses, particularly for important and controversial legislation. Control orders immediately spring to mind. Sunset clauses can allow Parliament to look again at legislation and see if it wants to bring it back into force.</p>
	<p pid="c.872.2/10">As an alternative, new clause 24 is not a sunset clause, but a renewal clause, providing a separate option for increasing post-legislative scrutiny of the Bill and the Government may find it more amenable. Under the new clause, part 1 of the Bill, the most important part, must be brought before Parliament for reapproval or rejection at least every two years.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-05-16c.892.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1649" speakername="Jonathan Djanogly" colnum="892"  time="017:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060516/debtext/60516-0009.htm#06051691001236">
	<p pid="c.892.0/1">This important group of amendments seeks to introduce similar changes to clauses 14, 15 and 16, which outline the procedure that would apply when an order is to be made under the negative resolution procedure, the affirmative resolution procedure or the super-affirmative resolution procedure. One of our long-held criticisms of the Bill is that it lacks adequate safeguards for the use of its fast-track order-making powers, which many people believe will abolish our constitutional longstops. The Bill has widely become known as the &quot;abolition of Parliament Bill&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.892.0/2">We supported the Government's amendments to part 1 of the Bill yesterday, following their stated intention that the Bill would deal only with deregulation. However, we made it clear that our overall support would depend on the introduction of further safeguards. The introduction of a procedural veto to the Bill, which would be exercised either by the Houses of Parliament or by Select Committees, was one of the primary mechanisms recommended by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1632" name="Oliver Heald">my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald)</phrase> and me on Second Reading, as a means of introducing such safeguards.</p>
	<p pid="c.892.0/3">For that reason, an amendment to clause 16 was tabled in Committee. It would have required an order to have been withdrawn or amended if an amendment to the order had been agreed by one or both of the Houses of Parliament or by the relevant Committees of either House. The amendment would have granted Parliament the power to insist on amendments to the order which, if not accepted by the Minister, would have to be withdrawn. The Minister would then have to start the process all over again.</p>
	<p pid="c.892.0/4">The Conservatives were, admittedly, far from being the only ones calling for a parliamentary veto on the use of the procedures in the Bill. The Liberal Democrats have done the same, and I noted with interest the reports of the Regulatory Reform and Public Administration Committees, among whose recommendations was a call for an amendment to the Bill to provide scope for an effective veto.</p>
	<p pid="c.892.0/5">Our support for the insertion of the procedural veto into the Bill meant that we welcomed the then Minister's announcement in Committee&mdash;I see him in his place today&mdash;that he would introduce a parliamentary veto on the use of the procedure. The Conservative party welcomes the Government's amendments on the statutory veto as a significant step in the right direction. It is accepted in most quarters that the Bill requires adequate safeguards so that it is not used in future as a tool for the Executive to abuse their power and discard Parliament. The amendments are meant to carry through the Government's pledge to build in a veto over an order for the relevant Committees of both Houses of Parliament. However, the amendments fall far short of introducing the robust and firm veto that we would expect to see inserted in such an important and constitutionally significant Bill.</p>
	<p pid="c.892.0/6">Our concerns were heightened when we read the wording of the amendments. The Minister needs to explain exactly what the amendments entail. A Select Committee of either House may recommend that the relevant draft order should not be proceeded with. That recommendation, however, can be discarded if it is rejected by a resolution of the relevant House. Furthermore, when making such a recommendation, the Committee must have considered a range of factors, including those listed in clause 3. Our primary concern is that the conditions imposed on the relevant Committee, by which it is able to exercise such a veto, are excessive.</p>
	<p pid="c.892.0/7">The primary difference between the Government's amendments and the amendment tabled by Conservative Members in Committee and now in new clause 5 is that the Government's proposals allow for the veto to be exercised only by a Select Committee, whereas our proposals allow for a veto by either the Committee or the Houses of Parliament. I note that the Procedure Committee, which recently produced an insightful report on the Bill, recommended that the power of veto should be exercised</p>
	<p pid="c.892.0/8" class="indent">&quot;outside the Committee as well as within it&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.892.0/9">While the Government's amendments allow both Houses to become involved in the process, they do not contain an automatic right of veto. If either House is unhappy with an order, it cannot veto it until a Committee has acted. The Procedure Committee's report noted that there was no need for the Bill to include a power of veto exercised beyond the Committee. It recommended that the mechanism by which the House of Commons exercised the veto should rest on House of Commons procedure. Is the Government's failure to empower Parliament by including an automatic veto in the Bill a result of that recommendation? If so, what steps will be taken to amend the House's procedure to ensure that it possesses a veto and that the mechanics are fully in place? More urgently, why will the Government not accept that this is a matter of great concern to Opposition parties and other Members who have voiced concerns and deal with the matter now, setting out the balances and stating the powers in the Bill?</p>
	<p pid="c.892.0/10">While the Opposition are concerned about the lack of a parliamentary veto under the Government's amendments, we are also concerned that a Committee could have its veto overridden by a resolution of the relevant House. According to the wording of the Government's amendments, the veto of a Select Committee, which the Cabinet Office proudly proclaimed in its press release on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-04">4 May</phrase>, is effectively nothing more than a recommendation. The difference between a veto and a recommendation is obvious and needs no further explanation. Were a Commons Committee to recommend that no further proceedings were to take place, is it not likely that the Government would simply use their majority in the House to overrule it? Would not that negate completely the introduction of the veto?</p>
	<p pid="c.892.0/11">If the Government have their way on this set of provisions, how will Parliament be able to ensure that the more contentious issues are dealt with in the Lords, where the veto is not capable of being vetoed by majority party votes?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-05-16c.899.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1569" speakername="Andrew Miller" colnum="899"  time="018:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060516/debtext/60516-0010.htm#06051691001257">
	<p pid="c.899.0/1">I think this is the first time, Madam Deputy Speaker, that you have had to listen to our long and complicated debates on the Bill, so welcome to the Chair. To make it even more complicated, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1649" name="Jonathan Djanogly">the hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly)</phrase> was speaking, my glasses fell apart, so I shall have to ask the Minister to hold my notes a little further away until my spare glasses arrive.</p>
	<p pid="c.899.0/2">Both in partnership with my fellow members of the Select Committee and subsequently in exploring practical ways forward, I have carefully considered the matter of the veto. I was certainly left with the impression, as reinforced by the Chairman of the Procedure Committee, that we were not being offered a qualified veto and I have discussed with Ministers where that would leave us. I have expressed to my hon. Friends privately and put it on the record that I am uncomfortable with the Government's amendment, so I am anxious to listen to the views of the Chairman of the Procedure Committee when he moves his amendments, particularly when I have amended his amendments further in respect of the two-year rule.</p>
	<p pid="c.899.0/3">What powers does the Minister envisage the Committee having? That is the most important issue. The Secretary of State said in a letter of <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-11">11 May</phrase>&mdash;I referred to it yesterday and confused the hon. Member for Huntingdon&mdash;that the statutory veto was not &quot;a blanket veto&quot;. There may be good technical reasons for that. I am not a lawyer, but am always prepared to listen to them. Often one has to listen to them at length; I do not want to disparage <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1794" name="Kenneth Clarke">the profession of the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe(Mr. Clarke)</phrase>, but he might be happier with a bigger Bill.</p>
	<p pid="c.899.0/4">I am more interested in the practical ways of how the House deals with its business. That issue was raised by the Liberal Democrat MP, Brian Cotter, in 2001. In the Second Reading debate on the Regulatory Reform Bill 2001, Brian Cotter, then the Liberal Democrat Member for Weston-super-Mare, asked <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1704" name="Graham Stringer">the then Minister, the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer)</phrase>, to explain what he meant about a ministerial undertaking. The undertaking given has proved to be mighty effective; only 27 orders were dealt with through the process in the last Parliament. The reason is probably that a ministerial undertaking given to the House is an absolute one.</p>
	<p pid="c.899.0/5">If the Parliamentary Private Secretary would like to pick up my glasses from over there&mdash;I have just seen them through the corner of my eye&mdash;I would be extremely grateful, especially as the next part of my speech is written in micro-dot. What a wonderful service we get here. That's better, I can read my notes now. The ministerial undertaking given is, I think, a very powerful vehicle. I would like to establish clearly and unambiguously with the Minister whether he is prepared today to restate that ministerial undertaking. I cite what the then Minister said when he gave it:</p>
	<p pid="c.899.0/6" class="indent">&quot;First, I am happy to confirm that the order-making power will not be used for large and controversial measures&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="c.899.0/7">we have already debated that.</p>
	<p pid="c.899.0/8" class="indent">&quot;Secondly, the Government would not proceed with an order against the Committee's wishes.&quot;&mdash;[<i> Official Report, </i><phrase class="date" code="2001-03-19">19 March 2001</phrase>; Vol. 365, c. 117.]</p>
	<p pid="c.899.0/9">No qualifications there; it was said clearly that the Government would not proceed against the wishes of the Committee. If the Minister can today, irrespective of the partial statutory veto, give a similar undertaking, that would make a forceful point. As I look around at hon. Members in their places who have been or are Ministers, I know that they realise that such an undertaking would be of very considerable significance.</p>
