Thus, &pound;70 million in compensation may be paid to prisoners. With the recent case of a prisoner who was denied IVF treatment getting a &euro;5,000 award from the court through the convention, does my hon.

	<p pid="b.156.7/1">In June, Andrew Mournian was jailed for 20 weeks for battery after attacking his partner, Amanda Murphy. He had previous convictions for violence and assault. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-18">18 August</phrase>, having been released from jail, Mr. Mournian again attacked Mrs. Murphy, but this time he brutally murdered her. He was convicted last week. It now transpires that Mr. Mournian had been released early from prison under the Government's end of custody licence scheme, and he killed Mrs. Murphy five days later, when he should have been behind bars. What does the Secretary of State have to say to Mrs. Murphy's relatives about the Government's decision to release such offenders early?</p>

	<p pid="b.182.1/1">My hon. Friend will know from the exchanges we had in the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs that there are good grounds for looking again at the way in which the period between 19 and <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-21">21 June</phrase> brought into sharp relief the choice faced by the Government and subsequently the House. That is the point at which the bilateral discussions that had been happening were consolidated into a single text. We have had exchanges about that in the Committee. She is right to say that the House will face the question of whether it should pass the treaty in the new year. If the House does not do so, or if the treaty is rejected elsewhere in Europe, it would not come into force.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-12-11b.185.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1826" speakername="David Miliband" colnum="185"  time="016:43:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071211/debtext/71211-0007.htm#07121141000586">
	<p pid="b.185.2/1">I strongly agree with my hon. Friend. Carla del Ponte made a presentation to the European Foreign Ministers in October. Of the 36&mdash;I think&mdash;indictees, 32 have been returned, and it is very important that the last four should be returned as well. It is also important to recognise that the Serbian Government have now put up $1 million as a reward. It is perhaps a little late in the day, but the reward is now there, and we now need to see 100 per cent. conclusion to the process, with all the indictees being returned.</p>
	<p pid="b.185.2/2">Let me briefly rehearse the position that the UK Government will take over the months ahead. First, resolution 1244 provides a legal base for international activity, and the decision by NATO Foreign Ministers on Friday to confirm the presence of KFOR is vital in that regard. Secondly, the Ahtisaari proposal for supervised independence continues to provide the best basis for moving forward in the absence of agreement between the parties. Thirdly, the EU needs to take responsibility for the problem in its own backyard. Inaction means something worse than continued limbo; it means a festering problem that will become dangerous if there is no way forward. Fourthly, there needs to be a European security and defence policy mission working in close co-ordination with NATO forces. Fifthly, there needs to be the significant outreach that I have described, to the Serbs in Kosovo, to guarantee their rights, and to Serbia. That position can command consensus in the EU in the months ahead.</p>
	<p pid="b.185.2/3">The second major foreign policy issue for discussion on Friday will be Iran. I hope that there is consensus across the House on that issue. Iran has every right to be a proud, respected member of the international community; it does not have a right to set off a nuclear weapons race in the middle east. Last week's US national intelligence estimate&mdash;the NIE&mdash;judged that Iran had a nuclear weapons programme up until 2003, when it halted one aspect of it. If true, that is good.</p>
	<p pid="b.185.2/4">However, the report does not answer the questions of the international community, which have been expressed in successive UN Security Council resolutions, about Iran's activities and intentions. That is why it is so important for Iran to come clean on its past activities, including on the nature of any weaponisation programme, past or present, that would be a serious breach of the non-proliferation treaty.</p>
	<p pid="b.185.2/5">The facts remain stark. Despite demands from the International Atomic Energy Agency and the UN Security Council, Iran is still pursuing an enrichment programme that has no apparent civilian application, but which could produce fissile material for a nuclear weapon. Iran is still denying the IAEA inspectors sufficient access to enable them to verify whether the nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes. The head of the IAEA, Dr. el-Baradei, whom I shall meet on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-07">7 January</phrase>, has said that the IAEA's knowledge of Iran's nuclear programme is actually diminishing. Dr. Solana has reported on behalf of the E3 plus 3 that his talks with Iran's nuclear negotiator failed to produce a positive outcome. As a result, we will be pressing for further action in the UN Security Council.</p>
	<p pid="b.185.2/6">At the same time it is vital that the European Council should send a clear and unambiguous message to the regime in Tehran that it has a choice. Either it can co-operate with the IAEA and comply with the demands of the UN Security Council, paving the way for a genuine transformation of its relationship with the whole international community, including the US, or it can continue on its path of confrontation, resulting in further sanctions and isolation.</p>

Under pressure from the Committee it was later confirmed&mdash;this Foreign Secretary has confirmed it&mdash;that the Sherpas did meet on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-24">24 January</phrase>, <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-02">2 May</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-15">15 May</phrase>. The right hon. Lady was clearly trying to avoid any questioning about what might have been discussed at those meetings.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-12-11b.197.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1782" speakername="William Hague" colnum="197"  time="017:23:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071211/debtext/71211-0009.htm#07121148000154">
	<p pid="b.197.2/1">I was going to cite that very passage from that report. It is marvellous of my hon. Friend to provide the service of reading out parts of my speech before I have arrived at them.<i> </i><i> [Interruption.]</i> It is also quite unusual.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/2">That is not the only example of such treatment of Parliament. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-25">25 June</phrase>, when the former Prime Minister came back to sell the treaty in his last two days in office, he managed some remarkably selective quoting. Reading from the protocol on the charter of fundamental rights, to show&mdash;as he hoped&mdash;that there would be no effect on British law, he actually missed out the words &quot;Title IV&quot; from an otherwise verbatim passage, so as not to betray the fact that the Government's clarification on the charter, whatever that may turn out to be worth, can apply in only one of the areas that it covers.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/3">The Foreign Secretary himself has set a doubtful example in such matters by refusing to list, in response to my written questions, the areas in which the constitution and the reform treaty are exactly the same&mdash;even though other authorities have been willing to do so&mdash;presumably because he does not want to concede with his own pen what is a fact: that vast tracts of the constitution have been incorporated as they stood into the reform treaty.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/4">The Foreign Secretary is not wrong about everything. He said on BBC &quot;Question Time&quot; on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-08">8 February</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/5" class="indent">&quot;I predict that when I come back on this programme...people will be saying, 'Wouldn't it be great to have that Blair back because we can't stand Gordon Brown?'&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/6">That does make him one of the most far-sighted forecasters in British politics in 2007. The Prime Minister has just spent days dithering over whether to go to the signing ceremony in Lisbon, finally arriving at the bold move of attending the signing but not the photograph. It is no wonder that the Foreign Secretary formed that early opinion of the Prime Minister.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/7">On the Government's approach to frank discussion of the treaty, the Foreign Secretary and his predecessor were at fault. I shall not quote again <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1844" name="William Cash">the passage that my hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Mr. Cash)</phrase> has already quoted, but I believe it to be true. Even now it is unclear just how much debate there will be in the House of this far-ranging treaty. Ministers have told the press that there will be 20 days of debate, although it would not be difficult to fill far more than that. However, they have not so far been forthcoming on the matter in the House and we look forward to hearing how many days of debate there will be.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/8">The treaty will bring about a profound change in the EU's structures and powers, with major consequences for Britain. One way to illustrate to the House the scale of what is proposed is to look at the wide range of proposals in the treaty to which the Government were themselves opposed in recent years, and even in recent months. As recently as June this year, the Government argued that the high representative or Foreign Minister should not be able to chair the regular meetings of Foreign Ministers or take over the resources of the European Commissioner responsible for external affairs, but both of those things are to happen.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-12-11b.205.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1999" speakername="Michael Connarty" colnum="205"  time="018:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071211/debtext/71211-0011.htm#07121153000075">
	<p pid="b.205.2/1">In one way I am disappointed that we are having another general debate on European affairs and not being given a full debate on the reform treaty. I believe that there is a technical term for this&mdash;it is not one that I knew before I came to Parliament&mdash;and that is &quot;frit&quot;. The Government are frit to have a debate on the issue that really is at this moment at the heart of Europe. We have a term for it in Scotland, which the Minister for Europe will recognise, and that is &quot;feart&quot;. I cannot understand why the Government are in that position: it is clear that a reform treaty debate would have allowed the Government and people such as myself who have looked at the treaty to talk about its contents and structure, but again to argue on the front foot for a European treaty that takes us where that treaty will take us. We could agree on what the treaty will do, and still debate whether it is a good or a bad thing. But in the context of a general debate on European affairs, it becomes somewhat lost.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.2/2">However, at least we are having a debate on European affairs, and I make no apology to the House for raising an issue that is not the reform treaty as my first point today. We should have debates such as this on general matters going to the European Council, but we should also have had a formal debate, as the Lords were brave enough to do on the reform treaty.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.2/3">The issue that I wish to raise first is the working time directive and the temporary agency workers directive, which will be reported to the European Council as a failure. This was a chance for the working people of Europe to see advances in their terms and conditions of employment and for protection to be brought in for the poorest and most exploited workers in Europe. In my analysis as a Labour party member, the UK Government are found wanting on the working time directive. We did not want the abolition of the opt-out after three years, as originally proposed, and we did not want to have an absolute cap on the working week of 55 hours, but negotiations broke down in 2006. The matter came back to the Portuguese presidency on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-05">5 December</phrase> with the proposal that there be no expiry date for the opt-out, which would have been beneficial to the Government and possibly to the Opposition, who have not been to the fore defending workers' rights either when they were in government or in opposition. But there would be an absolute cap on the working week of 60 hours, which is a long week for anyone to work, but is a regular working period for many in the poorest sections of our community, in the hospitality industry and elsewhere in Britain. So there was no agreement on that, and that is disappointing.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.2/4">With regard to the temporary agency workers directive, the Lisbon agenda said that there would be freedom and liberalisation of the markets and in the private sector, and there would also be liberalisation of labour markets. We have exploited that and used it to our advantage, and we have low unemployment because of it. The problem, however, is that people who work in agencies, not just under gangmasters but for any agency, find that they do not have the same terms and conditions of employment as people working alongside them. The worst example is in the telecoms industry, where members of the union of which I am the secretary in the House&mdash;although not a member of because I took that interest on from my predecessor who was a postman&mdash;tells me that people from agencies working alongside its members in call centres have not had a pay rise in five years, whereas those who work on a proper contract with an employer, whether it be an agency, BT or other call centre organisations, have regularly negotiated wage rises and all the other benefits that come with that.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.2/5">There was a proposal that we should bring the measure in for everyone, and we have seen the negative effect of not doing so. We have seen people coming by invitation, particularly from the A8 countries, to join our work force, and being offered agency work status, and then British workers being told that if they wished to work in a certain place of employment they would be made redundant but could then join the agency under the same terms and conditions of employment as those people coming into the country, without the benefits of organised trade unions. Winston Churchill said that without the minimum wage bad employers undermine good employers, and the worst employers undermine the bad employers. That is what is happening in this country at the moment because we do not have the temporary agency workers directive.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-12-11b.210.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1999" speakername="Michael Connarty" colnum="210"  time="018:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071211/debtext/71211-0012.htm#07121153000085">
	<p pid="b.210.5/1">The fluidity of the British constitution is such that what appears to be a system of persuasion and cajoling can be more effective than the concept of mandating. Governments find ways to get round the mandate; we have seen that on a number of occasions in those rigid forums.</p>
	<p pid="b.210.5/2">Mandating is attractive to people when they are out of office. I cannot imagine having a telephone conversation with a Minister of another party asking me, &quot;Is it all right if we agree this?&quot; It is difficult enough to get the ear of my own party; getting the ear of an opposing party might be even more difficult.</p>
	<p pid="b.210.5/3">Let me add the final analysis of the European Parliament report. It said that there would be greater effectiveness in law making and that the number of areas subject to qualified majority voting would be increased. It is clear about that. It said that having a two and a half year standing President would give more coherence, and I agree. It said that there would be a reduction in the number of Commission members; I hope that everyone would agree with that. It also said that the EU would be able to act as one in external relations and that the pillar structure would be abandoned. That abandonment leads to some of our deep concerns about civil and criminal justice.</p>
	<p pid="b.210.5/4">I turn now to the fundamental issues. I hope that people will read what we have said in our reports. As I believe that we have shown in the annex to our 35th report, every provision of the constitutional treaty, apart from the flags, mottos and anthems, is to be found in the reform treaty. We think that they are fundamentally the same, and the Government have not produced a table to contradict our position.</p>
	<p pid="b.210.5/5">The next issue is that of opting in and additional votes. The concept of the opt-in that we have is an odd trap that the Government have set for themselves. When I asked the previous Prime Minister at the Liaison Committee what the four red lines were, and what we would have to do so that we did not have to have a referendum, he referred to the protection of the UK's labour and social legislation and so on, but he used the words</p>
	<p pid="b.210.5/6" class="indent">&quot;the control of the UK's civil and criminal legal system&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.210.5/7">the common-law system of police and judicial processes. The White Paper responding to the Commission's report on the intergovernmental conference changed that to:</p>
	<p pid="b.210.5/8" class="indent">&quot;Protection of the UK's common law system and the police and judicial process&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.210.5/9">It is much more difficult to protect than to control. If we are controlling, all we need to do is to say, &quot;We've got control of it; we'll give it up tomorrow, or the day after.&quot; If we are protecting, we are saying that we do not give it up&mdash;that we do not move away from the position that we have at the moment whereby we have opted in, as the Foreign Secretary said in evidence to us, to 70 or 80 areas. We still have final jurisdiction over how the system is applied in the British courts. It is not controlled by the final jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice and the Commission, which can take infraction against any country that does not apply ECJ decisions.</p>
	<p pid="b.210.5/10">In the annex to our third report of Session 2007-08&mdash;wonderful things, these annexes&mdash;we list all the areas that we have already opted into that we were not in originally but we have gradually opted into, but only on condition that our courts will finally judge how they will be applied. We are told in article 10 of protocol 10 that over five years there are 70 or 80 areas&mdash;I do not know whether they will all be put together in a bundle&mdash;where we will have to make a decision whether to give up the right of the British courts to judge these matters, and opt into them when they are changed into what is now called the Community method&mdash;qualified majority voting.</p>
	<p pid="b.210.5/11">That is a worry that the Government have never clarified. How will it be done? Will some Minister send an explanatory memorandum to our Committee buried in lots of other EMs from the Council, with possibly a debate&mdash;or 70 or 80 debates&mdash;in a European Standing Committee, or will the Government simply go and agree it and then tell us, &quot;Sorry, we've done it&mdash;we've probably broken the scrutiny reserve but we can't do anything about it because it's all signed up to now&quot;? I have to say that that does not happen as much now as it used to&mdash;the Government are getting better about it.</p>
	<p pid="b.210.5/12">It is a real worry for us that that process has not been clarified. I asked the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary, but we did not get a clear response. Will it be included in the EU reform treaty Bill so that we can decide in Parliament what the procedure would be? The Government are duty bound to give us that right. Every time they want to give up protecting the civil and criminal justice system, as they put it, they must present it to this House. Sometimes I might say that I would like to stay in an area that we have opted into&mdash;for example, the European arrest warrant, which worked very well when we got back, within three or four days, one of the people who perpetrated the <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-07">7 July</phrase> bombing.</p>
	<p pid="b.210.5/13">We have got such people back because we did not have to go through the old process of looking for people to repatriate them to their own countries. That was a very good thing. In that case, we could argue that we should stay in and take the consequences. ECJ jurisdiction will apply, and if anyone breaks that, the Commission will decide to take infraction against them. On other issues, we might decide that we want them to remain within the jurisdiction of the British courts. As we showed, that is also a consequence of articles 62 to 69, which are all new areas that we can choose to opt into. That also applies to every amendment. There have been amendments to previous agreements, and we have had the right to choose whether to opt into them. There are consequences if we do not opt into them&mdash;mainly that we have to walk away from the agreement altogether.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-12-11b.223.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1411" speakername="Gisela Stuart" colnum="223"  time="019:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071211/debtext/71211-0014.htm#07121165000035">
	<p pid="b.223.4/1">Indeed. Let me return to the treaty. I ask the House to bear with me for a few moments, because one problem with most of these debates is that we do not pick up one issue and think it through logically to its conclusion. We tend to switch from institutions to policies and to make one case by using the other argument.</p>
	<p pid="b.223.4/2">I want to remind everybody of the difference between EFTA, the European Free Trade Association, and the EEC, the European Economic Community. EFTA was a free trading area&mdash;something for which I think the Conservatives still hanker. The EEC, as it then was, introduced the freedom of movement of labour, which was very important, because the minute that people are moved between countries, the mechanisms are created that will eventually lead to deeper political integration.</p>
	<p pid="b.223.4/3">The original institutions of the then EEC&mdash;the legal mechanisms of directives, the European Court of Justice, which had a mandate for achieving deeper political integration, judicial interventions or qualified majority voting, which came in later&mdash;have led to an EU with a range of tools, all of which were designed in one way or another to further political integration. The argument about the use of QMV, for example, is always, &quot;We cannot hold up progress by allowing Malta to stop us.&quot; I am afraid that if we are to have a union of nation states, there will be issues on which one member can say no. The minute we remove that right, we become federal states. If that is what people want, that is fine. I am one of those few people who are utterly agnostic about that because, having spent half my life in a federal state, I do not mind what people want, I just think that they need to know what they are getting, and it is no good pretending otherwise.</p>
	<p pid="b.223.4/4">The UK likes QMV occasionally, but I want to draw attention to something very different, because not only was the movement of labour significant, but there was another tool&mdash;the internal market. Although the rest of Europe, by and large, always prayed the internal market in aid of deeper political integration and was little concerned with whether it was fulfilled or not, Britain always liked the internal market as an end in itself rather than a tool. We were therefore much more focused on that notion, but those are the type of tools that the Germans put on the negotiating table that cause us a problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.223.4/5">The next problem is the time span during which things happen. The working time directive began to be debated in the early 1990s, but did not start to cause us political problems in this country until 18 years later when we realised that allowing the training of junior doctors to comply with the directive meant that many of our increased number of doctors were used up. As for the voters, they could no longer hold anybody responsible because they had all gone from office. People said, &quot;The pass has been sold.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.223.4/6">At this point, I want to consider something that is currently on the table. When I became a Health Minister in 1999, one of the first things that I had to do was to go to Europe&mdash;I was the foreigner on the team, so they said, &quot;She can do abroad.&quot; There was a Health Ministers' lunch, at which we all got together. A junior official came up and said, &quot;There's a case which you may want to raise over lunch. It does not really bother anybody apart from us, but the Dutch are sympathetic to us.&quot; The case was called Kohll <i> v.</i> Decker and it related to a Luxembourg national who went to Germany for dental treatment, and it was asked whether that was part of the internal market.</p>
	<p pid="b.223.4/7">I remember that the position taken at that lunch was quite eccentric. Only the Dutch Health Minister, who had been around for a long time, realised that there might be a problem, but the case was seen as a peculiarly British obsession. At that stage, we were waiting for another court ruling on the costs related to that case. To argue that, three or four court rulings down the road, we would have a problem with running the national health service, because we were the only country whose health system was completely funded by taxation and based on residency, with no controls&mdash;unlike other countries&mdash;was seen as the product of an eccentric lawyer's imagination running wild. It was argued that I did not have to worry because health was not an EU competence. Health is now becoming an EU competence, albeit only on the public health side.</p>
	<p pid="b.223.4/8">This is not a debate on the EU health directive or the court cases, but we had a succession of court cases that ended with a British case in 2006, where the ECJ pushed it to the limit and applied the internal market as a mechanism to allow people to travel from one country to another and claim health expenses without prior authorisation. We reached the point where Ministers were saying, &quot;Thus far and no further. We now want a political input.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.223.4/9">That political input is now in a draft EU directive on health, to be published, I understand, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-19">19 December</phrase>&mdash; politically, an extremely active date. I know exactly what will happen. We will get the directive and will be told not to be paranoid, as it is all perfectly all right. An early-day motion has been tabled that states that the logical conclusion of that directive is that it will undermine the way in which we run the NHS. What is so sad is that almost the only mechanism open to Members to raise that issue is an early-day motion. If we are honest, we all know the political significance of early-day motions. We might as well spray graffiti outside Big Ben&mdash;it would probably have more effect, because at least the cameras would catch it.</p>
	<p pid="b.223.4/10">If we pass the treaty, whatever it is called, we will create a situation in which, step by step, over the past 30 years&mdash;through legislation, court intervention or QMV&mdash;we will have completely recalibrated the presumption of who is in charge of legislation. This House is no longer in charge of all our legislation, so we must now find the areas in which we remain supreme. It can be argued that even matters to do with defence and foreign affairs can be circumvented. Over the decades, and step by step, the presumption as to where legislative power lies has moved away from this place. The problem with health legislation, for instance, is even worse, because that is something that we have devolved to Scotland and Wales. The result is that this House has become even less relevant.</p>
	<p pid="b.223.4/11">The British people may well be entirely content with that, but it is something that they need to think about. We need to explain what has happened, and that is why this debate is so important.</p>
	<p pid="b.223.4/12">Three things need to happen when the treaty is considered. First, given that the passerelle clause in its present state is not sufficient, the Government must make a clear commitment to bring in primary legislation, and not just to allow the House to have a vote, before there is any further erosion of our legislative power as a result of QMV. Secondly, the political parties must stop playing silly games about matters such as the new health directive&mdash;which incidentally looks suspiciously like the Tory policy on patients' rights&mdash;and be more open about what they believe.</p>
	<p pid="b.223.4/13">Thirdly, and most fundamentally, all three main political parties promised in their election manifestos that the treaty was so significant that the British people needed to be asked their opinion. If Labour, as the governing party, is so confident that the treaty represents a good deal for Britain, we should have the courage to ask the people about it, as well as subjecting it to 20-odd days debate in this House.</p>

	<p pid="b.229.1/1">The trade union position has been somewhat variable. As I said to the hon. Gentleman earlier, a European Court of Justice decision has come out today, which, I am informed, extends the right to strike. That should make the Government apprehensive. If the court is already saying that, how much will it say about the charter of fundamental rights as and when it comes up for interpretation?</p>
	<p pid="b.229.1/2">There is only one answer, which goes back to my point about intrinsic sovereignty. That is not a theoretical abstract; we are dealing with a decision about whether we legislate properly on behalf of the people whom we represent. The answer is simple: it is my &quot;notwithstanding formula&quot;. If we include in our own legislation the words &quot;notwithstanding the European Communities Act 1972&quot; as a prelude to legislation that emanates from the European Union when we enact it in this place, that would require the judiciary to obey the latest, inconsistent, expressly stated measure from Westminster. They have no option. I think that we have reached that point, and I think specifically&mdash;although I would take this on a far more general footing&mdash;with regard to the Government claiming that they do not want the charter to apply to this country in the legally binding way I have described, the fact that, according to the ESC, they cannot guarantee that leaves them with only one option: to apply the &quot;notwithstanding formula&quot; in their proposals for the Bill to make certain that it does not apply. I am deeply disappointed and disturbed by the clap-trap put forward by the Foreign Secretary in the Government's replies to the ESC report, because they know that that was not only a threadbare but a non-existent argument. This is a serious issue because the charter extends into so many areas of our national life.</p>
	<p pid="b.229.1/3">I said at the beginning of my speech that I think this treaty is more important than Maastricht. Why do I believe that? I believe it because although Maastricht was about the shift to European government&mdash;that is why I opposed the treaty, causing some pain and concern to some, or most, of my colleagues&mdash;since then there has been an accumulation of other functions, which have been all-pervasive in that they have gone into almost every other field. Members might or might not know about the so-called doctrine of the occupied field. I do not wish to explain it in detail other than to say that according to that doctrine if the EU has been granted competence in a particular field, a country could not legislate in its own Parliament. Furthermore, with the self-amending text point, which has already been discussed, the reality is that neither can it have any referendums in respect of those areas; a national Government would not be in a position to say that they were able to go to the people because they would have already made the textual changes internally within the framework of existing competences. Huge issues arise in relation to the treaty, which need to be not only carefully considered, but rejected.</p>
	<p pid="b.229.1/4">The Prime Minister has been talking about the governance of Britain and the fact that he thinks treaties should be approved by Parliament. This debate should have been on a substantive motion. The hon. Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk, Chairman of the ESC, made that point. Although the debate is taking place on the Floor of the House, it should also be subject to a vote. Not many Members are here but there are a variety of reasons for that, and I think the Government stand condemned by virtue of their failure to have a proper debate on a substantive motion before the treaty is signed.</p>
	<p pid="b.229.1/5">There have been deceitful circumstances, and also obscure and opaque circumstances, as we discovered from our cross-examination; some of them have not been entirely resolved even today. At some point between about 15 and <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-23">23 June</phrase>&mdash;I cannot be exact&mdash;things were going on. The German presidency produced papers; it bounced people, and papers emerged. There are also question marks over whether there was more discussion than was being disclosed. I simply make this point: against that background, it is fundamental to the integrity of this House that we make certain that the Government are forced into a position in which during the course of the debates that take place next year, not only do we have a referendum&mdash;that is entirely justified in the interests of the British people&mdash;but they are made to explain how it was that the poisoned chalice of the reform treaty was passed by the former Prime Minister within what appears to have been a period of approximately just one week before he gave up office and the new Prime Minister came in. I cannot believe that the new Prime Minister did not know exactly what he was taking on. Therefore, in the light of what I saw when I watched the former Prime Minister in &quot;The Blair Years&quot; on television, I was bound to conclude that in fact the incoming Prime Minister in part took on his job on an understanding that he would not disrupt the smooth passage of that poisoned chalice which he received from the outgoing Prime Minister. I think that that is the real reason we are not being given a referendum; I cannot prove it, but I believe it is the case.</p>
	<p pid="b.229.1/6">Some issues are so important to our constituents that we have to step up to the plate. I believe that this debate should have been on a substantive motion and that it should be subjected to a vote, simply as a protest and in defiance of the way in which the Government have behaved in betraying the British people and giving them a treaty they have no business inflicting on them.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-12-11b.243.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1916" speakername="David Heathcoat-Amory" colnum="243"  time="020:23:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071211/debtext/71211-0017.htm#07121181000169">
	<p pid="b.243.0/1">I am in the happy position of agreeing with most of the preceding speakers, certainly on the great question of the referendum. In particular, I agree with what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1370" name="Richard Shepherd">my hon. Friend the Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd)</phrase> said: political trust between the electors and the elected hangs by a thread, and grave damage will be done if all the political parties break the promise, so freely and so recently made, to consult the people on the question of the so-called European reform treaty. It is, of course, not a reform treaty; it was never seriously intended to reform the European Union institutions. It was intended to strengthen <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1600" name="Austin Mitchell">them. I also agree with the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell)</phrase>, who has just concluded: we are considering not simply a European constitution, but a constitution for this country, because it defines and alters the powers of the House and, by extension, the powers of the people whom we represent.</p>
	<p pid="b.243.0/2">When powers are transferred away from the House, not just our democracy, but the fundamental powers of the people, are degraded. Our democracy is not being replaced in any sense by a European democracy. There is no such thing as a supranational democracy, and it certainly does not exist in Europe. People have no sense of involvement in, or ownership of, the decisions made in their name in Brussels, and that is dangerous, particularly as issues such as criminal justice are now being involved. People assent to laws under which they may be imprisoned or fined if, in every sense, they are their laws, if they have a real and immediate opportunity to vote for or against them, and if they can talk to and consult the people who pass them. All that is absent in the European Union, and it will get worse, not better, if the treaty is passed.</p>
	<p pid="b.243.0/3">In two days' time, the Prime Minister will assent to the treaty. If he has the courage, he will sign it itself; if he lacks the courage, he will get someone else to do it for him. It is a disgrace that the motion before the House is</p>
	<p pid="b.243.0/4" class="indent">&quot;That this House has considered the matter of European affairs&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="b.243.0/5">whatever that means. We ought to be debating a substantive motion. The truth is that we have not considered the matters in any real detail. The only opportunities that the Select Committees have had has been when it is all too late, and when the decisions have all been made.</p>
	<p pid="b.243.0/6">To rewind a little, in January this year, two Sherpas were appointed by the Government. Well, they used to be called Sherpas, because they were there before a summit. I think that they are now called &quot;focal points&quot;, in the modern jargon. One was from the Foreign Office, and one was a minder from 10 Downing street. They were appointed to help the German presidency to draw up a successor to the European constitution. We know that the British Government did not like the constitutional treaty.</p>
	<p pid="b.243.0/7"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1411" name="Gisela Stuart">The hon. Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Ms Stuart)</phrase> and I spent nearly a year and a half of our lives in Brussels, working on the Convention on the Future of Europe and negotiating the constitution. I sat one seat away from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1723" name="Peter Hain">the right hon. Member for Neath (Mr. Hain)</phrase>, who was representing the Government. An unfortunate, rather bemused but charming Romanian sat between us and kept us apart, but I watched the Government representative. He tabled scores, perhaps hundreds, of amendments on behalf of the British Government, only a handful of which were ever accepted. That is on the record, and we know from that that the British Government did not like the European constitution and much of what was in it, although they accepted and signed it. However, it failed; it was turned down by the electorate of France and Holland. They are now colluding in bringing it back.</p>
	<p pid="b.243.0/8">Throughout the first half of this year, the Sherpas or focal points discussed matters with the German presidency, in order to revive the substance of the treaty while altering the terminology&mdash;those were the instructions given to member states. The Select Committees concerned tried to get information from the relevant Ministers. In an earlier intervention, I quoted from a public letter that the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs had sent, reprimanding the Foreign Office for</p>
	<p pid="b.243.0/9" class="indent">&quot;a failure of accountability to Parliament.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.243.0/10">That is a pretty serious charge. The European Scrutiny Committee, whose distinguished Chairman spoke earlier in the debate, said:</p>
	<p pid="b.243.0/11" class="indent">&quot;The Committee feels that despite repeated enquiries, they have encountered significant difficulty in securing any information from the Government on the proposals under consideration or any indication of what it favours and opposes.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.243.0/12">That is an outrage. For six months we were completely unable to get at what was happening in the negotiations in our name. Much worse was to follow. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-19">19 June</phrase>, the German presidency produced a draft text of the revived treaty. Two days later, it was agreed at the European Council summit in Brussels. The Council agreed the text politically, and since then there have been no substantive amendments. It has become a little bit worse for the United Kingdom, but essentially the matter was all over at that Council meeting. For those crucial two days between 19 and <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-21">21 June</phrase>, a text was available. It went around Whitehall, although we do not know to what extent. We have asked the Government which Departments were consulted, but they have not told us. The House was completely excluded, as were the public, so the only time that we ever saw a text was after it was agreed.</p>
	<p pid="b.243.0/13">The European Council itself is a secretive organisation: minutes are not published, so we do not know who said what, what negotiations took place or what the British Government's position was. Conclusions are published, which did not just agree the German presidency's text but, remarkably&mdash;and I think that this is unprecedented&mdash;said:</p>
	<p pid="b.243.0/14" class="indent">&quot;The present mandate will provide the exclusive basis and framework for the work of the IGC&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.243.0/15">The Council did not only agree the treaty but told the subsequent intergovernmental conference to take it forward on an exclusive basis. No changes were therefore possible, as the treaty was agreed in totality.</p>
	<p pid="b.243.0/16">That 48-hour window is important, because it was the only opportunity for the House to break into the magic circle that negotiated and discussed the matters in secret before presenting a fait accompli to the Council. No public involvement was possible at all, which makes a mockery of all the promises and rhetoric about public involvement and building a people's Europe. It even contradicts what the June European Council said:</p>
	<p pid="b.243.0/17" class="indent">&quot;The European Council emphasises the crucial importance of reinforcing communication with the European citizens, providing full and comprehensive information on the European Union and involving them in a permanent dialogue.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.243.0/18">How can we involve people in permanent dialogue if we do not tell them what is going on? Even their elected representatives in Parliament were completely unable to crack that secret circle and find out what was happening.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-12-11b.245.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1916" speakername="David Heathcoat-Amory" colnum="245"  time="020:23:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071211/debtext/71211-0017.htm#07121181000171">
	<p pid="b.245.1/1">The hon. Lady makes a fair point, but she would accept that, although the Convention on the Future of Europe produced a terrible outcome, it took place in public. People could come along and find out what was happening. I agree that we must improve our scrutiny of procedures. It is extraordinary that the European Scrutiny Committee, of which I am a member, should meet in secret. We must ventilate the whole system and let light in.</p>
	<p pid="b.245.1/2">The hon. Lady would agree that there is a valid charge of hypocrisy to be made against the European Council, which proclaims the desirability&mdash;indeed it said that it is essential&mdash;of bringing the public along, consulting them and explaining what is happening, only to conduct all the discussions in secret. Now, it is all too late: the European Scrutiny Committee and the Foreign Affairs Committee are conducting inquiries, or have already done so&mdash;the ESC has produced two very good reports&mdash;but essentially we are auditing something that has already happened. The Government persisted with their crime. An English text was not available for nearly a month and a half after the June summit concluded and the House had gone into recess. Remarkably, there is still no consolidated version of the text. There is only a confusing document with cross-references, which is completely inaccessible to the public.</p>
	<p pid="b.245.1/3">At the time, we had a weak Foreign Secretary and a Foreign Office that was consistently overridden and excluded by No. 10. Someone in the Government or in the Cabinet should have tried to bring the lofty rhetoric about a people's Europe into line with what was really happening. There is another doleful consequence. Relieved of the obligation of having to explain themselves to a Parliament or to a people, the Government acceded to a text that was, and remains, completely incomprehensible. Secretive and incomprehensible behaviour is the EU's besetting sin, and instead of curing that disease, we have reinforced it.</p>
	<p pid="b.245.1/4">As for the text that was produced, it is clear from today's debate that the reform treaty&mdash;or the Lisbon treaty, as it is to be called&mdash;is not the son of the constitutional treaty but its twin, and probably its identical twin. If anyone is in the slightest doubt, I refer them to the table in the first of the two reports by the European Scrutiny Committee, which helpfully sets out all the articles in the constitutional treaty and all the articles in the reform treaty so that a comparison can be made. The Government were asked to do that, but they refused, so a Committee of the House undertook that laborious but important process. Anyone looking at that table would conclude that the reform treaty is almost identical to the constitutional treaty or, in the words of the report, &quot;equivalent&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.245.1/5">There are a few differences, for instance, on symbols. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2016" name="Mark Hunter">The hon. Member for Cheadle (Mark Hunter)</phrase>, in his truly dire contribution, advanced the proposition that it was a completely different treaty, because the symbols had been removed. He is right to the extent that the articles that mandate the stars on the flag and the anthem have been removed. However, they have been in use for 20 years, and they will not stop being used just because they are not in the Lisbon treaty.</p>
	<p pid="b.245.1/6">Also, I am glad to say, <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-09">9 May</phrase> is no longer to be the day on which happy European citizens are all to be on the streets thanking everybody for how lucky they are to be in the European Union. That has been dropped. Is it seriously the position of the Liberal Democrats that the dropping of the symbols in a treaty is such an epic event as to mean that we need not have a referendum on it now?</p>
	<p pid="b.245.1/7">As the text is identical, the only real difference is that the structure has changed. It is only in that sense that the constitutional concept is abandoned. The constitutional treaty unified the two main European treaties into a single text. The Lisbon treaty does not do so. Only in that respect can we say that the constitutional concept is abandoned. So when the Prime Minister repeats that phrase from the conclusions of the European Council, and the Liberal Democrat spokesman did it to try and strengthen his case, they are referring only to the form&mdash;the packaging&mdash;of the treaty. In substance and legal effect, the treaties are virtually the same.</p>
	<p pid="b.245.1/8">We are concerned about legal effect. The transfer of powers upwards from the House to the EU, the vast extension of majority voting, and the fact that EU goes into new areas such as criminal justice and a great deal further in foreign affairs and security&mdash;all that is the same. There are a few name changes. The Europe Minister is to be called High Representative. People impressed by names and cap badges will think that the treaty is different, but in substance, it is the same. The referendum promise that was made by the previous Prime Minister is as valid now as when he made it.</p>
	<p pid="b.245.1/9">There are a few more fantasies around. The Foreign Secretary said that national Parliaments would benefit from the treaty. That is completely untrue. National Parliaments suffer from the transfer of powers to the EU that I have described. The scrutiny powers will go. When the High Representative is conducting foreign policy on our behalf, how can the House or its Select Committees scrutinise that foreign policy? Our powers are going, and that calls into question our very democracy. What will be the point of having elections, when the people elected to the House do not control matters such as criminal justice, asylum policy or immigration policy?</p>
	<p pid="b.245.1/10">The &quot;Why vote?&quot; question becomes virtually unanswerable. The Government are anxious to get people to vote. The Mayor of London thinks that we should all have lottery tickets instead of ballot papers to try and persuade everybody to vote. People will lose interest, not just in the House, but in general elections themselves if the issues that they are being called on to decide are decided, after a general election, not in the House but in another jurisdiction, in the European Union, over which they have only the most vestigial control.</p>
	<p pid="b.245.1/11">There is a pretence that our loss of powers is somehow offset by new abilities to question EU measures on grounds of subsidiarity. That is an illusion. We can already object to measures on grounds of subsidiarity&mdash;our Select Committees do that&mdash;and the European Commission can go on ignoring our objections, as they will be able to do under the new treaty. It is a total sham to suppose that the House has its powers strengthened in any way.</p>
	<p pid="b.245.1/12">The only remaining fig leaf is the red lines, on which the Government are increasingly trying to rely. They are supposed to salvage some powers of self-government, but the European Scrutiny Committee reports show how very flimsy these are. I shall not go into the details to show how the red lines are vulnerable. Those are available in the reports, and hon. Members should read them.</p>
	<p pid="b.245.1/13">I shall make the general point that if and when the treaty is ratified and takes effect, lined up against the Government on the question will be most other member states, the European Commission and the European Parliament, all of which strongly disapprove of the red lines. They do not like them, they will try and undermine them, they will try and erode their legal powers, and they will have an ally&mdash;the European Court of Justice. That court will be the arbiter and there is no appeal against it. The European Court is protective of European Union power.</p>
	<p pid="b.245.1/14">That was illustrated recently in an interesting case about a man called Tillack, who was a journalist working for <i> Stern</i> magazine. He reported on European Union corruption&mdash;not a difficult thing to do, given how widespread it is. Great offence was taken by OLAF, which, unbelievably, is the anti-fraud office reporting to the European Commission. It resented the work done by the journalist, so it reported him to the Belgian police and asked them to raid his home and office in order to try to get at his sources. That was done and they took away his papers and his computer, which they refused to give back. Eventually, the European convention on human rights was invoked and the Strasbourg Court found for the journalist, compensated him financially and awarded him costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.245.1/15">What is significant is that the European Court of Justice, which looked into the matter earlier, did absolutely nothing to support the rights of the journalist. It found against him because it has a vocation to support the powers and privileges of the EU. That is reinforced by the new treaty. Again, I am staggered that the Government did not mind about that. Article 9 of the new treaty says:</p>
	<p pid="b.245.1/16" class="indent">&quot;The institutions shall practise mutual sincere co-operation&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="b.245.1/17">and it lists the institutions. They include the European Council, the European Parliament, the European Commission and the European Court of Justice. So, in future, when another Member State or the Commission tries to undermine our red lines, we will be up against a Court that is enjoined by treaty law to practise sincere mutual co-operation with an institution that is trying to undermine our powers. It is not an independent body in that sense and the Government never raised any objections.</p>
	<p pid="b.245.1/18">The whole process of so-called reform started in December 2001 with the Laeken declaration when Heads of Government meeting at Laeken realised that the game was up for the old Europe. People were rejecting it in referendums, turnout in European Parliament elections was declining and there was a general feeling of malaise. So it instructed Europe to democratise and it set up the Convention on the Future of Europe with a mission to simplify and bring Europe &quot;closer to its citizens&quot;&mdash;that was the phrase used.</p>
	<p pid="b.245.1/19">I have mentioned how I and the hon. Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston had the honour to represent the House in those negotiations, and they failed. They produced a constitution that was turned down. I predicted that and it came as no surprise to me. But we have now resurrected the same legal powers and given the outcome another name, and it deserves to be rejected again. The instructions given to the process in the Laeken declaration were not just ignored, they were contradicted. We have not simplified, we have made matters more complicated. We have not made Europe democratic, we have made it less democratic. We have not brought it closer to the citizens, we have taken decisions further from the citizens. More powers are taken away from the citizens and their national Parliaments and are to be decided further away in the EU over more areas of policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.245.1/20">The only way to resolve this is by referendum. With respect to some of the remarks made&mdash;indeed by the Chairman of my Committee&mdash;this is not simply a policy matter. I am against government by referendum. I am glad that I do not live in Switzerland. I would spend my time going down to the polling station to vote on everything and I do not believe in that. We have a representative democracy. So policy matters are fought out in Parliament. But the rules of that Parliament, and the framework in which this process takes place, must be set not by politicians but by the people. We are talking here about the rules of the game; about the powers of that Parliament. It is about who takes the decisions. Who are those people accountable to? Are they elected? Can they be removed? These are constitutional matters. They cannot be decided by Parliaments but by the people in a referendum.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-12-11b.258.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1610" speakername="Greg Hands" colnum="258"  time="021:24:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071211/debtext/71211-0019.htm#0712122000563">
	<p pid="b.258.0/1">At the beginning of the debate, the bomb that exploded in Algeria was mentioned. I want to comment on EU relations with Algeria, which I visited last year. It is a country of enormous tragedy. It does not face starvation, drought, flooding or other natural disasters, but it desperately needs our help. We cannot rely purely on France to engage with Algeria. We in Britain need to do much more.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.0/2">On the way to Algeria, I was struck by the fact that nobody was travelling economy to get there. That is a troubling phenomenon, because it means that no one is voluntarily going to that country. Business class was packed with people involved in oil, diplomacy and so on. Algeria is one of the few countries in the world that does not even have a guidebook. There is no &quot;Lonely Planet&quot; guide to Algeria, nor is there one to Iraq and one or two other countries. The position in Algeria is troubling, and I believe that we should be engaged with it.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.0/3">I wanted to discuss the EU treaty, but it has dominated the debate. Despite <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1999" name="Michael Connarty">the long speech of the hon. Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk (Michael Connarty)</phrase>, some of the dangerous sanctions that the new treaty puts on national Parliaments have not been properly drawn out. Our Parliament will have a duty to contribute actively to the good functioning of the Union. Nobody can predict accurately what that will mean in practice, but criticism by elected representatives in our Parliament of the European Commission and its decisions might be out of order. National Parliaments, unlike the European Parliament, were not creations of the treaties, and our rights do not depend on them. The new treaty proposes for the first time that national Parliaments be subservient to the Union.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.0/4">I had an interesting exchange with the Foreign Secretary at an evidence-taking sitting of the European Scrutiny Committee. I was amazed that he did not know the original French wording of the treaty and its provisions about national Parliaments. It was surprising, given that he said that he wanted to change it, that he did not know the original words. The treaty states that</p>
	<p pid="b.258.0/5" class="indent">&quot;National Parliaments contribute to the good functioning of the Union.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.258.0/6">However, the French original makes it clear that national Parliaments should contribute&mdash;and have a duty to contribute&mdash;to the functioning of the Union. The treaty also provides that national Parliaments must &quot;see to it&quot; that subsidiarity is respected.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.0/7">Our report of <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-27">27 November</phrase>, which did not get so much publicity, states that the phrase,</p>
	<p pid="b.258.0/8" class="indent">&quot;National Parliaments contribute to the good functioning of the Union&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="b.258.0/9">is one from which an obligation can be inferred. The Committee report continued:</p>
	<p pid="b.258.0/10" class="indent">&quot;Given its constitutional significance, we emphasise that this is not an area in which any ambiguity is tolerable and we shall look to the Government to ensure that its original undertakings are met in any new text.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.258.0/11">The Government have not fulfilled that undertaking&mdash;but I should be delighted to hear otherwise from the Minister for Europe in his winding-up speech.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.0/12">A few weeks ago, the European Scrutiny Committee made interesting visits to two former Yugoslav republics of approximately the same size. I refer to the size deliberately, and also to the fact that they are completely or largely landlocked. They are the republics of Slovenia and Macedonia. The contrast is incredible. Slovenia is doing well. I had last visited Ljubljana in August 1991, when there was graffiti saying, &quot;Slovenia will rise again&quot;. It was shortly after the Jugoslovenska narodna armija&mdash;JNA&mdash;had trashed most of the city. Slovenia has risen again, and is doing incredibly well. It recently overtook Portugal and Greece and it is about to overtake Spain.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.0/13">The other landlocked former Yugoslav republic of approximately 2 million people is Macedonia, which is not doing as well. It has an excellent Prime Minister, Nikola Gruevski. We also met the Deputy Minister for European Affairs, Gabriela Konevska-Trajkovska. They are impressive people, who are taking their country slowly but surely in the right direction. I believe that things will get done there.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.0/14">I have mentioned two former Yugoslav republics of 2 million people that are both doing pretty well in different ways and can stand on their own two feet, because there is a third part of the former Yugoslavia, which also has a population of 2 million and is landlocked and mountainous: Kosovo. There is no reason why Kosovo could not go it alone. I believe that it can. It has far bigger problems than Slovenia or even Macedonia, but if we believe in self-determination, we must have some principles when we approach foreign policy. If a country of that size can go it alone, we should support it.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.0/15">There are some problems in terms of guaranteeing access for Serbs, and concerning the Serbian enclaves that are left&mdash;which have been dangerously ignored by our Government and by other European Governments. We must engage a lot more there. There should, perhaps, be a plebiscite for the Serbs living in the north of the country so that they can determine their own future. We also need to guarantee access for the Serbian people to the cultural sites that they find of such value to their culture, and, as I have said, we must do something significant about the Serbian enclaves. If we can do those three things, I cannot see any real reason why we should oppose Kosovan independence. I look forward to seeing that day.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-12-11b.262.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1772" speakername="Mark Francois" colnum="262"  time="021:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071211/debtext/71211-0020.htm#0712122000570">
	<p pid="b.262.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. I believe that he intervened at least five times, if I counted correctly, on the Liberal Democrat spokesman; he persisted, in the words of Peter Mandelson, in &quot;punching the bruise&quot;. We will most certainly hold every Liberal Democrat MP to account in their constituencies for how they vote, as indeed we will hold every Labour MP to account in their constituencies for how they vote.</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/2">I believe that the Government have comprehensively lost the argument on the point that the two documents are different, but still they peddle the same sorry line to the public, the press and to their own Back Benchers, because they know that the Prime Minister's intransigence leaves them with absolutely no choice.</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/3">Under pressure, the Government fall back on their much vaunted red lines, which are largely red herrings designed principally to distract attention from what is really being given up without a referendum. However, the European Scrutiny Committee in two very detailed reports picked apart the Government's red lines. The Labour Chairman of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1999" name="Michael Connarty">the Committee, the hon. Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk (Michael Connarty)</phrase> told the BBC &quot;Today&quot; programme that the red lines would, in his words, &quot;leak like a sieve&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/4">In fact, the Government have been in constant retreat on what is really at stake with this document. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-18">18 June</phrase>, the former Foreign Secretary, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1533" name="Margaret Beckett">the right hon. Member for Derby, South (Margaret Beckett)</phrase>, stated that the reform treaty would just</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/5" class="indent">&quot;tidy up the rule book of the European Union&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/6">A week later, she admitted that</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/7" class="indent">&quot;There are some power transfers&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/8">By July, the new Minister for Europe was arguing that we should not</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/9" class="indent">&quot;sign up to any treaty that transferred in any significant way, any UK sovereignty&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/10">By October, his mantra had become</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/11" class="indent">&quot;the reform treaty will not transfer power away from the UK on issues of fundamental importance to our sovereignty.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/12">That is a massive change in public position: from a tidying-up exercise to a rearguard action to protect fundamental sovereignty, in only four months.</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/13">But there have been further retreats. The red line concerning the charter of fundamental rights is just one example. After the June summit, the former Prime Minister assured us that we had an opt-out from the charter. The following day he was contradicted by the Swedish Prime Minister, who insisted that the United Kingdom did not have an opt-out, only a clarification. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-31">31 July</phrase>, after a month of considerable confusion in the Government ranks, the Minister for Europe conceded in a letter to the European Scrutiny Committee that</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/14" class="indent">&quot;The UK specific protocol which the UK secured is not an 'opt out' from the Charter. Rather, the protocol clarifies the effect that the Charter will have in the UK.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/15">We have a clear pattern of confident assertion followed by internal confusion in the face of detailed examination followed by retreat, and we suspect that that pattern will be continued when we debate the ratification Bill in detail next year.</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/16">I expect the Minister for Europe to get to his feet in a few moments and tell us that the constitutional concept has been abandoned, and that there is therefore nothing to worry about. Perhaps he will also tell us that there is excellent data security at HM Revenue and Customs, that there is plenty of room in our prisons, and that the former Prime Minister and the current Prime Minister have always been best mates. All that would be about as honest as the Government's position on the reform treaty.</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/17">The Labour party's manifesto at the 2005 general election was very clear about the EU constitution. It said:</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/18" class="indent">&quot;We will put it to the British people in a referendum and campaign whole-heartedly for a 'Yes' vote&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/19">Given that clear pledge, the Government's position is now dishonourable at best. Ministers are being not so much economical with the truth as positively parsimonious with it.</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/20">The Government continue to tell us that the two documents are different when they know full well&mdash;the Foreign Secretary knows, the Minister for Europe knows, other Ministers know&mdash;that they are effectively the same. Even the Prime Minister has admitted as much, in a memorable Freudian slip&mdash;and that from a Prime Minister who stated that one of his key objectives was to restore &quot;trust&quot; in politics, which, as he told the BBC specifically, included honouring Labour's 2005 election manifesto. That same Prime Minister is now doing precisely the opposite, and treating the British people like fools along the way. The Prime Minister once famously told his predecessor &quot;There is nothing you could say to me now that I could possibly believe.&quot; The risk that he faces is that if he continues on this course, much the same will eventually be said of him.</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/21">I remind Ministers that three quarters of the British people want a referendum. Most of the national press want a referendum. The trade unions want a referendum: indeed, they voted for it by a margin of nine to one at the TUC conference. Many Labour MPs privately concede that there should be a referendum, and some of them have had the moral courage to voice their concerns in the Chamber today. Included on that roll of honour are the hon. Members for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Ms Stuart), for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey), for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell), for Stroud (Mr. Drew), for Glasgow, South-West (Mr. Davidson), for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins) and for Hemsworth (Jon Trickett). There are others in the Labour party who have not yet spoken out, but we believe that they are there, and their contribution could eventually be decisive.</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/22">The Government are clearly losing the argument on the EU constitution. The emperor has no clothes. All the parties promised the people who sent us to this House a referendum on the EU constitution. We say, let the promise be kept and let the people decide.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-12-11b.274.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1818" speakername="Owen Paterson" colnum="274"  time="022:18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071211/debtext/71211-0022.htm#0712125000071">
	<p pid="b.274.2/1">My hon. Friend makes a very good point, and I am most grateful to him for coming with me to see the county council. I think that we have been there three times in the past three weeks. But again, the position is worse than he said.</p>
	<p pid="b.274.2/2">Shropshire's excellent education system is facing a major crisis that is wholly avoidable. Shropshire county council is predicting significant demographic change. There is a rising population with a relatively higher concentration of older people, and there is currently a decrease in the number of children under five, and in primary education. According to the county council's figures, there will be 3,400 fewer pupils on the roll from 2001 to 2012. There are currently 2,500 unfilled primary school places, which will rise to 5,450 by 2012. That is predicted to lead to a cumulative shortfall of &pound;3.8 million by 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="b.274.2/3">The council is proposing to debate a paper on reorganising primary schools in Shropshire on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-14">Friday 14 December</phrase>. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1696" name="Philip Dunne">My hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne)</phrase> and I have discussed that, and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1946" name="Mark Pritchard">my hon. Friend the Member for The Wrekin (Mark Pritchard)</phrase> saw the council only last Thursday. I have great sympathy for the position of the council, which faces the dilemma of receiving less from central taxation than the vast majority of other authorities, while trying to deliver high-quality education in the face of current falling rolls.</p>
	<p pid="b.274.2/4">However, the fall in primary school numbers is hard to understand in the light of the extensive new building that has occurred in Shropshire recently, and the dramatic increases planned for future years. It is also worth noting that live births in Shropshire bottomed out in 2001, at 2,628, rising to 2,767 in 2005. Another factor that should be borne in mind is that women are choosing to have children later, so nationally, fertility rates for women aged 30 to 34 rose from 78.2 births per 1,000 women in 1986 to 104.6 per 1,000 in 2006. Current research suggests that the trend towards later maternity is strongest among women with better educational qualifications, with some postponing child rearing to pursue their careers. That could well be the case in Shropshire, where there has been an unprecedented increase in mid-range housing with an average age of occupants that conforms more with higher birth trends, which may, therefore, fuel an unexpected surge in the school-age population.</p>
	<p pid="b.274.2/5">Another factor that is almost impossible for the council to estimate is the increase in population owing due to the Government's abject loss of control of immigration. The most graphic example of that was the Government's prediction, when Poland acceded to the EU, of 13,000 Polish immigrants working in this country, whereas the actual figure was well over 600,000. Ironically, 13,000 babies have been born to Polish women in this country since EU accession. Population estimates assume inward migration contributing nearly 6 million to the projected rise of 7.2 million in the UK's population between 2004 and 2031&mdash;equivalent to six cities the size of Birmingham over the 27-year period.</p>
	<p pid="b.274.2/6">Poles have always been welcome in my constituency thanks to a significant Polish community in Penley, just over the Welsh border, who stayed on after the second world war because, tragically, it was too dangerous for them to return to socialist Poland. Vans with names dominated by consonants are common in the area. Following Poland's accession to the EU, a significant population of Polish people has built up in nearby Wrexham and Crewe. Road signs near Whitchurch written in Polish attracted national attention earlier this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.274.2/7">Advantage West Midlands commissioned the university of Warwick to write a paper on the economic impact of migrant workers in the west midlands, which reported in November 2007. It said:</p>
	<p pid="b.274.2/8" class="indent">&quot;The West Midlands Migrant Worker Survey revealed that for a substantial proportion of migrant workers initial plans about length of stay in the UK had changed. On balance, the tendency was for migrant workers in the sample to decide to stay longer than first anticipated...The presence of children will also increase the demand for school places.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.274.2/9">I hope that that shows that it really is impossible for the county council to plan ahead with complete accuracy given the totally inadequate quality of Government data in this area.</p>
	<p pid="b.274.2/10">I hope, however, that the Minister recognises that the current system of education works well. That situation is very much due to the number of small schools that provide local education and parental choice. Having visited every school in my constituency in recent years, I can confirm that competition among schools guarantees higher standards as schools strive to satisfy parents, knowing that those parents often have an alternative so long as they possess a car.</p>
	<p pid="b.274.2/11">Last Thursday, I visited Childs Ercall Church of England primary school, whose future is up for review because it fails existing criteria on pupil numbers established by the last Lib Dem-Labour council. First, the governors and the chairman of the parish council disputed the predicted numbers and were confident that given new housing they would achieve the current minimum numbers required, but they stressed that the village of 237 houses has only a village hall, a church, a working men's club and no other public facilities. David James, the chairman of the parish council, has said:</p>
	<p pid="b.274.2/12" class="indent">&quot;Facilities are being bled out of the countryside and that is a thoroughly bad development.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="b.277.1/1">I am most grateful to my hon. Friend. Happily, the Secretary of State has just turned up, so perhaps the Minister can confer and give us a clear reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.277.1/2">Successive Ministers have promised to defend rural schools. At the time of the countryside march in February 1998, when he was the Minister responsible for school standards, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1730" name="Nick Brown">the right hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East and Wallsend (Mr. Brown)</phrase> said:</p>
	<p pid="b.277.1/3" class="indent">&quot;When a school closes a village loses a vital focus...setting a spiral of decline. This is what we want to stop.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.277.1/4">In May 2000, the current Home Secretary, who was then the Minister responsible for schools, said:</p>
	<p pid="b.277.1/5" class="indent">&quot;Rural schools are often the lifeblood of local communities. I know there are difficult decisions that local authorities have to take but in the case of village schools, we were right to put the village before the planner.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.277.1/6">The chairman of governors of Adderley Church of England primary school, alarmed at the proposed reorganisation of Shropshire primary schools, has also told me that the Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1491" name="Jonathan R Shaw">the hon. Member for Chatham and Aylesford (Jonathan Shaw)</phrase>, said on &quot;The Westminster Hour&quot; on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-04">4 November</phrase> that the Government have a policy to keep rural schools open.</p>
	<p pid="b.277.1/7">I have also had approaches from Maesbury primary school and Selattyn Church of England primary school, which are indicative of the huge confusion and disruption that will be caused to Shropshire's primary schools if a reorganisation leads to the closure of a number of schools. The proposals will be deeply unpopular with parents and grandparents, as well as being most upsetting for staff and, above all, the children involved. Councillor Keith Barrow has put down a motion to Oswestry borough council, while Councillor Gerald Dakin has laid a similar motion before North Shropshire district council. This is all so unnecessary. We would not even be discussing the issue tonight if Shropshire received a fraction more of the central funds from the taxpayer that are awarded to other authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.277.1/8">Given the unreliability of current population data, particularly on immigration, now is no time to close schools that take decades to establish and build a reputation. They may even have to be reopened or, worse, new schools may have to be built, at great public expense, to cope with an influx of new pupils.</p>
	<p pid="b.277.1/9">I repeat that I am not asking for a single penny more to be levied from the British taxpayer. I am simply asking for a proportion of taxpayers' funds to be returned to the county of Shropshire in order to make a bitter and costly closure programme unnecessary. The Government have established the primary capital programme for improving existing schools. Could this be brought forward? Finally, would the Minister agree to meet me, with other Shropshire colleagues and representatives from the council, to find a solution to our modest requests? Unless a solution is found, irrevocable damage could be done to Shropshire's exceptional system of primary education, with an inevitable further impact on the county's isolated rural communities.</p>
