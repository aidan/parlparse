<p>The proportion, including National Service officers, is 10 per cent. in the technical branch, 7 per cent. in the education branch and 83 per cent. in the airfield construction branch. No central record is kept of the number of officers in other branches who possess these qualifications.</p>

<p>I quite agree that the Royal Air Force is becoming an increasingly technical service. It was for that reason that my predecessor instituted the technical cadet scheme, and I am glad to say that it is now going very well. I gave some account of it in the debate on the Air Estimates.</p>

<p>asked the Secretary of State for Air (1) how many wing commanders and above, now serving in the Royal Air Force education branch, could still be serving in twelve years' time; and how many vacancies in those ranks there are likely to be available during that period for those who are now squadron leaders;<br/>
(2) how many squadron leaders in the education branch of the Royal Air Force aged between 37 and 43 years and who were recruited between 1947 and 1950 and attained the rank of squadron leader between 1950 and 1954, will have to retire at the maximum age of 53 years without further promotion;<br/>

<p>Eighteen wing commanders and above in the Royal Air Force education branch could be serving in twelve years' time, and if establishments and other factors affecting promotion prospects remained unchanged there would be 36 wing commander vacancies during that period.

<p>Is my right hon. Friend aware that many of these officers with the very highest qualifications were greatly misled when they joined this Service? They were told that the prospects of promotion to wing commander were statistically 50&#x2013;50, and actually greater than that. They are now greatly disappointed and very disgruntled at finding that they will be there for another eleven years without having any hope whatsoever of promotion.</p>

<p>Since two weeks ago the Secretary of State told the House that he had not made any changes recently, and is not making them now, can we take it that the organisation of Air Intelligence is so different from that of Naval Intelligence that any incident such as we had recently is, I cannot say impossible, but very unlikely?</p>

<p>Faults have occurred in the electrical system which controls the tailplane actuator in the Canberra, and two Marks have been grounded while modifications are made. Flying of the Valiant was suspended as a precautionary measure after one of these aircraft had 
crashed on 11th May. Certain modifications are being made to the electrical wiring system of the aircraft. Both Canberras and Valiants are returning to flying as they are modified. All Valiants in Bomber Command are likely to have been modified by the end of this week.</p>

<p>Is that not in direct contradiction to the information which the right hon.

There were absolutely no means of ensuring that the fair wages clause was observed by the foreign firm concerned.</p>

<p>I understand that this order was not placed direct. It was placed through a British agent. Of course, the hon. Gentleman is perfectly correct in saying that it is extremely difficult to enforce a fair wages clause in a foreign country.</p>

<p>What is the purpose of the fair wages clause if the onus is placed on the British firm to observe it and if it is possible for a foreign firm, whether the goods are brought in directly or indirectly by merchants, to undercut the British producer?

<p>As my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister informed the right hon. Gentleman on 24th April, Her Majesty's Government do not intend to depart from the normal practice of refusing to disclose details of current exports of military equipment to foreign countries.</p>

<p>In view of that answer, would the right hon. and learned Gentleman say whether any arms have been sent to Western Germany? Surely he can answer that. At the same time, if arms have been sent, as I suspect that they have, and as he well knows, would he tell us whether Western Germany is paying for them and if an arrangement was made for them to be sent before a financial agreement was reached about the cost of our troops in Western Germany?</p>

<p>The right hon. and learned Gentleman surely misunderstood the point I was making. The question whether arms have been sent to foreign countries has been answered in the House. For example, an answer has been given about whether arms have been sent to Egypt. I want to know whether arms have been sent to Western Germany. Reports have appeared in the Press that the United States has sent arms to Germany, and surely he can say whether we have done the same.</p>

<p>On a point of order. It so happens that the Question I originally sought to address to the right hon. and learned Gentleman was framed in this

fashion: "whether arms have been sent to Germany," and I was advised by the Clerk at the Table that it would be better to substitute the word "what".</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-05-30a.224.5" hansard_membership_id="6645" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20586" speakername="Mr. Shinwell" colnum="224" time="">
<p>Surely the right hon. Gentleman recognises that that is a purely negative reply which takes us nowhere. In view of the gesture by the Soviet Union, surely it would be advisable for us to make a similar gesture, in addition to what has already been done by the contemplated cut in the Forces. Surely now is the time to say to the world at large that we are responding to this gesture by reducing the period of National Service. Is it not contemplated by the Government quite seriously that before long they will make a cut?</p>

<p>The answer to that is, first of all, that if we are to consider our policy on National Service, it is very desirable&#x2014;indeed, the right hon. Gentleman himself drew attention to this on 20th April&#x2014;that we should see what has been the effect of the increases in pay on the numbers recruited and the period for which people take on. That is one of the things at which we must look. It would be most undesirable to make a general statement of National Service policy until we are aware of the relevant factors. Unlike what may be said of other people, this country is already in the process of taking substantial steps to reduce its armed forces.</p>

<p>Does not the Minister recollect that on 15th February he told me that he hoped that National Service would be ended long before the next General Election and that his statement was made long before the announcement of the reduction in the Russian armed forces?

<p>No, Sir. It would be unfair automatically to exempt men in these circumstances from National Service. I am satisfied, however, that sympathetic consideration is given to appeals for release on compassionate grounds where continuance of National Service would cause grave hardship.</p>

<p>Is the Minister aware that some National Service men who are the bread-winners for seven or eight young children are being refused release?

<p>Perhaps the hon. Member will send to the Ministers responsible for the Service Departments concerned the cases which he has in mind.

<p>The problems with which we have been faced have arisen mainly in the later stages of development. The production of aircraft has in general been proceeding satisfactorily.<br/>
The action to improve matters announced in the White Paper on Supply of Military Aircraft issued in February. 1955, and by my right hon. Friend the Minister of Supply in the recent Defence Debate is already beginning to bear fruit. The right hon. Gentleman will recall that during that debate I said that I was myself inquiring into these and related matters. I shall tell the House in due course what conclusions I reach; all that I would say for the moment is that I am making progress.<br/>
Development and production of guided missiles are proceeding reasonably well, though with entirely new weapons of this kind there are always liable to be unexpected hitches.<br/>
I have found that the co-ordination between the Ministry of Supply and the Air Ministry is good, and I do not think that any failure in this respect has contributed materially to our problems.</p>

<p>I understood the Minister to say in the early part of his reply that he was comparatively satisfied. How can he possibly say such a thing in view of


the statements made in the Defence debate on 27th and 28th February? Is he not aware that the hopeless muddle and losses which have been incurred in the supply of aircraft are largely due to the inadequate arrangements in the aircraft industry itself? How does he expect units of less than 15,000 men to produce large bombers? What does he intend to do about it?</p>

<p>The views of Her Majesty's Government on this boycott have been frequently stated and representations have been made to the Governments concerned.

<p>While thanking the right hon.

<p>Could the right hon. Gentleman not inquire into this matter and see whether anything can be done by one of the bodies in the United Nations in order that information available can be collected?

<p>One of the difficulties, of course, is to compel a Government to trade with someone with whom the Government does not want to trade. The best method is not too much ventilation of the matter.

<p>asked the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether he is aware that British shipping passing through the Suez Canal or the Strait of Tiran on the way to or from Israel is liable to be black-listed by Arab countries; that this black-listing results in such ships being denied normal port facilities, pilotage, and fresh water in Arab ports; and what steps he proposes to take to protect British shipping from such hostile action.</p>

<p>Several Arab countries have for some time imposed restrictions on merchant ships of all nationalities which have traded with Israel. These restrictions include the denial of normal port facilities. Her Majesty's Government have made it clear on a number of occasions that we do not accept the legality of the Arab blockade of Israel. But we believe, and have constantly maintained, that the best way to bring the restrictions to an end is to work for a general settlement of the Arab Israel dispute.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the boycott continues. Would it not be in the best interests of everybody concerned if Her Majesty's Government were to take the shipping lines into conference with them and say that they would support them to the hilt in opposition to this boycott?

<p>As far as British ships are concerned, there is, in fact, not very much interference. If the hon. Member will give me particulars, I will willingly look into them. Ships of ours which go to Israel are usually dry cargo ships, which do not go through the Canal, and are therefore not affected by the blockade, but if he has any particular cases which can be brought to my attention, or if that is the view he has attributed to the shipping interests concerned, I will look into the matter again.</p>

<p>It is very regrettable that the resolution of the United Nations has not been carried out, but then the question arises of the methods to be taken to enforce such a resolution. The fact is that Egypt maintains that there is still a state of war between Israel and Egypt

<p>I will now describe the general reasons which led to the acceptance of the Clause of right hon. Gentleman the Member for Vauxhall (Mr. G. R. Strauss) in Committee and describe the new Clause which now stands on the Order Paper in my name. The problem here is a very difficult one and, as the Committee will know, it has received a great deal of discussion in this House, in another place and in the country. When I took over the Bill, I thought it only right that I should consider carefully, and with an open mind, whether it was right that the compulsory testing of motor vehicles should be undertaken in addition to the existing powers held by the police, in conjunction with the examiners of my Ministry, to examine cars on the road by the spot check principle, as amplified in another Clause in the Bill.<br/>
I asked myself one or two basic questions. I asked whether it was right to take these powers for the compulsory testing of vehicles and what justification existed for imposing that extra duty on motorists. The first point which anyone must consider is the tragic fact that this year about 14 or 15 people will be killed every day on our roads. I do not think that any hon. Member will fail to be conscious of the human tragedy and waste revealed by those figures.<br/>
I tried to discover whether these powers would make a real contribution to safety on the roads. It is only fair to tell the


Committee that the statistics in the police records of accidents attributable to the unfitness of vehicles are not very impressive. They amount to about 2&#x00BD; per cent. But that, of course, is not the full story, as I hope to show. May I say at once, and as I think the right hon. Member for Vauxhall will accept, that we have made much discussion during the Committee stage on these matters. I propose to be brief, but I am at the service of the Committee to answer any questions arising on this or any other matter.<br/>
It is not only a matter of accident statistics. For example, a driver may turn to the right at short notice, without perhaps even giving the appropriate signal, and a car behind him may run into his vehicle. In the records that crash would be attributed to the negligence of the driver in front. But it may be that the driver behind could have avoided the crash had the brakes of his vehicle been efficient. So I think it fair to say that a great many accidents which are attributable to a defect in a vehicle do not get so recorded. I wish to refer to the experience at the Hendon car testing station, where we do not set an unnecessarily high standard. In March of this year 72 per cent. of the cars going through the station had one or more major defects. That figure is rather high.<br/>
There are many people who take the view that defects in headlights are not important, but they cause a great number of accidents through dazzle. I wish to give the Committee some other figures. Of the pre-1945 cars&#x2014;and these vehicles are not excessively old&#x2014;which were tested&#x2014;28 per cent. proved to have defective brakes, and in 47 per cent., that is nearly half the cars tested, the steering was not up to standard. If we consider those figures, and the casualty rates on the road; if we consider the tests at Hendon, which are not excessively tough, and do not conform to a very high standard, they clearly show that if the condition of cars could be improved, it would have a sensible effect on the accident rate.</p>

<p>Can my right hon. Friend say how many vehicles were tested at Hendon in March? Unless we have that figure, the percentages do not mean very much.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-05-30a.246.0" hansard_membership_id="10084" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/21940" speakername="Mr. Watkinson" colnum="246" time="">
<p>I shall be glad to tell my hon. Friend. I will give him the figure in a moment, before I end my remarks on this Clause.<br/>
I think it is shown, then, that we ought to take powers to test motor vehicles. The next question one ought to answer is: if we do it, how should we conduct these tests? This, of course, is only a permissive Clause. The detailed arrangements will have to be brought to the House in due course and will be debatable, but as I said in Committee and as I should like to make plain now, I think it right for me to take the broadest means I can. This will not be an easy thing to do. It will be a burden on the skilled labour and on the motor car industry. It will also take time. So I think it right that I should take powers that will enable me to use either Government testing stations, those of local authorities, or private garages.<br/>
A point has been made that the difficulty with a private garage&#x2014;and to some extent I think it is a difficulty in every test&#x2014;is the risk of an abuse; the risk of a motorist paying money to get a false certificate as to the condition of his car. We have looked at that very carefully and I believe that it is possible to avoid that kind of abuse. The first way to do it is to restrict, as we would propose, the test to a very simple list&#x2014;brakes, steering and lights. Subject to one overriding factor, only those three things would be tested.<br/>
The over-riding thing is, of course, that if in testing a car the experts found that it was in such a dangerous condition as to be unsafe for the owner to take on the road, they would tell him so. I have in mind such things as a tyre so badly slit that it might burst at any moment, a cracked chassis, or some other serious defect. The owner would then be told. But the purpose of the test would be to see that the brakes, steering and lights were of a sufficient standard to make that car reasonably roadworthy and not a danger to other users of the road.<br/>
If the tests are cheap and simple, as they will be, then the equipment necessary to be installed will equally be simple and reasonably inexpensive. What I think would be established would be something like the ordinary greasing bay, with which most of us are familiar in a garage; a separate corner of the


garage where the equipment is kept tidily and which is clearly marked as a testing bay and where the motorist would be in no doubt as to the equipment used and the people using it. It would not, I think, put the users to great expense, nor would it put the garages that had to install the equipment to great expense.<br/>
The only other point that I would make there is the very important one relating to the method of policing the scheme. Wherever the testing is carried out that policing will be done by the vehicle examiners and the certifying officers of my Department, who are experienced men. As the Committee knows, they are all members of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, and the senior vehicle examiners have actually been recruited from the motor car industry. They are men who know their job from beginning to end.<br/>
We should see that there was a sufficient force of certifying officers and vehicle examiners to make sure that the tests were properly and fairly carried out. As an example of the interest which the tests have already aroused&#x2014;and in answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Walton (Mr. K. Thompson)&#x2014;just over 6,500 vehicles have already gone through the Hendon station. Of course, those tests have all been voluntary tests. It is also fair to say that the owners of the cars tested are mostly motorists who are interested in their cars and not those who are sure that their vehicles should not be in the road in any case. Nevertheless, I think that the figures are not unfair.<br/>
The answer to the second is that the tests should be widely spread. I do not believe that there is a serious risk of abuse, but if there were I am sure that my controlling officers would be quite capable of dealing with it.<br/>
We have had a lot of letters from people asking, "Why pick cars that are ten years old?" The difficulty is that we have to start at one end of the scale or the other, and I think that the following figures perhaps do show that it is right to start with the older car. Of the older cars&#x2014;the pre-1945 cars&#x2014;going through Hendon, over a quarter have been found to have defective brakes and nearly half had defective steering. If we look at the figures for the modern cars&#x2014;that is to

say, the 1954&#x2013;55&#x2013;56 cars&#x2014;the figures go down to 4 per cent. for defective brakes and 9 per cent. for steering. Those are still quite large figures, but, of course, very much lower than those for the older cars.<br/>
One thing I do want to make clear. This is not an attempt to drive the older car off the road or to interfere with the well-kept veteran car, which is a remarkable vehicle, a great credit to the motor car industry of the past, and generally a good deal better kept than many more modern cars. The owners of veteran cars need not be alarmed, nor need the owner of the older cars. That is why we are to have these tests, which will be not expensive and may well save the life of the motorist himself as well as the lives of other users of the roads.<br/>
I would sum up by saying that I believe that vehicle testing once a year can make an essential contribution to road safety. I think that it helps the motorist, and encourages pride of ownership in the car&#x2014;which is very important. It is also very important in regard to safe driving. If the owner takes a pride in his car he is much more likely to drive carefully than if he lacks that pride. Let me repeat that this testing is not directed against old cars of any kind. It will take a long time to prepare the scheme and I certainly pledge myself not to implement it until we can do it properly. We will, I am sure, avoid abuse, but we shall have to spread the tests. If the House gives a passage to the Bill and it becomes law, I shall have to come here again with detailed proposals.<br/>

For those reasons, having tried to think it out as carefully&#x2014;and as objectively, I hope&#x2014;as possible, because as I see it there is no decision except as it concerns the safety of people on the roads, I think it right to bring forward this new Clause &#x2014;although I know that I am not moving it but moving to delete the right hon. Gentleman's Clause&#x2014;and I hope the Committee will accept what I have said as a statement of my general aims.</p>

<p>Are there any figures to show how the accident proclivity of the new cars compares with that of the old? I have been told that in that respect the new cars


show a good deal higher percentage than the old; although that may be because the old cars, as a result of their possible bad condition, are driven more slowly.</p>

<p>I think that there is an answer to that which I already know. There are certainly a number of very bad accidents occurring now as a result of very fast cars being driven at very high speed. When those cars crash it is obviously a very serious and messy business. But I do not think that there is any statistical evidence that new cars are causing more accidents than old and I do not think that there is any way of ascertaining whether that statement be true or not.<br/>
I agree that the owner of the old car which is reasonably well-maintained is inclined to drive more carefully and to that extent may be safer, but I do not honestly think that there is much in it one way or the other. What I want to see, if possible, is a greater pride in the car and a greater attempt to keep it in reasonable order. If that can be achieved, I believe it would have a sensible effect on road safety.</p>

<p>The Minister has, as usual, been admirably clear and&#x2014;although I am not criticising him for it&#x2014;exceedingly brief. It will be appreciated by yourself, Sir Charles, and by the Committee that this is probably the most important Clause in the Bill. As this is the first time we have had an opportunity of considering the Minister's version, and as there are a number of Amendments which some of my right hon. and hon. Friends and myself desire to move, I think that it will be understandable if we spend a little time considering this very important proposal, although I am sure that nobody in the Committee wants to prolong the discussions on this or on any of the Amendments which will come before us.<br/>
My first comment about the Minister's new Clause, which we are considering as well as the deletion of the old one, is that it is a very happy outcome of a long period of decision and counter-decision by the Government on this question of compulsory testing. Although the final outcome is one which we welcome, I think it is essential for the sake of the record to say a word about the extraordinary history of this business.<br/>
The first thing that happened was that the Bill which the Government introduced in another place in the previous Session had a Clause in it which provided the Minister with powers to effect compulsory testing of cars in private garages. The principle was accepted by their Lordships. The Government spokesman in another place said that this principle was essential to cope with road safety. It was accepted, but an Amendment was made to the effect that the tests should be carried out not in private garages but in State testing stations, such as we now have at Hendon.<br/>
When the Bill appeared in the Commons in the new Session all reference to compulsory testing was omitted altogether. Therefore, we had the strange situation in which the Government came to the House and said that what they considered essential and had been agreed to in principle in another place they now proposed to abandon altogether. There was no mention of the matter in the Bill that came before the House.<br/>
In the Standing Committee I, on behalf of my colleagues, who believed that compulsory testing would have a marked effect on reducing road accidents, moved a Clause to provide for this. We were turned down by the Minister, who said that it was impracticable, too difficult, that the number of technicians required would be considerable, and all the rest of it. But, later&#x2014;and it is true that by that time there was a change of Minister, but it was the same Government&#x2014;we were told that the principle was to be accepted. The last thought of the Government, after turning somersaults three times on this question, is the one which we now have before us, and that is the acceptance of the principle of compulsory testing.<br/>
Although we agree with the new Clause in principle, there are several defects in the Clause which we propose to bring to the attention of the Committee and, if possible, obtain the agreement of the Committee with our views. Before I refer to the Amendments, I want to say a few words about the general principle involved. I do not want to go over the whole question of compulsory testing yet once more, but I would say that it has been proved, as far as proof in this sort of matter is possible, that the regular compulsory testing of cars brings down the number of road accidents significantly and, indeed, in quite a striking way.<br/>
Incidentally, the case for compulsory testing of vehicles was never made by the Government on any occasion, not even when the Bill was first discussed in another place. No figures were quoted in favour of the case. But, in essence, the simple figures which we have show this. In the United States, where a large number of States have compulsory testing either yearly or half-yearly, the number of deaths on the road are 20 per cent. less than in those States where there is no compulsory testing of cars. I know it is possible to read those figures in two ways; it is possible to read them so that the result is only 10 per cent. But it is something between 10 per cent. and 20 per cent.<br/>
We know that our own Road Research Laboratory which went into this matter very carefully made an estimate, which has been accepted by the Government, that in the accidents that take place in this country a contributory factor in 20 per cent. of the cases was a vehicle defect. All these figures, together with those which we now have as a result of testing of vehicles at Hendon, make it clear that the defects in cars on the road contribute substantially to the number of accidents that take place.<br/>
I want to give a few more figures to show what benefit might be derived and what reductions might be made in our road accidents if we carried out on a full scale the compulsory testing of vehicles. If one takes the figure of a I0 per cent. reduction in accidents the lowest figure which one can get from the experience we have&#x2014;that would mean that in a year 550 people fewer would be killed and 6,000 people fewer would be seriously injured; and of the 550 fewer people killed, 60 would be children.<br/>
There is no question but that this proposal, when carried out to the full as it is in other countries&#x2014;this is only the first stage&#x2014;will bring down the number of deaths on our roads substantially. It is not only well worth while; it is urgent to move as quickly as possible along these lines.<br/>
If one looks at this problem from the material rather than the human point of view, it has been reckoned by the authorities from figures prepared by the Government Actuary that road accidents cost the country today at least &#x00A3;150 million a year.

A 10 per cent. reduction in accidents would produce a saving of &#x00A3;15 million&#x2014;immensely more than the cost of carrying out any scheme of compulsory testing.<br/>
The value of compulsory testing is twofold. Not only does it reveal defects in cars, but it makes people more defect-conscious. Very few people drive cars knowing them to be defective. Perhaps a few do but they are not social-minded. They may know that their brakes are not quite right, or that the lights are not what they ought to be, yet they take their cars on the road because they cannot be bothered to put them right. But most people do not realise in what a bad condition their cars are. I am certain that most of those who went to the Hendon testing station were amazed to find that in matters such as steering, lighting, and so on, there were serious defects in their cars.<br/>
I was given a striking example of this when I went to have my car tested. I had a conversation with the man in charge, and he told me that recently a man had driven his car there with his wife and two children. They had driven all the way from a town in the North. This was a man who was meticulous about the condition of his car. Before he had driven to Hendon he had had his car thoroughly serviced and tested by his home garage. Because he had an interest in this matter he went to Hendon and said, "I would like you to have a look at the car". They had a look at it.<br/>
The brakes were so defective that when the man was testing them the whole of the apparatus collapsed. It was absolutely certain that if that man had gone out and driven his car, at a certain time&#x2014;it might have been within five minutes or it might have been within some weeks or months of leaving Hendon&#x2014;if he had applied his footbrake it would have had no effect. Possibly he and his whole family would have been involved in a fatal accident on their way home. He did not know there was anything wrong with the brakes of his car. Most people do not. Therefore, these tests bring to light information which the motorists do not have, and make them, broadly speaking, more conscious of the desirability of keeping their cars up to standard.<br/>
I want to say a word or two on what we consider a very important aspect of


this new Clause, and that is who should do the testing. That was a matter of great controversy in the other place and in Committee. I was disappointed not to head the Minister's views on this matter. He takes power in his new Clause to have testing done at Government testing stations, such as the one at Hendon, by local authorities or in private garages. I hoped he would tell us that it is his intention to have as much testing as possible done by the Government garages or perhaps by the local authorities, and as little as possible by private garages. He did not tell us anything of the sort, and he has given us no idea of what his general policy on this matter would be. I really hope he will tell us, before we come to the end of our debate.<br/>
4.0 p.m.<br/>
We take grave objection to having cars tested by private garages, except in very special and unusual circumstances. It is all very well for the Minister to say that fears of abuse are ill-founded. They are nothing of the sort; he cannot get rid of the danger of abuse if private garages are to do this testing. He has said that one thing he will do to avoid the danger of abuse is to have testing of three things only, namely, brakes, steering and lights.<br/>
He is making a grave mistake there, to start with. At Hendon, many other things of great importance were tested, such as the direction indicators to see whether they are working properly, the windscreen wipers to test their efficiency, the effectiveness of the rear view mirror, and the tyres. All those things are important, and, if there is a defect among them, there can easily be an accident. It is wrong to say that in these new Government testing stations or private garages&#x2014;whatever they may be&#x2014;there should be no effective testing of these devices, and I very much regret that the Minister takes that view.<br/>
It is a lamentable fact, but it is, I suppose, indisputable, that garages as a whole do not in this country enjoy a reputation for shining integrity. To accord to private garages power to insist on what may be costly repairs being carried out at the expense of the private motorist is surely wrong; it will be not only disliked, but, I should have thought, resented by the great body of private motorists.<br/>
Of the two types of possible abuse, one&#x2014;and perhaps this is the lesser one is that a garage which wanted to keep or attract custom could do so by getting a reputation for being easy with its tests and by not being so meticulous as others in carrying them out, in the hope that in return it would become popular in the neighbourhood and that people would give them more business. Much more serious, however, is the possibility that a garage might find faults and be overmeticulous in making tests, insisting on repairs being carried out, in the hope and belief that those repairs would be carried out by that garage.<br/>
I should have thought that this is something which is bound to happen in some cases, perhaps in only a few; but even if it did not actually happen at all, the motorist or vehicle owner would be bound to think that it was happening when he went to a garage with his vehicle, believing it to be all right, and got a note to say that he must have substantial repairs carried out to his steering, that his lighting is out of order, and that this, that, and the other must be attended to. He may not believe it; he may believe that he has been told to do these things because it will bring business to the garage which carried out the test. That situation is surely unsatisfactory and ought not to be enforced by legislation.<br/>
In this matter, as in others, I would suggest that American experience is of value. Some States in the United States carry out tests by State stations; others do it by private enterprise stations, by garages. Incidentally, this fact should be borne in mind, that opinion polls taken in the United States with regard to the popularity or unpopularity of compulsory testing have shown an overwhelming result, over 90 per cent., in favour of compulsory testing of cars, in spite of the obvious great inconvenience to the motorist. It is, therefore, all the more surprising that some of the motoring organisations are opposing this proposal. It is very popular in the States.<br/>
As a result of personal inquiry I have made of friends who live in the United States, I have been told that where their cars are tested in private garages there is a general belief, justified or not, that a certain amount of hanky-panky goes on. That feeling does not exist at all,


of course, in those States where it is the State itself which does the testing. Where private garages do it, there is bound to be a certain amount of suspicion.<br/>
In this matter, we do not take an absolutist attitude; we do not say that private garages should be eliminated altogether. Throughout the discussion on this question, we have tried to be, and have been, I think, wholly reasonable. We have said there may be a case for having private garages authorised and inspected by the Ministry so that they may do the testing in exceptional circumstances, for instance, in remote areas where it is difficult for the State or local authority to set up a testing station, or in a place where, perhaps, it is desired to start the testing, but there has not yet been time or it has been difficult for the Government to set up its own testing station.<br/>
In such circumstances, let the private garage do it temporarily; we would agree that there is a case for it. We have put our Amendments upon the Notice Paper to ensure that testing by public authority stations shall be the rule, and that testing by private garages should be exceptional and temporary.<br/>
I hope that the Committee will agree on this principle. If there were any doubt about it, the Committee will surely be encouraged by the fact that it is the principle which the House of Lords has laid down as being the correct one. If we agree to it here, there will not be any difficulty in another place.<br/>
I now have one or two questions I should like to ask the Minister. First, in paragraph (4) of his new Clause there is a right of appeal to the Minister where someone feels aggrieved. I am not quite clear whether, if someone has been told by the inspector that his car is not fit for the road, and he desires to appeal, he is to be allowed to drive that car on the road pending that appeal. Obviously, he ought not to be allowed to do so, but, from my reading of the Clause as it stands, I am not quite clear what the situation is. Perhaps the Minister will be able to enlighten us.<br/>
Has the Minister in mind that the detailed regulations he will bring before the House will enable a motorist to undertake a test voluntarily, or will the testing

be of only those care which are ten years or more old?</p>

<p>I see the right hon. Gentleman is shaking his head in disagreement with the later part of my question. I am, therefore, satisfied that those who desire to have their own cars tested, even if those cars are younger than ten years old, will be able to do so. I am glad to know that.<br/>
Lastly&#x2014;and this is really a very important question&#x2014;how quickly does the Minister propose to proceed? I, and, I think, my colleagues, have been rather discouraged by what the right hon. Gentleman said in his speech. He said it would be a considerable time before he would be able to come to the House with the regulations, and from that I got the impression that there is not to be much sense of urgency about this matter. There is to be a delay before the scheme is drawn up, and a longer delay before the thing is in operation. We must not, apparently, expect any great speed.<br/>
No one wants to be unreasonable. Obviously, it would be quite impossible to have this scheme covering the country within the year. We know that. But we do believe that it is exceedingly urgent that this scheme should be put into effect as quickly as possible, and that the ten-year limit should be only a start. As soon as the scheme gets going properly, we should do what has been done in the United States&#x2014;gradually bring the ten-year period down to one or two years, so that all cars which have been on the road even for only a short time will be tested.<br/>
How quickly does the Minister propose to put this scheme into operation? Those of us who have been concerned about these matters of road safety for a long time know that three things, in effect, can bring about a significant reduction in road accidents&#x2014;education and propaganda, having newer and safer roads, and vehicle inspection. Education and propaganda ought to go on at a much more effective rate than at the moment. Newer and safer roads take a long time and are very expensive. The third method, although not easy, is a comparatively quick and effective method of having a marked effect on the number of road accidents which take place in this country.<br/>
There is, therefore, every conceivable ground for hastening the operation of the scheme, and I therefore hope that the Minister will give us more encouraging news when he speaks later. I beg him not to linger, but to put the matter very high in the list of priorities. According to the figures and calculations which I have given already, we can say with a reasonable degree of certainty that when this scheme is in full operation I00 cases of serious injury which now take place on our roads every week will not take place. There will be 100 fewer seriously injured, 10 fewer deaths on the road and one child fewer killed every week.<br/>
We can say that, based on experience, with a confident degree of certainty, and I therefore beg the Government&#x2014;as I am sure do all hon. Members&#x2014;to go forward with this matter with all possible speed and energy and thereby do something which, as we know by experience, will have a considerable effect on reducing the number of deaths and accidents on our roads.</p>

<p>I gather that we are having a general discussion upon the Minister's new Clause, and perhaps it would save the time of the Committee if I argued the points which appear in the Amendments to the new Clause in my name and the name of the hon. Lady the Member for Peckham, (Mrs. Corbet). The purpose of the Amendments, if accepted by the Committee, is to except local authorities from the operation of the Clause and from carrying out testing arrangements.<br/>
I want to make it clear that I in no way dissent from the point of view which has been so strongly put by my right hon. Friend the Member for Vauxhall (Mr. G. R. Strauss) that testing ought to be done either by the Government or by local authorities. The point really raised by the Amendments is that if local authorities are to undertake this heavy and new obligation, they must be properly remunerated for it. It is clear that the Clause as drafted makes no provision for reimbursement. Obviously in the case of a county council with a large area, or any large authority, several testing stations will have to be provided. The London County Council will have to provide a number. The cost of either

new buildings or the adaptation of old buildings in order that this work can be competently and efficiently done is bound to involve an expenditure of money.<br/>
In addition, there is the training and enrolling of inspectors and mechanics who are to do the work, and who must be well qualified and well trained if they are not only to do the job properly but to carry the confidence which work of this kind requires. Obviously those who have their cars inspected will need to feel complete confidence both in the arrangements for the reception of vehicles and in those who are to undertake the work.<br/>
In its present form the new Clause makes no provision whatever for the reimbursement of designated authorities either for their capital expenditure on the building and maintenance of the testing stations or for their expenditure on those who are to be employed in them. In the case of the London County Council, which is my special concern&#x2014;although I understand that the point is the concern of all the local authority associations&#x2014;the scheme is bound to involve a considerable capital and maintenance expenditure.<br/>
The purpose of the Amendments is to find out whether the Minister proposes in some way to ensure that local authorities are not out of pocket as a result of the new duty which is to be placed on them. I ought to make it clear to the Minister, although he may have already discovered this from his discussions with local authority associations, that this is not a duty which local authorities particularly want. They will have considerable difficulty in recruiting the mechanics required and making the necessary arrangements. If they undertake the task in the public interest and in the interest of road safety and the preservation of life, at least we must see that they are not financially injured as a result of the new obligations placed upon them.<br/>
Since I put my Amendments down, I notice that my right hon. Friend the Member for South Shields (Mr. Ede) and others have put down Amendments covering the point, and it may well be that the Minister can give us a fairly quick answer which would save the time of the Committee later. That is why I intervened at this stage.</p>

<p>My right hon. Friend the Member for Vauxhall (Mr. G. R. Strauss) has so very lucidly and powerfully made the case covering the main points contained in the views from this side of the Committee that, since we are all anxious to give a speedy passage to the Bill as far as possible, I will concentrate for a moment on the rather simple Amendment in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Rossendale (Mr. Anthony Greenwood) and myself, in line I3, at the end to insert "non-county borough".<br/>
The intention of the Amendment will be obvious to the Minister. I hope that he will give it sympathetic consideration. It shows my unselfishness, when the Committee remembers that I represent a large county borough, that I am taking the point of view, in this respect, of the noncounty boroughs. Whatever happens to the important Amendment in the name of my right hon. Friend, the position will certainly be that local authorities will have some part in the examination as envisaged in the new Clause. I will put the point as briefly and as forcefully as I can that some non-county boroughs are larger than many county boroughs. When we remember the discussions that we have had in the House whether Luton should be a county borough, we see an illustration of the present situation. It would be unfair to make non-county boroughs dependent upon the county for this examination. I hope that the Minister will accept the Amendment.</p>

<p>I said in my remarks that I wanted to spread the load as widely as possible. I cannot accept the Amendment of the hon. Member for Salford, West (Mr. Royle), but I will give him an undertaking to introduce in another place an Amendment which will cover the point he raises and which will make it possible for non-county boroughs, and indeed the whole range of local authorities, to participate in this scheme if they wish to do so.</p>

<p>I do not wish to detain the Committee for more than a few moments, but there are two points which I wish to put to my right hon. Friend on this new Clause. He is aware that I was not a member of the

Standing Committee which dealt with the Bill, but my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Freeth) then moved a new Clause on my behalf covering the compulsory testing of certain classes of vehicles.<br/>
I want to impress upon my right hon. Friend that he should be very flexible in respect of the vehicles called for testing. He should not start only with those more than ten years old. The particular class which I have in mind includes the privatehire vehicle used by a local authority for taking children to school. There was an accident in my own constituency the details of which my hon. Friend the Joint Parliamentary Secretary is very well aware through the exhaustive correspondence which ensued. It involved a vehicle of this kind which was in a disgraceful condition, and it was an accident in which a young girl was very nearly killed.<br/>
I think that that type of vehicle, particularly private vehicles which are used by public bodies, should also be tested, whether they are ten years old or not. In the particular case which I have quoted, the vehicle was more than ten years old and would have come within the scope of the Bill, but there are cases where the vehicles are not ten years old. They are being used to take children to school; the children have to travel in them whether they like it or not, and cannot refuse to go. Therefore, I think that such vehicles should be tested under the provisions of the new Clause.<br/>
The other point is that it is not much use having testing stations unless we know what kind of standards are laid down. The right hon. Member for Vauxhall (Mr. G. R. Strauss) said that not only a question of testing brakes, lights and steering was involved; and that is quite true. In the accident to which I have already referred, the real injuries were caused by flying glass. I understand that under the present Regulations safety glass is prescribed only for the windscreen, although I believe that most motor car manufacturers now fit it in all round their vehicles. On the occasion in the Standing Committee which I have mentioned, my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke asked the Joint Parliamentary Secretary if he would investigate the position and produce new regulations to make safety glass compulsory all round the car, and not


only for the windscreen. I should like to ask my hon. Friend whether any progress has been made in that direction since the Committee stage of the Bill was completed. I personally welcome the new Clause, and hope that it will be put into effect as soon as possible.</p>

<p>I should like to ask the Minister whether he will bear in mind the point raised in the Amendment to the new Clause in my name, in line 55, at the end to insert;
<q>(7) The Minister shall repay to designated local authorities their expenses properly incurred in the exercise of their function under this section?</q>
I would also support what has been said by my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington (Mr. Skeffington). The local authorities, while they are quite willing to undertake this work&#x2014;at least, the local authorities for whom one is competent to speak&#x2014;realise that it will involve them in a very great deal of expense, and they will require some assurance in the Bill itself that they will be reimbursed for any expenditure which they have to incur in carrying out these duties.<br/>
I was a little alarmed when I heard the right hon. Gentleman say, in answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Salford, West (Mr. Royle), that he was going to include the whole range of the local authorities in the Bill. In the light of what my hon. Friend himself said, I must point out that, while it is true that there are some non-county boroughs larger than some county boroughs, there are also some others that are very small indeed. Does my hon. Friend contemplate giving this power to the Borough of Montgomery, where a penny rate produces &#x00A3;12? &#x00B7;I would suggest that, in these claims for autonomy, there should be some regard to the nature of the duties which people express themselves as willing to undertake.</p>

<p>My right hon. Friend the Member for South Shields (Mr. Ede) has mentioned that I was trying to include every local authority.

<p>No; my hon. Friend did not listen quite carefully enough. It was the Minister who said, in one sweeping phrase, that he was going to give it to the whole range of local authorities that would include everybody. But that does not alter the fact that the Amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Salford, West would include the non-county Borough of Montgomery. Sometimes the trouble with people who claim to undertake certain duties is that they do not always sufficiently bear in mind their own capacity to discharge the duties when they have undertaken them. I hope that, whatever is done in another place, a sense of proportion will be observed in this matter.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman has quite correctly quoted me, but I had taken note, in what I said, of the fact that I understand that the Amendment is restricted, as the hon. Gentleman the Member for Salford, West (Mr. Royle) quite rightly said, to the noncounty boroughs. I certainly did not intend to take up the parish councils, nor, I think, probably, the urban district councils. All I say is that we want to look at it and make it as wide as is reasonably possible.</p>

<p>I am grateful for that interruption.<br/>
Let me say that there are some urban district councils that are tremendously greater than the majority of the noncounty borough councils. While I do not want to start a battle on this particular issue, I hope that the wide general phrases that are being used will be interpreted very carefully when it comes to putting something into legislation. I am quite certain that, no matter what the size of the authority or its financial resources, it will expect to be reimbursed for the cost of the work which it does for the Ministry and of any duties which are imposed upon it by this new Clause.</p>

<p>I come new to the matter of the words on the Notice Paper, not having been a member of the Standing Committee, and I therefore want to ask one or two questions about them.<br/>
First, I am not at all happy with the provision about ten-year-old cars. I have an 18-year-old car, which is far safer than


my second car, which is only one year old. I would much rather drive the 18year-old car on the icy roads in Scotland in winter than the modern car, because I feel much safer in it. I think that there is a great deal to be said for the old cars, and I therefore hope that any testing that goes on will be applied reasonably to old cars, because I believe that they are much safer than the modern, highly-geared cars, which skid about on the snow and ice in Scotland.<br/>
My second question is whether tractors are involved. I think I am right in saying that, under the licence which is issued for tractors, the driver is limited in the distance which he is permitted to travel to 15 miles. If he wishes to go more than 15 miles, he has to have the ordinary licence as well. The testing stations in my sparsely populated constituency may be 20 miles away. How, then, is the tractor to get there if it is involved in this testing business?<br/>
The next question that occurs to me is why one is to be tested only by the county council or the local authority of the area in which the vehicle has been registered. There are three points that might be chosen for the registration of a vehicle in my area. There is the county town of Forfar, in Angus, the county town of Perth, in Perthshire, and the big town of Dundee, which is in between the two counties. Why should not one have the choice of being tested at any one of these three places? Why should one be compelled to go only to the office of the authority in whose area the vehicle was registered?<br/>
My last question is at what date does the test cease to be effective? Under the wording of the new Clause, a licence will not be granted except after production of a test certificate issued within 12 months, or such shorter period as may be prescribed, before the date of the licence. When one applies for a new licence for a car on 1st January, one has to take the insurance certificate, and in the case of a ten-year-old car, or, in my own case, an 18-year-old car, one will have to take an extra certificate as well. That makes three pieces of paper which one has to take, but the point is how long in advance of 1st January will one be able to take a test? If it is 2nd January of the previous year, in that case the old car may have lost

the value of its certificate by then. I think there will have to be give and take, for if the testing conditions are too much prescribed they will be impossible to fulfil, and one may find oneself after fourteen days faced with the possibility of having to pay a &#x00A3;20 fine.<br/>
4.30 p.m.<br/>
I would impress upon my right hon. Friend once again that these old cars are intrinsically, because they are not so highly geared, safer than modern cars. The figure which my right hon. Friend has just given of 9 per cent. of new cars being defective in steering is a very alarming figure. I hope that, in addition to all he is doing, he will impress on car manufacturers that they should not turn out new cars in the state in which they are turning them out today, a state in which, in a year, 4 per cent. have defective brakes and 9 per cent. defective steering. It is a disgrace to modern motor engineering.</p>

<p>Following what the hon. and gallant Member for South Angus (Captain Duncan) has said, I myself think that the Minister's figures were rather alarming. If I understood them correctly, they showed that of the pre-1944 cars that were tested 28 per cent. had defective brakes and 47 per cent. defective steering. That is a very high proportion of the pre-1944 cars, and I should think that that is evidence that cars of a vintage ten years old should undergo the testing experiment.</p>

<p>I was not objecting. I was pointing out that new cars, while not as dangerous, I admit, are yet very dangerous.</p>

<p>I think there will be a trend towards reducing the ten years to a shorter period eventually. A ten-year period is suggested as a start.<br/>
I want to ask the Minister about the examiners and their selection. Will those who are not his officers have, for the job of examination, any qualifications comparable with those of his own officers? Or will they be merely garage hands employed by garages, and without having had inquiry made into their qualifications? They may not have any, apart from the experience which garage hands invariably acquire simply by working for a long time at garages. Many of the people employed in garages have had no


mechanical training, and some have no mechanical knowledge. Many of them do nothing more, or very little more, than fill the petrol tanks of vehicles. If the Minister is to put persons other than his own officers to this class of work it is important that he should see they have some qualifications for it, comparable with the qualifications of his own officers, who, we know, have very high standards of attainment and proficiency.</p>

<p>I want to ask the Minister about the fees which will be paid for the testing of cars. I assume, from my reading of his new Clause, that drivers taking their cars to a testing station, whether it be a public station or a private garage which has been, so to speak, licensed for the purpose of testing, will pay fees. Is the Minister's view that the income from the fees will, over a period of years, cover the capital cost of erecting the testing station and also pay the cost of its maintenance, and so on? I think it would be helpful if the right hon. Gentleman would clear up the question of fees arising out of our experience of Hendon?<br/>
I would support my right hon. Friend the Member for Vauxhall (Mr. G. R. Strauss) in his objection to the use of private garages as testing stations. My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Ilkston (Mr. Oliver) has just asked questions about testers in the private garages, how they will be selected, and what standard will be laid down to which they must conform. There is another factor. It will not be possible to select only a man to be a tester. It will be necessary to select the garage, too. The state and size of the garage will have to be such that testing can be done there.<br/>
I can foresee conflict arising over this selection, particularly in country districts. In a country district there may be a private garage run by a very good mechanic, a first-rate mechanic. Many of us know, from our driving experience, that one can come across private garages where there are very good mechanics. However, a very good mechanic at a private garage may not be selected to be an examiner because his garage may not be of a size suitable for the testing. Down the road there may be a tied garage which the petrol companies helped to provide with a pretty expensive lay-out, and there may be room at that garage for a test bay.

There may not be so good a mechanic there, however.<br/>
The good mechanic at the small garage perhaps believes in British freedom, and does not want to become tied to great petrol companies or their garages, and wants to run his own garage, but because he has not the facilities he may lose the testing job and thereby lose the trade in repairs. As my right hon. Friend said, there may be a tie-up between the testing and the subsequent repairing, and the more expensively equipped garage, where the testing can be done, will attract the repair work. I think that that is a consideration which ought to be borne carefully in mind. I would oppose, for that reason and others, the proposal that private garages should be selected as the testing stations.</p>

<p>We have to be practical over this question of compulsory testing. According to what my right hon. Friend said in the Standing Committee upstairs, we shall want about 150 testing stations and 2,000 mechanics. In these times of shortages of men and materials it will take long to find the stations and the men and to build up this structure and to get it in good working order.<br/>
I wonder whether my right hon. Friend, in the meantime, will make some determined use of spot checking on the roads? I have always believed that we could achieve some good results by spot checking. It could be done. A spot check would take only five or ten minutes. It could be a quick and effective means of telling a driver that his car is or is not up to standard. Will my right hon. Friend say whether he proposes to use that spot checking in the meantime as a practical means of bringing about a better standard?</p>

<p>I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Vauxhall (Mr. G. R. Strauss) for putting down the new Clause in Committee and for allowing me, as the Minister who came newly to be in charge of the Bill, time at that stage to think again. I am very grateful to him for that. I do not mind how many vicissitudes we go through on this Measure, which is not a subject of party political controversy, and is an attempt to make a contribution to the solution of the problem of road safety. I do not mind how many vicissitudes I


personally go through as long as at the end I am satisfied I have obtained the best possible answer.<br/>
I should like now to answer one or two of the points which, so very fairly and well, the right hon. Gentleman has made. I was very interested in the examples he gave of the astonishing things that come to light. People who at present oppose this system of testing would not for a moment do so if they spent a day at Hendon and there saw motor owner after motor owner coming in with their cars, thinking there is nothing wrong with them, and learning that they are defective&#x2014;have defective brakes, for instance&#x2014;and constitute dangers even to the drivers themselves should they be in a crisis on the road.<br/>
I have had prepared a list of a few things which were found wrong with vehicles tested during April this year, when 979 vehicles out of 2,248 passing through the testing station were regarded as having under-vehicle items requiring attention. It is a most astonishing list. I will not go into details but it includes cracked chassis, broken springs, and dangerous steering due to a variety of causes. In some cases the steering box itself was ready to drop off. Wheel bearings were worn and tyres were dangerous.<br/>
There was almost the whole range of things that could possibly happen to a car. I am advised that in most cases the owners had not the slightest idea that these things were wrong until the cars were examined. This is, therefore, a service of value to the motorist. It is not an imposition upon him. It may well tell him something about his motor car which it is very much in his own interest that he should know.<br/>
I agree that the question of who is to do the testing is a difficult point. It caused a great deal of debate in the other place. Speeches by the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (Mr. Skeffington) and other hon. Members have shown a desire for a sense of urgency and I want to respond to the request of the right hon. Member for Vauxhall that I should show it. I accept that as a very proper criticism, but if we are to show a sense of urgency we must use every possible means to get this service into operation. That is the difficulty that faces me, and I have deliberately drawn the Clause

as widely as I can so that I shall not be debarred from using any method available. That is perhaps why I was a little too generous, as the right hon. Member for South Shields (Mr. Ede) said, in responding to the hon. Member for Salford, West (Mr. Royle), who wanted me to widen the means. I do not want to exclude any possible means of getting this most necessary job done.<br/>
If we are to get that reasonable sense of urgency I cannot see how we can hope to do this job without using ordinary public garages a great deal. I think that in many cases the general public will expect that we should use State stations where available, but I must be fair and say that we shall not have the money to build a great chain of State testing stations. A good many local authorities have service garages where they service their own vehicles. That is a useful method that might well be adopted. I undertake to have the most careful discussions with local authorities to see what use we can make of the facilities they offer, in the same way as we shall have careful discussions with the motor trade to see what facilities the private garage can offer.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Vauxhall asked what steps we propose to take against abuse. There is the possibility of abuse wherever we do the testing. There will always be the odd owner of a car who knows that it should not be on the road and takes it to a station and hopes to get by through some means or other. Therefore, there will have to be a standard of inspection by officers of my Ministry.<br/>
The case made by the Opposition is that in the private garage the likelihood of some sort of wrong inspection or of a certificate being given wrongly is greater and more difficult to police. I do not necessarily take that view. I think that it will be possible, and it will be necessary, to examine most carefully the private garages that will take part in the scheme. Equally, and this is why I cannot be specific about progress, I intend to have full consultations with the motor garage trade itself through the responsible trade organisation.<br/>
4.45 p.m.<br/>
I will take careful note of what has been said on both sides of the Committee about the best methods of doing the


job, because I have yet to draw the regulations&#x2014;as I have yet to conduct conversations and examine the position. Therefore, there is plenty of room for manoeuvre. I am advised, however, that there is no possibility of doing all this without relying to a great extent on private garages if we are to have the scheme in a foreseeable time. It would not be right to carry it out in one area and not in another. We cannot have it in London, for example, and not in the Midlands. It must be a nation-wide scheme and therefore it must use every kind of testing authority that we can find.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Vauxhall also said that he thought that my list of things that would be tested was rather restricted. I said that we would concentrate on brakes, steering and lights, subject to the general point that if a car was for any reason found to be dangerous on the road it would have to be dealt with. One of the reasons why I want to restrict the scheme to simple things is that they are not costly. To put right the things that I have mentioned is not an expensive or difficult business. It is not something that will throw a big new load on the garage business. If, for example, a car comes to Hendon and is found to be in need of a complete overhaul and reconditioning of the engine, that is an expensive matter. Whilst that might well be pointed out to the owner, it is not largely a question of road safety that it should be immediately put right. It is not something to which an owner should fear he would be subjected in this testing system. On the other hand, if the steering is affected or the brakes are well below standard, those are things which he ought to have attended to immediately, but they are neither expensive to do nor do they take a great deal of skilled labour to put right.<br/>
I say this in the light of not yet having finally made up my mind. The regulations are not prepared yet, and when they are they will have to come before the House of Commons, but the fact remains that the simpler we make the task, the less burden we put on the mechanics and the garage industry, the quicker and better we shall have this job done. Therefore, I do not want to put up an elaborate list of things which must be put right

when they may not make a contribution to the safety of the car on the road.<br/>
I was also asked by the right hon. Member for Vauxhall about the car found to be too unsafe to go on the road at all. I shall have to look at the position from the longer term point of view, but I think that we can protect matters so that, at least, the owner can get the car home. Equally, however, we must try to preserve the position that he cannot go on using the car if it is generally unsafe. I will take careful account of that point when the detailed regulations are prepared.<br/>
The last point put to me was the question of how quickly we propose to proceed. I do not want to throw this back in any way on what has been said, but if we are to make reasonably good progress we must make some use of the private garage industry, because otherwise I think the scheme will be almost indefinitely postponed. I shall see that the use we make of them is fair, reasonable and not subject to abuse.<br/>
As I have said, the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington made the case for spreading the load as widely as possible if we want to get on with this job. It will be done on a fee basis which should fairly cover the cost of installing the necessary equipment. If that is restricted to simple operations, it should not be unduly expensive. I want to make it plain that there is no question of any subsidy. The State will not pay for it; it must pay for itself.</p>

<p>I was just about to elaborate the point made by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for South Shields, as to what burden would be put upon the local authorities. I cannot accept his Amendment in those terms, but I give the assurance that no attempt will be made to pass any of this burden on to the local authorities. This must pay for itself, and in the discussions which my Department will have with the local authority associations we shall have to see how that can best be achieved.<br/>
I quite understand that the County Councils Association might be, and probably is, perturbed about the possibility that a designated local authority would have for its pains only an increased


burden to bear. I can best answer that point by making two points of my own. First, I would not designate any local authority against its wish. It must be done by negotiation and agreement. If, therefore, a local authority said that it did not wish to be designated, for the reason of expense or any other reason, I would not press the matter, much less try to coerce it.<br/>
Secondly, I hope that the fee charged for testing will be a standard one throughout the country. The question of the fee will have to be discussed thoroughly with all the interests concerned, including the local authorities, on the basis of making this a service which reasonably pays for itself. I hope I have made it plain that there is no question of placing any burden upon the local authorities, and I repeat that there is no question of them being forced to participate if they do not wish to do so.<br/>
I cannot identify individual vehicles as my hon. Friend the Member for Gravesend (Mr. Kirk) asked me to do, but of course all cars over ten years will be caught. In answer to my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for South Angus (Captain Duncan), I have power in this Clause to exempt certain classes of vehicles, such as tractors, and I shall certainly see that we do not bring in classes of vehicles which it would be impossible or impracticable to include.<br/>
As to the 18-year-old car, I have no doubt that my hon. and gallant Friend has a good and serviceable one. If that is the case, it will pass the test and he will have the additional pride of knowing that it has done so, and it will not cost him anything or be any burden on anybody else. If what my hon. and gallant Friend said is right&#x2014;and I think there is some truth in it&#x2014;some of the old cars are better kept and safer, and there is nothing to worry about because they will certainly pass the test.<br/>
The hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Ilkeston (Mr. Oliver) raised a point about the men who will carry out the tests. I hope I have indicated that the garages will be carefully selected, not necessarily as to whether they are tied or free garages or whether they have modern premises or not. I think that any garage capable of carrying out repairs will have a corner which could be allocated for this purpose. I know that some

greasing bays today are beautiful and elaborate structures, but one would not expect these to be built specially for this task. However, it is important that my expert officers should choose a garage which is capable of doing the work properly, and in it there must be a suitable place so that the owner of the car knows where he is to go. In other words, the testing bay or corner of the garage must be indicated by a sign, and there must be a suitable mechanic available to carry out the test.<br/>
Obviously, at this stage I cannot give any indication as to what steps we should take. I have indicated the steps we shall take to choose the garages, but I cannot say what steps we ought to take to ensure that there is an adequate standard of skill amongst the garage hands who will carry out the work. However. I have noted the point and I shall take it into account.</p>

<p>Do I understand that the bay would have to be used exclusively for this purpose, or might the small garage owner use it for other purposes when it is not being used for tests?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-05-30a.272.1" hansard_membership_id="10084" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/21940" speakername="Mr. Watkinson" colnum="272" time="">
<p>That is a good point. I think it is possible that in some cases the greasing bay, with its hydraulic lift, might be used for both purposes. I do not want to place a greater burden on the garage industry than is necessary. At the moment it is wiser for me to indicate my general requirements only, and to leave the specific needs until we come to the negotiations with the trade.<br/>
The answer to the question of avoidance or of not getting a sufficiently high standard is that at Hendon we have had a great deal of experience of brake-testing machines. There it is not a question of a man carrying out the test. There is a most accurate gauge which can be read and which records whether the brakes conform to a satisfactory standard or not. The skill of the operator does not enter into the matter because the machine does the job. Fortunately, it is not an expensive machine to mass-produce if necessary. I am trying to point out that we want a simple test, with simple yet practical machines doing most of the work. In this way there will be no necessity for a man to decide on his own experience and judgment whether


the standard of the vehicle is satisfactory or not. I hope it will be much more like reading a chart.<br/>
Finally, my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Mr. Gresham Cooke) asked if this meant that I would not continue the spot check procedure. Of course, I have powers already to use that procedure under existing legislation. Those powers are tidied up and expanded in another part of the Bill and I consider it to be essential to have both. Spot checking on the road will, on certain occasions, be a useful incentive to people to have their cars tested voluntarily before their time has arrived. This I shall welcome as long as the testing stations can handle it; so the answer to my hon. Friend is that both spot checking and compulsory periodic checking once a year are both necessary if we are to get the results we want.<br/>
I believe that I have answered most of the points raised in the general discussion, but I shall be pleased to answer any other detailed points later.</p>

<p>I want to ask one or two questions and to make some comments on what the Minister has said. First, may I ask a question which I should have asked previously? What is the attitude of the right hon. Gentleman to our Amendment, to add at the end of the new Clause:
<q>The Minister shall lay annually before Parliament a report on the operation and the results of this and of the next following section"?</q>
I assume that the right hon. Gentleman will have no objection, but as we may have to vote on the Amendment, perhaps the Minister will indicate whether it is his intention to accept it.<br/>
In the course of his remarks the Minister again emphasised the desirability of keeping these tests to the minimum and one agrees in principle. The Minister again said that the essentials were to test the brakes, steering and lights.

That is true, but I must repeat what I said, that there are a number of other components of great importance which ought to be tested. They would not take much time or require special apparatus. For example, a test should be made to see that the direction indicators are working properly. This might be exceedingly important on a rainy night because, if they are not working, an accident might be caused.<br/>
5.0 p.m.<br/>
The next test is to ensure that the windscreen wiper is working properly, which is equally important. The third is to make sure that there is a rear-view mirror. The fourth is to ensure that the tyres are in proper condition. A defective tyre may result in a blow-out and an appalling accident may take place involving death. I suggest that the compulsory testing should cover at least these other four things, and should not necessarily be confined to the three read out by the Minister, because that would be ridiculous.<br/>
Next, has the Minister really said his last word about the relative importance of the private garage compared with what one might call the public authority garage for testing vehicles? At the moment I feel wholly dissatisfied with the Minister's reply. He told us that he will have to put a very great deal of reliance on the private garage. What does that mean? I still want to know. Does it mean that private garages will be used in exceptional cases only? If so, we do not disagree with the right hon. Gentleman. But I fear from the general tenor of his remarks that use of private garages will be the order rather than the exception. I do not think it is unreasonable of us, knowing the Government's prejudices against all forms of public enterprise, to feel that the Government will put much greater emphasis on the private garage than on the State or the local authority garage.<br/>
I was not a bit convinced by the right hon. Gentleman's arguments against having State garages. I gathered that there were two arguments. One advanced in the Standing Committee was the difficulty of obtaining the necessary men. The number of men who would be involved, spread over the country, would not be so very great. As the Minister himself argued, some of the tests are


effectively done by machines, and highly skilled men are not required. I can confirm what the Minister said about the braking test, for I had the brakes of my car tested. One drives the car on to a certain apparatus and applies the brakes, and a column on which there are four glass dials shows whether or not the brakes are working effectively. Anybody could do that. It does not require a highly skilled man. It could well be done by someone who was invalided out of industry and could not do a strenuous job. We want people of good character who are able to discuss the matter and approach the motorist in the proper way, but we do not want highly skilled people to do these jobs. I should have thought that it would be sufficient to have one or two highly skilled people in charge of each garage. The Minister is wrong to put so much emphasis on that point.<br/>
Secondly, he says that there will not be much money available for building the garages required for the task. I have two answers to that. First, it may not be necessary to build many garages, if any. Garages often change hands, and the Minister could take over some which are being sold and use them for this public service. He would then not have to put up so many buildings.<br/>
Even if the Minister has to put up new buildings, they are not elaborate. Indeed, they are perfectly simple brick sheds. The total cost of putting up about 150 brick sheds, if they were all new ones, would be insignificant compared with the benefits which we can expect from the scheme, including the saving of hundreds of lives. It is ridiculous to suggest that there will not be the money to build sufficient garages or that it is not possible to use existing buildings for the purpose.<br/>
Unless the right hon. Gentleman can give us something much more persuasive than he has done so far in favour of the use of private garages as against public garages, I have no doubt that my hon. Friends and I shall wish to record our vote upon this very important matter when we reach our Amendments after having dealt with the Clause. We approve the Clause as a whole, but we believe that our important Amendments are absolutely essential to make the scheme a good one. We have also in mind that abuses are bound to arise if

private garages are doing this work to a considerable extent, and the whole system will then get into disrepute in the eyes of the motorists and the public generally. We do not want that to happen, and it should not happen. The work should be done by public enterprise. The only really effective method is to make it a public test. Only rarely should private garages do this important work.</p>

<p>Perhaps I might answer the right hon. Gentleman now. His last Amendment in the series asks me to lay before Parliament a report on the operation of the Clause. I take it that he means that it shall be a report once a year when the scheme is in full swing and that it should, presumably, record the number of cars tested. I cannot accept the Amendment, but I will accept the principle that, once the scheme is in full operation, I should find a way of keeping Parliament informed of progress, the number of cars tested, and so on. I should not wish to bind myself to an annual report, although I would agree to finding a way of keeping Parliament properly informed about the progress of the operation.<br/>
As to the right hon. Gentleman's other point, what he said was what I meant when I spoke about having, apart from a test of steering, brakes and lights, a condition of general safety. For example, if an examining mechanic saw that a tyre was slit inside and was likely to blow out, he would obviously inform the car owner so that he might put it right. Although I will take carefully into account what the right hon. Gentleman and other hon. Members have said, we have yet to have the necessary discussions and I do not think we want to have too long a list of the tests which have to be carried out to complete the inspection. I do not necessarily rule out windscreen wipers, trafficators, or anything else. I merely say that my desire is to restrict the list to the minimum number of items which are really necessary for the actual safety of the vehicle on the road.<br/>
As to the most important point whether we do this as a State service or by means of a mixture of private and public enterprise, I cannot go any further than I have gone except to say that I think that most hon. Members would not, on the whole, disagree that we want the scheme in


operation in a reasonable time and we obviously cannot build up a great new chain of testing stations all over the country very quickly or very cheaply, despite what the right hon. Gentleman said.<br/>
What we will do is to examine most carefully all the ways of doing it. That is why the Clause has been drawn in its present form. I am advised, for example, that it may be possible to devise a mobile testing station which could be taken round scattered rural areas on a lorry and trailer and thus save motorists from having to drive considerable distances to have their vehicles tested. My hon. and gallant Friend the Member for South Angus (Captain Duncan) referred to this matter in relation to Scotland. We will certainly ascertain what facilities local authorities can offer us. We shall be very glad if they can offer us facilities.<br/>
However, I really cannot bind myself at this stage to say that I will do it one way or the other. All I will say is that we want to do it as quickly as possible. I want to do it well and fairly. Provided that I am satisfied on those points, we must merely ascertain how we can best do it, bearing in mind that up to this moment it has not been possible to have discussions with anybody. We shall certainly see what we can first do through our own resources. Perhaps a mobile testing station might be useful. We shall then see what facilities local authorities can offer us. At the same time, we shall see what facilities private garages can offer. Out of all these things we shall try to pick what we think is a fair and reasonable method of doing the test and making it pay for itself. That is as far as I can go now.</p>

<p>Will not the right hon. Gentleman be a little more forthcoming about laying a report before Parliament about the operation of the Clause? Surely it is reasonable for us to ask him to inform Parliament about how the testing works out and what results from it. There are various publications by the Ministry. We have the Annual Report on Road Accidents, which, although it comes out somewhat late, contains a very great deal of valuable information. The Minister is starting a most important undertaking, and we feel that it would be of value to Parliament to be informed about the results. I urge

the Minister to think about the matter again and to consider accepting the Amendment.</p>

<q>(3) Where, not less than two months before the beginning of any financial year, the Minister on an examination of arrangements proposed to be made under the last foregoing subsection by a local authority in England or Wales, not being the council of a county or county borough, is satisfied that arrangements so made are likely to be effective and notifies the local authority that he is so satisfied, then from the beginning of that year until a notification by the Minister to the local authority that he is no longer so satisfied takes effect, the expenditure of the county council in respect of the cost of arrangements, or of contributions, made by the county council under the last foregoing subsection shall not be chargeable on the area of the first mentioned authority.</q>
<q>A notification by the Minister that he is no longer satisfied as aforesaid shall take effect at the end of the financial year in which it is given or, if it is given during the last two months of a financial year, at the end of the next following financial year.</q>
This is an Amendment to give effect to a promise which I made in Committee. The hon. Member for Rossendale (Mr. Anthony Greenwood) pointed out that there were cases in which ratepayers might have a reasonable ground of complaint if they were precepted by the county council for road safety purposes. Where a non-county borough or urban district in England or Wales incurs expenditure on its own scheme for road safety information and road training and does not therefore need to participate in the county scheme, it seems unjust that it should be precepted for the benefit of the county. I said in Committee that we were satisfied that there was a point of


substance in that view, and the Amendment gives effect to the undertaking which I gave.</p>

<p>I beg to move, as an Amendment to the proposed Amendment, at the end to add:
<q>This subsection shall not apply to the administrative county of London.</q>
I hope that the Committee will realise that in moving this Amendment I do not desire to put London in a separate category for any other than practical reasons. As the Joint Parliamentary Secretary's Amendment is now drafted, it would have an unfortunate effect in the case of the London County Council&#x2014;a body unique in the structure of English local government. There is no area within the boundaries of the London County Council which is not in fact already covered by one of the 28 Metropolitan borough councils or the Common Council of the City of London.<br/>
Circumstances could easily arise where every one of the 28 Metropolitan boroughs and the Common Council of the City of London were engaging in road safety propaganda of one kind or another. Each of those authorities could therefore get the special sanction which it is proposed to confer upon them under the Joint Parliamentary Secretary's Amendment. The result would be that the largest local authority in the country&#x2014; indeed, in the world&#x2014;would have no funds with which to conduct its own road safety propaganda. I am informed that that is the legal position, and that there would be no way under existing law whereby the county council could finance any road safety propaganda.<br/>
It is obvious that a body like London County Council might feel it desirable to undertake road safety activity in connection with the 440,000 children in its schools. Under the Minister's new Amendment it would have no resources to do that work. Because London County Council, being a precepting authority of this kind, is in an exceptional position, we hope that the Minister will sympathetically consider my Amendment. It is clear that any action which the county council took would equally benefit any one of the 28 Metropolitan boroughs or the Common Council of the City of London. In London, any of the work done by the L.C.C. would undoubtedly

benefit the whole of the county but, as the Joint Parliamentary Secretary's Amendment now stands, London County Council would have the greatest difficulty in paying for any work which it wanted to do.<br/>
5.15 p.m.<br/>
I understand that the Amendment has the support at any rate of a number of the Metropolitan borough councils, if not all of them, and there is no rivalry among the authorities in London on this matter. In the past the county council has always been able to make very satisfactory arrangements for joint activities of this kind with the boroughs. I am advised that the Joint Parliamentary Secretary's Amendment would put the county council in a particularly embarrassing position. If some boroughs undertook safety work and some did not it would mean levying a special rate. I hope that on these purely practical grounds the Minister will be able to make an exception in the case of London County Council.</p>

<p>I am sure that we have all listened with interest and some degree of sympathy to what the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (Mr. Skeffington) has said on behalf of the London County Council. I fear, however, that I cannot advise the Committee to accept his Amendment. I say that for three reasons. The first is that the principle put forward in the Standing Committee, and which commended itself to the Committee, is one which is obviously equitable and which ought to be of general application. I do not feel that a special exception should be made in the case of London County Council.<br/>
The second reason is that, on the whole, the Metropolitan boroughs are in a better position to operate effective road safety schemes in their areas than is the more remote London County Council. I am glad to have this opportunity of paying tribute to the extremely effective work being. done by a number of Metropolitan boroughs. Thirdly, we have received representations from the Metropolitan Boroughs Standing Joint Committee supporting the principle embodied in my Amendment.<br/>
The hon. Member's Amendment would put London County Council in an exceptional position. London County Council's present contribution to road safety


now consists only of a &#x00A3;60 subscription to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents and a further subscription last year of &#x00A3;2,370 towards the cost of the training and exhibition centre at ROSPA House. Although the Royal Society would feel the loss of that subscription, it would not be unreasonable for the Metropolitan boroughs, which under this Amendment would be able to contract out of an obligation to pay a precept, themselves to undertake that responsibility. In view of the attitude which has been taken by the Metropolitan boroughs, it would be better for us not to accept the hon. Member's Amendment.</p>

<p>I have listened to what the Joint Parliamentary Secretary has said: it was a very discouraging answer for London County Council. It has pursued a number of safety activities in past years. There are also great possibilities in connection with more than 400,000 schoolchildren. The Government Amendment will deprive it of the opportunity of carrying out this sort of work. I hope that the Minister will think again about this matter.<br/>
Furthermore, it is not my information&#x2014;the Minister's information may be later&#x2014;that all the Metropolitan boroughs subscribed to the point of view which he has now put forward. I understand that that was not so in the case of Westminster, and Lambeth and others. I would ask the Minister to have another look at this matter, because the Government Amendment will place the London County Council in a very unfortunate position. It will not be able to take much part in this very necessary propaganda work in future if it has no funds with which to do so.</p>

<p>Can the Minister tell us exactly how far he has got with his communications with the Metropolitan borough councils? From the answer which he has made he seems to assume that all the Metropolitan borough councils would agree to carry on the work. If they do the activities of the London County Council in this subject would be brought to an end at once. I do not know how far, as the local education authority, it would he able to deal with instruction in road safety to children in schools. It might be able to, or it might not. It certainly would not be able to do so as the road safety authority if all the

borough councils availed themselves of the opportunity given them in the Clause.<br/>
Let us assume that the two borough councils mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington (Mr. Skeffington) do not come in. In that case the London County Council remains the road safety authority for them, and may spend money within their borders&#x2014;but it must be very careful not to charge any of that money to the other twenty-six councils, or to the county council. We shall then have one of those amazing and awkward things, namely, a special expenses rate, levied upon the one or two or more boroughs&#x2014;not reaching the total of twenty-eight&#x2014;which have not come into the scheme. That would be a very unfortunate result for any local authority to have to face. The Minister might enlighten us as to how far that point of view has been considered, and what is the real effect of any communication which he has had from the Metropolitan Boroughs Standing Joint Committee or the Metropolitan boroughs separately.</p>

<p>As a result of the discussion which took place in Committee we got in touch with the Metropolitan Boroughs Standing Joint Committee. That Committee speaks for the Metropolitan boroughs as a whole, and we really cannot enter into discussions with individual Metropolitan boroughs when they have this Standing Joint Committee to represent them. It was when we were considering how to give effect to the promise which I made to the hon. Member for Rossendale (Mr. Anthony Greenwood) that we discussed the matter with the Committee. It informed us that it supported the Amendment.<br/>
I am quite willing to give further consideration to the points which have been raised by the right hon. Member for South Shields (Mr. Ede) and the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (Mr. Skeffington), but I must make it quite plain that, as at present advised, I do not think we shall alter the view which we have formed. I made what amounted to a promise on behalf of the Government, and we must carry out that promise. I see great difficulty in making a special exception to the general provisions of the law in favour of the London County Council. I have already indicated that


up to the present time&#x2014;I am not in any way reproaching the London County Council in this matter&#x2014;excellent road safety propaganda is carried on in London, and it is the work of the Metropolitan boroughs. Up to the present time the activities of the London County Council in this respect have been extremely small, although the subscriptions which it has made to the Royal Society have been valuable.<br/>
Therefore, I do not think that, from what I have heard today, there would be any justification for accepting the hon. Gentleman's Amendment to the proposed Amendment, which I think would introduce an anomaly into the law. In view of what has been said, however, I gladly undertake to look at the matter again, and if I am convinced about it there is still, fortunately, an opportunity of effecting an Amendment elsewhere.</p>

<p>I do not want to be unduly importunate, but I would point out that, because of its peculiar structure and status, the London County Council is already an exception in a great number of other local government matters. The whole system of precepting in London is different from that in other areas. It has its own special powers in a number of respects. It is a housing authority, which other county councils are not. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will not feel that because my Amendment to the proposed Amendment would make the London County Council an exception in this respect, that is the end of the matter. The London County Council is bound to be an exception, because of its artificial creation in 1888 out of other existing counties and because of its special position as capital of the Commonwealth. I hope that the Minister will bear that fact in mind in reconsidering the whole matter.<br/>

<p>When we considered this question, which deals with the subject of London traffic, we found that there was an omission in the Bill as originally presented. I can best explain how it came to notice by reminding the Committee of a recent action by the City of Westminster. I am grateful to the City of Westminster for the great interest which it is taking in the immensely difficult parking and traffic problems which lie within its area. As a result of the interest which it has taken it has given a great deal of examination to the problem, and a special sub-committee of the Westminster City Council has recommended:
<q>That the Council do inform the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation that it views with growing concern the worsening of traffic conditions in inner London caused by the increase in the parking of cars in streets and it suggests that in order that the effect of parking meters on congestion may be assessed an experiment with such meters should be undertaken as soon as possible on the understanding that the various regulations relating to parking cars will be effectively enforced.</q>
We expect that, as our parking plans develop, other local authorities in London will take the view that the right way to deal with the parking meter is to experiment with it. There is a very sound precedent for all this in the traffic schemes which the police have set up, on an experimental basis for a purely limited period, to see how they work, and what is the response of the motoring public.<br/>
Under the Bill as it was drafted, I found that I had not the powers to assist a local authority in a scheme of this kind if I wished to do so. Equally, I found that if certain local authorities decided to install parking meters and another local authority, surrounded by them, decided not to do so, I should not be able to help the authority in the centre which, perhaps, felt that it ought not to

introduce these meters unless it had some help from me. I should not be able to run an experimental scheme to try to show it that this method of controlling parking might be helpful in its area.<br/>
5.30 p.m.<br/>
Therefore, the purpose of these two Amendments is merely to give me a very limited power so as to enable me to show that these parking plans can be worked successfully, and, equally, to enable me to work with those London authorities who want to carry out experimental schemes. Of course, if the authorities are willing to carry out such schemes entirely on their own, my help will be largely of an advisory nature, but I want powers to set up parking meters, for which I shall bear the burden for a limited time, and to try to show that they provide a practical method for controlling parking.<br/>
I think that I ought to make it clear that my power to run any parking place is expressly limited to two years with the possibility of an extension for a further twelve months, but that in any event it cannot be for a period longer than three years. It is not my intention to accept any permanent responsibility for the operation of parking places, but merely, as I have said, to assist local authorities in much the same way as do the police in experimental traffic schemes.<br/>
The remainder of the material on the Order Paper really deals with the various safeguards and with matters concerning the cost of the experiment. Here, again, I should perhaps make plain that in the same way as I am limited to a definite period during which the scheme can be run, so I am limited as regards the money that I may collect. At the end of such a scheme the money has to be passed over to the appropriate local authority except that, of course. I can recover any direct cost of the scheme before I hand over the balance.<br/>
Perhaps I might sum up by saying that I think that this is a useful addition which will enable me to respond to what seems to be a desire on the part of at least some important authorities in London to use the parking meter as a method for controlling the alarming growth of congestion in the streets due to cars being left for long periods. Therefore, I hope that with that explanation the Committee will accept the Amendment.</p>

<p>As the Minister stated, this Amendment remedies an omission in the Bill. It is rather remarkable that there should have been so many gaps to be filled in during the passage of the Bill in view of the fact that it is the second Bill which we have had before us and in view of the time which was spent on the Second Readings of the two Bills&#x2014;on the first one in another place&#x2014;and the long period of the Committee stage. But, be that as it may, we on this side of the Committee have no objection to the Amendment.<br/>
I was glad that the Minister used the word "experimental" because many of us have some doubts as to the way in which the parking meter will operate in this country and to what extent it will be effective. Any experiment to lessen traffic congestion in London is certainly to be welcomed and it is hoped that the scheme will succeed. Many of us have doubts about certain aspects of the effectiveness of the parking meter and it is as well that the Minister should be enabled to undertake some experimental schemes to see to what extent they are acceptable to local authorities.<br/>
I should be glad if the Minister would tell us who will be responsible for enforcing the time limit on the meters. When the time has expired and the signal on the meter shows that the time has expired, who is to be responsible for imposing the fine, the summons, or whatever the penalty may be, upon the motorist? That was never really made clear in Standing Committee, and I am still uncertain as to what exactly the Minister has in mind on this point. If he is to run these car parks, does he intend to employ attendants whose duty it will be to accost the motorist when he returns and finds that his time has expired? It would be helpful if the Minister could make quite clear what he has in mind in this regard.<br/>
Has the Minister any schemes in mind for installing parking meters in the centre of London? Again, in Standing Committee, we were never given any very clear indication as to what exactly the Minister had in mind concerning the areas in which parking meters are to be installed or whether they are to be in the side streets, in the squares, or in the main traffic arteries. Nor has the Minister given any clear indication as

to the protection to be afforded for access to buildings in the neighbourhood of these parking places. As this will probably be our only opportunity to discuss the question of car parks, perhaps the Minister could be a little more explicit about what he has in mind.</p>

<p>I wish to support this admirable Amendment which extends the power of the Minister. In the Standing Committee I did not observe the hon. Member for Enfield, East (Mr. Ernest Davies) or any of his hon. Friends raise any criticism which led to the increase of these necessary powers, but I remember that a number of us raised the question whether the designation of parking places should not remain entirely the responsibility of the Ministry of Transport. I think that the conclusion come to was that, on balance, it was better for the local authorities to administer the scheme. But it is clearly necessary for the Minister to have some further residual powers, which he takes under this Amendment, to enable him to operate the experiments of designation where the local authority does not come fully up to the mark.<br/>
I should like my right hon. Friend to tell me whether I am right in supposing that in London he will ensure that a sufficiently wide area is taken to ensure that the scheme is a thoroughly successful experiment, because we all know that the London driver today is peculiarly cunning at getting round the parking provisions. We are all sinners in this respect. We first try to find a parking place and then find that we cannot get into it. With great ingenuity we are prepared to drive up on to the pavement in, say, Park Lane and park our cars outside somebody's private house. That is being done every day. It seems to me, therefore, that the Report of the Traffic Advisory Committee&#x2014;and the Report of the Ministry of Transport upon which, I presume, the Minister will rely as to the number of places to be designated&#x2014;is really insufficient.<br/>
At one time I went into this matter very carefully and prepared a scheme covering certain areas in London. It would seem, for example, that if we take an area such as the district around Harrods we must ensure that all the surrounding squares and the area at the back of Harrods are covered by parking places,


because, otherwise, people will avoid going to the places where they have to pay to park and will go a bit further afield. If that happened, it would merely mean that the congestion would be driven from the centre of London to the surrounding residential districts. For that reason the Minister may have to take an area which covers not only Westminster, but also Chelsea and perhaps the City of London. I am not certain that the Minister has taken sufficient powers under this Amendment to ensure that he will be able to take in an area which can be blanketed so effectively that the whole of it can be fully covered with parking places, thus preventing people from evading their responsibilities in the matter. That is the worry which I have had throughout about parking meters.<br/>
I have always been a protagonist of them as one of the solutions, taken collectively with others, to meet the traffic congestion problem. But they will fail&#x2014;and I think that they will only fail&#x2014;if people are able to leave an area where there are parking meters and go to another area where there are no parking meters. I should like to see them brought into force in the whole of the centre of the West End of London at the same time, with altogether about 2,500 parking places, which is considerably in excess of double the number recommended in the Report.<br/>
If that can be done, I think that the scheme will be successful and that after the initial pains of screaming motorists who have to pay for the first few weeks, we shall go on to what has been the accepted feeling of motorists and other people in other parts of the world where, in a short space of time, they have come to accept parking meters as a satisfactory provision which is for the benefit of all concerned.</p>

<p>I am one of those who favour the possible introduction of parking meters. I think that they will be for the convenience of motorists and of the local authority, and that if a reasonable charge is imposed they should not cause very great hardship, except on one section of the community. I should like to ask the Minister whether, in setting up his experimental scheme, he has thought about how

he can avoid the infliction of severe hardship on disabled people.<br/>
There are many ex-Service men suffering from war wounds, victims of industrial injuries and members, for example, of the Infantile Paralysis Fellowship who must use motor-propelled vehicles. If they have to pay a parking meter charge every time they park their vehicles, I can see that those people, who are usually not very well able to afford such charges, will be under a special handicap.<br/>
I should like to draw this point to the attention of the Minister, and ask him whether he has thought about it, and whether he has any solution to offer as to how such people can be dealt with in connection with the parking of motor-propelled vehicles.</p>

<p>One point which intrigues me in respect of parking meters is how the Ministry's scheme will be put into operation. Is it intended that the parking meters should merely register the sums or the time for which coins are put in the box? There seems to be no explanation as to how any excess is to be collected.<br/>
When my right hon. Friend the Member for Huyton (Mr. H. Wilson) and I were in New York together for about a fortnight before Christmas we went to a number of parking places where there was not one meter that was not registering an excess. I am told that this is a simple matter in the United States because the police impose the charge; but that does not apply here.<br/>
What system are we intending to work with regard to these experimental meters? Is it intended to have a parking attendant to collect the fee when a motorist continues to park in a position in excess of the period for which he has paid. If not, what means will there be of collecting the excess if a motorist drives away? Will there be any check or any prospect of getting the fee which he ought to have paid? That seems to be the problem in deciding whether we should be in favour of this experimental scheme.<br/>
We want to know a little more about what the Minister has in mind, because if there is to be an attendant to see that no one gets away when there is excess on the charge for which the motorist has paid, what is the purpose of having the


meters at all? I should like this matter to be explained so that we can come to some reasonable conclusion about what the Minister has in mind.</p>

<p>It is very agreeable to us to find that, at this late stage in the discussion of the Bill, no hon. Member has risen to express hostility to parking meters. When the Bill was introduced originally there was loud protest at the idea of the introduction of this useful contrivance. I think that it is as a result of the general discussion which has taken place, and of the fact that parking meters are working so satisfactorily in Canada, the United States, New Zealand and other places overseas, that opinion in this country has changed.<br/>
I am very glad to have the opportunity of explaining somewhat fully to hon. Members how we have it in mind to try to work the parking meter system. First, let me say that we are under no illusion that the use of parking meters will increase the amount of parking accommodation in London. The effect of them will be to ensure that no single, selfish person is able to peg out a claim in a part of a street for the lifelong day. Such parking space as there is will be more fairly and equitably divided among those who have occasion to leave a car in a parking place for a reasonably short time.<br/>
We also fully recognise that it is desirable to provide greatly increased off-the-street parking accommodation for cars that are to be there for a long time. It has, I think, done a great deal to disarm criticism of these proposals that the whole of the profits made from parking meters are obliged, under the provisions of the Bill, to be used for the provision of off-the-street parking accommodation. What might appear at first sight to be a slight exception to that is contained in the Amendment which my right hon. Friend has moved. But that exception is more apparent than real, as he is only intending to use&#x2014;and, indeed, can only use&#x2014;these powers in order to give a start to the experiment. At the conclusion of three years, at the longest, he will be obliged to hand the parking meter organisation over to a local authority.<br/>
I want also to say, in order to disarm criticism in advance, that the parking

meter system is no more incapable of abuse than any other human device. We are fully willing to admit that the ingenuity of man will be exercised to try to defeat the purpose of the scheme; and that can be avoided only by careful supervision and, let me add, by the willingness which generally we can rely upon among the British people to co-operate with the Government when something is being introduced which is deemed to be for the general benefit.<br/>
Having said that by way of precaution, I will now try to describe in fuller detail exactly how we intend that the scheme should work. Parking places where a charge may be made for parking on the highway will be appointed by the Minister by orders made under the Bill. When applications for the appointment of such parking places are made by local authorities, they will be considered by the Minister before he makes an order to determine whether he approves of the general scheme of which they are part. Parking schemes should each cover a fairly wide area and should take into account, in addition to parking meters, existing and planned parking accommodation off the street.<br/>
I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for the Isle of Thanet (Mr. Rees-Davies) will accept my thanks for the constant propaganda he has gone in for in favour of the experiments being on a sufficiently large scale. He certainly convinced me that if they are too small, the only effect will be to drive cars out of one street into the next. I am glad to say that the police recognise that the parking meters will be effective only if they are able and willing to enforce no-parking restrictions in places where parking meters do not exist or where parking is not otherwise authorised.<br/>
Once parking places have been appointed, they will be run by the local authority or, in particular cases, by my right hon. Friend under the provisions of the new Clause, and attendants will be appointed to look after them. The attendants will look out for and report infringements of the regulations, report defective meters and generally supervise the parking places.<br/>
The question of excess charges has caused a good deal of confusion in the public mind. I understand that in some


countries the police have powers to accept fines on the spot without going through the procedure of the courts. Obviously, that would great simplify the administration of parking meters. In this country, however, we are opposed to anything of that kind, which, quite obviously, would, or might, lead to abuse. We therefore propose a different method. As hon. Members will be aware, the Sharpe Committee, which recently considered expediting the procedure in police courts, expressly recommended against the adoption of any scheme of that kind.<br/>
Parking places will be intended to cater for short-term parkers. In these parking places, a motorist will be allowed to leave his car for a standard period, probably for two hours, on payment of a specified charge. It will be a fairly modest charge, because short-term parking on the road with the help of a parking meter is considered to be a legitimate thing to do. The parking meter will indicate when the period of time paid for may be deemed to have expired. From that moment, the driver of the car will become liable to pay the excess charge.<br/>
That is no fine. It is an additional rent for the use of the space on the road. It is intended that that excess charge shall be very substantially in excess of the small charge which is paid for the standard period. The amount of the excess charge will be fixed by order. Only if a car remains in the parking place beyond the total period covered by the excess charge will an offence be committed.</p>

<p>I do not mind giving an idea, provided it is perfectly plain that I am only giving an idea and am in no way binding my right hon. Friend. The kind of thing we have in mind would be 1s. for the first hour and 2s. for two hours, but we also have in mind that the excess charge for staying for two hours and ten minutes might be 7s. 6d. or 10s.; so that there is a jump from the small charge for the legitimate use of the parking meter for a limited and proper period up to the excess charge.</p>

<p>I am not getting into the realm of theoretical jurisprudence in considering what the nature of a fine may be, but I would say that a fine is the punishment imposed by a court for committing an offence&#x2014;I see my right hon. and learned Friend the Lord Advocate on the bench beside me and I trust I am not going wrong in these legal matters&#x2014;whereas the excess charge to which I have referred is a charge made for the use of the highway and does not in any way involve the commission of an offence.</p>

<p>I was merely indicating that for the standard period the charge would be small and the excess charge would be heavy.<br/>
The attendant in charge of a parking place will record the particulars of any car left at a meter which indicates that the time has expired. He will place on the car a note containing a statement of the time he first observed that it had become liable for the excess charge. The note will also indicate how and when the excess charge should be paid. We have in mind that the excess charge will be sent by post to the local authority which is responsible for the parking-meter system in the area.<br/>
Any car remaining in a parking place after the expiry of the time paid for, plus the maximum time allowed after the excess charge has been incurred, will not only be committing an offence but will also be liable to be removed from the parking place; and the cost of removing and storing it will be recoverable from the driver. That is obviously necessary as otherwise there might be cases when a car would be left beside a parking meter throughout the whole of one day and then throughout the night and be there the day after.<br/>

I have responded to the requests of hon. Members to indicate how we intend to work this system. I have made it plain that we have not worked out all the details and that very wide powers are given by the Bill to my right hon. Friend to make regulations dealing with this matter. It will therefore be possible for there to be complete flexibility about special problems. For example, those in the market towns may very well be different from the problems to be dealt with in London.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That the Clause be read a Second time.<br/>
This new Clause deals with the second part of the Bill and concerns the compulsory testing of motor vehicles. The first new Clause we have dealt with deals with the establishment and running of testing stations. This Clause sets out what vehicles must be taken to those stations and at what intervals and the sanctions for non-observance. I will remind the Committee of the main points of the Clause. Subsection (1) makes it an offence to use on the roads a motor vehicle to which the Clause applies and in respect of which no test certificate has been issued within the last twelve months.<br/>
Subsection (2) specifies vehicles which must undergo the tests and they are defined as vehicles first registered not less than ten years ago. It is only intended to start with the provision for vehicles older than ten years and it is the policy progressively to expand the field in which a much large number of motor cars will eventually fall under the test requirements.<br/>
Subsection (2) exempts
<q>public service vehicles adapted to carry eight or more passengers</q>

and trams and trolley buses, because the road-worthiness of those vehicles is dealt with under existing legislation. It enables me to exempt by regulation vehicles of specified classes or descriptions and to restrict the testing to vehicles registered at the material time with specified local taxation authorities.<br/>
That enables the system of testing to be made compulsory by stages and by selection. For example, it would be possible to apply it first only to private cars or to goods vehicles up to a certain weight and to exempt all other classes. The purpose is to make the provisions flexible and to bring in the testing of vehicles at a reasonable speed so that the testing stations may be able to cope.</p>

<p>Will the right hon. Gentleman make clear whether goods vehicles are to be included in the inspection? I think that this is the first time it has been suggested that goods vehicles would be subject to the testing.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-05-30a.306.1" hansard_membership_id="10084" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/21940" speakername="Mr. Watkinson" colnum="306" time="">
<p>Because of the capacity of the testing stations, I think that at first the testing will have to be restricted to private cars. I wish to consider the question of including some light goods vehicles. It may be possible that


they can be, or are, covered in other ways. The right answer to the hon. Gentleman is that at present the intention is to restrict the testing to private cars.<br/>
There are one or two other classes of vehicles which may have to be exempted. For example, there are vehicles temporarily imported into the country by tourists. There are also vehicles of special types, such as bulldozers. The subsection is one which makes the whole thing flexible.<br/>
Subsection (3) enables me to make the testing compulsory for vehicles of such an age less than ten years as I may specify in the future. By this subsection, I am enabled to widen the scope. The other points contained in this Clause are technical points. Subsection (4) enables me to exempt vehicles which have been laid up and must go for a test before they can again be licensed. Subsection (5) makes the issue of the vehicle Excise licence dependent on the production of a current test certificate. This link with the Excise licence is desirable to ensure that a vehicle is submitted regularly for testing. Subsection (6) provides that the regulations made under this Clause, as in the case of those made under the first Clause, will be subject to the negative Resolution procedure and will have to be brought before the House.<br/>
The Clause as a whole is widely drawn to enable the maximum flexibility to be exercised in its operation. It is intended to bring in the private motor car over ten years old, but the Clause is so drawn that, as we make progress with the scheme, we can make cars of a lesser age subject to the test, if we so desire. I am given full powers to examine classes of vehicles or vehicles not subject to the test and to deal with special cases such as vehicles which have been laid up and must come for a test before they can be licensed, and other special matters of that kind. The Clause does not meet one or two of the points brought forward by the hon. Gentleman opposite, but no doubt they will be raised in the form of Amendments.</p>

<p>I gather that if one wishes to make any general comment about the Clause, now is the opportunity to do so. I was interested to hear the Minister say that he had not made up his mind whether goods vehicles are to

be included in the test. The reason for omitting goods vehicles is, I think, because there already exists spot checking of goods vehicles to some extent. But it is not a great extent, and I hope that the Minister will consider carefully the question of the large number of trade vans over ten years old which are on the roads and the danger they may present. They would seem to be as great a danger as the private motor cars.<br/>
Before he comes to a decision, I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will review that aspect to see whether it may be desirable to include goods vehicles.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in line 9, at the end to insert:
<q>and those which are sold after the coming into operation of this section and were first registered as aforesaid not less than three years before that sale".</q>
With your consent, Sir Charles, it might be convenient if, with this Amendment. we discussed the other two Amendments in the names of myself and my hon. Friends, namely, in the same line, at the end to insert:
<q>and (on the occasion of a sale and for twelve months thereafter) those which are sold after the coming into operation of this section and were first registered as aforesaid not less than three years before that sale".</q>
and in line 16, after "years", to insert:
<q>or for three years, as the case may be</q>
The Minister has drawn the Clause fairly widely and seems to be making an effort to deal with most of the difficulties which arise by reason of faulty vehicles being on the roads. In my opinion, the first thing the Minister should have tackled is the trafficking which goes on in second-hand cars. That is the reason why a great number of defective second-hand vehicles find their way on to the roads.<br/>
We consider that the 10-year age limit is too high. A vehicle which has been driven hard for ten years is usually in a parlous condition. Judging from the vehicles which one sees on the roads today, many are in a bad condition long before they are ten years old. I listened


to the argument advanced earlier by the hon. and gallant Member for South Angus (Captain Duncan). The hon. and gallant Member said that he had a car which was 18 years old and which was better than many modern cars.</p>

<p>The Minister has not included in this Clause a proviso that vehicles, when they are sold, must be examined, and that if the vehicle changes hands again a year or so later there should be a further examination before it is allowed on the road.<br/>
We need only look at the daily Press to realise that there are a number of unscrupulous dealers who are prepared to take advantage of people with little experience of cars and to sell to them vehicles which are in a very bad condition.<br/>
A large number of the defects which have been discovered at Hendon were probably unsuspected by the owners. I do not charge the owners with having wilfully driven a car with headlights which were out of focus, nor do I suggest that the majority of drivers drive a car which has not effective brakes. After all, their own lives are in peril. That being so, how much more difficult is it for the man procuring a second-hand car for the first time to be quite sure that that vehicle which he purchases from the dealer has efficient brakes, properly focused headlights and all those other things which, unless effective, are a danger to the unsuspecting pedestrian.<br/>
6.30 p.m.<br/>
For those reasons, special steps ought to be taken by this Clause to ensure that when a car changes hands it must at least have had a test and have been given a test certificate within three years, and that if that vehicle is sold a second time it should have a further test before the second sale takes place. If those precautions were taken, I believe that the number of accidents on the road would be minimised and that the number of people taking out cars which are defective in essential things would be reduced. If I may borrow a phrase used by the Minister in connection with another subject which we discussed not many weeks ago, he would, by accepting this Amendment, "put teeth" into the Clause.<br/>
The Minister has not been too forth-coming about the Amendments which have so far appeared on the Notice Paper. Nor was his predecessor, when we spent a considerable time in Committee trying to achieve the best we could get. There are no politics in this at all. We are all subjected to the dangers arising from the ever-increasing traffic on the highway. Those who, like myself, have more often than not to be pedestrians because we cannot be otherwise are probably subjected to a greater danger than are those sitting behind a lethal weapon which is travelling on the roads. If the right hon. Gentleman is prepared to accept the principle here involved he will put teeth into this proviso which will at least be a substantial effort towards reducing the number of unsatisfactory vehicles on the roads.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-05-30a.310.0" hansard_membership_id="10084" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/21940" speakername="Mr. Watkinson" colnum="310" time="">
<p>I am very anxious to put teeth into the whole of this Measure because, as the hon. Member for The Hartlepools (Mr. D. Jones) very rightly and fairly said, there are no politics in this matter. The whole House desires to make a contribution to road safety by the passing of this Bill. I therefore looked very carefully into these related Amendments, which, I think it fair to say, all really try to do the same sort of thing in general&#x2014;to impose a certificate on the sale, and. in some cases, on the resale, of a vehicle. Perhaps I might deal with them in very general terms.<br/>
First, I should say that at the moment we do not entirely lack powers to deal with this problem. If the purpose of the Amendments, as I am sure it is, is to see that unfit cars are not sold or resold, that purpose is already substantially met by the provisions of Section 8 of the 1934 Act which are proposed to be extended by Clause 6 of this Bill. That Section penalises the sale or supply of vehicles which do not comply with certain statutory requirements. We are not, therefore, without some powers in this matter against those who are deliberately trying to sell an unsafe or unsatisfactory article and those putting it on the road when it is a danger to other people.<br/>
One big difficulty, as I think everyone will agree, is that the addition of this class of vehicle to the numbers to be tested would add enormously to the task. It is difficult at this stage to form any firm opinion as to how rapidly we shall be


able to deal with the vehicles which are over ten years old. If we add to that number the quite large numbers of cars which change hands after they are three years old it will probably mean deferring for a considerable period the coming into operation of the Clause and the whole operation of the scheme itself. I am very anxious to make a start as soon as we can. If we had to cater for all cars over ten years old plus an unknown number of cars which would have to be tested because they were changing hands after they were three years old it would inevitably delay the coming into operation of the whole scheme.<br/>
There is another difficulty, and I think it is a fair one. If these Amendments&#x2014;or some modification of them&#x2014;were accepted it would enforce on the seller a duty to have and to produce a test certificate. That might well be misunderstood by the public. As has already been said, the test certificate would only say that the car was satisfactory as regards certain specified things such as steering, lights, brakes, tyres, and so on. It is certainly not a general guarantee that the car is in all degrees roadworthy and satisfactory&#x2014;or, indeed, a good bargain. For example, it will have no relevance to the condition of the engine, to much of the condition of the bodywork and the like. The certificates might well be misunderstood and might, I think, do something to bring them into disrepute&#x2014;a thing which I am sure we are anxious should not happen. We are anxious to have them regarded as being very fair and accurate for the limited purpose for which they are intended.<br/>
I am advised that a difficulty also arises as to enforcement with reference to the actual day of sale in the case of vehicles bought under hire-purchase agreements. I am advised that there are also serious difficulties of enforcement arising from the need to identify a particular vehicle on the road as one which had been sold in circumstances which brought it within the requirements of the test. I quite accept the general principle that we ought to do all we can to make this Clause bite as hard as possible. I say again that there are certain powers&#x2014;which will be improved by this Bill&#x2014;available under the 1934 Act which meet the extreme case of the man who deliberately sells a defective vehicle.<br/>
I must also repeat that there are great difficulties of enforcement which might tend to some extent to bring the whole idea into disrepute. The suggestion put forward would undoubtedly increase the delay in bringing the scheme into operation by including for test a very large and unknown number of vehicles. Whilst I accept and, indeed, welcome the motives which have caused the hon. Gentleman to bring forward these Amendments, I think that for the reasons I have given I should advise the Committee not to accept them.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-05-30a.312.0" hansard_membership_id="12567" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29563" speakername="Mr. G. R. Strauss" colnum="312" time="">
<p>I very much regret that the Minister has not been able to accept this Amendment. When the principle of compulsory testing was accepted in Standing Committee, and now at this present stage, we had to decide to which cars that principle should apply. It would obviously be desirable, if it were practicable, to test all cars at the same time. Everyone agreed that that was not possible and that only certain types or categories of cars could in the first place be subjected to compulsory testing.<br/>
The proposal relating to cars over ten years old came from ourselves. We were trying to put forward a practical proposal. To keep the numbers down we said that this provision should apply to cars which are ten years old or more and cars which change hands after they are three years old. It seemed to us that there was particular force in applying the provision in the first place to those two categories only. The case for including cars ten years old and over is obvious. But there is a similarly strong case with regard to cars which change hands after they are three years old. If it were easier and the Minister would accept the suggestion, I would suggest four years.<br/>
Human nature being what it is, we know that a person wants to sell his car when he is dissatisfied with it. He says, "It is about time I got a new car." That does not mean that the vehicle is seriously defective in any way. It means merely that its performance is not so good as it was, that perhaps the steering is loose, that the brakes are not as good as they were and that the traffic indicators are not working well. It is often an indication that the performance of the car is not what it ought to be. It often means that the car has reached a stage when the expense of keeping it in good repair


is becoming burdensome, and, therefore, the owner decides to sell it.<br/>
We suggest that, when that happens, it would be a strong case for having the car tested for road safety. This is almost as important a category of car, from the point of view of road safety, as the category of car which is ten years old. The two things ought to be taken together.<br/>
One objection of the Minister to this proposal is that it would add to the total number of cars which have got to be tested in the first place. We do not know how many cars there are. I do not think that the Minister knows how many ten-year-old cars there are on the roads. We do not know how many cars change hands after they are three years old. It is guess-work on anybody's part, and, therefore, it is impossible for the Minister to say that there will be too many cars for the first operation. He does not know how many there will be.<br/>
Clearly, the fewer cars there are, the easier the operation will be. If we were to apply the scheme to cars twelve years old instead of ten years old, there would be fewer cars still. The number of cars which are ten years old and which change hands after they are three years old will be as many as any comprehensive system of testing stations throughout the country will be able to deal with reasonably well. Until the Minister can give us some figures to disprove that contention, he has not made out his case.<br/>
What are the other arguments that the right hon. Gentleman puts forward? He says that there are already powers included in Clause 6 which make it illegal for anyone to sell a car the standard of fitness of which is below a certain level. But that is no protection at all. I wonder how many prosecutions took place last year under the 1934 Act? I am sure there were very few. We know from the Hendon tests that most of the cars tested are fairly good cars but that 75 per cent. of them have defective headlights and 50 per cent. have defective steering. The protection afforded by Clause 6, which makes it illegal to sell cars in a dangerous condition, does not bite on this proposition. We say that when a car is sold, it should undergo this general test of roadworthiness.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman's last argument was that people will think that if a car has passed the road safety test at a testing station, the car will be in good condition in all respects, and that that would be misleading the public and the purchaser would think that the standard of the engine and everything else was high. That is assuming an extraordinary lack of intelligence on the part of the public.<br/>
Such a certificate would mean nothing of the sort. Everybody will know that when a car changes hands a certificate will have to be issued from the road testing station saying&#x2014;and it would say only this&#x2014;that the car has been tested from the point of view of steering, brakes and lighting, and that in those respects only has it passed the test. That would not mean anything else. I do not think that anybody would assume that it meant the engine was in a perfect condition. The purpose and the effect of such a certificate would be quickly understood by the public. There is nothing in that argument.<br/>
6.45 p.m.<br/>
It is no use asking the Minister to think again in this matter. I am sure he has made up his mind. He is making a great mistake in not including among those cars which have to be tested in the first place the type of car which appears to us ought to be tested from the point of view of road safety, just as much as the car which is ten years old. We feel strongly about this matter. The Minister is missing a great opportunity to help to keep down road accidents, and when it comes to the right time we shall vote in favour of the Amendment.</p>

<p>I do not think that I shall cause the right hon. Member for Vauxhall (Mr. G. R. Strauss) to change his mind, but he asked me whether I had any estimate of the number of cars older than ten years which will be affected by this proposal. This figure can only be very approximate, but, as far as I am advised, private cars over ten years old which will fall to be tested will amount to more than 1&#x00BD; million. If we include motor cycles and goods vehicles to be tested, the number will be about 2 million.<br/>
The task is already fairly formidable. If we were to add some unspecified


million transactions, it would be a very formidable task indeed. I think it would be wise at present to adhere to the procedures that are laid down and try to make a good job of the cars over ten years old.</p>

<p>Is the right hon. Gentleman not assuming that the number of cars that change hands is much higher than it probably is? I do not know what the figures are. I think the right hon. Gentleman suggested that more than a million cars over three years old change hands every year.</p>

<p>Perhaps I may add some informaton. We talk rather glibly here about cars, but there are also commercial vehicles and motor cycles, so the total number of vehicles is much greater than merely the number of cars. I have always understood from trade circles that the number of sales of second-hand vehicles is about 1,800,000 per annum. Knowing, as we do, that there are 6 million vehicles on the roads, and assuming that they change hands about once every three years, that figure of 1,800,000 is not out of the way. One would expect there to be about 2 million sales a year.<br/>

<p>&#x2014;and over ten, one comes at once to a figure which would be somewhere well over I million. Therefore, this proposal is adding a very substantial figure to the 1&#x00BD; million or 2 million which are to be tested every year. In that case, it would be impracticable to demand that another million vehicles should be added for testing purposes.</p>

<p>Most of us, I am sure, are in sympathy with the point of view expressed by the Minister, that this large number of cars coming to be tested would probably make the scheme unworkable. But if the Minister is in favour of the principle, is there anything to prevent him specifying an appointed day for the operation of this scheme when opportunity presents itself? That would show that the Minister is really concerned about the second-hand car market.<br/>
There is no question that if one wants to find a defective vehicle, the Warren Street kerbside market would be a very good place to find one. In the main, they are sold because they are defective. I am not suggesting that the defect is always in the brakes or the tyres. I know full well that there are other parts of a car which are defective and that cars are sold for that reason, but I cannot believe that the Minister can accept the penalty Clause as having any retarding influence on the sale of defective vehicles.<br/>
It would, I am sure, be very interesting if the Committee could have some idea of how many prosecutions have taken place under this particular Section which he quotes. I venture to suggest there have been very few indeed. We want something positive. We want the Minister to do something to ensure that cars, when they do change hands, change hands in a safe condition.<br/>
We all recognise that we cannot deal with the 1&#x00BD; million or 2 million vehicles which change hands every year until the scheme is launched, but I would beg of him to show quite clearly that he is in sympathy with the intention of this Amendment by accepting it and passing it, perhaps with some deferring words, which would mean that on some appointed day this provision could come into operation.</p>

<p>I hope that my right hon. Friend will not be persuaded, either now or at any future time, to accept the proposal contained in this Amendment. I myself think that the age of ten years is quite high as a limit to set. A good many cars get into quite bad mechanical condition before they are ten years old, and I should hope that, as soon as the initial rush has been absorbed, it would be possible gradually to lower the age from ten to a smaller number of years.<br/>
The proposal which is put forward in the Amendment has the disadvantage that it will greatly slow down that process by diverting the testing facilities in a haphazard manner. Some cars may change hands many times, and quite frequently, and they would have to be tested each time they changed hands. Other cars, on the other hand, would remain in the same ownership for ten years, not being tested at all. I should think it was a pity, testing capacity being the limiting factor, that


it should be dissipated in a haphazard fashion rather than being concentrated upon the flat rate, universal testing of ageing vehicles which will gradually take all vehicles into its care. I therefore hope that my right hon. Friend will resist this Amendment and use his testing resources to the best effect.</p>

<p>I ask the Minister to reconsider this matter. What we are asking is that the Minister should at least take power, so that if and when the time arrives when it is possible to deal with this type of second-hand vehicle, he will be able to exercise that power, first of all in the interests of public safety, and, secondly, in order to prevent many decent people being swindled by those who sell cars under false pretences.<br/>
After I had spoken on this matter in Committee, I had a letter from as far away as Glasgow, from a person who had been badly bitten in buying a motor car. The hon. Member for Buckinghamshire, South (Mr. R. Bell) may laugh, but it is not an isolated case; there are thousands of people who have purchased cars, honestly believing those cars to be in proper running order, and have found themselves in a very difficult position, having to meet a lot of expense, when they have tried to put them on the road. I know of one instance near where I reside; a chap bought a car over 12 months ago, in that same belief that he was buying a roadworthy vehicle, and he has not yet got it fit for the road.<br/>
It is reasonable, both in the interests of public safety and for the protection of decent people from being rooked by those who are speculating in this type of broken-down car, that there should be</p>

While I appreciate that, in the initial stages of the inspection and testing scheme, it would not be possible to meet this situation, surely, in three, four, five or six years' time, when the scheme is well under way and the Minister is advised by his Department that the testing stations could deal with the sort of second-hand vehicles to which he has referred, then if he had the power in the Bill he would be able to extend this further protection to the community.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-05-30a.318.1" colnum="318" time="">
<p>I ask him very sincerely to reconsider this matter. There are many people who are dealing in second-hand cars in the way I have described. I would ask the Minister at least to give some hope that the public will, in the future, be given some protection from that undesirable type of trader through the exercise by the Minister of the power which we now ask him to put into the Bill.</p>

<p>I merely want to say, in answer to the hon. Member for Bradford, East (Mr. F. McLeavy) that I have carefully thought of that. As we make progress, I really think it will be fairer to continue the universal testing of cars, taking them at lesser ages as time goes on, thereby keeping the testing stations going on that basis, rather than bringing in this quite new consideration of testing cars on sale and resale. I think that, by that process, based on the figures I have given and those which my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Mr. Gresham Cooke) from his expert knowledge of the industry has given, we really shall have as big a job as we can hope to tackle in the future.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in line 11. after "passengers", to insert:
<q>to hackney carriages licensed by the Commissioner of Police for the Metropolitan Police District under the provisions of the Metropolitan Public Carriage Act, 1869".</q>
Perhaps the Minister will be good enough to explain the position in respect of the vehicles referred to in the Amendment.</p>

<p>I shall be glad to do so. The position is, I think, quite properly met. Under the proviso to subsection (2) of the new Clause, I shall have power to exempt by regulation any classes or descriptions of vehicles prescribed in the regulations, including the description of vehicles mentioned in the Amendment. I have, therefore, the power to exempt them.<br/>
I shall, of course, be favourably inclined to exempt any vehicles which I consider are adequately covered in other ways. Taxis and some other classes of vehicles which are already subject to an annual examination of such a nature and carried out by such an authority that it can be accepted as at least as sufficient as the test which I am proposing will certainly come within the exemption category.<br/>
Under these provisions, taxis in many other places besides London may well be exempted. Indeed, it would be unfair to exempt London taxis alone. In short, I have the power to exempt these vehicles provided I am satisfied, as I should be in the case of taxicabs, that the annual examination which they undergo is at least as stringent as the one that I am proposing.</p>

<p>In my youth I was often a witness of horse-coping deals, which were often marvels of ingenuity entailing reprehensible statements being made, the veracity of which was demonstrated


to be non-existent the moment that the transaction had been completed. Judging by what I have heard in the discussion on the new Clause, it would seem that although horse coping has almost disappeared, the sale of secondhand cars appears to have taken its place as an example of reprehensible ingenuity on the part of some members of the community.<br/>
I wish to express my satisfaction that the penalty to be imposed is limited. My fear with regard to the whole Bill has been that the penalties now proposed are often likely to be so heavy as to scare the people who will have the duty of reaching the decision after which a penalty may be imposed. In this new Clause, in spite of any temptation which there may have been to impose high penalties, it seems to me that the penalty is so reasonable that there should be no difficulty about the persons who may have to reach the decisions being scared off making the right decisions because of the fear of the penalty that might afterwards have to be imposed.<br/>
I can only hope that some of the other penalties in the Bill will be scaled down so as to bring them within the same feeling of certainty, because the great thing in these cases is to make the possible offender feel that conviction is certain If prosecution is undertaken. At the moment, a good many people escape their just deserts because those who have to reach decisions fear that the punishment afterwards imposed may be too heavy.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That the Clause be read a Second time.<br/>
It was an Amendment moved by the right hon. Member for Vauxhall (Mr. G. R. Strauss) in Standing Committee which gave the Committee an opportunity of expressing its views on this subject. It was very strongly urged that there was really no reason for driving licences having a duration of only 12 months, and that it would be greatly to the convenience of the motoring public if driving licences were of longer duration. It was also argued and proved that, with the great increase in the number of driving licences, there is an increasing burden upon the local taxation offices, and that it would reduce the amount of work very much, or prevent it from increasing at the present rate, if driving licences had a duration of a longer period than 12 months.<br/>
The Government undertook, if that Amendment was withdrawn, to move an Amendment dealing with the matter on Report stage. I made it plain that in doing that it would be necessary to impose certain limitations if it was to result in a decrease in the labour of the taxation offices. As a result, this new Clause provides for certain restrictions. It may be suggested, for example, that an arrangement should be made to refund the unexpired portion of the licence fee where, as often is the case, it is not desired that the licence should run its full term, or that a person should have the option of annual or triennial licences. If we introduced complications of that kind, they would add greatly to the difficulties of administration.<br/>
There is another thing which also became apparent when we began to study the matter. It was obvious that if a triennial system was suddenly introduced, it would result in a tremendous burden of work being thrown upon the offices every three years. For that reason, subsection (5) makes provision for transitional arrangements. This will enable the licensing authorities to arrange, under regulations made by the Minister, that, for example, persons whose surnames begin with the letters A to F will be entitled to the three-year licence in the first year of the new arrangement, whereas those whose names begin with the letters from G to L or M to Z will get annual licences. In that way, the new system will be introduced gradually. It is, in fact, a fulfilment of a promise I made in Standing Committee, and I therefore trust that it will be acceptable to this Committee.</p>

<p>While I welcome the new Clause very enthusiastically, I wish to add an extra reason why it should be introduced. It happens that people who take out licences year by year sometimes slip up and gain a couple of months as a result of taking out yearly licences, and it is quite possible for the holders of driving licences over the course of five years to save 5s. by "pinching" a couple of months year by year. It will certainly be the fact that under this new Clause that could not happen except every three years, and I think it is quite a sound argument in favour of the Clause.</p>

<p>I want to express the appreciation of hon. Members on this side of the Committee who pressed for this Amendment during the Committee stage. This is one of the few of the numerous commonsense proposals which we made which the Government have seen fit to accept, and for that we are grateful. I only hope that, having accepted this suggestion in the case of driving licences&#x2014;that they should be issued for a three-year period instead of annually&#x2014;the same principle will be applied to some other licences, dog licences and the like, which would also bring a benefit in a saving of expense in administration.<br/>
It seems to us that the introduction of this system of a three-year period on the basis now proposed by the Government is a very sound way of doing it, and should prevent an accumulation of work in the taxation offices. We therefore welcome it.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That the Clause be read a Second time.<br/>
This is not the correction of an oversight, but rather something which, as the Bill was going through the House, it seemed wise to insert. Perhaps I may briefly give the Committee the background. We are now at the beginning of a very large road programme for this country, and, although no doubt it will not develop as quickly as some people would like, none the less I think many fair-minded people will be surprised in the next year or so as they see the buildup in road schemes that will follow from works which are now being started or soon will be started.<br/>
The point is that all these schemes, or the majority of the important ones, will be for double-track highways, and here we are beginning to create in this country a new kind of idea which the experts call the central reservation; that is, the strip of land which runs down the centre of double-track highways. In making our plans for these new roads, and for example, in considering the Cromwell Road extension, which as I think all hon. Members know is a double-track route for the major part of its length, certain doubts have been brought to our attention by the legal experts as to who really owns these reservations and who, indeed, has proper powers over them.<br/>
It is not a great point, but the purpose of this Clause is, frankly, to put beyond legal doubt the powers of the highway authorities to construct and alter certain road works which have in practice for long been regarded as essential features, but which recent legal advice has held to have no clear statutory sanction.<br/>
This new Clause makes it clear that the central reservation&#x2014;the strips of grass or concrete, sometimes planted with trees&#x2014;can be dealt with in ways which are necessary. It deals, for example, with such matters as lighting and fencing. I regard the latter as a very important one from the road safety point of view. Fences on these central reservations would


prevent children from running across the road at dangerous points. It is much easier to fence central reservations&#x2014;and sometimes it is the only way to fence a road&#x2014;rather than have fences along each side of the road. It is these things which we are putting beyond doubt in this Clause. If there are any other points which hon. Members wish to raise, I shall be pleased to try to answer them, but I have explained the general purpose&#x2014;the useful and necessary purpose&#x2014;of this new Clause.</p>

<p>I am glad to have the Minister's explanation, because when I read the new Clause it surprised me to see that this power was necessary. I wondered what the position was. However, with the explanation I am quite satisfield. The Minister says that we have now embarked upon a very large road programme. I would seriously challenge that statement. While there is some work being done at present&#x2014;and we are very glad of that&#x2014;the fact remains that the amount of money we are spending on road construction is very small indeed compared with that which is spent not only in the U.S.A. but on the Continent. We on this side certainly desire that programme to go ahead, and if the new Clause will in any way facilitate it so much the better.</p>

<p>That is a relevant question, for the plans for beautifying these new roads will have to include plans for the treatment of the central reservations. It may interest the Committee to know that the island at the Gunnersbury end of the Cromwell Road extension, where there will be a fly-over, will be no less than two acres in extent; that is, the central reservation will be two acres in extent. That, of course, will have to be landscaped. I would take this opportunity of expressing my gratitude to Mr. Bowes-Lyon for kindly accepting the chairmanship of the new committee I have just set up, and which is charged with the most important task of seeing that as the new roads are built&#x2014;

<p>I beg to move, That the Clause be read a Second time.<br/>
The new Clause seeks to clarify and extend the Minister's powers under Sections 48 and 49 of the 1930 Act over the erection, display, illumination, etc., of traffic signs. It is a consequence of the representations made to the Government by the motoring authorities and, in particular, by my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Mr. Gresham Cooke).<br/>
Subsection (1) of the new Clause is intended to remove certain doubts in the existing law. Section 48 (9) defines a traffic sign as including
<q>&#x2026; all signals, warning sign posts, direction posts, signs, or other devices for the guidance or direction of persons using roads.</q>
By Section 48 (1) the highway authority may
<q>&#x2026; cause or permit traffic signs to be placed on or near any road in their area.</q>
Doubts have arisen whether this language is wide enough to embrace carriageway markings and hence whether it is possible to prescribe such markings in regulations. A further doubt arises whether a portable sign, such as that used by a school crossing patrol or at an airfield crossing, can be said to be "placed on or near" a road.<br/>
The new Clause makes it clear that any object or device, whether fixed or portable, may be a traffic sign if prescribed or authorised as such by the Minister.<br/>
The second effect of subsection (1) is to enable the Minister to authorise the precise meaning of any traffic sign.<br/>
Subsection (2) also deals with a doubt which has arisen and restores what is believed to have been the earlier position by referring in this connection to objects and devices instead of to traffic signs.<br/>
Subsection (3) ensures that reference in any enactment to the placing of an object or traffic sign shall apply equally to the display thereof in any manner, for example, the holding up of a portable sign. Subsection (4) will permit the Minister to prescribe or authorise the illumination of traffic signs either by

lighting or by the use of reflectors or reflecting material. It is obviously very desirable that the Minister should be able to require the illumination of such signs as, for instance, halt signs.<br/>
Subsection (5) extends the Minister's power to give directions for the removal of a traffic sign, to enable directions to be given for the placing of traffic signs of the prescribed type or authorised character, and subsection (6) provides that where a highway authority fails to comply with a direction requiring the removal of a traffic sign the Minister may himself effect removal and recover the cost.<br/>
I hope that the Committee will feel that these are important matters of detail which are likely to lead to convenience, economy and safety upon the roads, and that the Committee will be willing to accept this new Clause.<br/>

<p>We welcome this new Clause also in so far as it contributes in any way towards the clarity of the directions on the roads and thereby to road safety. I urge the Minister to continue to give serious attention to the uniformity of the signs on the roads. There is a multitude of different signs. Motorists and pedestrians are confused by them. The more uniform the signs are the more likely they are to be observed and the greater the contribution they will make to road safety and the free flow of traffic. I hope that, having taken more and clearer powers, the Minister will turn his attention to that matter.</p>

<p>I also welcome the new Clause, but I would ask the Minister to take into consideration one detail, and that is the height of the traffic signs.

I wonder if the Minister would give consideration to the height of signs above the road level, since subsection (4) of the new Clause refers to signs

<p>I beg to move, That the Clause be read a Second time.<br/>
The object of the Clause is to make it possible to vary the minimum age for the driving of motor cycles by regulations to be made by the Minister instead of having to pass an amending Act of Parliament. At present the minimum age for driving motor cycles is fixed at 16 by Section 9 of the Road Traffic Act, 1930. As a result, if for any reason it is desired to vary that minimum age it is necessary to wait for a legislative opportunity. That may well be inconvenient. The Departmental Committee on Road Safety is now undertaking an inquiry by means of a Sub-committee into the appropriate minimum age for motor cyclists. That will undoubtedly take some time. It is unlikely, therefore, that effect could be given to any recommendations that the Departmental Committee might make if the opportunity of this Bill were not taken and if the Committee are to present its Report after the Bill had been placed on the Statute Book.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) moved an Amendment in the Standing Committee, on 20th December, to exclude a person under the age of 18 from driving a motor cycle of more than 250 c.c. I undertook that the Departmental Committee on Road Safety would set up a Committee to go into the matter and report upon the whole question of accidents to motor cyclists. The moment that the Committee began to look at this matter we realised that it was a good deal more complicated than we had at first supposed.<br/>
In the first place, despite the very widespread feeling that modern heavy, fast motor cycles are being ridden by persons who are really too young to do so, there is extremely little evidence to show that the youngest of the motor cyclists are in fact having the most accidents. Clearly, before a change is made in the law, it would be essential to justify it on the facts. However, there is a very widespread feeling of that kind, and we should certainly want to have power to deal with the matter if, after careful examination, the Committee on Road Safety comes to that conclusion.<br/>
Further, it has been strongly represented that some of the light motor cycles could quite safely be ridden by these boys but that there should be a limit upon the size. That is what my hon. Friend the Member for Crosby had in mind, but from the practical point of view of enforcement it is essential that such limit should be one which the police can readily detect, and it is not at all easy to know whether a particular motor cycle is more or less than a certain cubic capacity. Therefore, it is a matter which must be carefully considered from the point of view of enforcement, even if the case is made out that it is desirable that there should be a limit of that kind.<br/>
Thirdly, it emerged that the size of the motor cycle&#x2014;the cubic capacity of the cylinders&#x2014;is not necessarily a criterion of the speed at which the motor cycle can travel. We were surprised and rather alarmed to learn that some quite light motor cycles can travel and are ridden at speeds up to 100 m.p.h. Obviously, we want to take that kind of thing carefully into account before we decide upon altering the law in this matter.<br/>
The Road Safety Committee, by a considerable majority, represented through me to the Minister that it was most anxious that the opportunity of this Road Traffic Bill should not be lost. It is for that reason that I move the Second Reading of the new Clause. It gives the Minister power, by regulation, to alter the age, if and when he is satisfied, as a result of the investigations now being undertaken by the Road Safety Committee, that it is desirable to do so.</p>

<p>So far as I understand the new Clause, it empowers the Minister, by regulations, to raise the age at which one can drive a motor cycle&#x2014;or to lower it. I do not think that anyone in the House would suggest that the age should be lowered below that of 16 at which it stands at present.</p>

<p>The Joint Parliamentary Secretary said that the Departmental Committee on Road Safety is conducting an inquiry into the age limit for the drivers of motor cycles and I hope that this will be speeded up as much as possible. The road accidents which occur as a result of motor cycles being involved are numerous. Indeed, I believe that in 1954 there were 700 fatal accidents as a result of motor cycles being used, and no doubt the number is increasing.<br/>
It seems disproportionate that no one can drive a motor car until he is 18 years of age, whereas the motor cycle, which, in my view, is a more dangerous lethal weapon, can be driven by younger people. What is more, those who drive motor cycles are of the type who take greater risks and cause confusion on the highways, so that many of them are a danger to the public. Again, whereas before a provisional licence for a motor car is obtained the applicant must have someone by his side who is a fully qualified driver, there is normally no one assisting the person learning to drive a motor cycle. So for those reasons there is a strong case to be made out for raising the minimum age for the driving of motor cycles.<br/>
I welcome the power being taken by the Minister to put this into effect if recommended so to do by the Road Safety Committee. I repeat that I hope its inquiry will be regarded as a matter of urgency, and that before long the House will be informed of its recommendations.</p>

<p>I want to express gratitude to the Minister for introducing this new Clause. At an earlier stage of the Bill I introduced a rather more specific Clause because, according to Metropolitan Police reports,

there has been a substantial increase in the number of accidents involving motor cyclists.<br/>
I thought that this matter could be dealt with in a specific way, but the Minister has referred it to the Road Safety Committee which has found that it is not nearly as simple as I thought. The problems which arise when one investigates the accidents in which motor cyclists are involved are unexpected and unusual. Therefore, I thank the Minister for introducing this new Clause, which will give my right hon. Friend power to bring the recommendations of that Committee into effect as soon as it has reported.</p>

<p>I want to put what I think is a small but practical point to the Joint Parliamentary Secretary. Suppose that the Departmental Committee on Road Safety suggests at some future date that the way to deal with this problem is to allow driving licences to be granted at the age of 16 but recommends that between the ages of 16 and 18 any applicant for a licence must pass a special and stricter test than would be given to anyone above the age of 18. Is there anything in the Bill that would prevent the Minister from accepting such a suggestion, or could it be suggested under this proposed Clause and the other parts of the Bill that might be affected?</p>

<p>One or two of the comments made in connection with this new Clause seemed to infer that it was designed primarily to give power to the Minister to give legal force to such recommendations as may emerge from the Departmental Committee on Road Safety. I hope that we shall not prejudge the verdict of that Committee or its findings. We do not know what they will be, and if, for want of evidence of greater accidents among the young riders of motor cycles, the Committee were disinclined to increase the age limit at which the licence is granted, I for one would still remain impressed with the view that an increase ought to be made.<br/>
I agree with the hon. Member for Enfield, East (Mr. Ernest Davies) that motor cycles, in terms of road accidents, are more dangerous than motor cars. Therefore, whatever the Road Safety Committee recommends, and whatever may be the statistics of accidents for young and old, I hope we shall keep to that point and leave to the consideration of the Committee any distinctions between small, not dangerous types of motor cycles and the bigger ones, which evidently is thought by the Minister to be relevant to this issue.<br/>
I hope that we shall be completely free to consider the Statutory Instrument which, presumably, will follow from the powers now taken to deal with the recommendations of that Committee when they come forward.</p>

<p>I, too, welcome this new Clause, but two things should be remembered when motor cyclists are criticised. The first is that the proportion of motor cycle accidents to the total number of motor cyclists is substantially less than it was before the war, not more, as is often stated.<br/>
Secondly, in reply to a recent Parliamentary Question, it was indicated that although, unfortunately, many motor cyclists succeed in eliminating themselves, the numbers of the general public who are killed by motor cyclists is very much smaller than the corresponding numbers killed by motor cars, even allowing for the different numbers of vehicles licensed.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That the Clause be read a Second time.<br/>
This new Clause has been introduced in fulfilment of a pledge which I gave in the Committee upstairs, and it makes the following three distinct though connected changes in the law. It provides a new defence for a person charged with using a motor vehicle on a road whilst it is uninsured. It makes disqualification for the offence of so using a vehicle a matter for the discretion of the court instead of automatically following upon conviction. It also removes the power of the court to limit any disqualification to certain classes or descriptions of vehicles.<br/>
Subsection (1) provides the new defence to which I have referred. To establish this defence the defendant will have to prove that the vehicle did not belong to him and had not been hired or lent to him, that he was using the vehicle in the course of his employment, and that he neither knew, nor had reason to believe, that the vehicle was uninsured whilst he was driving.<br/>
We had considerable discussions in Committee, and my hon. Friend the Member for Buckinghamshire, South (Mr. R. Bell) took a prominent part in those discussions. There was a general debate arising from Amendments which he moved both to Sections 11 and 35 of the 1930 Act. I think that the purpose of my hon. Friend was to extend in both Sections the special reasons which entitle the courts to say that the defendant shall not be disqualified where, but for such reasons, disqualification must follow.<br/>
I undertook to meet the feeling of the Committee so far as it related to insurance cases, but I said that I could not promise to alter the law in relation to dangerous driving. So the first point I want to make on this new Clause is that it is limited to the insurance aspect, as I said in my opening remarks, and it only provides a new defence to a person charged with using a motor vehicle on the road whilst it is uninsured.<br/>
I have tried to implement fully the undertaking which I gave to deal with the insurance side of the matter. I think it is a fair point because it may well be that, for example, an employee can drive a motor vehicle which is not insured, although that fact is completely outside his knowledge. The owner of the vehicle might have allowed the insurance to lapse. by design or accident, and it might be quite outside any reasonable requirement that the driver could or should have known that. We are trying to meet a practical point, and I hope that the House will feel that the new Clause does so.<br/>
I do not want at this stage to repeat the arguments into which we went very fully in Standing Committee. I will merely say that in the case of someone driving an uninsured vehicle I have tried to meet my hon. Friend's point. In fairness to him, however, I must say that I think his original desire was to give a much wider power than I have given.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-05-30a.341.0" hansard_membership_id="3892" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/14480" speakername="Mr. Ede" colnum="341" time="">
<p>I regard driving a vehicle which is not insured as the most antisocial of all the motoring offences. Anyone who has had long experience on a bench of magistrates must know of some very heart-rending cases of the consequences inflicted by uninsured motorists on pedestrians or other persons who have been involved in accidents.<br/>
I also have knowledge of the kind of case to which reference has been made, in which an employee, possibly of a big firm, drives on the roads, having no reason to suspect that his employers have not complied with the law, and then, when an accident occurs and an investigation takes place, it is discovered that the vehicle is uninsured. I agree that in such circumstances it is revolting to one's sense of justice to impose a penalty which may include depriving the man of his means of livelihood for twelve months.<br/>
I hope that the new Clause will be so linked with the original Act that the person who is responsible for the vehicle being on the roads while uninsured will still be liable to the penalties involved. I was hoping to hear from the right hon. Gentleman that precautions had been taken to make sure that that was so. If that is not done, there might be a very serious case of the kind to which I referred. Having an uninsured vehicle on

the roads is so serious an offence that the House ought to be satisfied, before it exempts some persons from the penalties, that the person who really ought to be charged with the offence is still liable to the legal penalties.</p>

<p>I thank my right hon. Friend for meeting so amply the case made by many hon. Members as well as myself during the Committee stage. There is no doubt, as the right hon. Member for South Shields (Mr. Ede) has said, that driving without an insurance policy can have very serious consequences for people who are injured. What the Amendment aims at achieving, and, I think, succeeds in achieving, is merely to remove from the administration of Section 35 of the principal Act some of the anomalies which had become notorious.<br/>
I think that the right hon. Gentleman can be assured that all that the Clause does in the way of making a new defence is to give the defence defined in subsection (1) to the person who is charged with using a motor vehicle in this manner and is able to establish the various circumstances there set out. It does not provide any new defence or otherwise reduce in any way the criminal liability of the owner of the vehicle under Section 35.<br/>
The second thing that the new Clause does is to restore to benches of magistrates a discretion which a certain judicial decision took away from them. Their power to refrain from disqualifying because they thought special circumstances existed ceased as a result of a judicial decision, and it is now given back to them. I am sure that nothing but benefit to the administration of justice will result from this provision.<br/>
I am sorry that my right hon. Friend has put in the counterweight of subsection (3), which takes away the power of a court to order a limited disqualification. I did not table an Amendment to delete subsection (3) because, like everyone else, I did not want to prolong the Report stage. However, it seems to be proceeding remarkably quickly, and I think I might well have tabled such an Amendment. If I say that I am sorry that the subsection has been inserted, perhaps the Minister will consider the point before the subsequent stages of the Bill in another place.<br/>
I know that there is a slight logical difficulty in justifying the power to disqualify from driving one kind of vehicle and not another. Yet if a lorry driver is convicted of driving his uninsured motor cycle, it is a pity that he should be disqualified from driving his employer's lorry, by which he earns his living. It is arguable that if he drives, uninsured, a lorry for which he is responsible in some way, it is perhaps a pity that, automatically and without any discretion in the court, he should be disqualified from going to work on a powerassisted bicycle, one of those little, rather noisy contraptions which are nevertheless mechanically-propelled vehicles.<br/>
I should have thought that for reasons of that type, which do not arise frequently but nevertheless exist, it would have been desirable to leave that discretion with the court so that, when the circumstances seemed to justify such a course, the court could exercise it. I do not want to be ungrateful, because my right hon. Friend has met me very fully on the insurance point, but I hope that he will consider the matter before the later stages of the Bill to see whether he can make a further concession.<br/>
I am sorry that the new Clause extends only to the insurance point. I spoke in Committee about the second conviction for dangerous driving. I feel, and I think most hon. Members feel, that the discretion should be with the court as the 1930 Act intended that it should be, and that the effect of the decisions in 1945 and 1946, which took the discretion away from the court, were unfortunate and have not contributed anything to the even administration of justice.</p>

<p>I have not the advantage of having been a member of the Standing Committee which considered the Bill. I want wholeheartedly to support what was said by the hon. Member for Buckinghamshire, South (Mr. R. Bell) about subsection (3) of the new Clause. I am very much in agreement with what my right hon. Friend the Member for South Shields (Mr. Ede) said about the importance of insurance. Those of us who have had experience on magistrates' benches know the difficulties and tragedies which have occurred in many cases through the absence of third party insurance.<br/>
I join with my right hon. Friend in asking that those who own vehicles shall in future be responsible for matters of this kind, instead of the people who may not know that a vehicle is not insured and who, by subsection (1), will have a defence. I hope the Government will not lose sight of that.<br/>
I was tempted to put down an Amendment to delete subsection (3), but I hope that we shall be able to persuade the Minister to remove the subsection when the Bill goes to another place. The subsection makes it impossible for justices to exercise a form of leniency which is not only very desirable, but which has been found to be very valuable. A man does not necessarily belong to the criminal classes because he is driving a motor vehicle in a manner of which the law does not approve, or when, for example, the vehicle is not insured.<br/>
Magistrates want to temper justice with mercy, but subsection (3) prevents that in this context. A man who earns his living by driving a heavy motor vehicle may go to work every morning on a light motor cycle. He may be convicted of an offence&#x2014;perhaps dangerous driving&#x2014;with that vehicle. On conviction, his licence is automatically suspended. At the moment the magistrates have power to limit that suspension to the type of vehicle he was using, but if the Clause goes through, with subsection (3), the magistrates will not have that power of limitation and will have to take away from that lorry driver the right to drive a heavy vehicle and will thereby deprive him of his living for the period of the disqualification.<br/>
That power in the hands of justices is extremely valuable in tempering justice with mercy. Some weeks ago a bench with which I am associated dealt with a case which achieved nation-wide notoriety, or celebrity&#x2014;there are different views about it. Two brothers were engaged in the caf&#x00E9; business. The elder brother owned a motor car. He ran out of orange juice and said to his younger brother, "Get in the car and go to the wholesalers and get a bottle of orange juice." The car was insured only for private purposes and not for the carriage of goods.<br/>
Unfortunately, the younger brother left the car with its engine running. The police came on the scene and drew his


attention to the fact that the engine was running. He was asked for his driving licence, which was produced at the police station within 24 hours. It was found that he was carrying goods in a vehicle not insured for the carriage of goods. There was a dual prosecution. Leaving the car with the engine running cost him 10s., but in the case of the uninsured vehicle the magistrates appreciated the difficulty and imposed the very small fine of 20s.<br/>
However, they were compelled to disqualify him for 12 months. The solicitor who had pleaded guilty on behalf of the defendants said that he could find no special reason to put to the magistrates to show why there should be no disqualification. But he appealed that there should be a limitation in regard to motor cars only to enable the defendant to go to work each day on his own motor cycle. The magistrates exercised their power with the result that something which was quite trivial was covered by the leniency of the magistrates.<br/>
That power is being removed by the terms of subsection (3). To some degree, subsection (1) would cover the case which I have illustrated, but it may have been that that particular defendant did know that the car was not insured for the carriage of goods. It is not merely a question of the uninsured car, but of other offences such as dangerous or careless driving. The hon. Member for Buckinghamshire, South, in a veiled way, referred to a case which hit the headlines of the national Press not long ago.<br/>
We know that case as <i>Regina</i> v. <i>Cottrell.</i> The case went before the Court of Criminal Appeal. Cottrell had been charged with dangerous driving. It was found that there could be no appeal for the removal of suspension for the type of vehicle which was then being driven, when a period of disqualification had been disposed at the trial. The only course for the magistrates at the original hearing was to limit disqualification for the particular type of vehicle, because it could not be done later when an appeal was made.<br/>
That shows the desirability of retaining in the hands of the magistrates the power of limitation of disqualification. In this, I am largely representing the view of the Magistrates' Association and of justices'

clerks. This has proved to be very valuable practice. Without this power there is a likelihood that very severe hardship will be imposed on a defendant for a very trivial case. In spite of the fact that I have resisted the temptation to put down an Amendment to delete subsection (3), I appeal to the Minister to give an assurance that he will consider removing it when the Bill goes to another place.</p>

<p>I wish to support the appeals made to the Minister to delete this subsection, particularly having regard to the point of view of justices dealing with these cases. If a man is brought before a court, and has to be punished for an offence, it is very hard if he has to be punished a second time and his livelihood taken from him for a year.<br/>
These things may seem all right when they are examined in an office where a Bill is being drafted, but those who sit on the bench and those who appear on behalf of defendants are able to make up their minds about those defendants. Sometimes they decide that the defendant is not a bad sort, but has done something foolish and he has to pay the penalty. To deprive him of earning his living for a year is very hard. I think that magistrates throughout the country may be trusted.<br/>
The first two subsections of the Clause will be very useful and I am grateful for the opportunities they will present for avoiding injustice, but I appeal to the Minister to give justices of the peace some discretion in this matter. They are men and women appointed for their common sense, fairness and judgment, and they should be given that opportunity. If this subsection were taken out of the Bill in another place, I am quite sure that the cause of safety on the roads would not suffer in consequence.</p>

<p>First, I wish to answer a point made by the right hon. Member for South Shields (Mr. Ede). The intention here in so far as it refers to insurance is to avoid exactly the point the right hon. Gentleman made&#x2014;the gross unfairness which might fall on an employee through no knowledge or, indeed, culpability of his own&#x2014;but it does not relieve his employer or the owner of the vehicle from his due responsibility. It merely relieves a man who unknowingly committed the offence.<br/>
I think that hon. Members have been interpreting this matter very widely. It would not be proper to give any assurance at this stage, but I will examine very carefully the points that they have made. They are certainly much wider than the question of insurance. On the question of driving while uninsured the point is that subsection (2) of this Clause repeals those parts of subsection (2) of Section 35 which make disqualification automatic except for special reasons. The effect of that repeal is that the courts under Section 6 of the 1930 Act will have the same discretion to disqualify for the offence of driving while uninsured as they now have under that Section in the case of other driving offences.<br/>
In other words, I admit that the particular issue I undertook to cover is a narrow one, but the disqualification of driving in an insurance offence will now be a discretionary matter and any hardship which the court wishes to mitigate in any such case could be dealt with through the exercise of discretion in such a way as the court thought appropriate. So there is no need to retain the proviso in subsection (3). I believe that the undertaking I gave upon insurance has been fully met. I undertake to consider very carefully the wider points raised by hon. Members before the Bill is dealt with in another place.</p>

<p>Is it not the case that although the court has gained in discretion inasmuch as it will now be able to disqualify or not to disqualify altogether, it has lost in discretion in that it must either disqualify completely in respect of all classes of vehicles or not at all? Would it not be desirable in some cases that someone should be taught a lesson and disqualified in respect of driving one class of vehicle?</p>

<p>That is very fairly put. We dealt with the matter in Standing Committee. I am not trying to say that I will consider this question and then not do so, but the point I made in Committee was the example of a man being drunk in charge of a particular kind of vehicle of whom it may be said that it is a hardship if he is a lorry driver and has been convicted of being drunk in charge of a private car. Some people might say that it is very hard to take away his livelihood

because the two classes of vehicle are not the same, but I think there is a case for saying that a man who has been drunk in charge of one vehicle might be drunk in charge of other vehicles. That is a relevant question I must bear in mind. Provided that is understood, I undertake to look at what has been said on this question.</p>

They will be followed by the Government Amendment, in Clause 6. page 5, line 45, at the end to insert:

<p>Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy-Speaker. I am sure it will be for the general convenience of hon. Members to know that.<br/>
General concern about the control of dogs in relation to road accidents has been shown throughout the consideration of the Bill and also during the consideration of the Measure during the previous Parliament. Amendments were moved which the Government were unable to accept, mainly on the grounds of un-

enforceability; or because it appeared that the liability which would arise from the wording of such Amendments would be so wide as to go beyond what hon. Members who had moved them intended.<br/>
During the Committee stage there were long discussions on this matter, and hon. Members on both sides of the Committee made strong representations to the Government that some steps should be taken to ensure that more effective control over dogs was exercised. The number of road accidents which are, at all events in part, due to dogs is very great. My right hon. Friend the then Minister undertook that the question should be referred to the Road Safety Committee of which I am Chairman. He undertook that everything possible would be done to speed up the matter so that the Government could at this stage lay before the House the recommendations of the Departmental Committee.<br/>
A special Sub-committee which was set up to consider the matter found that the more it went into the question, the more difficult it became to make recommendations which were not open to strong criticism. It seemed to the Subcommittee that the suggestions advanced during the Committee proceedings by the right hon. Member for Vauxhall (Mr. G. R. Strauss) held out the best prospects of achieving the maximum advantages and incurring the minimum disadvantages. It was suggested that local authorities should be given discretion to make byelaws dealing with this matter.<br/>
Conditions vary considerably in different parts of the country, and the actual places where dogs may reasonably be expected to be kept under control can be determined only by local authorities familiar with the neighbourhood and the way in which dog owners exercise their animals. The Sub-committee therefore made the recommendations contained in this new Clause which, as I say, are based on the suggestions made by the right hon. Member for Vauxhall. This is an enabling provision to empower local authorities to make regulations.<br/>
It enables local authorities, except county councils in England and Wales, after consultation with the chief officers of police, to make orders designating certain lengths of road within the areas for which they are responsible. Such


orders would be subject to confirmation by the Minister, or in Scotland by the Secretary of State. When such an order has been made the new Clause would make it an offence punishable on summary conviction by a fine not exceeding &#x00A3;5 to cause or permit a dog to be on a road designated by the order unless it is held on a lead.<br/>
Subsection (1) makes it an offence to cause or permit a dog to be on any designated road if such dog is not held on a lead. Subsection (2) defines the term "designated road" as a length of road specified under the order made under the Clause within the area of the local authority making the order. Subsection (3) provides that an order made under the Clause may apply, subject to such limitations as are contained in the order. For example, it may be thought desirable to apply the order only at certain specified times&#x2014;for example, at times of the year when traffic on the designated road is exceedingly heavy&#x2014;or to make certain exceptions from its operation.</p>

<p>No, I would rather get on and give the explanation of what the new Clause seeks to do and try to answer my hon. Friend's point later.<br/>
The need for such exceptions may be illustrated by the obvious necessity not to prevent shepherds from using dogs to assist them in driving cattle or sheep along the road. That will be dealt with by an Amendment which is, I think, to be moved later. When devising this Clause we had that kind of difficulty in mind.<br/>
Subsection (4) lays down the procedure to be adopted if a local authority wishes to make an order. Prior consultation with the chief officer of police is necessary, and thereafter before an order can come into operation it must be confirmed by the appropriate Minister. Orders made under this subsection are made subject to the normal procedure adopted for the making of byelaws under the Local Government Act, 1933, for England and Wales and the Local Government (Scotland) Act, 1947.<br/>
Briefly, and without dwelling on the minor differences in this particular

between English and Scottish local government structure, this procedure is that before application is made for confirmation of the byelaw the. local authority making it shall for a period of at least a month before such application is made give notice in a local newspaper of its intention to apply; and secondly, must make available copies of the byelaw for public inspection free of charge at the council offices.<br/>
Subsection (5), which applies only to England and Wales, provides that
<q>a local authority may institute proceedings for any offence under this section relating to a road in their area.</q>
Subsection (6) defines the local authorities which are empowered under the Clause to make an order; namely, in England and Wales:
<q>the council of a county borough or county district, the Common Council of the City of London or the council of a metropolitan borough,"&#x2014;</q>
and in Scotland&#x2014;
<q>a county council or a town council.</q>
We recognise that the Clause is open to some of the objections on the ground of unenforceability which we made when considering the new Clause entitled "Offences relating to dogs" which was moved in Committee by my hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page), and which I think he has been optimistic enough to put on the Notice Paper again in unchanged form. I will be quite frank with the House and say that the more we have studied this whole question of trying to control dogs&#x2014;and their owners&#x2014;the more difficult we have found it to be satisfied that it will be possible to enforce fairly and equitably the kind of prudent restraint which I think is ordinarily shown by good and sensible dog owners.<br/>
At the same time, in view of the very large number of accidents that are caused by dogs not being under proper control, and in view of the very strong representations that have been made to us from both sides of the House, we referred the matter to the Departmental Committee on Road Safety, as we had promised. It is in accordance with the spirit of the undertaking given by my right hon. Friend who was then Minister of Transport that we have accepted the recommendations of the Road Safety Committee, and it is for that reason that I have moved this new Clause.</p>

<p>Whilst one can respect the motives which evidently inspire those who support this proposed new Clause, I am bound to say that I think it is perfect nonsense. Whether it be the Government or the Road Safety Committee who drew up the Clause is not my concern. All I say is that I do not think that it will work, and those who drafted it cannot realise what it is designed to deal with.<br/>
It is suggested that there shall be hours of the day and seasons of the year when these regulations shall apply. How does anybody imagine that the innumerable dogs which wander about are going to know whether it is the season of the year or the time of the day when these regulations shall apply? I am reminded of the lady who went to a shop to buy a bowl for her dog to drink from. It was recommended by the salesman because it had the word "dog" written on it. The Lady said, "I am afraid it is no use. My little dog cannot read, and my husband does not drink water".<br/>
It might perhaps be fair that people living on a designated highway should be punished if their dogs are allowed to stray and cause accidents. But what is the position of the housewife whose child inadvertently leaves the door open, allowing the dog to go out? Is the housewife to be liable to a fine of &#x00A3;5 because of the inoffensive carclessness of the child?</p>

<p>It is all very well for the hon. Member to refer to accidents which are brought about by dogs.<br/>
As I have already said, I respect the motives of those who brought forward this new Clause, but it is unrealistic to imagine that it is fair for a dog owner, perhaps a housewife, whose child inadvertently leaves the door open or who fails to detect a hole in the fence so that the dog escapes and causes an accident, to be liable to a fine of &#x00A3;5.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman says "Rightly so." He will, no doubt, have an opportunity to speak in support of this new Clause if he is successful in catching your eye, Mr. Deputy-Speaker.<br/>
There will be scores of instances of dogs wandering about in the region of designated areas in circumstances in which it will be quite unreasonable to expect the owners to keep them on leads.<br/>
The proposed new Clause says that it shall be an offence either to cause or to permit a dog to be on a designated highway without the dog being held on a lead. How far from that designated highway is it to be thought reasonable to expect all owners of dogs to keep them so firmly under lock and key that they cannot stray and make their owners liable to the penalty of this Clause?<br/>
We all know that many accidents are caused by dogs, but I do not think this is a sensible method of trying to reduce the number of accidents which are caused in that way. If dogs are to be dealt with in this way, why not cats? As the traffic in this country increases and the dangers of accidents increase, the criticism of today against dogs will be directed against cats tomorrow. The designated areas will extend all over the country. I think that we are losing our sense of proportion. There may well be ways in which owners of dogs which cause accidents may be punished, as is intended in another new Clause, but it is quite another thing to say that the owner of every dog that is seen straying on a designated highway, from however far the dog may have come, is liable to prosecution and to a fine of &#x00A3;5.</p>

<p>There is one further aspect which we must consider, namely, the effect of the proposed new Clause on existing local authority byelaws in regard to nuisances caused by dogs. Many local authorities already have byelaws under which it is an offence for any person to allow a dog to foul the pavement; the dog is expected to go into the road and commit the nuisance in the road, wherein it is not an offence. It seems to me that the right hon. Gentleman is proposing to make that an offence if it occurs on the highway. It will be an offence also under the local authorities' byelaws if the nuisance occurs on the pavement. Moreover, the number of trees in any locality has some distinct bearing upon this problem.<br/>
The problem is not quite as easy of solution as has been suggested. I agree that something ought to be done to reduce the number of accidents caused


by dogs running on certain highways without any control whatever. I think that the better way to proceed is by designating certain areas where there should be a complete and absolute prohibition on dogs. There is no justification for permitting dogs to be allowed to live in areas where they might create a danger of accidents on certain highways. There are, of course, other highways where the traffic is not so heavy and the problem is not so acute.<br/>
The Committee considering this matter ought to consider the imposition of a complete prohibition in certain areas. After all, I suppose one must have a certain amount of sympathy with the dog itself. As for the local authorities, the Parliamentary Secretary has said they would be aware of people's habits in exercising their dogs in any particular locality. There, I think, he is placing too big a responsibility on local authorities; they know many things, but I doubt whether they know the habits and customs of all breeds and kinds of dogs, and their owners, the times they go out and what they do.</p>

<p>Our inquiry should be carried a little further than the Parliamentary Secretary has indicated. If he is to place the responsibility upon local authorities now for carrying out this function in regard to highways, then we ought to know what reaction that will have upon existing local authority byelaws. As I have said, they now ban the pavement to dogs, and they are to ban the roads as well. It seems to me that the only answer lies in complete prohibition in certain designated areas. Some case can be made for that. Otherwise, I cannot see how this provision will be quite as workable a proposition as the Parliamentary Secretary seems to think it is likely to be.</p>

<p>We must recognise the difficulty and seriousness of this subject. The trouble is that it is both funny and serious. The Government undoubtedly face an extremely difficult problem in devising a provision which makes sense and will work.<br/>
I was shocked when I discovered how high a proportion of road accidents

was caused by dogs. When we think of the public indignation which, quite rightly, exists about accidents caused by drunkenness among drivers and compare the number of accidents known to be due to that cause with the immensely larger number known to have been caused by dogs, it is astonishing, and an interesting comment upon the social habits of the British, that no such indignation exists against the owners of dogs which cause accidents on the road. Although the number varies in different areas, it is ten or twenty times as great.<br/>
The difficulty is that whereas most of the accidents caused by dogs are in built up areas, nearly all the serious and fatal accidents caused by dogs occur on country roads and usually in relation to motor cyclists. I cannot give exact figures but about seven-tenths of all fatal accidents caused by dogs are to motor cyclists and occur largely on country roads. That is the great difficulty facing us in dealing with this problem. It is a defect which also diminishes the value of the new Clause in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page)&#x2014;"Offences relating to dogs"&#x2014;which, otherwise, I prefer to the Government's new Clause.<br/>
However difficult the matter and whatever ridicule one lays oneself open to, something must be done about this problem. We should make a try. I am not happy about the Government's new Clause. I am disposed to accept it as at least some progress, but I see the difficulty about how people are to know what is a designated road. [An HON. MEMBER: "How will the dogs know?"] It does not matter about the dogs; it is their owners we are after.<br/>
The Clause provides for publication in a local newspaper, but that will occur only once and the byelaw will go on for ever. Knowing, as one does, how byelaws against the fouling of footpaths and for keeping dogs on leads are common and extensive, one knows that they are almost entirely dead letters and almost entirely unenforced.</p>

<p>Therefore, I am a little sceptical about this apparatus of designated streets in relation to dogs. We would have to paint a green line or something similar along the pavement if we


want people to know that a road is designated. It would become somewhat ridiculous.<br/>
I am attracted still by the basic approach of my hon. Friend the Member for Crosby to attach responsibility&#x2014;criminal in the case of my hon. Friend's proposal; it might well be civil&#x2014;to the owner of a dog which causes an accident. Of course, that would not work if the dog was not caught but, equally, neither would any other provision. Unless the dog is caught, no one know whose it is.<br/>
I remember that when the House was dealing with a Bill concerning dogs and the worrying of sheep, many people said it would never be of value because its provisions could only be enforced against owners of dogs which were caught and that the dogs were never caught. That Measure has now been in force for three or four years and hon. Members on both sides will confirm that it has been most useful and many prosecutions have taken place under it. In fact, if an accident is caused by a dog, the dog is not infrequently caught. In such a case, one could quite properly proceed criminally against the owner.<br/>
What right have people to allow their dogs to wander untended in the streets in present-day conditions or untended, for that matter, on or near main roads in the country? People who keep dogs should take them out under proper supervision; they should not turn them out of doors to roam about all day and let what will happen. Far too many people are killed and injured every day as a result of that happening for us to take this matter in a light-hearted way.<br/>
Nevertheless, I think that some progress should be made. I would only say about the new Clause that I am not happy about it. I hope that, before the Bill goes to another place, my right hon. Friend will see whether he cannot adopt the principle of my hon. Friend's new Clause, without its limitation to built-up areas, which, I think, destroys much of its value, and see whether, somehow or other, it cannot be shaped into a practicable form so that we may make some progress in this matter.</p>

<p>I think that everybody in the House, whatever may be the merits of the new Clause, must agree that this problem is a serious one which ought

to be tackled somehow. I do not know whether it is fully appreciated how many accidents are caused by dogs running loose on the roads, and I should like to give the House some figures which I have been studying while the debate has proceeded.<br/>
One can only give useful figures by comparing the number of accidents caused by dogs with the number of accidents caused by other factors. Let us take some of the common factors in causing accidents, and these figures relate to 1954. Failing to afford free passage to pedestrians at pedestrian crossing places caused 1,970 accidents; turning round in the road negligently, 1,054; reversing negligently, 1,839; dazzled by the lights of another vehicle, 1,796; under the influence of drink or drugs, 826. The number of accidents caused by dogs being on a carriageway is much greater than any of these factors. The figure is 2,626. Everyone who motors nowadays must have had experience of the enormous number of near-accidents which take place, when accidents are only avoided by great skill or luck, when a dog suddenly runs across the road.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-05-30a.360.0" hansard_membership_id="7490" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/32708" speakername="Mr. Page" colnum="360" time="">
<p>Would the right hon. Gentleman make it clear that the figure of 2,626 which he has quoted relates only to those accidents in which people have been killed or injured? There is a very large number of other accidents in which dogs are involved, but in these 2,626 cases people were actually killed or injured.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-05-30a.360.1" hansard_membership_id="12567" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29563" speakername="Mr. Strauss" colnum="360" time="">
<p>Certainly; I was making a comparison, and I was saying that three times more people are killed or injured because of dogs running across the road than by motorists who were drunk or under the influence of drugs when driving a car.<br/>
Therefore, I think that any Government introducing a Bill which is designed to reduce the number of accidents on the roads must do something about this, or try to do something about it. I agree straight away that any Minister of Transport who tries to do anything about this problem faces a very difficult task indeed. It is exceedingly, and any proposal which he puts forward may be ineffective and is certain to be ridiculed. All he can do is to say, "Well, let us try to do something." This is a proposal, which I personally think is the best proposal, which


should be tried as an experiment. It may work or it may not, but if it does not work we shall have to try something else. I do not see any better way of dealing with it than this way, and I will give my reasons.<br/>
What are the alternatives? One is that put forward by the hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page), which makes it an offence on the owner's part if a dog is responsible for an accident. I do not see that that would be effective. What would happen? If there is an accident because a dog suddenly crosses the road, we take the owner of the dog into court and tell him that he is responsible for allowing a dog to run across the road. What would be his reply? It would be that the dog had never done it before. The owner would say that he could not tell that there would be a cat on the other side of the road, or a dog friend or a dog enemy, that would attract his dog suddenly to cross the road. Of course, there would be no conviction, or, if there was a conviction, it would be only a nominal one.<br/>
Surely, the right way to tackle this is, somehow or other, to try to prevent dogs being on roads carrying heavy traffic, to prevent them being allowed to walk on such roads at all except under control. That seems to me the only sensible way of doing it, to say that in certain streets, perhaps certain areas, dogs must be on the leash. It really is not such a terrible hardship to have to keep a dog on a leash in busy streets. Everyone who has a puppy always takes his puppy out on a leash in busy places or in any place where there may be danger to the puppy or to anyone. Therefore, it is not, surely unreasonable to say that certain roads are so dangerous that there dogs must be kept on leashes? By doing that we may save many hundreds of lives a year.<br/>
It must be left to local authorities to take the initiative in the matter and to designate those roads which they regard as dangerous in their areas. It may be that local authorities will be slow to act in the matter because they may not want to incur unpopularity by preventing people from exercising their dogs unleashed, but I hope that many of them will have a sufficient sense of responsibility to pass byelaws insisting that dogs shall be kept leashed in busy streets. They can ask their people to co-operate

with them, and they can see what happens. Perhaps, they may not be successful, but I do not see why.<br/>
Of course, people can ridicule the idea. They may say that, despite byelaws, a dog may run out of a house, of which the door has inadvertently been left open, and run into the street and be the cause of an accident. None of these schemes can be 100 per cent. perfect, but it does not follow that they cannot achieve beneficial results. Of course, there can be circumstances in which an unleashed dog may cause an accident, but its owner may have a sufficient excuse for not being in control of the dog at the time, and no prosecution would take place.<br/>
A prohibition on the permitting of dogs to run about uncontrolled in busy places can be reinforced by propaganda explaining to the public the need for the byelaws, and that propaganda would have an effect on people's consciences, so that they would desire to co-operate with the local authority in seeing that dogs were kept under control, at least in designated streets.<br/>
At least, the new Clause will mean that a very great number of dogs on designated roads will be kept leashed on those roads, perhaps 90 per cent. and, maybe, 90 per cent. fewer accidents will occur than would have occurred but for the new Clause. One hon. Member has said today that byelaws against dogs fouling pavements have been ineffective. Of course, those byelaws are not 100 per cent. effective, but I am certain that they have some good effect. In Kensington, they have had a substantial effect in making dog owners much more careful. The proposal of the new Clause is easier to enforce. The offence is easier to check, because if a person takes out a dog unleashed on a designated road he is liable to be summoned.<br/>
Upon all these road safety matters we have expressed personal views, and they are non-party matters, and, personally, I fully support the Government in the proposal they are making. I understand their difficulty, and I realise that their proposal may not be a success and may be unpopular, but it appears to me the most effective way of attempting to deal with this very serious problem. I know of no better way, and I give them my wholehearted support. I hope many local authorities will pass the requisite byelaws


&#x2014;in agreement with the chiefs of police, though that in some cases may be difficult to obtain&#x2014;to see whether the high rate of casualties in accidents caused by dogs wandering about the roads can be materially reduced by this proposal of the Ministry.</p>

<p>I am very grateful to the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Vauxhall (Mr. G. R. Strauss) and to my hon. Friend the Member for Buckinghamshire, South (Mr. R. Bell) for drawing out the seriousness of this problem. I am grateful to the Minister, too, for the new Clause, which is the result of a new Clause I introduced in Standing Committee and of the very interesting and thorough discussion which this subject received upstairs.<br/>
The figure quoted by the right hon. Gentleman, of 2,626 accidents caused by dogs in 1954, in each of which someone was killed or injured, went up in 1955 to 2,848. It has been estimated that as many as 75,000 dogs a year are either killed on the roads, or so badly maimed that they have to be put to death&#x2014;that is, about one-fortieth of the dog population. Therefore, those who are animal lovers can see the tragedies that occur to animals on the roads and those who have in mind the interests of human beings can see the seriousness of the problem when it is realised that 3,000 accidents are caused every year by dogs and that human beings are either killed or injured as a result.<br/>
9.0 p.m.<br/>
In a great proportion of the London parks a byelaw requiring that one must have a dog on a lead is severely enforced. I know, because one of the parks is directly opposite my house. If I take a dog into the park, and it is off the lead, I am immediately called to order by the park-keeper for doing so. It is amazing that we have this byelaw for the protection of plants in parks and we find some difficulty in enforcing a similar byelaw for the protection of life on the roads.<br/>
In the Metropolitan area alone, 19,000 stray dogs are collected every year by the police. The police have no difficulty in taking up these dogs, and 6,000 of them are claimed by their owners from the police station. Therefore, a third of the owners of stray dogs are traced by the police themselves. The remainder of the dogs go to Battersea Dogs' Home or some

other home where more of the owners claim them. I cannot give the figure for the proportion in that case, but from these figures it will be seen that it is not difficult to trace the owner of a stray dog. I do not think that it would be difficult to enforce a byelaw of this sort. If a dog strays off the lead on a road designated by the local authority it should not be difficult for the police to take action.<br/>
I cannot help feeling that a proposed new Clause on the Notice Paper in my name, dealing with offences relating to dogs, is better than this Clause. In that Clause I endeavour to impose a penalty on those who allow their dogs to stray so as to be a danger or obstruction to traffic on a bus route in a built-up area. People would know where they had to keep their dogs on a lead in that case, but I am grateful to the Minister for introducing the present Clause. I support it as going some way towards meeting the very serious problem which the dog presents on the road.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) made a very powerful case for doing something about this problem, though not necessarily in this way, when we discussed the matter in Standing Committee. He received very strong support from my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds. West (Mr. C. Pannell), who reminded us that he had campaigned long, and he hoped that eventually it would be with success. for something to be done about the danger caused by dogs straying on the roads.<br/>
The hon. Member for Leeds, West is not here tonight to welcome this new Clause, so I am doing it on his behalf. I understand that my hon. Friend is in America, where I hope they appreciate to the full the flavour and humour of the remarks which he makes from time to time. I remember that in commenting on the matter with which this new Clause is concerned he once used the phrase that the dog was the sacred cow of the British way of life.<br/>
Certain it is that this straying of dogs on the roads is a matter which it is right that we should tackle, and perhaps tackle in this way. I agree with the hon. Gentleman the Member for Buckinghamshire, South (Mr. R. Bell) who said that this Clause was being ridiculed, as was


the Dogs (Protection of Livestock) Act, 1953. In fact that Act has had a measure of success, though not a complete success. The week before last the Minister of Agriculture told me that he was not wholly satisfied with the operation of that Act but nevertheless it was working fairly well. It so happened that last week I went to my local court. There I found that two dog owners were being prosecuted for permitting dogs to trespass after livestock. They would not have been prosecuted had it not been for the fact of that Act being placed upon the Statute Book. It brought home to dog owners the seriousness of the offence.<br/>
When I drive a car there are three classes of road user of whom I am much afraid. They are the wobbly cyclist, the straying sheep, particularly in Wales, and the dog. I am very much afraid of those three road users.</p>

<p>This proposal seems to me to be merely shunting a difficult problem on to the local authorities. I was much impressed by the speeches of my hon. Friend the Member for Acton (Mr. Sparks) and of the hon. Members for Crosby (Mr. Page) and Buckinghamshire, South (Mr. R. Bell). This problem will not be solved by the mere passing of this Measure, which gives the local authorities the delicate and difficult job of designating areas and then puts the onus on dog owners to keep their dogs on leads. In fact, many dog owners who do not have their dogs on leads have them much more under control than others who have their dogs on leads.<br/>
This proposal does not solve the problem, and I ask the Minister to consider

the form of words. We want to do something to mitigate the danger of dogs on the roads, but I ask the Minister not to take the simple way out of merely saying that a dog must be on a lead. I prefer the form of words indicated by the hon. Member for Crosby, which specify some point of danger or obstruction to traffic. Alternatively, the word "control" should be incorporated in the Bill.<br/>
It seems to me that dog owners who take the trouble to train their dogs, and keep them effectively under control, should have that point recognised. A constable who is looking for a few easy prosecutions can charge a dog owner with a technical offence who has his dog at heel, because it can be said that the dog is not on a lead, although he is completely under control, whereas the person who should be charged is the owner whose dog is on the road and causing danger.<br/>
Therefore, this new Clause seems to me to he unsatisfactory. When the Minister replies to the debate will he tell me whether the phrase "designated road" includes the pavements on each side of it? I suppose it is a point I should know. If it does not include the pavements, the difficulty may arise which was mentioned by the hon. Member for Acton, that if a dog wants to respond to the call of nature its owner can be charged with committing an offence under this Measure or one under the byelaws of the local authority. From my experience, anyone who can time the inclinations of a dog in these matters in relation to designated streets has his dog under such control that the use of a lead is completely superfluous.</p>

<p>I had intended to say almost precisely what the hon. Member for Sheffield, Park (Mr. Mulley) has said.<br/>
I want to make a very strong plea to the Minister about the word "lead". Either the Canine Defence League or the R.S.P.C.A. has been campaigning for a considerable time, trying to teach people how to control dogs without having them on leads, and considerable success has been achieved. It would be very sad if the day came when, by law, people were not permitted to exercise control over their dogs in a way in which it can well be done if they know how to do it. I have done it all my life. I know quite well that my dog is under better control


when I have not got him on a lead. Any dog on a lead is a sitting target for another dog. A first-class way to start a row between dogs is to have one's dog on a lead. If one's dog is under proper control, walking at heel, there will probably not be a row if another dog is encountered.<br/>
I hope that the Minister will be able to delete "lead" from the Clause and insert "under proper control".</p>

<p>We are all anxious to limit the number of accidents on the road. I do not like the new Clause tabled by the hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) because in that case the accident appears to occur first and then the dog gets into trouble. I prefer the Minister's Clause, although I believe it will be completely unworkable. [<i>Laughter</i>.] That is not so humorous as it might sound. Subsection (5) gives the secret away.<br/>
The Clause will be workable only if the police undertake its enforcement. I gather from the subsection, after having some experience of negotiating byelaws and so on, that the police have asked to be relieved of the responsibility for enforcement. The police will be on the highly trafficked roads, and if they see such a dog they ought to treat it as they do stray dogs, for which they have the responsibility to which the hon. Member for Crosby referred.<br/>
The responsibility is in many cases put on county district councils. Small urban district councils and rural district councils in areas in which there are a number of villages with narrow, highly trafficked streets will not be able to afford to have on the roads servants looking for such dogs. If it is to be left to the local authorities, the provision will be unenforceable and unenforced.<br/>
I hope that the Minister will consult the Home Secretary. The Joint Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department is sitting beside him, and therefore, he can easily make an arrangement for an interview at very short notice. Perhaps he can bring some influence to bear on the police authorities so that if local authorities make byelaws&#x2014;they have to be made after consultation with the chief constables of the areas concerned&#x2014;they will undertake a substantial share of the enforcement.<br/>
9.15 p.m.<br/>
I share the feelings of chief constables who do not want fresh duties put on the police who have to control road traffic as part of their duty. The presence of dogs on the roads makes that task more difficult than it would otherwise be. There are not merely cases where an accident occurs. I know a lady who had had a leg amputated when a dog ran across the road and the driver of the car pulled up sharply and the lady was thrown from her seat. That sort of thing frequently happens through dogs being on the road, and there are no statistics about it.</p>

<p>I am not trying to minimise the problem, but to point out the very serious inconvenience caused to people and the injuries which are sometimes not reported. If someone hits his head on a partition in a car, he does not run along to the police station to report it.<br/>
I agree with what the hon. Member for Buckinghamshire, South (Mr. R. Bell) has said about the importance of this matter. I am pleading with the Minister to get the police interested in the matter and to persuade them to accept a large share of the responsibility for securing the enforcement of these byelaws, wherever they are made. Without that, I am certain that, although we pass a law, it will not be effective. With police help and support it can be made effective. Subsection (5) is an indication that up to the present the police have expressed the decided view that they will keep out of it.</p>

<p>The tenor of the debate has indicated that all who have participated in it agree that the Clause will be completely unworkable. Hon. Members have been talking about the menace caused by animals trespassing on the road. Apart from the Minister, I have heard no one argue in favour of the Clause that it would be effective for the purpose for which it is designed. If that is the case, and if there is a problem of straying animals on the road, why is not the Minister sufficiently courageous to deal with that problem?<br/>
Why should only dogs be given a bad name? There are other animals which stray and which cause damage and injury. If any animal causes injury and damage, then the owner of that animal should be punished for it. I see no reason why a penalty should be restricted to one particular type of animal. All animals which are allowed to stray on the public highway and cause damage should come within the scope of the Bill.</p>

<p>What my hon. Friend has in mind is the sheep which came down and ate the cabbages on the allotments in Pontypool three years ago.</p>

<p>They ate them three years ago and they are eating them today. They are still trespassing and causing considerable damage in the area from which I come. The Minister should tackle the problem of straying sheep.<br/>
There are other parts of the country where this problem of straying animals occurs. In the New Forest and in towns around the New Forest straying ponies cause considerable damage, and there are notices on the roadsides warning motorists of the danger of straying animals. The problem of such damage is one which the Minister should attempt to tackle.<br/>
What is the Minister doing in this new Clause? Whom does he propose to catch? Is it the owner? In my respectful submission, the owner is not the person who will be caught. If a dog is trespassing on land and chasing a chicken and the owner of the chicken drives the dog off the land on to a designated roadway, he in fact has caused the dog to be on the roadway and he is the person who is to be convicted under the Clause. That is an utter and complete absurdity.<br/>
If it is the owner whom it is intended to catch by the new Clause, why does not the Minister say that it is the owner? I suggest, as all other hon. Members who have spoken have suggested, that the new Clause has not been thought out, that it is completely unworkable and that the Minister should withdraw it and have second thoughts about it.</p>

<p>As a matter of courtesy to the House, I ask leave to reply very briefly to what has been said. The hon. Member for Pontypool (Mr. West) has surely demonstrated to the whole House how impossible it is to satisfy some people. He asks that the Minister should have the courage to deal with all cases of animals upon the highway. We have done what we can about animals in the New Forest. We have had a conference there and it has been quite impossible to solve the problem of the wild animals which come on to the roads there.<br/>
We have confined ourselves in the new Clause to dealing with the special problem of dogs. As has been said, about 75,000 dogs are involved in road accidents every year. One-seventh of all the road accidents that take place are, to a greater or lesser extent, caused by dogs. I should like to express my appreciation of the speech of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Vauxhall (Mr. G. R. Strauss), who has said that he feels that in view of the rate of accidents of that kind no Minister of Transport introducing a Road Traffic Bill to try to reduce the number of accidents could fail to include a Clause which attempted to deal with this cause of such a very large proportion of accidents.<br/>
The speeches during the debate have been of most diverse kinds, but perhaps about half of them came down in favour of the Clause and about half were against the Clause. Those hon. Members who were against the Clause were usually against it on the ground that they feared that it would be ineffective. They were not usually able to put forward any suggestion of what other steps could be taken that would be more effective.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) preferred his own Clause, which attaches criminal liability to the owner of a dog where actual damage or injury results from its action. But, as the right hon. Gentleman the Member for South Shields (Mr. Ede) pointed out, the effect of that would be entirely capricious. It would mean that the penalty would fall upon the owner of a dog who probably had had the misfortune to have his dog killed or injured, and a very large number of people who were even more careless in looking after their dogs which did not happen to


involved in any accident would be free from any liability.<br/>
From the logical point of view, it is far better to legislate to keep dogs under control than to penalise the owners of dogs after accidents have occurred.<br/>
We believe that the best way to deal with the problem is to leave it to the experienced discretion of the local authorities. That was the suggestion originally made by the right hon. Member for Vauxhall. After the most careful consideration a special sub-committee of the Departmental Committee on Road Safety arrived at the same conclusion. After listening to our debate tonight, I must confess that no new suggestion has been advanced which would make me think that any alternative proposal would be more effective.<br/>
Of course, a great deal will depend on public opinion. I believe that the fact that Parliament has legislated in this way to give power to local authorities will have some effect on public opinion. But it will depend, first, upon the willingness of the local authorities to avail themselves of the powers given to them and then on the power of public opinion to ensure that any offenders against the byelaws are fined by the local magistrates. I do not make any exaggerated claims for this Clause, but I believe that, on the whole, it is the best proposal which we can put forward. I believe that it will have a beneficial effect on public opinion and if we are supported by public opinion, it will result in a substantial reduction in road accidents.</p>

<p>Opinions among the police are divided, as they are among everybody who has considered this matter. It may be that in some parts of the country the police will be more active in enforcing byelaws of this kind than in other parts. In fairness, since I have been asked the question, I feel bound to say that some chief constables take the

view that at a time when their forces are not at full strength it would be impossible to devote much time or manpower to enforcing byelaws of this kind.<br/>
For that reason, as the right hon. Gentleman rightly deduced, we included subsection (5) in the Clause. We thought it reasonable and logical, since no local authority is under an obligation to enforce regulations of this kind, that responsibility for enforcing them should be placed on the local authority.</p>

<p>Frankly, I am not happy about this Clause and I hope that the Minister will look at it again before we arrive at a further stage in the proceedings on this Bill. In Buckinghamshire, we have had experience of local authorities, with the assistance of the police, creating byelaws overnight, and without due public notice criminals are made of ordinary people the next morning.<br/>
I should like to see this Clause amended so as to include something to the effect that due notification must be given in the local Press about these matters. I should like to see inserted in this Clause something to the effect that there must be adequate public notice given about any road being designated as not a dog area in the future.</p>

<p>I beg to move, at the end of subsection (3) to insert:
<q>and (without prejudice to the generality of this subsection, the said subsection (1) shall not apply to dogs proved to be kept for driving or tending sheep or cattle in the course of a trade or business, or to have been at the material time in use under proper control for sporting purposes".</q>
This Clause has as its object safety on the road and my Amendment has the same object. Three special considerations are involved. First, in Scotland and England there are at certain seasons of the year large congregations of lambs brought together. They are usually brought to the towns and it really would create complete chaos unless those lambs, sheep and ewes were controlled by sheep


dogs, which are the first class of case that this Amendment seeks to exclude from the provisions of the new Clause.<br/>
The next class of case relates to the cattle markets. In my part of the country cattle are coming in to the various local towns two or three times a week. Very often they come by train and are then driven to the auction market. There, again, there would be complete chaos in the streets of these local towns unless the sheep dogs, the collies, which are trained to work with cattle, were allowed to herd them.<br/>
The third class of case I have in mind is mainly an English one, although it does happen in Scotland&#x2014;the meeting of packs of hounds in the local town square, where it is quite a picturesque and popular local custom for the hounds to meet. I believe that they have a thing called a stirrup cup and that afterwards the hounds, under proper control, proceed to their normal duties in the countryside.<br/>
Those are the three classes for which I seek exemption from the provisions of this new Clause, and I think that the need to exempt them is self-evident. I have had discussions with the Ministry about this and I gather from what my hon. Friend has already said in the previous debate that he is willing to accept the Amendment.</p>

<p>Would the hon. and gallant Member for South Angus (Captain Duncan) explain just exactly what he means? We all understand that it is desirable to have these dogs excluded while they are performing their function of herding sheep and cattle. I, too, belong to a country town, and I know that after the dogs have done their job and reached the cattle market they are still on the roads, like any other dogs. Surely the same legislation should then apply to them as applies to other dogs.</p>

<p>I beg to second the Amendment.<br/>
It is obviously beneficial to the cause of safety on the roads because the sheep dogs and collies to which my hon. and gallant Friend has referred do organise that movement of sheep and cattle along the roads and are themselves no danger to traffic. They are well trained for traffic on the road.</p>

<p>I agree, of course, with the purpose of the Amendment, but I am a little worried about its actual wording. If a dog is kept for this purpose it does not seem necessarily to follow that the dog will always be driving cattle and sheep under control on the road. There must be occasions when the dog will not be under control despite the fact that it is kept for that purpose. Any exception of this nature should apply when the dog is actually being worked and used for this purpose.<br/>
The Amendment seems to give a wide exception to dogs kept for this purpose and would cover them at all times even when, quite obviously, they would not be under proper control and, in fact, driving or controlling animals on the roads. I think that the Minister is accepting an Amendment which is very wide and would exempt many dogs in circumstances in which they should not be exempt.</p>

<p>I want to strengthen the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, South-East (Mr. Champion). What happens when shepherds come into the town having performed their job and are in the town for the rest of the afternoon with their dogs? The very fact that the dog has been designated as a dog kept for this purpose puts it outside the provisions of the Clause.<br/>
As the Amendment is acceptable to the Joint Parliamentary Secretary, I can only appeal to a higher authority. Will the Lord Advocate tell us how this will work in Scotland? How will people who are owners of dogs which are well trained and have their dogs under control view this provision when they see a dog not


on the leash because it has come into town with a shepherd herding cattle and that dog can wander where it likes and the owner not be subject to penalties? This is complete nonsense. I am surprised that a Minister with a Law Officer sitting beside him should so gaily accept this Amendment.</p>

<p>Are we to have a reply on the point made by my hon. Friends? They have made an effective point which requires a reply. There may be a good answer, but we have not had it. There may be a case in which a dog is normally kept for herding sheep and the farmer may take it into town on a Sunday when he visits relatives, but then the dog has nothing to do with herding sheep. In those circumstances, surely the dog ought to be under the same control as any other dog which is taken for a walk along a designated street.<br/>
I suggest that the Minister should look at this question. He certainly cannot leave it as it is without giving a reply. Either the arguments put forward by my hon. Friends call for some reply or the Minister should agree to look at the question to see whether something can be done.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That the Clause be read a Second time.<br/>
The text of this Clause is identical to that which I moved in the Standing Committee and which, I think, found majority support in the Committee. It was left in a state of suspended animation because of certain assurances which the then Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation, my right hon. Friend who is now the Minister of Pensions and National Insurance, was able to give the Committee.<br/>
In order to shorten my speech on this occasion&#x2014;and I have no desire at all to repeat any of the lengthy arguments which were adduced in Committee&#x2014;might I quote two short passages from my right hon. Friend's speech on 15th December last. He said:
<q>It has been in the hope of securing the first objective"&#x2014;</q>
that is the removal of this speed limit&#x2014;
<q>that, as a good many Members of the Committee know, discussions have been taking place in the industry as to what are the possibilities. I do not want to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Kidderminster into the discussion as to whom represents whom on the employers or employees side in the industry. It is one of the problems of the industry that this structure, both on the employers or employees side, is a good deal more complicated than that of other industries, and that in itself, may well be a contributing factor to making this a more difficult situation in which to reach agreement.</q>
Later in the same speech the Minister endorsed the principle of the desirability of removing the 20 m.p.h. speed limit on heavy goods vehicles&#x2014;that is, vehicles which have an unladen weight in excess of three tons. The Minister then said&#x2014;and I think these words are very important:
<q>As frankly and clearly as I can. I have indicated the view of the Government on this matter, that, on the merits, there is very little that need be said against the proposal of the change. but the time of any such change is a matter which still requires consideration in the light of the discussions which have taken place, and I do not think it would be the wish of any Member of the Committee, in these circumstances. to take a step as we could do today, which might make it more difficult to arrive at a satisfactory settlement of this question."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Standing Committee B,</i> 15th December, 1955; c. 858 and 860.]</q>
In the light of what the Minister said on that occasion, my hon. Friends and I withdrew the proposed new Clause in the Standing Committee. We wished the


negotiations between the interested bodies&#x2014;the Road Haulage Association, representing certain of the heavy goods vehicle owners on the one hand, the Transport and General Workers' Union representing the majority of the drivers on the other hand, and also the watching brief held by British Road Services&#x2014;to take their normal course in the hope that a settlement could be reached on what was the principal outstanding impediment&#x2014;namely, the revision of drivers' schedules and revised scales of remuneration for the drivers. They were very valid objectives to which I, for my part, fully subscribed.<br/>
The fact is that another six months have elapsed. added to a delay of what previously had been more than twenty years while these discussions in one form or another had been going on. In fact, at regular intervals since 1934 this question has been raised in the House and elsewhere, and particularly of course in the lifetime of the second post-war Labour Government, when the then Minister of Transport responded nearly as favourably as did my right hon. Friend in the Standing Committee on 15th December to a Motion that was signed by more than 250 Members of this House urging upon the Minister, on a number of very valid grounds, the desirability of raising the speed limit from 20 to 30 m.p.h.<br/>
As a footnote, I might add that there are 110,000 vehicles in this country tied to the speed limit of 20 m.p.h., and of 110,000 vehicles 64,000 of them&#x2014;this is an important figure&#x2014;are C licence vehicles, owned for the overwhelming part by private firms. The remaining 46,000 vehicles are of A and B licences, and included in that 46,000 is the entire fleet of vehicles owned by British Road Services which today we estimate at about 12,000 vehicles, which are tied to a limit of 20 m.p.h.<br/>
9.45 p.m.<br/>
I wish very briefly to recapitulate the urgent reasons which make it desirable to revise this speed limit upwards to 30 m.p.h. The first is, obviously, on grounds of much lower operating costs. If all these vehicles can run at the higher speed limit, then, without placing any undue burden upon any interested party, it should lead to greater productivity. The second is on the ground of road safety.

There have been arguments advanced that road safety would further be prejudiced if these heavy vehicles were allowed to run at the higher rate. In fact, all the evidence is to the contrary.<br/>
In 1954, my right hon. Friend the then Minister of Transport used these words, which I think are conclusive:
<q>Some recent observations by the Laboratory indicated that on roads in areas not built up about 95 per cent. of heavy goods vehicles exceed 20 miles an hour, and some 65 to 70 per cent. exceed 25 miles an hour."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL. REPORT, 28th July, 1954; Vol. 531, c. 68.]</q>
Furthermore, as I said' in Committee, the final Report of the Committee on Road Safety in 1947 used these words, that
<q>having regard to improvements in braking equipment, we see no objection on grounds of road safety to an increase of the speed limit of 20 m.p.h. at present applicable to heavy goods vehicles.</q>
I suggest that a combination of those two considerations&#x2014;the fact that 95 per cent. of these vehicles are already exceeding the limit and working at speeds up to 30 m.p.h., and the assurance of the Road Safety Committee that braking power and other mechanical factors are now adequate to deal with vehicles operating at the higher rate&#x2014;should dispose of any suggestion that road safety would be prejudiced by increasing the speed limit of these 110,000 vehicles.<br/>
It is also, I think, incontrovertible that, particularly on long runs, on which most of these heavy vehicles operate, driver fatigue is lessened if the vehicle may be driven at 30 m.p.h. I have, on occasion, travelled on overnight, long-distance lorries, in the cab, on runs of 200 miles or more. I can imagine nothing more tiring to the driver of the vehicle than having to operate at a speed of 20 m.p.h. throughout, when, very often, on long stretches of open road, he can comfortably drive his vehicle at 30 miles an hour, reaching his destination more quickly, without in any way prejudicing road safety.<br/>
Further, it is an anomaly, of course, that heavy vehicles are tied to a speed limit of 20 m.p.h., whereas heavy passenger vehicles are subject to a limit of 30 miles an hour. It seems to me rather ridiculous that human freight should be placed in a higher category as regards speed limit than material freight. It seems to me rather ridiculous that a vehicle such as a large double-decker bus


of the heaviest kind should be allowed to travel at 30 miles an hour, whereas a goods vehicle of comparable weight and carrying inanimate objects and material is allowed to travel at only 20 miles an hour.<br/>
Finally, there are substantial financial benefits to be derived by owners, by drivers, and by consumers alike, from a change in the speed limit. There is a tripartite interest in this long-overdue reform. Owners ought to be able to operate their vehicles on a more profitable basis. The drivers, as I averred and explained in some detail during the Committee stage, ought to have a direct participation in the extra earnings and profitability of the vehicles concerned. Lastly, it should be possible to pass on a measure of the savings that a 30 miles an hour limit would bring to the hard-pressed consumer who, in these days, is inevitably faced with rising costs on every hand and is very rarely offered a reduction.<br/>
<i>The Times</i> this morning had a second leader on this subject. It is one of a large group of reputable journals which have supported the view that this speed limit should be raised at an early date. <i>The Times</i> uses these words:
<q>Other Clauses remove discrepancies or loopholes in the present law. There is one notable nettle here that the Minister has not grasped&#x2014;the 20 m.p.h. speed limit for goods vehicles. This, which is everywhere ignored, has its <i>raison d'etre</i> in lorry drivers' schedules, not in road safety. The law should either he amended so that it will he observed and enforced, or exceeding the limit should cease to be a nominal offence altogether. Whatever the law can do to make the roads safe is inevitably weakened if some of its provisions are openly and habitually disregarded.</q>
Bearing in mind that 95 per cent. of these vehicles break the law, I think we would all agree that the law should not continue to be brought into disrepute.<br/>
The <i>Economist</i> has been so bold as to say, in its latest issue&#x2014;26th May&#x2014;that the Minister proposes to resist this new Clause. I am not sure where it gets its information from or what special prescience it claims, but it is quite emphatic. The <i>Economist,</i> after supporting in the previous week the abolition of the 20 m.p.h. limit, wrote on 26th May:
<q>The Minister will resist an Amendment by Mr. Nabarro to raise the speed limit on goods vehicles from 20 m.p.h. to 30 m.p.h. at this stage and in this Bill. He should be pressed"&#x2014;</q>

that is, the Minister; I am pressing him now&#x2014;
<q>to say why. The 20 m.p.h. speed limit for goods vehicles is never enforced at the moment; the sole reason for retaining it is that the lorry drivers have made it clear that they would resist Mr. Nabarro's Amendment.</q>
In fact, the lorry drivers have done nothing of the kind. The <i>Economist</i> is wholly wrong in this matter. What the lorry drivers have done, through the Transport and General Workers' Union, is the perfectly reasonable thing, in a complicated matter of this kind, of trying to assure that they will have a proper share of the increased profitability of the vehicles which they drive. That is a principle that I strongly espouse this evening.<br/>
We have had years of delay in this matter, and in an effort to try to put a time limit on these negotiations I suggest to my right hon. Friend that he must do one of two things. Either he should accept the new Clause this evening and add it to the Bill, so that when it reaches the Statute Book&#x2014;it may be longer, but say within a matter of eight weeks&#x2014;the negotiating bodies are thereby compelled to bring their negotiations to a successful conclusion. Surely, they can go on sitting round the table for that eight weeks and reach a successful conclusion; it ought not to be beyond their wits.<br/>
Alternatively, as my right hon. Friend already has the powers under the Statute of 1934 to make a variation order for the rasing of the speed limit of these vehicles from 20 to 30 m.p.h., he can proceed on the basis of the 1934 Statute and say tonight that if I will withdraw my new Clause, he will make such an order under the Statute of 1934 and make it operative from a date forward&#x2014;say, 31st December next or even 31st March, 1957&#x2014;to give adequate, and more than adequate, time to the negotiating bodies which I have mentioned to bring their further discussions to a successful conclusion.<br/>
The case for this reform is overwhelming, which is most pressingly urgent today on the grounds of national productivity and exports. I leave my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Mr. Gresham Cooke), who I hope will catch your eye, Mr. Speaker, to deal with the factor of the improved design of heavy vehicles for our export trade, which is another material consideration. I trust that, when my right hon. Friend replies


to this short debate on the new Clause, he will be able to give us a more satisfactory answer, indeed, a conclusive answer, on this problem, and add lustre to his not inconsiderable reputation as present incumbent of the office of Minister of Transport.</p>

<p>Will the hon.

<p>If I may reply to that point, may I say that I think there is an element of truth in what the hon. and learned Gentleman has said, but I am encouraged by the fact that, since we debated the matter in Standing Committee on 15th December last&#x2014;six months ago&#x2014;very considerable progress has been made by the negotiating bodles, and, in fact, the issues outstanding have now been so narrowed down as to be capable of resolution within a few weeks.

<p>I beg to second the Motion.<br/>
It is a pleasure to me to second this Motion at three minutes to ten o'clock, because it gives me the opportunity to point out to the Minister of Transport that it has been pitch dark outside for the last half-hour, but it is not yet officially lighting-up time.<br/>
Those who have been interested in this question of road transport for very many years will confirm everything that my hon. Friend the Member for Kidderminster (Mr. Nabarro) has said. Road transport interests have been trying to get this reform brought into force for the last 20 years. There is every reason for doing so at present in fact, it is ridiculous that the law should not be put into proper shape. The real reason why that has not been done during all these years has been the one question of wages.<br/>
I think I have seen, in other capacities, nearly every Minister of Transport since

Dr. Burgin on this subject, and every Minister has said, "It is very desirable to do this, and we want to do it very soon. We are just waiting for some discussions about wages." Some of us, and, I think, many Conservative Party supporters, are becoming extremely tired of being held up like this. We are tired of a change of the law which is both beneficial and desirable being held up because of disputes over wages.<br/>
The point is that, at the moment, under the 20 miles an hour speed limit, the average schedule is about 16 miles an hour, whereas if the speed limit were raised to 30 miles an hour, the average schedule would be about 22 or 23 miles an hour. This means that the London to Birmingham run, which now takes seven or eight hours, could be expected, if the limit were raised to 30 miles an hour, to be completed in five hours. The question then arises: what is to happen to the driver&#x2014;whether he is to be expected to drive on to another town or be compensated for the hours that he is saving?<br/>
I ask the Minister tonight to say that he will accept this proposal and bring this reform into effect, and let these discussions take place after the law has been changed. I do not see why we should keep on waiting for these discussions to conclude, when we have waited for over ten years already. In fact. I think it has really been a form of blackmail, because people have said&#x2014;[<i>Interruption.</i>] I mean the people who are negotiating these wages, or not negotiating them, and I am not going to name the parties. We know that at present there are discussions between the Transport and General Workers' Union and the Road Haulage Association, which have not been brought to a head.<br/>
The law in this matter is a laughingstock, and just as much a laughing-stock as the law was in 1930, when, until the passing of the Road Traffic Act of that year, a motor car could not go faster than 20 miles an hour. I do not think we should take into account the question whether those discussions will be completed in a few years or a few months. I ask my right hon. Friend to say that he will change the law, and let the discussions take place in due course afterwards.</p>

<p>As the hon. Member for Kidderminster (Mr. Nabarro) has told the House, we had a very long discussion of this matter in Standing Committee, when the hon. Member made a very long speech containing some of the arguments he has adduced tonight in favour of increasing this speed limit. I object, and have always objected, to increasing the speed limit for heavy vehicles because, first, our roads are totally inadequate for excessive speeding by heavy vehicles. It is nonsense for hon. Members glibly to talk about a speed limit of 30 miles an hour for heavy road vehicles when the roads throughout the length and breadth of the land are not conducive to such speed by heavy vehicles.<br/>
The question of the construction of motor roads to enable vehicles to proceed at greater speed has been one of constant discussion in the industry and the nation for many years, but no Government have tried yet to tackle the very serious problem of the inadequacy of the roads to allow the increased speed. Before the House agrees to increase the speed limit for heavy vehicles to 30 miles an hour we ought to await the construction of the right type of roads, roads which will allow for such speeding, roads which, if there is such speeding, will save it from endangering the lives of the people.<br/>
The hon. Member for Kidderminster has made it perfectly clear where he stands upon this question of the 20 miles an hour or 30 miles an hour speed limit. He makes no excuse about it. He says that it is in the interest of industry that the speed limit should be increased to 30 miles an hour. It may be perfectly true. Why, however, stop at 30 miles an hour? The hon. Member has glibly told the House that 95 per cent. of the heavy goods vehicles today exceed the speed limit. That is a monstrous assertion. [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."] It is all right for hon. Members to laugh. [HON. MEMBERS: "We do not."] I do not think that that is the interpretation of the position at all.</p>

<p>I did not make that assertion. It was made by the then Minister of Transport on 28th July, 1954, when he said:
<q>Some recent observations by the Laboratory indicate that on roads in areas not built

up about 95 per cent. of heavy goods vehicles exceed 20 m.p.h. and some 65&#x2013;70 per cent. exceed 25 m.p.h."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 28th July, 1954; Vol. 531, c. 68.]</q>
Subsequently, the Lord Chancellor in another place confirmed those figures.</p>

<p>If the hon. Member will read HANSARD tomorrow he will find that what I said was perfectly true. The hon. Member said that 95 per cent. of the vehicles were exceeding the speed limit, and I have quoted precisely what he said.<br/>
I was very surprised at the speech of the hon. Member for Twickenham (Mr. Gresham Cooke). If anyone gave the game away, it was he. He said that the Minister should increase the speed limit in order to force an acceptance of the 30 m.p.h. In other words, he asked for the speed limit to be increased before there has been general agreement in the industry on the outstanding matters involved.<br/>
I have made it plain that I am opposed to increasing the speed limit on the ground of public safety and because our roads are inadequate for vehicles to travel at that speed. I make no apology for that. I come back to the point made by the hon. Member for Kidderminster&#x2014;the question of trade union negotiations on this very difficult problem. In spite of my opposition to increasing the speed limit in any circumstances, I say frankly to the Minister that if there are proceeding at the moment delicate negotiations between both sides of the industry on schedules of duty and the payment of drivers, this is not the time for the right hon. Gentleman to intervene on behalf of the road haulage employers' side of the industry.<br/>
Whatever the Minister's views may be, and whether or no he has finally made up his mind that the speed limit shall be increased in spite of the road difficulties, I urge him not to accept the proposed new Clause and to say quite emphatically to the House and to both sides of the industry that he is not prepared to be used by one side or the other to secure benefits for either the employers or the trade unions.<br/>
Where delicate negotiations are proceeding, the Minister should await the conclusion of the negotiations before taking any step in the direction indicated by the new Clause. In view of all the


circumstances, it would be unwise to incorporate the Clause in the Bill. As the hon. Member for Kidderminster has pointed out, the Minister already has power under the Road Traffic Act, 1934, to vary the speed limit. Why the hon. Gentleman wants to incorporate into the Bill a new Clause to duplicate the provisions and the powers of the Minister in the 1934 Act, I cannot understand. I ask the Minister, in view of all the relevant circumstances, not to accept this proposed new Clause.</p>

<p>I should not have intervened but for the speech of the hon. Member for Bradford, East (Mr. McLeavy). I wish that he and other hon. Gentlemen opposite would get it into their heads that this is not merely a question between the trade unions and the Road Haulage Association. It is a matter which affects public safety and public convenience.<br/>
As long ago as 1950 I mentioned in the House an instance in my own division. There, for more than 1&#x00BD; miles, a narrow road winds up the hill to Truro from the village of Tresillian, with a deep ravine on one side and a steep hill on the other. If any heavy vehicle observes the 20 mile per hour limit on that road a queue of other vehicles piles up behind it. I have seen that happen frequently in the last six years and again last Saturday. Somebody, perhaps a motor cyclist, at the back of the queue, gets tired of winding up the hill behind the other vehicles, cuts out, and comes round one of the many corners on the wrong side with no room to pass another vehicle should it meet one. Why we have not had anyone killed on that road during the last six years as a result of the 20 m.p.h. limit, I do not know.<br/>
have seen that form of dangerous driving on numerous occasions. The speed limit is merely provocation, because the public gets tired of following meandering vehicles travelling at a ridiculously slow pace. The danger on the roads lies not so much in the imposition of any specific speed but in having one vehicle travelling either much slower or much faster than the remainder.<br/>
Of course, we do not want this matter to be settled without agreement between the two sides of the industry, but I wish

they would hurry, because it is causing inconvenience and danger to the public.</p>

<p>The view which we on this side of the House hold about raising the speed limit for heavy vehicles from 20 m.p.h. to 30 m.p.h. is well known to all hon. Members. In principle, we are not opposed to such an increase, but we are firmly opposed to its imposition by the Government before agreement has been reached between the trade unions on the one hand and the employers on the other. There is the danger in this new Clause that it would lead to negotiation under duress, that it would be a form of blackmail, as it were, which would not result in satisfactory agreement being reached.<br/>
The Road Haulage Association is selfishly responsible for preventing higher productivity being brought into this industry, because it is standing in the way of sharing the benefits of that higher productivity between itself and the transport workers. Speaking in the Standing Committee, the hon. Member for Kidderminster (Mr. Nabarro) made that clear. He stated:
<q>The deadlock at this moment is because the Road Haulage Association flatly refuse an undertaking to grant to the drivers any substantial part of the proceeds that will flow from increased productivity. That is what is bedevilling the successful conclusion of negotiations. I emphasise that the Road Haulage Association is an unrepresentative and minority body in this connection".&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Standing Committee B,</i> 15th December, 1955 c. 825.]</q>
10.15 p.m.<br/>
The responsibility rests on the Road Haulage Association for selfishly refusing to meet the just demand of the workers that the conditions of operating the vehicles at higher speeds shall be agreed upon before the higher speed limit is permitted. In this respect the transport workers have justice on their side. They are acting rightly and in the interests of not only themselves but road safety. They must have conditions for driving the vehicles which they accept as practicable and as safe as can be. If higher schedules than the men feel capable of carrying out are imposed upon them and they are forced to drive at excessive speeds, the greater danger upon the roads becomes obvious.<br/>
While we oppose the Clause as it stands&#x2014;as my hon. Friend the Member


for Bradford, East (Mr. McLeavy) remarked, it is unnecessary because the Minister already has power to raise the speed limit by regulation&#x2014;</p>

<p>Yes, the Minister has the power, of course, but what I am anxious to do, and what I have done, is to precipitate the issue, both last December and this evening, in order to try to make the latest incumbent of the office of Minister of Transport make up his mind&#x2014;after twenty years&#x2014;to do something which is really desirable.</p>

<p>We strongly object to the Minister saying to the industry today, "In six months time I shall allow you to raise the speed limit from 20 to 30 m.p.h., and, therefore, you have to reach agreement." That would lead to negotiations taking place in circumstances which would prejudice the position of the transport workers.<br/>
While the Minister may be able to offer his services to assist in the negotiations and help towards an early conclusion, I hope that he will not be tempted by the fluency of his hon. Friend to announce the imposition of the higher speed limit without full negotiations having been concluded.</p>

<p>Surely it is all right for the Minister to make an order introducing a 30 m.p.h. limit for the purposes of certain sections of the road haulage industry, such as the C licence section and anyone else who has come to an agreement to work new schedules at a higher rate, even if a small part of the industry has not yet come to an agreement?</p>

<p>If the hon. Gentleman's argument were tenable it would mean that in the Lancashire cotton industry nobody would be working more than two looms. The fact that one cannot get standardisation throughout the industry at one moment surely is not an argument that there is not a case for increasing the speed limit.</p>

<p>There are national agreements about wages and working conditions, and they have to be arrived at with the employers. We should strongly oppose the splitting up of the industry into sections having different working conditions. There is a strong case for the increase in the speed limit, provided, of course, that the road safety factor is fully taken into account. There is no doubt that at present the law is not enforced. It cannot be enforced and it is bad for the industry, bad for those who work in it and generally bad when the law is brought into contempt.<br/>
We have to reach a state of affairs where we can bring the law into respect again and that can be done only when the speed limit is increased. The conditions for that increase are those laid down by the Transport and General Workers' Union and other transport workers concerned. They are that they must have a fair share of the greater productivity which results from the increase.</p>

<p>I should like to bring the House back to the Bill. We are not discussing negotiations between the Transport and General Workers' Union and another body of people. On another occasion that might be a proper matter to discuss. We are discussing people who drive dangerously or under the influence of drink, people who are killed on the roads and general safety on the roads. It is in the form of that argument that I rise to support the new Clause.<br/>
The question we have to consider is whether heavy goods vehicles should be driven at 30 m.p.h. Whether when they are so driven people should receive more or less or work longer or shorter hours, is a matter for the people in the industry and nothing to do with us. In support of that argument let us consider when this provision was introduced. I may be wrong, but speaking from recollection I believe that it was in 1934, when these vehicles had solid tyres and were fitted with brakes only on the back wheels and with steering systems entirely different from those on modern vehicles.<br/>
It was probably true to say that to drive at more than 20 m.p.h. was <i>prima facie</i> dangerous and the regulations were very properly made. That was 22 years ago, and since then we have had


entirely different vehicles on the roads. It may be that a heavy goods vehicle could be driven at more than 30 m.p.h. and on the German <i>autobahnen</i> one can see vehicles a great deal bigger than the ones we are discussing driven not at 30 m.p.h., but at a speed which makes them difficult to overtake in the modern highpowered cars of today. They are safe, because the roads are safe.<br/>
The modern goods vehicle can be safely driven at 30 m.p.h. on proper occasions. I know that the roads are too small and too narrow, wherever the fault may lie, but if it was safe to drive at 20 m.p.h. in 1934 it is safe to drive at 30 m.p.h. today. To say, "We will drive at 30 m.p.h., if we are paid more" and, presumably, at 40 m.p.h. if paid still more, is wrong and irrelevant to the debate. The Minister should say that the time has come when heavy goods vehicles can properly be driven at 30 m.p.h. Whether drivers should be paid more or less, is something for them to discuss with the employers and is altogether another matter. We are not discussing the terms of employment in the industry.<br/>
To negotiate for conditions in which the Minister says that he will make an order, if the two sides of the industry agree to a 30 m.p.h. limit, is blackmailing the Minister. He is saying that he will change the law, if the two sides get agreement. He should at once say that he is concerned only with whether 30 m.p.h. is safe. Having decided that, he should say that the two sides of the industry can reach agreement if they so want.<br/>
Heavy vehicles driven at 20 m.p.h. can be a very much greater danger than if driven at 30 m.p.h. We have all seen the blocks along Wading Street day and night and blocks on the Great North Road day and night. Heavy vehicles often have trailers, and when they are driven at 20 m.p.h. there is a great danger that overtaking vehicles may be forced to the wrong side of the road, or have to cut in, and so forth, and thus cause accidents. Let us stick to this Bill. I am not interfering in any way at all with negotiations on wages or conditions which may be going on. I hope that they will be successful, but they have no relation at all to the Bill.<br/>
I ask the Minister to take the line that the new Clause should be accepted. To say that the Minister has power by an Order has nothing to do with the question at all. The House of Commons has the responsibility. We are very critical, and I hope we always will be, of Orders which Ministers made without discussion in the House. We have had an opportunity to discuss this matter in the House tonight and I hope that we shall say that the time has come, and indeed has long passed, when heavy vehicles should be driven at 30 m.p.h. We should recognise the facts of the situation as they exist today.</p>

<p>The hon. and learned Member for Surrey, East (Mr. Doughty) seemed to assume that when the 20 m.p.h. limit was fixed, in 1934, no consultations whatever took place between the Ministry and the trade unions. I assure him that he is quite wrong. Negotiations did, in fact, take place. I was in the House and I was also here when the 1930 Act was passed. I know something about the negotiations which took place. The assumption on which the hon. and learned Member based his argument is that 20 m.p.h. is dangerous and 30 m.p.h. is safe. That is a new one to put over in this House.<br/>
I am not suggesting for one moment that 30 m.p.h. is dangerous. I do not suppose that the trade unions arc arguing that; this House is not arguing that. Many times it has been held by both sides of the industry that modern vehicles could run with comparative safety at 30 m.p.h.; but the point is that it is not the trade unions who are holding up this matter. If to concede the point of 30 m.p.h. would restrict the income of the industry, then, of course, there could be an argument based on that; but the trade unions are quite prepared to agree to their members operating at 30 m.p.h. when it is giving to the industry a greater income, yet the industry is not prepared to share that greater income.</p>

<p>I do not think that the hon. and learned Gentleman has followed my argument. I hope that I made it clear&#x2014;if I did not, I repeat it&#x2014;that I am not concerned with the sharing, or the duties or hours of work. They are totally different matters. We are concerned in the Bill with the question


of road safety and the conditions upon the roads, whether it is safe or whether it is not. If the hon. and learned Member is concerned in negotiations, I hope that they will be successful. I am asking the House to say that 30 m.p.h. is a proper speed for heavy goods vehicles.</p>

<p>That is not the point [HON.

I do not share that view. I do not suggest that 30 m.p.h. would be dangerous, but the hon. and learned Member is suggesting that 20 m.p.h. is a dangerous speed and 30 m.p.h. is a safe speed.</p>

<p>I never said anything of the sort. I said that it would be safer to drive at 30 m.p.h. than at 20 m.p.h. because at 20 these heavy goods vehicles cause an unnecessary obstruction upon the road. That is all I said. I went no further than that.</p>

<p>Perhaps the hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Ilkeston (Mr. Oliver) is confused with what I said. I did say that it was dangerous in my constituency to drive at 20 m.p.h. on a certain stretch of road.</p>

<p>The assumption is that 30 m.p.h. would be safer than would be 20 m.p.h. I do not accept that, but I am not opposed to 30 m.p.h. I made that quite clear to the hon. Member for Kidderminster (Mr. Nabarro) when we discussed this matter in Standing Committee. We are not opposed to increased speed limits, but we are opposed to an increase in the speed limits if the people employed in the industry do not share the benefits.<br/>
We must not forget this aspect of the matter. Joint negotiations have been going on in this industry for many years, but we must not impose a 30 m.p.h. limit for the heavy goods vehicles without taking into account any negotiations that are taking place. I took it from what the hon. Member for Kidderminster said that negotiations were proceeding at this particular moment. If they are and are at a critical stage, why cannot we not

wait a little longer? I have no doubt that the Minister, if he wants to, has the capacity and the power to exercise pressure on the two parties to come to an agreement fairly quickly.</p>

<p>Perhaps it might be of assistance were I to intervene at this stage because, without in any way wishing to comment on what has been said, I am rather well up to date on these negotiations at the moment. It might, therefore, help the House if I were to say what the position is. Anyone who has listened to this debate must be very conscious of the fact that there is a lot to be said for and against whatever particular view is taken on this issue. I suppose that it would not have been before the House for more than ten years were that not true.<br/>
To get one issue out of the way, I say frankly that I do not think that I should be justified, on grounds of road safety, in refusing to increase the speed limit. As has been pointed out by several hon. Members, the modern lorry, with its vacuum brakes and modern construction, is perfectly capable of being driven on our roads at 30 miles per hour; and whatever we may argue as to how many do it, it is certainly true that a great many of them are so driven.<br/>
The draw-bar trailer&#x2014;the separate trailer&#x2014;would not be, and I think was never intended to be, affected by any increase in the limit. I wanted to get that aspect out of the way. I know that the hon. Member for Bradford, East (Mr. McLeavy) holds his views on road safety most sincerely, but I do not think that it is fair today to say that a 30 m.p.h. speed limit for heavy goods vehicles, excluding locomotives and draw-bar trailers, is a dangerous speed at which to travel.<br/>
That, of course, is not really the argument. As my hon. Friend the Member for Kidderminster (Mr. Nabarro) knows&#x2014; and I thought he made his case very fairly &#x2014;the main question here&#x2014;and I do not entirely agree with my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Surrey, East (Mr. Doughty) here&#x2014;is one of industrial negotiations, of settling the new schedules, etc., that must inevitably arise from a change in speed limit. It is a question not only of schedules but of subsistence, of different turn round&#x2014;in fact, to some extent, almost a different system of operating. We cannot just put that on one side.<br/>
The first step I took, therefore, when this issue came before me was to try to find out what progress the various parties had made. My right hon. Friend the present Minister of Pensions and National Insurance had quite rightly said in Committee that negotiations were going on between the Road Haulage Association, British Road Services and the trade unions concerned&#x2014;and particularly the Transport and General Workers' Union. I found that some progress had been made, but not very much.<br/>
As a result, I have had several meetings with the parties concerned, with myself in the chair, not, may I certainly say, merely in order to try to negotiate this&#x2014;that is certainly not my business but that of the parties concerned. I had the meetings in order that they should try to tell me what the difficulties were that lay ahead of them before they could come to me and say, "We have reached agreement and want to tell you when this should be done".<br/>
There is another very relevant consideration. There is a time when this decision is convenient to take from the point of view of all the parties and another time when it is inconvenient. I am advised by the experts in the industry that the right time to take this decision is in the early spring of the year when the days are lengthening. I am told that that is likely to cause much less dislocation in the working out of the new schedules.<br/>
I had another meeting with all the parties concerned early this week, and they were then able to tell me that some progress had been made, that they had reached certain general&#x2014;I do not say agreements but principles, for example that no man should be worse off because of any new schedules, etc. I do not want to go into those details, and I am sure that the House will understand that this is a matter of industrial negotiation and not one that we should debate in this House. Equally, it is my duty as Minister to endeavour to see whether the matter will go through smoothly or not, and whether the fact that I have done this could be used by one party or the other as a method of blackmailing the other, if one likes to use that kind of word.<br/>
The first thing that I want to say is that in those circumstances I cannot accept my hon. Friend's proposed new Clause, because if I did it would imply an

immediate alteration in the speed limit. He quite fairly said that this Bill will probably not become an Act for some months, but even so it would be held to be an immediate increase at a time when negotiations are still going on.<br/>
On the other hand, I think it is fair that I should tell the House that I have this morning seen the Road Haulage Association and British Road Services, and they have both informed me that, whatever decision I take, they will not use it as an excuse either to stop negotiations or to import some new conditions into their negotiations. They have also both told me that they are most anxious to continue the progress that they have made until a satisfactory solution is reached, and I think they sincerely believe that they can reach a solution now. I do not think, as I judge the position, that the unions concerned dissent very strongly from that view, although I am not for a moment saying that the whole matter is settled.<br/>
To sum up my position, it is this. First. I think we all agree&#x2014;and I am very grateful to the hon. Member for Enfield, East (Mr. Ernest Davies)&#x2014;that this is a change that ought to have been made. Successive Ministers have said that it ought to have been made, and it has been before this House for a very long time. The situation is bringing the law into contempt. It is also having a bad effect on the design and construction of new vehicles, because large numbers are now being made to evade the present speed limit when they ought to have been made merely for their duties on the road.</p>

<p>I did not intend to intervene, but I cannot allow it to go out that we are all agreed. I do not agree that the speed limit should be raised. I feel very doubtful that if the speed limit were raised to 30 m.p.h. the law could still be enforced. I am very much opposed to the change, and I therefore do not want it to be thought that I am agreed.</p>

<p>No doubt the hon. Gentleman did not have an opportunity of speaking in the debate. I accept that he does not agree, and I have little doubt that the hon. Member for Bradford. East does not agree, either. I dealt with the question of safety in my opening remarks, and I am now discussing the industrial aspects of the question.<br/>
I am not prepared to accept the new Clause, because I think that it would be felt, and perhaps rightly so, by the parties to the negotiations, that I or the House was trying to force their hand. Equally, I think we must bring this controversy to an end. It is too late, on the whole, to make the change this year, and the right time to make it is in the spring of the year. Therefore, it is my disposition to make this change in the early spring months of next year.</p>

<p>I hope my hon. Friend the Member for Kidderminster will not say "Hear, hear" too quickly, until he understands quite clearly what I am undertaking to do. Having said that I am not prepared to accept his new Clause, I rest on my proper powers, which are perfectly constitutional, notwithstanding what my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Surrey, East says, to make an Order which can vary the speed limit at any time when I make and lay an Order before this House, provided, of course, that the House accepts it.<br/>
I have been assured by the parties concerned that they will go on with these, I think, reasonably fruitful negotiations until they have achieved success. Therefore, I shall not take any action at the moment. I shall probably lay an Order fairly soon after the House returns after the Summer Recess, which will give the parties a further four months to reach agreement; and I consider and hope that in that time they should be well able to do that. Then, I shall lay the Order, which will sot a future date. So that the vehicle building side of the industry can have knowledge and notice of what will happen, that date is likely to be in the early months of 1957.<br/>
That is, on the whole, about the fairest compromise that we can achieve. It gives everybody a chance to get a sensible solution. It gives plenty of warning to everybody and it does not coerce anybody, which I am anxious not to do. On this assurance which I have given to the

House, I ask my hon. Friend to withdraw his new Clause.</p>

<p>I hope that the Minister of Transport will agree that it is high time that there was some definite planning of the country's road system. The number of new vehicles coming on the roads is approximately 50.000 a month, whereas changes in road arrangements and construction in past years have been trivial. The roads arc virtually the same as they were ten years ago.<br/>
England's premier highway is, or should be, the Great North Road, which is designated A.1. I am not altogether sure that we ought not to have a Roads Marks Act, in the same way we have a Merchandise Marks Act, because the term Al is hardly applicable to this road in the circumstances which prevail. It is one of the principal routes for traffic between London and the North, but for three-quarters of its length, about 300 miles, it is wide enough for only one line of traffic in each direction.<br/>
What is even more important, this overloaded highway has all the hazards to be found on the worst of British roads. There are blind bends, hump-backed bridges, congested towns, bottlenecks. zigzag turns, inadequate sidelines&#x2014;everything calculated to promote the maximum delay and inefficiency. In such circumstances. I feel justified in asking for information of what the Government are doing about providing an up-to-date highway, and providing it quickly in a scientifically planned manner.<br/>
To date, as far as I can trace, there has been no planned attack on this problem; just delay and indecision. We were told years ago that it was planned to improve the road on its present alignment, including by-passes, and that the length between London and beyond Newcastle was to be provided all the way with dual carriageways. Later&#x2014;and I quote&#x2014;it was said:
<q>In the interests of economy the standard was reduced except here and there to a single through lane of a 30 feet carriageway.</q></p>

<p>I am quoting from a reference which I saw some time ago, and which, I believe, came from a statement made by the Government. I have not the actual reference itself, but I will try to provide it.<br/>
Even by 1955 no reconstruction work of any importance had been actually carried out, and the standards to which the road was to be rebuilt were again. apparently, under reconsideration, on the grounds that the design had to be modified because of the traffic which would use the road when the London to Yorkshire motorway had been built. Yet the building of that motorway was already planned when the dual carriageway plan was decided upon. 1n other words, the picture presented is that, having decided upon a certain standard ten years ago, which was subsequently reduced, the question whether or not to have the higher dual carriageway standard was still under consideration in 1955, in spite of the fact that the traffic increased in those nine years more than was expected in 1946. I now understand that it is proposed to provide dual carriageways between London and Newcastle. Thus, in 1956, a return is made to the standard laid down in 1946.<br/>
I would briefly describe the present position on the Al between the Barnet by-pass and East Retford, in Nottinghamshire. After the Barnet by-pass, which itself is adequate for only one line of traffic in each direction, the road is wide enough for three lines of vehicles only to the north of Baldock in Hertfordshire, a distance of less than 20 miles. From there to as far as the county boundary of Rutland and Kesteven it is only wide enough for two lines of traffic, that is, for a distance of about 60 miles.<br/>
On this length there are the usual hazards which one would expect&#x2014;blind bends, hump bridges, villages and towns, including Stamford, which is notorious for its congestion. In places, there is a lane fenced off for the building of a second carriageway. North of the junction of the Great North Road with the A14, in Huntingdonshire, for a distance of 4&#x00BD; miles, the road, in places, is along a narrow causeway made because earth


has been taken away on both sides to make way for the foundations of the dual carriageways which have not yet been built. When one crosses the boundary into Kesteven one finds a road reconstructed recently to 30 feet width for a distance of 14 miles. It then reverts to two-lane width, then back again to three-lane for 1,300 yards south of Grantham. In the open it continues, as two-lane until just this side of the Nottinghamshire boundary. Near the village of Long Benington, half a mile has been widened to about 30 feet. It is something like Joseph's patchwork coat of many colours but not as effective. Just at the boundary the road has been widened recently to 28 feet in two places, totalling under one mile.<br/>
Crossing the boundary, the road becomes 30 feet wide with three lanes, except in built-up areas, and it continues like that as far as the junction with A57, a distance of about 16 miles. A57 is eventually to form part of a by-pass to East Retford. From about two miles from its junction with the Al, the A57 is at present being rebuilt with a new alignment, with dual carriageway. This will join just over one mile of dual carriageway which was built before the war. It will thus be seen that the standard which exists and is scheduled on the length of road with which I have dealt varies frequently from dual carriageways to a single two-lane carriageway of varying width.<br/>
Nor is that all. Despite the fact that the Ministry has apparently laid down that the road is to be reconstructed throughout to dual carriageway standard, one section 3&#x00BC; miles north of Stamford is being rebuilt as a single three-lane road to a width of 33 feet. I suppose that it may be contended by the Minister that a second carriageway can always be added, but in view of what has not been done already, can it be seriously suggested that it will be made into dual carriageways in the foreseeable future? If not, what is the value of the Minister's declared intention to provide a dual carriageway from London to Newcastle?<br/>
If it is suggested that the second carriageway will be added within the foreseeable future, perhaps the Minister will explain why his Department is widening this section of the road to 33 feet, which I understand is the standard for a single two-lane carriageway and

which his Department chooses to describe as a "two-lane carriageway with a central overtaking lane." Clearly, there is no intention for all practical purposes of providing dual carriageways at this point. Once a road has had any major improvements, it is invariably put at the bottom of the list for future attention, and with the huge backlog of hundreds of millions of pounds for road schemes which still need to be completed, it is clear that there is no immediate intention to act upon the stated intention of providing dual carriageways throughout the 300 miles of the Great North Road.<br/>
There is also the problem of building by-passes on this road. I quote the example of Stamford. If ever there was need to construct a by-pass for a town it is here. When one approaches that beautiful town one sees a notice, "This is Stamford. Stay a while amidst its ancient charm." It is really unnecessary. One invariably has no option since one finds oneself in a long queue of vehicles waiting to worm its way through the twisting streets of the town, whilst another long queue of vehicles crawls slowly past in the opposite direction.<br/>
Yet, according to the local Press, the Stamford by-pass has been put back until after the Grantham scheme has been carried out. I would like to know whether that suggestion is or is not wellfounded. Then again, in the "Lincoln, Rutland and Stamford Mercury" for 3rd February last, this appeared. There were two headings. The first was, "The real chaos is at the Ministry". The second was, "Official dabbling annoys us all."<br/>
This is what the newspaper said:
<q>The Mercury, along with thousands of exasperated motorists and traffic-weary residents of A1 towns, still wants to know when work is likely to begin on improving the Great North Road in this area. We questioned the Ministry of Transport, 'Could you give us any idea when the various proposed schemes are likely to begin?' The Ministry's reply was, 'Your guess is as good as ours. But we can definitely say that they will not be starting on them tomorrow. 'However, the Ministry's spokesman did inform us that his Department was at work on plans. but everything depended on what funds would be available. They did not know the answer to that one from year to year. We wonder if they know the answer to this one? Why is the Al to be translated into a dual carriageway south of Stamford Borough boundary but only widened to 33 feet north of the town? For the latter is the tortuous section of the road between Stamford and Grantham. which is known as the Devil's Walk'.</q>


I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to Stevenage. Here a new town has been built on one side of the Great North Road and an industrial estate on the other. As was to be expected, conditions on Al at that point have become dangerous and difficult. Indeed, the local authorities were obliged to put a Bailey bridge over the Great North Road for the benefit of the workpeople going between the new town and the factories. Of course there are plans for by-passes&#x2014;there are always plans. As a matter of fact, we find that the Stevenage by-pass was scheduled under the Special Roads Act which received the Royal Assent seven years ago. In fact, an order for it was made two years earlier as a trunk road.<br/>
Such is the tale of muddle, indecision and procrastination over the re-building of the Great North Road, and, what is more, there is visual evidence that the muddle is being perpetuated. The optimistic statements that are being made about the work which is being done on our road programme are difficult to accept in the face of what one can see with one's own eyes on the Great North Road. The proof of the programme is what is built, and the speed and efficiency with which it is built. Judging by the situation on the Great North Road, the programme is a mess of inconsistent, piecemeal patching, as inadequate as it is intolerable.<br/>
I urge the Minister to assure us that this road will be developed to dual carriageway standard without further indecision or delay. Whatever may be the human failings and individual accidents, the state of the roads is making it harder and harder for drivers to find enough room to drive safely. The stream of traffic on busy roads on all days of the week, not only on holidays, forces vehicles into a compacted mass whenever there is a momentary hold-up somewhere in the line. Fast moving and slow moving vehicles are all compelled to use the same roads. We have heard about that earlier tonight. Often they are wide enough for only one line of traffic in each direction.<br/>
New motor vehicles came on to British roads in March at the rate of more than 10,000 every working day. A total of about 91,000 new registrations for that month is a very high figure. This summer, we understand, there may be well

over half a million more vehicles crowding on to the roads than there were last summer, and there is no sign of any major relief in the way of new roads to take them.<br/>
If the piecemeal and inadequate patching of the Great North Road is a fair example of how the Minister's road programme as a whole is being carried out, then I suggest that the outlook is very depressing indeed, and calls for a wholly new, vigorous and scientific approach to this most serious problem of our times, namely, the total inadequacy of our roads for present or future traffic.<br/>
I have chosen the Great North Road because it indicates what is going on all over the country. It shows how very important it is that the question of expense should not be an obstacle. It is a very false policy to regard the immediate expense of making our road system adequate as being anything which is detrimental to the general economy of the country and to the safety of those on the roads.<br/>
In America, the roads out of the towns are built to enable traffic to proceed as it should. This cuts down the expense of transport. We are constantly complaining about the costs of our goods for export and for our own use. I am sure that, irrespective of the immediate cost, the Minister ought to consider ways and means of raising money for the purpose, whether by loans or by tolls. The latter method would, I think, be worth considering at present.<br/>
I speak on this subject on behalf of my constituency. Leicester is not quite so much concerned about this particular road between that city and London, in so far as their use of it is concerned, but it is deeply concerned in respect of traffic travelling on it northwards from Leicester.<br/>
I hope the Minister will give us an assurance about this. In answer to a Question today he made reference to 23 projects. There are projects and projects. What are the projects to be? Are they to be scientifically arranged so that the country shall be provided with the necessary roads? Are false economies to be avoided? Is the road accidents problem to be solved, or are we to continue to muddle through year by year without the problem being adequately dealt with? I


hope that the Minister will give an assurance which will satisfy those like myself&#x2014;there are many such people&#x2014;who are concerned about the present position.</p>

I was surprised that he chose to refer to 1946 and compare what was promised in 1946 with what has been achieved in the last ten years. In 1946, a Socialist Government were in office&#x2014;</p>

<p>Yes. The hon. Gentleman referred to the programme and he has no ground for complaint if I refer to it also.<br/>
It was in 1946 that the grandiose Barnes' programme of great motorways was announced, and in the following year that the whole thing was wound up, with scarcely a beginning made. Since the present Government have been in office, two programmes have been announced&#x2014;the Lennox-Boyd programme of 1953 and the Boyd-Carpenter programme of last year. Everybody recognises that it takes some time before a programme, after it has been authorised, can be got well under way. At present, both programmes are being got well under way and we have been able to announce that during the next three years a large number of projects will he undertaken.<br/>
The present Minister has given considerable priority to works on Al. If

the hon. Member had looked in the Library, he would have found deposited there a map showing all the announced schemes. For Al, 23 schemes costing more than &#x00A3;100,000 each are to be authorised in 1955&#x2013;56, 1956&#x2013;57. 1957&#x2013;58 and 1958&#x2013;59. There is Page Street to Mill Hill, widening; between Apex Corner and South Mimms by-pass, widening; Browney Bridge to Farewell Hall, Durham; Allerton Station; Wetherby by-pass; between Leeming and Catterick, widening; Alconbury Hill to Woolpack Cross Roads; Doncaster by-pass; East Retford by-pass; Wansford Bridge to Stamford Borough Boundary, widening; East Retford bypass&#x2014;Five Lanes End to the North of Checkerhouse, widening; Colsterworth diversion; Grantham by-pass; Stamford Inner Relief Road; Woolpack Cross Roads to Norman Cross; Sandy to A428, Bedfordshire, widening; Norman Cross to Water Newton by-pass; Biggleswade bypass; Wansford-Water Newton by-pass, Huntingdonshire.<br/>
I do not know why the hon. Member should raise this matter on the Adjournment and ask for information which is already available to him and which has been published. That is what is now being done on the A1.<br/>
The hon. Member asked what general policy we were pursuing and I will tell him. 1t is not possible simply to sit down and say that because we desire to have dual carriageways all the way from London to Newcastle, we shall begin at London and drive dual carriageways all the way. A number of other considerations have to be taken into account. In the course of his speech, the hon. Member mentioned several. There are, of course, particular places on the Al where, because they are built-up areas and there is extremely serious congestion, there is great delay to traffic and danger to life. It is natural that in planning our programme. as we have done, we should give priority to those places in Al where it is most urgent that there should be by-passes.<br/>
We also work, as the hon. Member no doubt knows, through agency authorities, through the highway authorities of the counties. There is a limit to the amount of work which they can undertake at any particular time. If we ask a county to undertake more than a certain


amount of work, that will merely result in delay. Therefore, in planning the work which is now being undertaken on Al, we have taken into account several considerations. First, a road may pass through an old, in many cases a medieval town, and it may be important to build a by-pass there. The second is whether the alignment of the road is unsatisfactory and congestion is caused, or danger incurred. Thirdly, cases where there is a large amount of traffic, and where the width of the road is particularly inadequate.<br/>
The hon. Member will perhaps be aware that we have periodic traffic censuses which are taken at different places, and, of course, the volume of traffic is not the same at all points on the Great North Road. At some points the traffic is heavier, and the need for widening correspondingly greater. The worst parts, such as at Doncaster and Stamford, or those parts where the accident record is bad, must be dealt with as early as possible; and, it must not be forgotten, we must also take into account the state of readiness of individual schemes. Some local schemes are ready, and it may be possible to get on with them more rapidly than other improvements, even although, theoretically, their urgency is less.<br/>
There are certain existing lengths of good 30 feet carriageway which will not be touched initially unless the traffic there becomes exceptionally heavy. Although it is our intention that there should be dual carriageway all the way from London to Newcastle, it is because we have measured the needs of different parts of this line that we have not begun on a

straight programme from Newcastle to the south. But a programme has been carefully worked out by the Ministry of Transport in consultation with local authorities, and I think that even the hon. Gentleman will agree that it is a very good and practicable programme.</p>

<p>Then, Mr. Speaker, may I ask, first, how much expenditure will be involved in, say, the next three years; secondly, how the plan which we have just heard will decrease the number of deaths, about 100 a year at present; thirdly, why, in the five years during which they have been in office, have the Government done nothing and have announced only recently the plans which are being projected?</p>

<p>It is obviously not possible for me, without notice, to give the total cost, because in the programme now in hand we have only announced, as the hon. Member knows, those schemes costing more than &#x00A3;100,000 each. If the hon. Gentleman cares to table a Question, I shall be very glad to give him what figures I can.</p>
