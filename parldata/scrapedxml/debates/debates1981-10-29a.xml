<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said amendments proposed in lieu of Commons amendment No. 33. 

When the House agreed on Report to provisions requiring daily inspection of snares, it did so on the clear understanding that the amendment would need some technical redrafting in another place. That was acknowledged by both sides.<br/>
The Lords amendments give full effect to the intention of the amendment that the House accepted on Report. In addition, it provides for reasonable excuses such as illness, accidents or bad weather. The maximum penalty is set at a fine of &#x00A3;500.</p>

<p>The House knows that we are entering the final stint of the Bill, which has occupied the House and another place for most of the year.<br/>
There have been occasions in Committee and on the Floor of the House when the issue of snares has been raised and voted on. I congratulate the Under-Secretary on his first appearance at the Dispatch Box with his new responsibilities and on taking charge of the Bill. He must know that there were occasions here and in Committee when the Opposition gave serious consideration to the possibility of not making progress on the Bill. We were uncertain of the Government's intentions.<br/>
I pay tribute to the former Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro), who is no longer able to take a direct involvement for the Government. I also pay tribute to the Minister for Local Government and Environmental Services for the wisdom he has shown on more than one occasion. Those Ministers recognised that the Bill was worth saving, and changes were made in it.<br/>
Before I look at the procedures involved in the amendments I feel obliged to inform the Under-Secretary that the Opposition are not satisfied that the Government's good intentions will make progress&#x2014;despite what they consider to be the reality of the situation.<br/>
We shall want to look closely over the next two years at the effect of the amendments. We want to give the Government the benefit of the doubt, particularly on this amendment and others, but we shall watch closely to see whether the Government's proposal results in a satisfactory solution. If it does not, our intention as an incoming Government will be to revise the procedures we do not agree with.<br/>
We are grateful for another opportunity to consider the issue of snares. My right hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Ardwick (Mr. Kaufman) referred at Second Reading to the snare as a vicious and a cruel device.<br/>
Progress has been made in Committee and on Report. We are now considering something different from what we wished to achieve in Committee&#x2014;not the prohibition of snares but the operation of them. The operation of snares should be discussed for good reasons. Snares are considered by a wide sector of the farming community to be essential. Snares will be legalised and operated provided that there are certain safeguards and assurances.<br/>
The Minister rightly mentioned the narrow point, which the House has conceded, that snares need daily inspection. Our concern is not the damage or pain that is inflicted at the time an animal is caught, but the length of time that it is possible for the snare to be in position. The person who sets the snare does not always catch only the desired animal. He may also catch a wide range of other animals.<br/>
Experience has shown that, when a snare has been set to catch a rabbit or fox, in addition to catching those animals it catches badgers, deer, cats and dogs. Even sheep, cattle and pigs have been caught. It is essential that


snares be inspected daily. We appreciate that the previous Under-Secretary did not accept our amendments and said that they would need to be revised, but we want to ask a number of questions about the new proposal.<br/>
The RSPCA, to its credit, has served the House, as it served the Committee, faithfully and well over the many months of our consideration of the Bill. However, it says of the Lords amendment:
<q>The RSPCA does not mince words. We are bitterly disappointed by the Government's proposals and feel that the purpose of the amendment would be completely frustrated by the Government's alternative. We believe that the proposed amendment is so negative in its approach and so hedged about with qualifications that its declared purpose could not be achieved.</q>
I want to ask a number of questions. The wording sent to another place was based on provisions relating to traps mentioned in section 10 of the Protection of Animals Act 1911 and those relating to spring traps and snares contained in section 9 of the Protection of Animals (Scotland) Act 1912.<br/>
Why have the Under-Secretary and his colleagues ignored precedent, which has been lauded so often by Ministers in our discussion of the Bill? Why have they departed from language in existing legislation that has caused no problems?<br/>
For example, why are the words "reasonable excuse" introduced? Earl Ferrers said in another place that they were necessary to take account of cases of illness, accident or bad weather. The Government have more than once stressed the need for absolute clarity, yet they propose to introduce the term "reasonable", which, for hundreds of years, has given the courts field days in assessing and interpreting its precise meaning.<br/>
If a shepherd set a snare in the knowledge that the lambing season was imminent and thereafter failed to inspect the snare because of his commitment to the stock would that be a "reasonable excuse"? Why has the reference to the competence of a person inspecting a snare been removed? That is a crucial change, and both the 1911 and 1912 Acts use the expression. The Opposition do not intend to vote against the amendment, but the Government must spell out why that change has been made.<br/>
Are the Government really suggesting that a snare should be inspected by someone who is, or could be, incompetent, or incapable of taking remedial action? The purpose of inspection is to release a captured animal humanely or to destroy it humanely. If that is not done, the person who inspects the snare is guilty of an offence and must pay the penalty.<br/>
Another matter that has vexed the House on this Bill and thousands of others is that of enforcement. Whatever words we use, the problem of enforcement will be with us for a long time. It is a difficult problem and we suggest that it has been made even more difficult by the omissions and changes of emphasis that have taken place. If enforcement is virtually impossible, why should we bother to make such a drastically weakening provision?<br/>
We accept the sincerity of the hon. Member for Dumfries who assured us when he was Under-Secretary that he accepted the spirit of our amendments but could not accept the wording. But we strongly suspect that the change in the form of words pays scant attention to the wishes of the House. We want the new Minister to justify the way in which the words sent from this House were changed in another place.</p>

<p>I welcome the observations of the hon. Member for Edmonton (Mr. Graham) about the general principles of the legislation. I am aware, not only as the incoming Minister, but as one who has voted on the Bill from time to time in the past six to nine months, of the distinguished contribution and painstaking efforts of my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro). I pay tribute to his enormous contribution that has helped to make the Bill a possibility.<br/>
4.45 pm<br/>
Many hon. Members spoke in Committee and on Report about the matters outlined by the hon. Member for Edmonton, and there are naturally deep anxieties among animal lovers, the RSPCA and others. The hon. Member said that the RSPCA was bitterly disappointed with the Lords amendment. I am depressed to hear that, because there are safeguards in the amendment and I hope that we shall see that they are effective. Only time will tell, but the maximum penalty is &#x00A3;500. The hon. Member also referred to previous legislation, but that is a detailed matter for the courts to inspect.<br/>
The hon. Member for Edmonton mentioned shepherds setting snares in the lambing season. That was also raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries in Committee when he referred to the difficulties facing those in far-flung regions, especially the North. He said that snowstorms and blizzards in the Highlands would cause particular difficulties. That is the reason for including the phrase "reasonable excuse". We are looking for general competence among the individuals who will be concerned.<br/>
There are a number of question marks over any legislation. The hon. Member for Edmonton said that the Opposition would monitor the effects of this measure over the next two years. It is up to the various agencies and individuals involved to make the legislation work. The overall objectives are beyond rebuke and we now need to move on.<br/>
I believe that the Opposition should be satisfied with the amendment. I am sure that the hon. Member for Edmonton's heart is in it. He recognises that there are anxieties about how it will be implemented, but it gives full effect to the amendment that the House approved on Report. The reasonable excuses, such as illness, accident or bad weather, are effective and adequate safeguards.<br/>
I hope that the Opposition will understand that the amendment has the best interests of everyone at heart and that it will be for the courts and everyone else concerned to make sure that that is recognised.</p>

<p>By leave of the House, may I reply to what the Minister has said? He has asked us to take on trust that he believes that the spirit of what the whole House wants&#x2014;daily inspection by competent people&#x2014;will be covered by the words of the amendment. We are prepared to take that on trust, because we have no alternative, but there are anxieties among people outside, and I am not talking of snoopers or those who look for trouble.<br/>
As a "townie", I was told more than once that no one who sets snares desires to do anything other than inspect them daily, because no one wishes to prolong an animal's suffering. We were told that snares would usually be inspected every day and we are happy to take on trust that problems caused by snowstorms, snares set during the lambing season and so on will be few and far between.<br/>
We have to give the Government the benefit of the doubt in a difficult situation. My hon. Friend the Member


for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) will be raising that matter later. It is not possible for us to be precise and to take account of every conceivable problem. Therefore, we shall not delay the Bill's progress.</p>

<p>Deeply concerned though I, along with colleagues, have been for the last nine months with the Bill, and deeply interested in it, may I be forgiven for saying that it will be thought a little odd by thousands of my constituents working in the truck and tractor division of British Leyland that we are discussing this afternoon relative minutiae of the Wildlife and Countryside Bill rather than the very serious, spine-chilling problems that concern the future of British Leyland.<br/>
Were there such a thing as gratitude in politics&#x2014;and we all know that in British politics gratitude is a very rare commodity&#x2014;the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro) would have been allowed to finish his work on the Wildlife and Countryside Bill, on which he has borne the heat and burden of 27 sittings in Committee, not to mention our activities on the Floor of the House. However, I suppose that Downing Street had to find ministerial niches&#x2014;at any rate at Under-Secretary of State level&#x2014;for those to whom it is obliged for party and personal services far remote from the Wildlife and Countryside Bill and that someone had to give way.<br/>
On account of the hon. Gentleman's helpfulness to the Opposition, and his stubbornness in combating what in our view was a less than helpful set-up at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, we regret that the hon. Gentleman is no longer on the Front Bench to see his task through. Nature in the raw, which we have so often discussed in Committee Room 12, is probably less cruel in selecting its victims and certainly less random than Downing Street. In the process of culling her Ministers, the Prime Minister set her sights on the wrong stag when she disposed of the hon. Member for Dumfries. There were many others in the ministerial herd whom we would rather have seen her get rid of. I hope that those remarks will be taken in a kindly spirit and as a "thank you" to the hon. Member for Dumfries.<br/>
The new ministerial team has to be asked a direct question on amendments Nos. 7 and 8, compared with which other matters are peripheral. Does the Minister have the authority from the Treasury to provide moneys for conservation agreements? Clause 28 explicitly asks for notification of the Nature Conservancy Council, and the only reason for this is that the NCC can enter into managerial agreements to solve problems. After clause 44 we discover that the level of management payments will be decided by Ministers. If we assume that 11 to 13 per cent. of sites of special scientific interest were damaged last year, if the Nature Conservancy Council is to react, what sums will be needed? The same point, incidentally, applies to the national park authorities.<br/>
Admittedly, we do not know how many SSI agreements will be entered into, but there are 3,800 sites. Is there a


determination on the part of the Government to finance management agreements? Can we, arising out of these amendments, explore the nature of the bid placed by the NCC to the Department of the Environment in respect of the extra responsibilities that accrue to the NCC as a result of the provisions of clause 28 and of the Bill in general?<br/>
The Nature Conservancy Council's most recent surveys show that last year over 8,000 hectares of sites of special scientific interest were seriously damaged. About 50 per cent. of this resulted from agricultural and forestry operations. Even if we ignore the inevitable increase in the amount of SSSI land that will be threatened next year because of the incentives to plough up SSSIs under the new compensation system, about 4,000 hectares of SSSIs will need to be protected annually by the Nature Conservancy Council.<br/>
Most of the threats to SSSIs from agricultural operations will come in lowland areas, where the agricultural value of land is at a financial premium. Areas such as the north Kent marshes, the Somerset levels, the Nene washes and the Derwent ings are all prime SSSI grade 1 sites currently under threat. In these places an acre of land costs over &#x00A3;1,000, and the difference in profit between land managed for nature conservation and land under intensive agricultural systems is as much as &#x00A3;80 to &#x00A3;100 per acre.<br/>
It is the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food which will be determining the value of the management agreements that the NCC will be forced to enter into under the new provisions, and we can be sure that they will reflect accurately the revenue that might have been earned had the land in question been converted for agricultural production. Given these sets of figures, it will be necessary for the NCC to be given at least &#x00A3;3 million in additional revenue if it is to safeguard SSSIs properly.<br/>
It is, therefore, of paramount importance that the NCC be given enough money to make its side of the voluntary system work. If it is unable to protect sites because it has not asked for enough money, or because the Government have not given it enough money, landowners will rightly be able to claim that it is not their fault that the provisions to protect SSSIs, and land in the national parks, are not working.<br/>
Additionally, it is essential that the NCC should not find itself in a position where it cannot object to a damaging proposal simply because it does not have sufficient funds to finance management payments. If this were the case, sites would be lost by default, without the conservation case even coming to the attention of Ministers. Unless the money is forthcoming, there is no conceivable chance of the voluntary system working. The Opposition's fear is that there has been an underestimate by Government of the finances required to protect sites of special scientific interest and national park land.<br/>
Specifically, is it true that the NCC has used the figure of &#x00A3;600 per hectare in calculating how much money it will need to purchase land to ensure the protection of SSSIs? If the &#x00A3;600 per hectare assumed cost is right, is this not a gross underestimate for the lowland areas where SSSIs are most likely to come under threat? I can accept that for a hectare of Crinan moss in remotest Argyll &#x00A3;600 per hectare is not unreasonable, even though my fellow countrymen&#x2014;and the fellow countrymen of the hon. Member for Dumfries&#x2014;might value their bog at a steeper price than &#x00A3;600 per hectare. 

Let us journey from Argyll to lushest, rich Norfolk. Who in their right mind will assess a hectare of Halvergate at &#x00A3;600 a hectare? I am told by Peter Melchett that in Norfolk the going price Ls at least &#x00A3;3,000 a hectare. What about the Nature Conservancy Council's book? Halvergate will be the great test case in assessing how compensation agreements will work in practice. At Halvergate 1,175 acres of SSSIs have to be protected. Halvergate alone will probably cost the Broads authority and the Countryside Commission a cool &#x00A3;1&#x00BD; million at 1980 prices over 20 years. That is the financial lead that worries us. <br/>
5 pm<br/>
Does the Minister fully comprehend the mammoth nature of the task that is now being given to the NCC to finance SSSIs and to undertake the problem of renotifying owners and occupiers, involving one letter and possibly more to about 3,800 sites? Some of the sites will have to be revisited by a trained scientist. I understand that on average the NCC has little more than one person per area. There may be as many as 50 sites of special scientific interest in a county. It is possible that 50 to 100 persons will have to be notified on one site.<br/>
We return to the issue whether the NCC will have the wherewithal to undertake the task. Resources for the NCC are crucial to the Bill. All our work and its usefulness is triggered by the assumption that the NCC will have the resources for the task that we have given it.<br/>
We think that the written notice requirement in Lords amendment No. 8 is important. Without that provision farmers could say "I phoned your office the other day. The girl at the end of the phone said that she would give a message. Did she not pass on the message?" There must be no misunderstanding on notification. That is why we think that the Lords are right to insert the word "written".<br/>
It is the resources of the NCC that are the crucial issue. Yesterday my hon. Friend the Member for Stockport, North (Mr. Bennett)&#x2014;like my hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Hardy), he has played a massive part in the Bill&#x2014;asked about the NCC. His question appears in column 862 of <i>Hansard</i> of 28 October. The Minister replied that he would deal with the question of moneys. I asked him to comment further this afternoon. I think that this is the appropriate moment to insert that question.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) for his support of Lords amendment No. 8. We, too, believe that it is important to insert the word "written". I understand the hon. Gentleman's anxieties on other matters. I agree that I said yesterday that we could discuss these matters more fully. Parliamentary Question Time does not always provide that opportunity.<br/>
It will come as no surprise to the House when I say that I do not speak on this occasion with authority from the Treasury. However, I hope that the issues that the hon. Member for West Lothian has raised will be noted in appropriate quarters. They embrace important aspects of this measure.<br/>
We shall be having urgent discussions with the interested parties in the near future. Those parties will include the NCC. On 18 September my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State spoke at a national parks conference. On that occasion he was questioned about finance. At the same time in another place the Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, referred to the


financial issue at some length. He accepted that, as legislators, we must carry the tabs that follow from the legislative decisions that we ask Parliament to take. He added that the response had been intended to be encouraging.<br/>
I am unable to make detailed comments upon the statistics that the hon. Gentleman has produced. The presentation of those figures confirms that he has taken a diligent interest in the passage of the Bill. His knowledge of these subjects is inestimable. I hope that he will forgive me if I do not go into detail on the figures. I shall not be able to deal with land valuation in various regions of the United Kingdom. However, I shall consider the issue that he raised and communicate with him.<br/>
We are considering an important amendment. I confirm that we shall be having discussions with the NCC and other bodies to ascertain the estimates that they are making between now and next year. It is important to note that the funds for the NCC over the four years to date have remained at a constant level of slightly over &#x00A3;9 million at 1980&#x2013;81 prices. Those funds have been supplemented by &#x00A3;4.6 million in 1978&#x2013;79, &#x00A3;1.09 million in 1979&#x2013;80 and slightly less than &#x00A3;300,000 in 1980&#x2013;81 at 1980&#x2013;81 prices. Those figures indicate that the funding has risen. I assure the House that there will be an urgent dialogue to ascertain the needs and requirements of the various organisations as we try to shape the way to implement this measure over the next few years.</p>

<p>I ask for the leave of the House, Mr. Deputy Speaker, to speak again on the amendment.<br/>
I accept that the Minister is new in his job and will find it difficult to go into the detailed figures. However, will he confirm that the assumed cost is &#x00A3;600 a hectare? The areas that need the most protection are often lowland fertile areas, and &#x00A3;600 is an unreal sum at current land prices. One might get away with &#x00A3;600 in a remote mountain area, but such a sum would be unthinkable in areas of Norfolk and other similar areas. We are concerned with lowland and often extremely fertile agricultural areas, and it seems that &#x00A3;600 a hectare is not realistic.<br/>
I regret that the Minister does not have the authority of the Treasury. We promise the hon. Gentleman that our interest in the Bill and in the way in which it works will not come to an end this afternoon. Some of us feel that it is deeply unsatisfactory that some hon. Members sweat their guts out for honourable reasons&#x2014;I include the hon. Members for Harborough (Mr. Fan), Gainsborough (Sir M. Kimball) and Hereford (Mr. Shepherd)&#x2014;only to find that they are left with no positive assurances. We have made changes to the Bill and some of us will continue to monitor the consequences of our actions, perfect or imperfect though they may be, with not only the Minister's Department but the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and certainly the Treasury. I hope that the hon. Gentleman gets all the authority from the Treasury that he needs. It will be authority in a good cause. If the Bill does not work, the heritage will be greatly damaged and it may prove to be our last chance.<br/>
We shall monitor it. If it does not work, I make no off-the-cuff threat. The repercussion was spelt out eloquently by my right hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Ardwick (Mr. Kaufman), who is Shadow Secretary of State for the Environment. There are serious people in the

House who, albeit reluctantly, might think that the only answer was a system of planning. This would be unacceptable in a number of quarters. However, that may be the alternative if we do not succeed in what we are doing.</p>

<p>I cannot give the assurance about the statistics now. I have indicated that I shall communicate with the hon. Gentleman. I give the assurance that the Government are grateful for the support that he will provide over the next couple of years in monitoring how the legislation is implemented. All Ministers within the Department of the Environment will do everything possible to make certain that the legislation works and will monitor it closely through the relevant agencies. It is a vital piece of legislation. There is still a great deal of work to do. We shall be grateful for the hon. Gentleman's support.</p>

>The amendment refers to a part of the Bill that will

We envisage that additional land will be acquired for management and other purposes and that moneys will have to be found. We do not wish to see another Act full of good intentions placed on the statute book, with Ministers with their hands on their hearts having said upstairs, in another place and here, that they want to see it work, only to find that the public say cynically that all that has happened is that a duty has been laid upon a body to carry out certain things but that the moneys to carry out those responsibilities have been denied. We do not wish to see increased responsibility and diminished funding. 


Will the Minister give the assurance that when he refers to meetings that will take place&#x2014;it was helpful in the context of today's debate that he replied to my hon. Friend the Member for Stockport, North (Mr. Bennett) yesterday&#x2014;they will not be along the lines of the Minister informing the bodies that their aspirations will have to go into cold storage? Will he listen sympathetically to the bids that will be made to him? Will he accept that the bodies asked to carry out the duties placed upon them by the Act will feel entitled to tell him that they require certain sums of money?

I listened carefully to the Minister. He said that the way in which the staff was disposed of might not be a matter for him.

<p>The Lords amendments deal with two distinct aspects of the control of pleasure boats in marine nature reserves&#x2014;access and discharges. I should like to deal first with the question of access.<br/>
As it was worded when it left this House, the clause on marine nature reserves, subsection (6), allowed a byelaw to prohibit absolutely the entry of pleasure boats into a reserve. Although the Government gave categorical assurances that the byelaw-making power would never be exercised in that way, certain interests, as hon. Members who served on the Standing Committee will know, protested strongly that the mere existence of an enabling power was an infringement of the cherished rights of innocent passage.<br/>
In another place, amendments Nos. 11, 12, 13, 14 and 16 were agreed. They have the effect of removing the Secretary of State's power to confirm byelaws which could stop all pleasure boats from entering or passing through any part of a reserve at any time, while at the same time allowing the prohibition of access to certain areas within the reserve at certain times of the year. Since this is closely in line with the way in which it was expected that the previous provision would have been applied, the Government saw no need to resist. I trust that the House will feel likewise.<br/>
As it left this House, the Bill provided that discharges from pleasure craft could be controlled by byelaws while discharges from other craft could not. The Lords held that this was discriminatory. As the Bill is now worded as a result of Lords amendment No. 15, all craft are now subject to the same controls. The only effective control at present available is the Prevention of Oil Pollution Act 1971, which covers the discharge of any oil or oily substances except bilge water from boats of under 80 tons. The Dumping at Sea Act 1974, which was mentioned in another place, does not cover pleasure boats. I hope that that clarifies the matter.<br/>
What we must now do is look to the future, and to the next couple of years in particular. When section 31(5) of the Control of Pollution Act 1974 comes into force, the Secretary of State will have power to prohibit by regulation the deposit of any polluting matter into areas which he may designate. Where there is an international dimension to the problem, section 20 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1979 can be brought into play. Under that, Orders in Council could be made to give effect to any international agreement which relates to prevention, restriction or control of pollution of the sea by matter from ships. At present there is no relevant international convention in being but the subject is of great international concern, and to attempt to treat our marine nature reserves in isolation is not necessarily the most effective way forward. Pollution from outside the reserves can so easily flow in 


I asked the House to agree, as the NCC has agreed, that the broad front approach is the right one. Meanwhile, the Royal Yachting Association has agreed enthusiastically to co-operate with the NCC in drawing up a code of conduct for our marine nature reserves. If this proves ineffective and if pollution from pleasure craft is seen to be a problem, it will always be open for the NCC to make out a case for the application of the power to make a byelaw to route vessels away from sensitive areas.<br/>
I hope that what I have said will be of reassurance to the House.</p>

<p>As will be known to the Minister&#x2014;and I take this opportunity of thanking the Department for all its courtesies throughout the long passage of this Bill&#x2014;I contacted the Department this morning about our worries on this issue. Has there not been a little misunderstanding? I am not casting blame on the Minister in the House of Lords. I understand that notes were passed frantically to him&#x2014;which may be the source of the difficulty. I have had notes passed frantically to me by Friends of the Earth, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, the World Wildlife Fund, the Council for the Protection of Rural England, the Council for the National Parks, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the Nature Conservancy Council, the Council for the Preservations of Nature and, indeed, on occasion, the National Farmers Union&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p><member>Mr. Dalyell:</member> *Certainly the Whips&#x2014;and my colleagues on the Front Bench. I know what it is like to have notes suddenly thrust in front of one, so I do not blame Lord Avon for having misunderstood one. However, I should have thought that if there had been a misunderstanding, something could be done about that by a very tiny alteration of the legislation over which we would not create difficulties. As I understand it, the directorate of rural affairs in the Department, advised by the departmental lawyers, thought that the Dumping at Sea Act would cover the dumping of rubbish from pleasure boats. I understand, however&#x2014;and the Minister has confirmed it&#x2014;that that is not so, because that Act concerns specific dumping of items such as sludge and sewage.**</p>

<p>*In reality, it is in the interests of pleasure boat users and those who are concerned about marine nature reserves that the clause be restored, because if there were no control of dumping, boats would be restricted in their access to marine nature reserves. If the clause is restored, pleasure boats would gain greater access since dumping would be illegal. If this provision goes through, is it not a fact that the pleasure boat fraternity would be the losers and would possibly be forced to do things that they do not want to do?</p>

<p>I understand also that there is a problem concerning the code of conduct with the Nature Co nservancy Council.

<p>*I know that this matter occupied much time in debate, both in Committee and in another place, and I understand that deep views are held on all sides. We come to what can safely be said to be the substantive Lords amendment to part I. It is their disagreement to Commons amendments Nos. 143 and 144, the effect of which would be to give protection at all times to the curlew and the redshank.**</p>

<p>*Hon. Members will recall that their Lordships, when considering the Bill earlier in the year, voted substantially to remove the curlew and redshank from schedule 2 part 1. That is the list of birds which may be shot as legitimate quarry species outside the close season. This House disagreed with the other place in its amendments during proceedings on the Bill in Standing Committee D. The Government's attitude on amending schedules is well known and on record. It is that species should be given additional protection only where their conservation status warrants such a step, where an adequate scientific conservation case for protection is made out. We see this as an important basis for reconciling the conflicting interests in the countryside.**</p>

<p>*It is clear, however, that the other place feels particularly strongly about these two species. I know that Labour Members and many Conservative Members feel that the Government do not advise opposing the amendments which their Lordships voted on in favour of restoring to the list on two occasions. However, we believe that the element of conservation is an important element. I realise the deep convictions that are held on both sides. Accordingly, I urge the House to accept the amendment, recognising that their Lordships have now voted on two occasions. The objective and purpose of the Bill are of enormous importance, and hon. Members on both sides acknowledge its long-term contribution to our heritage and to conservation.**</p>

<p>*Some 30 species of wading birds visit Britain's shores. All but a few are protected by the Protection of Birds Act 1954, including species which are abundant, such as dunlin, knot and lapwing, all of which are more common than the curlew and the redshank.**</p>

<p>*Waders, particularly in flight, are difficult to identify, and confusion can easily arise between similar species. Reports of protected species being shot in error are received each year.

<p>*Waders flock and roost in mixed species parties. Thus, wader shooting causes disturbance to both protected and quarry species. Disturbance in mid-winter can cause stress and increase mortality. Although curlew and redshank, as such, are not endangered, public feeling against their being shot is very strong. Those of us who took part in the Bill received, long after the Bill was finished, representations to this effect from time to time. Even the Nature Conservancy Council recognised this and supported their removal from the shooting list in the Lords.**</p>

<p>*Tastes and wildfowling practices have changed. Shore waders are not a major part of the wildfowler's quarry. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds has received reports from East Anglia of people using redshank for practice, and not even bothering to retrieve the birds once they had been shot. In the earlier debates in the Lords many wildfowling peers agreed that shore waders were unpleasant to the modern palate and therefore could see no reason why they should be shot. Some of us will say "Amen" to that.**</p>

<p>Recent correspondence in the <i>Shooting Times and Country Magazine</i> has indicated that hunters themselves are not of one mind about the retention of the redshank and curlew on the hunting schedule. In the issue of 11 June 1981, Robin Brockbank, director of the British Field Sports Society, made the following comments:
<q>
"There is room for more than one opinion on many issues in the shooting world, whether they be in the firearm fees, the unrestricted shooting of lapwings or brent geese, the use of air weapons, or the tricky question of the ethical approach to wildfowling practices which has been a predominant issue in the debates in the Wildlife and Countryside Bill. As an indication of this I received a tiny mailbag on the subject of Mr. Kimball's policy on firearms fees but a not inconsiderable one and hostile at that from BFSS shooting members opposed to our decision to back WAGBI in the offence of Sunday wildfowling in England and Wales and the shooting of curlew and redshank."

<p>In the issue of 2 July 1981, there was a letter from David Tomlinson which presented the facts in full. It was headed "Protect not shoot?" It said:
<q>
"Sir, Am I the only WAGBI member who would like to see curlew, redshank and bar-tailed godwit removed from the list of sporting quarry? In my experience, and I have been fowling on many marshes in England, Scotland and Wales, few experienced wildfowlers consider shooting these birds. Also I have met few wildfowlers who were sufficiently competent ornithologists to tell bar-tail from a black-tailed godwit or a redshank from a spotted redshank in the half light of dawn or dusk"&#x2014;

<p>Tomlinson goes on in his letter:
<q>
"I agree that there is no strong argument on conservation grounds for not shooting these species but it could be fairly argued that an open season for blackbirds and song thrushes would have little impact on the population of these birds, both of which made reasonable eating. However, it would be very bad public relations to shoot songbirds. In the same way I feel it is detrimental to the wildfowlers' image to shoot waders, especially as none of the trio in dispute is particularly good to eat. A September curlew well roasted may be acceptable but a January bird of the saltings is fit only for the dustbin. Much better to leave it alone and enjoy instead the most beautiful and haunting of calls across the marsh."

<p>Although the curlew is quite a common breeding and wintering bird in Britain, we have an international responsibility for its protection. Our wintering population of about 44,000 is 15 per cent. of that wintering in the whole of Europe. Furthermore, 11 of our estuaries are sites of international importance for this species, meaning that they hold 1 per cent. or more of the wintering European population. There is an important argument that, with the removal of the whimbrel and now the bar-tailed godwit

from the list of those species which may be hunted, the curlew should also be removed on the grounds of "look alike" identification difficulties. The three species have very similar flight patterns.</p>

<p>The main reason, however, for the removal of the curlew and indeed all shore waders concerns the serious disturbance that they suffer during the vital feeding and roosting periods.

<p>An equally important consideration that applies to all shore waders is that of serious disturbance at vital times of feeding and roosting. This applies indiscriminately to other species occurring with redshanks, whether protected or not, and possibly even more so than in the case of other waders due to the redshank's use of wider range of habitats. The redshank weighs only 4&#x00BD; oz and is 10&#x00BD; ins from bill to tail. The bill is 2&#x00BD; ins long. The estimated numbers shot is 2,000 a year.</p>

<p>I do not believe that there are sound conservation reasons why protection should be extended to the two species which are the subject of the amendment.

It is a dangerous precedent to state that, because a bird is charming, pretty or attractive or that it makes a nice noise, it must not be shot. A ptarmigan is a lovely bird. It is also great fun to shoot. A black cock is a lovely bird, but it is a game bird. The argument that, because a bird is attractive, which the curlew and redshank are, it should not be shot is very dangerous, and it represents the first step down a very slippery slope. I would never shoot a redshank or a curlew. As the hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) said, only about 2,000 redshank a year are shot periodically in September round our shores.</p>

<p>It is right that we should put a few matters in perspective if only to prevent such an event happening again for the wrong reasons. I remind the House that when the Bill was published under a year ago there were already many changes to the schedules dealing with bird protection. We had gone through it with a toothcomb with consultation papers and all the conservation bodies. A number of birds had been taken from the quarry schedule

and put on the protected schedule. Therefore, all the issues which were debated at length relative to the redshank, curlew and godwit had been dealt with before the schedules were printed and presented to Parliament.</p>

<p>Like my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough, I have never shot a redshank or a curlew, and I never intend to. Some skilled wildfowlers&#x2014;wildfowlers by and large are extremely skilled shots, know what they are doing, and know their bird recognition&#x2014;wish to do so and have done so for generations. As has been said, at certain stages of the season, particularly in early autumn, they are good eating. Therefore, judging from the figures, there is no reason to say that for conservation reasons one should put those two waders&#x2014;the curlew and the redshank&#x2014;on the protected list.

That was accepted by the Committee and there was no vote. That issue was not debated on Report in this House. Surely the rights of the House of Commons should be given as much consideration as the rights of another place. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough about that.</p>

I regret that the arguments were ones of sentiment and not of conservation. I agree with him that all birds are attractive to look at. It is no use saying that the godwit is more attractive than, for example, the cock pheasant, the partridge, or the blackcock or many other birds which are on the game or quarry list. Therefore, it was right that their Lordships stuck to conservation reasons alone and did not change their tack to reasons of sentiment, as they did in earlier debates. The removal of the godwit was significant because the majority, which in the first instance was 51, was reduced to 19, in a House numbering only 105.</p>

<p>The Wildfowlers Association of Great Britain and Ireland&#x2014;now the British Association for Shooting and Conservation&#x2014;and the British Field Sports Society feel that they have been let down, because the view of the House of Commons has not prevailed. As I said, we are in an impossible position. If we ask the other place whether it really wishes to persist with the amendment, the Bill will be placed in jeopardy, and I am the last person to wish that to happen.</p>

<p>In considering this important Bill I set out with the principle that we should improve conservation and protection. For field sports that principle was that conservation must be all important. At this final stage, the principle that I set out to achieve has gone by the board. Therefore, the words that I have from time to time uttered on this subject will not be fulfilled in their entirety. Because of the timing and the practicalities involved, I must make clear my view on how this issue has been handled in the other place. The measure was always supported by my noble Friend Lord Avon, but, regrettably, it was lost in the other place.</p>

<p>If further protection measures are introduced&#x2014;and they will be as evolution in bird protection proceeds&#x2014;I hope that we shall always bear in mind that principles are as important as other mechanical means of obtaining protection, such as those of the Division Lobbies. I am sad about this one aspect of the Bill, but in other respects I am more than delighted that the tremendous step forward represented by the Bill&#x2014;and supported by Europe and Britain&#x2014;will be enacted tomorrow. It will immensely enhance conservation and protection in Great Britain.</p>

<p><member>Mr. John Farr (Harborough):</member> I add my congratulations to those given to my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro), which have been echoed on both sides of the Chamber.

<p>I agree with the criticisms levied by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Sir M. Kimball), and to a lesser extent by my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries, who, naturally, chose his words carefully. The House is in an invidious position. As Opposition Members have said, there are many important matters before the country, and that makes one wonder how many members of the public would regard it as right to be discussing this

measure. In addition to the threatened strike at British Leyland and the IRA bombs, there are many other important matters to discuss.</p>

<p>The last straw is that the House is not only discussing such relatively trivial matters, but cannot reject the provision because the other place is not sitting. That is intolerable. I cannot understand how the other place can engage in such brinkmanship on a Bill of such magnitude and importance. The Bill has been carefully prepared and thought out. For years before its introduction consultations were carried out with all the different bodies and a consensus was reached. I cannot understand how, at this late stage, the other place can be so rash and foolhardy as to prejudice the whole Bill. It is doing so for the sake of 18 or 20 amendments, none of which&#x2014;with the exception of this amendment&#x2014;is of any consequence.</p>

<p>For purely sentimental reasons the amendment seeks to pursue something that the House, in a democratic way in Committee, considered and rejected. No hon. Member can disagree with the analysis that my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough put forward when he said that we had no alternative but to accept the amendments. The Bill is a credit to the Government and, in particular, to the careful way in which Ministers have listened to various opinions. The Bill is a monument to their achievement. No sensible Conservative Member could do anything but reluctantly accept the Lords amendments.</p>

<p>Mention has been made of the careful consultations carried out. We are playing for big stakes tonight, and whether the bird is a curlew or a redshank does not matter. Indeed, it is all the same whether the bird is a bar-tailed godwit or a dodo. We are playing for big stakes, because many people, particularly in the other place, believe that monumental progress has been made on the protection of sites of special scientific interest and moorlands and on the protection of plants by the new laws that have been introduced on wild and captive birds. The new marine nature reserves are inspiring. The Bill contains important provisions on public rights of way, with all that they entail. It is unthinkable that the Bill should be imperiled simply for the sake of a couple of minor species, such as the curlew and the redshank.</p>

<p>In Committee and in the other place vigorous discussion took place. Labour Members launched several attacks on all forms of shooting. They sought to ban certain forms of wildfowling, to limit the woodcock shooting season, to reduce the snipe shooting season, to ban night-time shooting and, as I have said, to ban the Sunday shooting of wildfowl. In Committee we carefully considered the evidence relating to the population count of the curlew and the redshank.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries referred to a governmental committee. Until recently he had the benefit of its advice, and, as he said, it advises the Government of the day of danger levels among the various species. The committee was originally a Home Office committee, but it was transferred to the Department of the Environment. It was originally known as the advisory committee on the protection of birds for England and Wales. When the committee was under the Home Office,


there was a separate committee for Scotland. The committee is now called the Nature Conservancy Council advisory committee for Great Britain.</p>

<p>The committee considered whether there was a risk to the redshank and curlew. It was confirmed to me today by members of that committee that the conclusion was reached that on conservation grounds there was no need for protection. Those birds are adequately represented in population numbers. Surely that evidence must guide a sensible politician. We were guided by similar evidence in Committee. There was considerable discussion of the matter and figures were given of population numbers. Give or take a little, the analysis of population counts for the curlew and redshank are almost exact. Both birds are prolific breeders, both breed in Britain, and their wintering numbers are numerous.</p>

<p>What will happen if, after having been shot for many years&#x2014;only a small cull is taken annually by wildfowlers on our foreshores&#x2014;these birds are not culled? There is a real risk that some of the scarcer waders will have difficulty in maintaining their population levels. If the curlew and redshank are allowed to continue breeding unmolested&#x2014;they are big, strong and aggressive birds&#x2014;some of the smaller waders that are not numerous, such as the avocet in Suffolk, could find their existence at risk, because the total area of feeding grounds is limited and the total population of all waders that can be carried on those feeding grounds is limited. If these two birds are protected, the balance on our foreshores, as we know it today, could be endangered.</p>

<p>In Britain today about 2 million people enjoy the recreation of shooting, in one form or another. It is estimated that about 100,000 people gain a living thereby, directly or indirectly, either in arms and ammunition manufacture or in maintaining and keepering woods, fields and plantations. They carefully conserve and protect the remoter&#x2014;some not so remote&#x2014;parts of the country and keep them quiet for breeding purposes. In addition, the sport of shooting is a big foreign currency earner. These birds will continue to flourish only if quarry which is in abundance is harvested or shot during the open season.</p>

<p>There is nothing that hon. Members can do today but squeal and wriggle, because we cannot reject the amendments. We cannot imperil the progress of the Bill by insisting on our right to eradicate the amendments. If we follow the reckless attitude of the other place, we shall have much to answer for. When the Bill is enacted, even with these flaws, it will prove to be an edifice and a monument to the caring attitude of the Conservative Government towards our countryside.</p>

<p>Strange alliances are often struck in this establishment, and one of the more endearing memories that I shall have of this dying Session is that the views of my hon.

Member for Bristol, South-East (Mr. Benn), in his revulsion of the House of Lords, which I do not wholly accept. We must remember that this legislation started in

the House of Lords and thus has occupied a great part of this Session. Views and arguments have passed to and fro between the Houses, and we and the country have every reason to be grateful for the great knowledge that hon. Members have brought to bear on the subject. I respect their views.</p>

Friends the Members for Gainsborough and Harborough (Mr. Farr) acknowledged that time is not on their side and that we have to bow to the two votes in another place, when well in excess of 100 peers were present on both sides, even though only between six and 12 took part in the debate.</p>

<p>I understand, Mr. Deputy Speaker, why you may have wished to call me on the previous order relating to Northern Ireland, but it is more than 10 years since I made a speech in the House about the European Comunity. . I do not know how many right hon and hon. Members in their places now were present on that occasion&#x2014;I believe not many. In my previous job in Northern Ireland there was not much call to talk about the European Community, and in the job before that I was not allowed to make speeches at all.</p>

<p>It is appropriate that I should start by reaffirming in the strongest terms both my and the Government's commitment to the Community. The British people made a wise decision six years ago when they voted in the referendum by a majority of two to one to remain in the Community. Community membership offers Britain the best and, indeed, the only satisfactory basis on which to build our future prosperity and economic strength.</p>

<p>Our trade with the Community has reached a point where it takes 43 per cent. of our exports&#x2014;60 per cent. if we include the European associates to whose markets we also enjoy tariff-free access. There has been a steady increase in industrial investment in Britain by American, Japanese and other overseas firms which, to a considerable extent, are attracted here by the fact that we are part of a free market of 270 million people. That investment, as we all know, means a great deal in terms of new jobs and new activity, most of it fortunately coming to the areas where it is most badly needed.</p>

<p>The Community has given us greater weight in international economic negotiations.

<p>The report that we are debating was produced by the Commission in pursuance of the mandate given to it in the agreement of 30 May 1980. That agreement among the Heads of Government of all the member States provided for substantial refunds of the United Kingdom's net budgetary contributions over the succeeding two, or possibly three, years, and went on to state that a structural solution designed to prevent the recurrence of any unacceptable situation would be decided by the end of 1981. Since I had nothing to do with the negotiations, I cannot be accused of immodesty when I say that the agreement was a significant step forward for Britain and the Community as whole.</p>

<p>When we took office we inherited an intolerable situation. Unless some action had been taken, Britain, a country below the Community average level of prosperity, would have had to pay a net contribution of about &#x00A3;1,000 million a year into the Community. The Government changed that, thanks in no small part to the determination and negotiatiating skill of my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister.</p>

<p><member>Mr. Tony Marlow (Northampton, North):</member> I apologise for intervening so early in my right hon. Friend's speech, but an important calculation must be made if we pay the money one year and get it back a year or a year and a bit later. If there is money in the bank it earns interst, but if one has to borrow it one pays interest. Can my right hon.

<p>I have spoken about 1980. We shall shortly be getting the first refunds in respect of 1981. The May 1980 agreement made a major reduction in our net contribution over those two years. As I said earlier, there is provision for a similar arrangement to apply to 1982 if necessary.</p>

<p>However, it was only a temporary solution to a continuing problem. The 30 May agreement also pledged the Community to resolve the problem on a longer-term basis by means of structural changes. That was an important decision. It was agreed that the problem should be tackled through an examination of the development of all Community policies, including the common agricultural policy, with the aim of preventing the recurrence of unacceptable situations for any member State. The report before us gives the Commission's proposals on how that may be done.</p>

<p>The report deals with the problem in three sections&#x2014;the development of policies other than agricultural, the reform of the CAP and the problem of unacceptable net budgetary contributions. In the first section the Commission sets the problem within the broad context of Community development in the medium term and the need for the Community to meet the challenge of the 1980s. It calls for progress in a number of areas, including completion of the internal market, energy policy, development of the European monetary system and research and development. It recommends that the resources of the regional and social funds should be increased and concentrated on areas of particular need, in

particular, that the regional fund should concentrate on areas suffering from underdevelopment as well as the problems of industrial decline. At the same time it says that the social fund should give more emphasis to current problems, particularly in regions where traditional industries are concentrated, and to preparing young people for working life.</p>

<speech hansard_id="69193" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1981-10-29a.1044.0" colnum="1044" time="18:33:00">
<p>On the common agricultural policy, the Commission, although endorsing the basic principles of the policy, concludes that, since the Community is now more than self-sufficient for most agricultural products, sound management and the need to keep costs under control require that adjustments should be made to the way in which it operates in future. It recommends a number of guidelines, which include the following five: first, a price policy based on a narrowing of the gap between Community prices and prices applied by its main competitors; secondly, a limitation of the open-ended price guarantee, so that if Community production exceeds certain thresholds the full Community price will not be paid; thirdly, the possibility of direct income support subsidies to certain producers in specific circumstances; fourthly, an active export policy which would honour the Community's international commitments; and, fifthly, stricter discipline over national aids to agriculture.</p>

<speech hansard_id="69194" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1981-10-29a.1044.1" colnum="1044" time="18:33:00">
<p>It is the Commission's view that, if these guidelines are implemented, the Community's agricultural expenditure should grow more slowly than its financial resources, and that, of course, means that what we consider to be the excessive proportion of Community expenditure devoted to agriculture would be gradually reduced.</p>

<speech hansard_id="69195" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1981-10-29a.1044.2" colnum="1044" time="18:33:00">
<p>Finally, in the third section dealing with the budget itself the Commission recognises that the United Kingdom continues to face an inequitable budget situation, mainly because it obtains a much smaller relative return from the CAP than do the other member States. It recommends that there should be a corrective mechanism based on the difference between the United Kingdom's share of Community gross national product and the proportion it obtains of FEOGA guarantee expenditure. It suggests that the corrective should be temporary, but should last until the development of other Community policies makes itself felt.</p>

<p><member>Mr. Marlow:</member> I am terribly sorry to intervene again. My right hon. Friend talks about radical ideas for reform of the CAP. Reforms have been required and requested and plans put forward for years, going back to the Mansholt plan, which must be about 10 years old. Can my right hon. Friend really give us hope that this time changes will take place? What is the difference now that will make changes take place? If we do not get the changes within a limited time, will the Government take action unilaterally to support the consumer in the United Kingdom, who has been milked for so long by this wretched policy?</p>

<p><member>Mr. Atkins:</member> The difference is that the Heads of Government on 30 May recognised the existence of the problem, instructed that work should be done to see how it could be resolved and told the Commission to produce ideas, and the Commission, for the first time that I know of, has produced them. Those are the ideas that I have outlined. I was about to comment on them. I have so far briefly put what the Commission, in pursuance of the mandate, produced as ideas about what should be done.

<p><member>Mr. Atkins:</member> I repeat again that we are discussing tonight the Commission's ideas produced in June on how the mandate given on 30 May 1980 might be fulfilled. In June, when the Heads of Government met in the European Council again, they called on member countries to sit down, discuss, negotiate and work out how best to solve the problem, whether by adopting the proposals or in some other way, and present Heads of Government with decisions for them to endorse, or, if decisions were not possible, at least alternatives to discuss and decide on. That is what is happening. Discussions have gone on steadily and intensively over the past weeks and months.</p>

<p>It has been agreed in the Community that discussions should be carried forward on a broad front, encompassing all three elements in the Commission's report. They are in fact closely connected. It is recognised that what is needed now is a general revitalisation of the Community and that our decisions should be taken in the context of an overall strategy to that end. My right hon. and noble Friend the Foreign Secretary has indeed been calling for this for some time. We wish this to apply to areas where no expenditure is required, such as the completion of the common market and the creation of common rules for the service industries, such as insurance, as well as to the Community's regional and social funds, whose expansion we have consistently supported and whose operation we feel should be focused more precisely on the main areas of need. It is welcome news that certain other countries, most recently the new French Government, have now made similar calls for the renewal of the Community through the development of its policies in these fields.</p>

<p>In parallel, there will have to be genuine reforms in the CAP. A great deal of nonsense is talked about the CAP in Britain, It has become one of the "Aunt Sallies" of our time. Clearly, it would be ludicrous to "jettison" the CAP, as the Opposition amendment suggests. The CAP is a working system, imperfect but capable of improvement. All the Opposition have to offer is a hope and a prayer. They say "the British consumer would be free to buy food at the lowest prices". Where would we find the quantities that we would need at these "lowest prices"? Do they think the British consumer would have welcomed the opportunity to buy sugar at "lowest 'world prices" last year, when these were about &#x00A3;400 per tonne, compared with a Community price of &#x00A3;300 per tonne?

<p>A central element in this must be a policy for agricultural price restraint on the lines proposed by the Commission. There will also have to be limitation of guarantees once certain production thresholds are passed. Measures of this sort should, however, not discriminate

<p>We also support the Commission's proposals for stricter control of national aids. They serve to distort the common market in agricultural produce. We are, however, cautious about the Commission's proposals for a more active export policy if these mean that the practice of exporting at heavy subsidy will be expanded. The Community must be careful of its obligations to its main trading partners, whether developed or developing. The overall objective must be to establish effective financial control over the CAP and reduce costs so that resources can be released within the 1 per cent.

<p>One disturbing feature of the Commission's proposals is its desire, when it looks at the surpluses and the cost of the CAP, to extend the system of what is called co-responsibility to curb the milk surplus in the Community, and presumably also raise more money for the Commission, for in paragraph 24 the Commission report states:
<q>For milk products, the Commission considers that the objective of controlling production can only be achieved if the principle of co-responsibility is extended.</q>
Stripped of the Community doublespeak, that means, in effect, a kind of tax on milk products. The Lord Privy Seal has great experience in these matters and I put this question to him: why on earth should the British dairy industry and the British consumer have to suffer this levy on milk when there is no surplus of milk products in Britain?</p>

That in itself is an extraordinary and retrograde system, because decisions are taken about farm policy not intrinsically on their merits&#x2014;the co-responsibility levy is a classic example&#x2014;but in order to raise more money for the Commission to spend on various other projects.</p>

In other words, the Common Market should be allowed to spend what it wants and the money must then be found to pay for it. That is what the Commission is saying: the real world must not be allowed to intrude upon the Commission's grandiose designs. That is how the Common Market has operated up to now.

The Commission then looks for an alternative scheme or policy to try to solve the problem. The problem arises in respect of the EEC budgetary year 1982 and onwards.

If there is no agreement for 1982, will the Financial Secretary indicate what our net contribution might be during that year? We have calculated that our net contribution for 1982, in the absence of an agreement, could be &#x00A3;1,250 million or more. That will be the starting figure. Will the hon. Gentleman tell us what our net contribution for 1982 might be if the mechanism which the Commission is suggesting in the document is applied? The mechanism compares our share of the Community's GNP with our share of receipts under the CAP.</p>

<p>If there are to be negotiations between now and the end of November, and if the negotiations take into account the system advocated by the Commission, surely the British

Government must have the figures to enable them to determine whether the new scheme will be of benefit to Britain. The Opposition do not have the resources of the Foreign Office, the Treasury or the Commission, but we estimate that in 1982, under the Commission's so-called solution, we shall make a net contribution of about &#x00A3;800 million.

<p>As the amendment makes clear, and as the House has accepted unanimously on two occasions, the only real solution is for Britain not to contribute more to the budget than it receives. There is nothing revolutionary about that suggestion. As I have said, eight of the 10 members of the Community are already in that position. Only two member States contribute towards running the EEC&#x2014;West Germany and Britain. What kind of a Community is it when only two members are paying to keep it going? Eight of the 10 members are receiving benefits from the Community in excess of the money that they put into it.</p>

I should like to deal with the negative attitude displayed by the official Opposition's amendment. We must look at the amendment and what the Opposition have to say in the context of their official party policy to quit the Community, come what may, without giving the citizens of this country even the courtesy of a referendum to reverse the decision that they took so overwhelmingly in the previous one. It is not for me this evening to dwell on the disruptive effect that that would have in this country on a scale that is impossible to imagine.

I should like to quote his remarks to us on 24 March 1980, when he seemed very confused as to whether it was a good thing for Britain to press for payments and refunds from the Community budget anyway, since he complained:

<q>By seeking to secure increased Community expenditure in Britain we are allowing the EEC increasingly to determine our own public expenditure priorities and to increase its influence and competence over Government decisions in Britain."&#x2014;</q>

<p>Secondly, the Opposition have some things to sort out on their side in this respect. They cannot, on the one hand, say that accepting increased Community expenditure in Britain robs us of power to determine our own public expenditure priorities and, on the other hand, at the same time, allow one of their representatives in the European Parliament, Mr. Richard Balfe, to use his position on that Parliament's finance committee to seek to chop in half the refunds that were negotiated for us by the Prime Minister in the teeth of such hard negotiations. The Opposition must sort out what it is that they want. Do they want Britain to have the primary say on where these resources go, or do they accept Mr. Balfe's arguments that it is some Community institution that should have the right of decision on, this money is spent?

In tackling this problem in this country, whether or not in conjunction with our partners, we must remember that it is access to Community markets that is essential for our industries and our jobs.

That means that it had to put concrete proposals before the Council before the end of June. Yet the document contains nothing like that. It is a vague document that expresses a number of sentiments, with perhaps one or two minor changes in direction.</p>

<p>It is true that the Commission is inhibited by the terms of the mandate, which provides that the main principles of agricultural policy shall not be questioned. The main policies relating to Common Market finances&#x2014;that is, mainly the own resources policy&#x2014;also shall not be questioned. Those restrictions impose considerable difficulties on the Commission in proposing a restructuring of Community policy in that connection. It does not do so.</p>

<p>Its policies are vague. In fact, that vagueness is commented upon in <i>The World Today</i>, which says:

<q>Analysis of the Commission's report is complicated by its lack of clarity and coherence, It is in places vague or ambiguous and occasionally self-contradictory. The cause seems to have been that the final draft was prepared in haste."&#x2014;</q>
I stress that point&#x2014;
<q>with several last-minute revisions, and translated from the original French in even greater haste. Perhaps also some differences within the Commission remained unresolved when the final text of the document was drawn up. The effect is that the reader has difficulty discerning what, if any, meaning to read into some passages and reconciling what is said in one place with what is said in another. Although negotiations may be facilitated if proposals of this sort are not set out in too much detail, they may be hampered if the imprecision is such that even the broad intent is obscured.</q>
I entirely agree with that analysis, having looked at the document.</p>

<p><member>Sir Anthony Meyer:</member> I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman. I recognise that we have to debate the document that is before us, that being all that we have, but, as we all know, the Commission has produced much more specific proposals during the past week. Those proposals contain figures that go a long way towards meeting our requirements. It is unrealistic that we should be so bound by procedure that we cannot take account of the realities.</p>

<p><member>Mr. Silverman:</member> The point is that we are not discussing those proposals. Our discussions are confined to the document that is before the House. That is the subject of our debate. If there are more precise proposals, clearly they should be brought before the House and discussed here. Not only should they be brought before the House, but, in accordance with the procedure of the House, in the first place they should be brought before the Scrutiny Committee and be discussed by that Committee and then reported to the House, recommending a debate on specific items.</p>

<p>So far no other document relating to this matter has been brought before the Committee. That is a gross breach of procedure. Having read the report, I cannot help feeling that some time before 26 June&#x2014;the deadline by which the Commission had to fulfil its task; in other words, produce the documents&#x2014;someone said to someone else on the Commission "Look lads, we have to produce a document by 26 June", and so they produced something that has all the marks of being cobbled together at the last moment, as was pointed out by the article that I quoted. It contains sentiments that have long been in the minds of the Commission, but there is not a single specific proposal that the House or the Committee could discuss in concrete terms. That is my chief criticism of the document.</p>

<p>It was for that reason that the Committee decided at the earliest possible moment that the Minister of State should give evidence to the Committee, not only to clarify the Commission's proposals, but to state the Government's attitude to them. I am bound to say that we have made little progress in that respect today. The invitation extended by the Committee to the Minister of State was to give evidence this morning, and we were astonished to learn a few days ago that the debate was to take place this afternoon. Clearly, that did not provide any time for the Committee to consider the proposals and then report to the House.</p>

Secondly, why, if other documents have been brought forward, have they not been placed before the Scrutiny Committee and why are they not before the House today so that we can discuss them as an essential part of this debate? Those are questions that I am entitled to ask, not merely as a Member of the House, but as Chairman of the European Legislation Committee.</p>

<p>I shall not go into any of the proposals in detail, but, speaking now as a Back-Bench Member of Parliament representing a West Midlands constituency, I wish to ask the Minister one specific question. I notice that it is suggested&#x2014;it is a suggestion of which I do not disapprove&#x2014;that there should be an extension of the social and regional funds and that in that way the United Kingdom Government could recoup a certain amount of their contribution.

<p>In the West Midlands there has been a savage deterioration in the level of employment, and it has occurred rapidly and suddenly. No reference is made to that in this document, and no project has been provided for the West Midlands. Of course, that is a matter that is decided not so much by the Commission as by the Government, and that is a broad aspect of Government policy that I should like to have explained. Those who are suffering most seriously, not merely in terms of unemployment but in terms of a huge deterioration in their position, do not: understand it, and I should like to hear the Minister's views on it.</p>

<p><member>Mr. Teddy Taylor (Southend, East):</member> I share the views of the hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Mr. Silverman), but I wonder why we are debating this matter at all. The document is little more than a series of broad generalisations which give no detailed indication of how the mandate can be carried out in a way which is politically acceptable to member States. What is more, to the extent that they are no more than general indications, they are not helpful to the United Kingdom. Those who doubt whether the paper is helpful should read page 5, which contains a full list of wide and general sentiments that make no real sense and give no indication of how the mandate can be pursued.</p>

<p>In the mandate we are concerned largely about how we can resolve the problem of the common agricultural policy and member States' contributions to it. Having read the document and the Foreign Office paper on it, and having

listened to the Minister and the Opposition Front Bench, I am depressed to discover that all the indications are that it will be extremely difficult&#x2014;assuming that it is possible at all&#x2014;to get any meaningful reform of the CAP which is politically acceptable to member States.</p>

<p>As the Minister said, the obvious problem is that of production levels, which are likely to rise. How can they be controlled? The Commission seems to believe that the answer lies basically in lower prices. Unfortunately, there is no indication that these necessarily result in a reduction in production. Indeed, in some quarters it is argued that a lowering of prices often brings about a further increase in production. But even if lower prices worked, and even if such a solution brought Community prices into line with world prices and succeeded in controlling production, does the Minister seriously believe that such a proposal would be acceptable to all member States unless they agreed at the same time to national "fiddles.' whereby the money could be made up with national cash? The idea that we could solve the CAP problem by lowering prices is not politically acceptable to all member States, and I doubt whether it would be acceptable to Britain and its agriculture.</p>

<p>What about the possibility of production curbs? The implication of co-responsibility payments basically is production curbs&#x2014;in other words, we shall not finance open-ended production. Does the Treasury Minister believe that British agriculture&#x2014;or French or German agriculture&#x2014;will be prepared to accept what amounts to specific curbs on production? But even if that were the case, would it make sense in Britain's case when we are telling all our industries that they must become more efficient and productive? Our farming has a very good record in this connection. At a time when we are not self sufficient in food, how can we tell British farmers that they must produce less than at present? The Minister will be aware of the sentiments of those engaged in milk production about the existing co-responsibility levy.</p>

<p>There is a third way, of course. The Commission hinted at it, and I was delighted with the response to it by the Lord Privy Seal. It is not only to continue with subsidised exports but to have general agreements for continuing exports of subsidised food. The Lord Privy Seal was right to say that we must not solve the problem of overproduction by having a massive increase in the amount of subsidised food, which will not only wreck the economies of the poorer countries but create an intolerable burden for the CAP.</p>

<p>Having listened to the Minister, I adhere to the view that I have held for a long time, that, despite all the Government's efforts, there is no realistic way in which we can look to major reforms of the CAP which are politically acceptable unless it is as the result of a "fiddle", by which I mean replacing CAP cash with national cash


to supplement it, or finding ways of disposing of production other than destroying it, as we do at present, or exporting it at knock-down prices and thereby damaging the world economy.</p>

<p>One hon. Member who has now left the Chamber repeatedly shouted "What about the farmers?" whenever a criticism was made by an Opposition Member. I accept that British agriculture has benefited from the CAP and the EEC. The prices made by British farmers have gone up considerably, since they have risen to EEC levels and the green pound has been removed. In this way British agriculture as a whole has benefited. however, I hope that those engaged in agriculture will look to the future with a view to deciding whether the CAP will be as good for them then as it is now. If we reform the CAP in any meaningful way, it means either curbs on prices or specific curbs on production, which will apply to efficient British agriculture as well as to those on the Continent who are still inefficient. In my view, there is no way in which we can increase prices without adding to the intolerable problems of overproduction by the EEC.</p>

<p>In the circumstances, British agriculture should be looking to the future, realising that the only real hope of long-term prosperity will be if Britain looks after its own agriculture, bearing in mind that we are not self sufficient in food. I doubt whether anyone really believes that there is a genuine way in which the CAP can be reformed effectively to bring supply and demand into broad balance and to get rid of the cheating and fiddling which up till now have maintained the CAP. They can be contained so long as the Government adhere strictly to their commitment to a ceiling of 1 per cent.</p>

Whenever we ask specific questions on that matter, we are told that it is impossible to find out. In a question this week I asked why British unemployment has soared so substantially, more than that of almost any other country in the Western world, while the four little European countries which did not join the Common Market in 1973&#x2014;Austria, Sweden, Norway and Switzerland&#x2014;now have virtually full employment as in 1972.</p>

look at obvious and prima facie evidence on why, since 1972, our unemployment has soared so much, while the little countries which stayed out of the Common Market have done wonderfully well. In Sweden the percentage of unemployment has reduced.</p>

<p>The Minister cannot ignore this serious point. There must be an answer. I believe passionately that in our decision to join&#x2014;this should colour the way in which we approach reform&#x2014;we made a dreadful mistake for the British economy in that we joined when Western Europe as a whole was heading for decline. We joined at the time when the principle that "big is beautiful" was being destroyed, if one considers the economic situation in the world as a whole.

<p>That is my point of view, but the facts support it. Surely before we go further, as recommended by the paper, we should have a proper, objective inquiry, a proper assessment of the effect of the EEC on the British economy. The effects have been substantial and negative. The Government must accept that our giving a net sum of over &#x00A3;3,000 million since 1972&#x2014;over &#x00A3;1 million a day&#x2014;must have damaged the British economy. That cannot be denied. If any country, particularly one such as ours with problems, is having to give foreign aid of &#x00A3;1 million a day virtually for nothing, for which we pay more and get back less, that must do damage, because it means that we lose &#x00A3;3,000 million of public spending that we could have used in other helpful ways, for example, for investment and reducing taxation.

<p>It should be accepted generally that the CAP has damaged the British economy. It has given temporary relief to agriculture, but surely by removing the one competitive advantage that we had as a country&#x2014;access to food at world prices&#x2014;we have added considerably to the costs of British industry by unnecessarily forcing up the cost of living. No one knows whether we shall be able to buy the food at lower prices in the future. However, we know that there is a tax on imported butter of over 60p a pound, of 61.14p per pound on cheese, of 67p a pound on beef and of 27p a pound on lamb, which has pushed prices up considerably more than might otherwise have been the case. I obtained those figures from a parliamentary answer. Surely it must be accepted, even by the Euro-fanatics, that the CAP puts up prices in Britain and thereby adds to industrial costs.</p>

<p><member>Mr. Taylor:</member> It is silly for my hon. Friend to disagree. Those figures were given to me by the Secretary of State for Trade in an oral answer. For example, in 1978, 1979 and 1980, Britain had a profit in manufacturing trade of about &#x00A3;15,000 million. On the other hand, in our manufacturing trade with the EEC, we had a massive deficit of about &#x00A3;5,000 million. We made a profit in manufacturing trade before, but now we make a substantial manufacturing loss. That considerably affects jobs. Germany is referred to as our best customer. We are now doing more trade with Germany, but our deficit in manufactures last year was over &#x00A3;2,000 million, which is about double our deficit with Japan.</p>

<p>What worries me even more is that we are becoming involved in more Socialist schemes through the EEC. That will do us more damage. We know the effect of the CAP. I fear that steel is moving in the same direction. Because we have problems with production, supply, prices and losses, we are moving slowly but surely towards a scheme for steel whereby there will be a substantial tariff wall, artificially high prices and controlled production. That will add considerably to the costs of British industry.</p>

of Germany that is twice as big as our deficit with Japan.

<p>It is possible to manufacture slogans and figures. It is also possible to pick out figures. I have made a desperate effort to avoid doing that. Let us take the figure mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Reigate (Mr. Gardiner) as that is at the nub of the argument. I refer to the figure of 1 million jobs. At Blackpool, it was included in the Prime Minister's speech. By coincidence, Mr. Roy Jenkins used it on the same day. It is suggested that if we lose one-third of our trade with the EEC when we leave it, 1 million jobs might be lost. The assumption is that one-third of our exports will disappear, but that none of our imports will disappear. It is strange that such a precise figure can be given, because whenever the Government are asked about the EEC's effect on jobs they say that it is neither possible nor realistic to isolate from all influences that bear on employment those that are due solely to our membership of the Common Market. I am scared that we are scratching round and looking for any figure that can be interpreted to show that the idea is good.</p>

Therefore, we must look for the right type of reform. We should try to get equal contributions. The CAP will not be effectively reformed not because of a conspiracy by nasty foreigners, but because a major reform will not be politically acceptable. Before we become further enmeshed in more Euro-steel plans, Euro-energy plans, Euro-training plans and Euro-employment plans, we should stop and objectively consider why Britain has suffered massive and soaring unemployment since 1972. We have suffered greater unemployment than that experienced in the other EEC countries and infinitely more than those countries that did not join the EEC. The time has come to look at the situation objectively so that we can see which type of reform is most suited to the special problems of our poor nation.</p>

<p>I would agree with the hon. Gentleman that the common agricultural policy has probably had a negative effect on the United Kingdom. However, it is impossible to put a value on security of supply, which has been one of the major facets of the CAP. I agree that the prospect of radical reform of the CAP is remote and will probably founder on the rock of vested interests among those of our partners who currently benefit so greatly from it and on the fact that for many in Europe the common agricultural policy is the Ark of the Covenant and the high spot of European achievement. They fear that if there were a root and branch reform of the EEC the whole structure would crumble. That is a major factor.</p>

He knows as well as I that much of what he has asked for cannot be obtained. For example, who can calculate with any precision the tariffs that we may face if we leave the EEC? On the assumption that Britain would leave the EEC, who can make a proper analysis of the likely trends in world food production and the availability of agricultural supplies? Who could, with any precision, say what alternative markets&#x2014;if any&#x2014;there might be for the percentage of the 43 per cent. of our goods that we would certainly lose if Britain were no longer a member of the EEC?

<p>The mandate is based on the May 1980 agreement. On any criteria, the agreement represented a substantial step forward for Britain. The agreement covered only the years 1980 and 1981, with&#x2014;if there were no clear agreement to the contrary&#x2014;a probable follow-through to the budget year 1982. My right hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli (Mr. Davies) asked the Minister several important questions. He asked what we were likely to pay over the exchanges&#x2014;according to the best available estimates&#x2014;in the budget year 1982 if the 1980 agreement were extended. If, on the other hand the current Commission's proposals were accepted, bridging the gap between our proportional gross national product and receipts from the CAP, what then would be the probable figure?

<p>A positive feature is that for the first time our partners have recognised that an "unacceptable situation" has arisen. Given the smallness of our agriculture sector and the fact that the EEC budget is predominantly oriented towards agriculture, that was probably inevitable. The Commission was given a clear task to examine current policies, to propose structural changes to the budget and,

most important, to prevent a recurrence of the "unacceptable situation". It was asked, as far as was practicable, to provide a basis for a long-term solution.</p>

The proposals that relate to the United Kingdom contribution are possibly less valuable to us than a continuation of the May 1980 agreement. The proposals are also weak because they exclude the Federal Republic of Germany, which, in terms of its contribution to the budget, is in an equally "unacceptable position". It pays over &#x00A3;1 billion per annum to the budget and has taken our place as the paymaster of Europe.</p>

Member for Reigate (Mr. Gardiner) said, at that time, on present principles, Portugal is likely to be a net contributor. If one compares Greece with Ireland, in terms of benefit per head of population, there is a factor of about 1:9 in favour of Ireland, which on any basis of integration and common purposes is wholly inequitable.

<p>Why is it so immoral and wicked to suggest a significant expansion of the Community budget? I hope that the Minister will listen to this idea. Let us make it 50 per cent. more. I know that this is difficult for some to take, but I am in favour of exceeding the 1 per cent. ceiling in due course. We do not have to worry about that happening now, because the inflation receipts and the rise in world food prices has kept the figure below 1 per cent. for longer than we expected two years ago, but eventually we shall come up against it.</p>

<p>I was struck by the contrast between the Labour Party's attitude and that of the French Socialists to the Community and to this document. On 13 October the French Minister in charge of European affairs issued a memorandum on behalf of the new French Government. That document

<p>In the French memorandum there was an emphasised proposal for a greater drive towards European self-sufficiency in energy. Those key proposals fit in well and closely with some proposals in the Commission document. It sounds strange for me to say that the French Socialists have good ideas, but they do.

<p>I refer finally to "European File" of October 1981. As hon. Members know, that is produced by the Commission. The Commission specifically referred to "The British problem". It said:

we still do not have that&#x2014;
"respect for European competition laws and the international role of the Community cannot be translated into budget credits."

<p>The agreement of 30 May 1980 was a great step forward. That was the view of the hon. Member for Swansea, East (Mr. Anderson), although it does not seem to coincide with the view of the right hon. Member for Llanelli. He asked me what would be the results for 1982 on three different possibilities. If there is no agreement about the mandate, the form of refund is clearly set out in the 30 May agreement. It is impossible to calculate, because 1982 has not even been reached let alone the finances determined. If the Commission scheme, as set out, is adopted, it is impossible to estimate the effect, because it is only an outline and not a precise scheme. We do not yet know what will be the costs of the Community budget next year. The United Kingdom will not be satisfied with the scheme put forward by the Commission. We shall seek to find a better solution than that which appears to be contained in the Commission's document.</p>

<p>The Commission proposes to solve the mandate problem under three headings. One is non-agricultural expenditure. The reason why the hon. Member for Erdington has not yet received any assistance from the social or regional fund for his West Midlands constituency is that these contributions from the Community are

accredited to assisted areas only. The West Midlands is not an assisted area. This does not affect the distribution of United Kingdom expenditure but in order to qualify for the refunds certain projects have to be put up. It does not affect United Kingdom expenditure. It is just a device for reclaiming our money. The heading on which the House has spent most time is that concerning agriculture. We do not question the principle of the common agricultural policy, although both the Government and the Commission admit that it is capable of reform and are in favour of reforming it.</p>

How can we stand that on top of unemployment which is now over 3 million?</p>

<p>The Secretary of State must act and take up his responsibility as Secretary of State. We want him to initiate negotiations tomorrow. We want to see the strike averted.

<p>The Government are well aware of the grave concern about the danger that looms over British Leyland, which has been most eloquently expressed by the right hon. Member for Salford, West (Mr. Orme) and which is felt both inside and outside the House. The Government's position has been made clear by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, who answered questions on this subject on Tuesday and again this afternoon. The conduct of the negotiations over pay&#x2014;for pay is at the heart of the dispute&#x2014;is a matter for the management of the company and the unions involved.

<p>The management of the company is that appointed by the last Labour Government to manage British Leyland and, if possible, to restore the company to viability. Our predecessors backed the board with substantial sums of public money. They allocated to it about &#x00A3;870 million of taxpayers' money. As the House will remember, my immediate predecessor&#x2014;the present Secretary of State for Education and Science&#x2014;announced in January a further sum by way of support to British Leyland, amounting to &#x2014;990 million. Part of that sum has already been made available and there is provision for the rest&#x2014;about &#x00A3;540 million&#x2014;to be made available to the company during the rest of 1981&#x2013;82 and 1982&#x2013;83.</p>

<p>Confirmation that that sum will be available will depend, as in the past, on the company's submitting its annual corporate plan to the Government, embodying proposals consistent with the planned path to viability. The company has been making huge losses, which are continuing at the rate of about &#x00A3;500 million in the current year. But, thanks to very effective management, and with the full co-operation of the work force&#x2014;Sir Michael Edwardes paid tribute to that on television last night&#x2014;the groundwork has been laid for recovery and the results are beginning to show.

<p>As the House knows, there are now new and, one hopes, very successful models of cars on the market. They have appeared on time and within planned costs. That in itself is a striking change from the recent past of the company. BL's market share has not only stopped falling, but is now rising, despite the most difficult trading environment for some decades. The productivity of the company is rising, despite the fact that the overall market has been falling. I know, because he has told me so, that the last thing that Sir Michael wants is the success for which he and all his work force have striven to be dashed from his hands. His reputation as a manager depends on his achievements in setting BL on the road to economic viability.</p>

This point was put clearly by the right hon. Member for Cardiff, South-East (Mr. Callaghan), who as Prime Minister said:

<p>The question that the House needs to face&#x2014;following the line of the right hon.

I have not heard figures from the Opposition spokesman about the average earnings of BL employees. I believe that they are about the same as those of people in other car plants around Britain. [HON. MEMBERS: "Not true."] The figures would have been useful. If, as I believe, the average earnings are generally within pounds of each other&#x2014;which I think the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) has admitted&#x2014;the question is whether British Leyland can afford another increase.

<p>It is also incumbent on us all to consider what is being asked for. If the Opposition are suggesting that the extra percentage of basic pay should be, say, 5 per cent. instead of 3.8 per cent.&#x2014;we are told that the gap is narrow but not how narrow&#x2014;if the argument is that an extra 1 per cent. or 2 per cent. on the offer would be acceptable, the House must consider whether such an increase in a company requiring vast sums of taxpayers' money is justified. Then, if 5 per cent. is justified for a company that still needs substantial financial support from the Government, how

much will be argued for in profitable companies? Again, if companies that are profitable but are not increasing their productivity or competitiveness and output by more than the 5 or 10 per cent. that would therefore seem sensible for a profit-making company have higher pay increases, what pay increases will be looked for in the public sector, teaching, the hospital service and throughout the economy?</p>

<p>In the past two years we have witnessed a decline in industrial production and nominal earnings increases of 50 per cent. or more. In the next year, presumably, it will be more. We have seen a vast increase in unemployment, not solely because of nominal pay increases but in large part because of agreements made by employers and trade unions. I do not argue that we should solely blame trade unions for taking what they are offered or what they can force out of employers. We need a basic degree of realism.</p>

<p>It is accepted that this is not the place for negotiation, but it is the place to put forward the public interest. It is in the public interest that the general level of pay increases in the forthcoming year should be kept down. Those pay increases will be nominal and not real, because we are not producing extra throughout the country to justify, or even make possible, an increase in the real standard of living. We are talking of artificial pay increases anyway. If we are talking about the level of artificial pay increases and we are concerned about the pensioner and people bringing up dependent children and all the other things that we want to do with real output, we should ask "If the pay increase for a loss-making company is more than 3.8 per cent. on basic rates, what about the rest of us?"</p>

I am prepared to give way to the hon. Member for Workington if he will answer my earlier question about the differences in average earnings among BL, Ford, Talbot and so on.</p>

<p>A group of Labour Members from the West Midlands went to see the chairman and some of his colleagues on Monday. Sir Michael laid great emphasis on the bonus. One would imagine that it would be paid to all BL's employees, but that is not the case. I understand that it is likely to be paid to only about 5,000 of the 58,000 employees. Moreover, the bonus is complex. Far from its being easily understood, even senior managers do not understand how it will be worked out. It is wrong for the public relations machine at BL to give the impression that the bonus will be enjoyed by a majority of the work force.</p>

It is all very well for the hon. Member for Woolwich, West (Mr. Bottomley) to say that there is a shortage of money. We understand all the problems involved, but the BL work force has taken wage increases well below the rate of inflation in previous years.

<p>The 3.8 per cent. on offer to those on grade rates means a pay increase of &#x00A3;2.25 a week. That is what the company is offering.

That is after a productivity increase of 40 per cent. at Longbridge and 30 per cent. overall. With that kind of reward, Edwardes is saying that if the worker

dare strike against it they will lose their jobs. That is tantamount to withdrawing the right to strike from British Leyland workers.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman has referred to previous positions and statements made by previous Ministers. No previous Minister or Prime Minister has been faced with the threat of a closure of a major company employing so many people. I ask the Secretary of State not to quote previous Ministers but to stand on his own feet and take positive action. He has discussed the matter with Sir Michael Edwardes and the board. Knocking on his door tomorrow will be some major trade union leaders asking the right hon. Gentleman to intervene in the dispute. They will include Mr. Alex Kitson of the Transport and General Workers Union Mr. Cure of the AUEW and other trade union leaders. Will the Secretary of State see those trade union leaders tomorrow before the dispute starts, listen to their side of the argument and see whether they can play a major part at this eleventh hour?</p>

<p>Comparisons have been made with other companies and car workers generally. I am informed that there is a type of guaranteed payment at some companies, such as Ford, which are not paralleled at British Leyland. Car workers generally are not at the top of the scale in earnings. They are very low down the scale. We are talking about men who work on a conveyor belt for 40 hours taking home net payments of about &#x00A3;72 a week, including bonus.</p>

<p>We do not want the matter to be left where it is. I welcome the fact that there has been a large attendance of Labour and Conservative Members for this important debate. I have not seen any members of the Liberal Party or the Social Democratic Alliance. We welcome the fact that the debate has taken place. We have had to force it out of the Government, but it has taken place. However, the debate is not the end of the issue. We do not sit back now and wait for the dispute.</p>

<p>I hope that the Secretary of State will take away the views put by Opposition Members and initiate negotiations over the weekend that can get this dispute resolved.

<p>The debate has served a useful purpose. The poll in <i>The Sun</i> this morning showed that only about 30 per cent. of the work force of BL believe that a serious strike will result in the closure of the company or large parts of it. I think that the remaining 70 per cent. are very wrong. Virtually every word that has been spoken by every speaker in this debate has shown very clearly that that is not a view shared in this House. I think that everyone has recognised that with this prospective strike at BL we are facing a desperately serious situation which could well result in the closure of the company or large parts of it.</p>

<p>The fact is that, whatever the basic pay increases may have been over two or three years, in both 1980 and 1981 the increase in average earnings of BL employees has been above the increase in prices. In 1980 the rate of inflation was virtually 18 per cent.; the increase in average earnings was 20.6 per cent. In 1981&#x2014;for the 10 months since 1 November 1980&#x2014;the rate of inflation has been 9.6 per cent.; the increase in average earnings has been 13.5 per cent. Although the increases in basic rates have been of the low figures quoted by the right hon. Member for Salford, West (Mr. Orme), the increases in earnings&#x2014;I am quoting them before tax and national insurance, in the normal way&#x2014;have been higher than the increase in the cost of living.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman suggested that pay at BL was significantly below that of other car workers. A great many comparisons can be made; some are below, and some are above. However, the average production worker at BL, including the average bonus, earns at present &#x00A3;105.50. The average production worker at Fords, getting the attendance allowances that Ford pays, earns &#x00A3;103.50. So the BL worker&#x2014;</p>

<p>I come to the hon. Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Winnick). The fact is that the average bonus that has been earned in BL is &#x00A3;11.50. Most of BL's employees already earn good bonuses. The hon. Gentleman seemed to suggest that only 5,000 people were earning the bonus, if I understood him rightly. The effect of guaranteeing the first &#x00A3;3.50 of the bonus would help 5,000 people who at present do not come up to the level of the guarantee&#x2014;the first &#x00A3;3.50&#x2014;so the hon. Gentleman got it completely wrong. The full offer that has been put on the table by the management of BL would help those 5,000 who at present do not reach that level.</p>

<p>I make one other point in closing. Opposition Members have been free in their criticisms of Sir Michael Edwardes. It is their perfect right to be critical of me. They have concentrated, quite wrongly in some cases, on his salary. What is a little sad is that not one Opposition Member has seen fit to recognise that in the last two and a half years Sir Michael Edwardes and his board have given&#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Of course, as I have said, with the full co-operation of their workers. They have given the company something that it has not had for many years&#x2014;the chance of a real and viable future. That is what we want&#x2014;</p>
