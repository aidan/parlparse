<p>Yes, Sir. I am glad to say that the Anglo-Soviet-Persian Treaty of Alliance, which was approved by the Persian Parliament on Monday, 26th January, was signed in Tehran on behalf of the three Governments on Thursday, 29th January. The Treaty entered into force on signature.<br/>
The large majority by which the Treaty was approved in the Persian Parliament shows that it has gained the free assent of the elected representatives of the Persian nation. It is a justification of

the patience with which the long and sometimes difficult negotiations have been conducted by all concerned. I should like to take this opportunity of extending a cordial welcome to our new Ally. The full text of the Treaty is being laid as a White Paper. Copies will be available to hon. Members to-day. It will be seen that the Treaty provides for the grant of those facilities which the British and Soviet authorities have considered necessary for the prosecution of the war. It covers, for example, the facilities to be provided in Persia for the passage of troops and supplies, for the maintenance and improvement of the means of communication, and for censorship control. I should also like to emphasise, as is explicitly laid down in the Treaty, that His Majesty's Government and the Soviet Government undertake to respect the territorial integrity, sovereignty and political independence of Persia. They have no designs or ambitions which would conflict with this principle.</p>

<p>As my hon. Friend is aware, the Agreement between Greece and Yugoslavia was signed in the Foreign Office on 15th January, and I am glad to have this opportunity of welcoming an Agreement which cements the friendly relations already existing between two Allied Governments and which affords a basis for a future Balkan Confederation. The text


of the Agreement has already been published, and there is nothing that I can add to it.<br/>
The text of the Polish-Czechoslovak Agreement has also been published. In reply to a Question by the hon. Member for East Wolverhampton (Mr. Manner) on 26th November, 1940, the Prime Minister said that His Majesty's Government warmly welcomed the original Polish-Czechoslovak Declaration of 11th November, 1940.

<p>Are we right in thinking that it is the intention of the Governments which honour the Agreement that it shall be open to all other Balkan countries to adhere to it as soon as they have democratic and peace-loving Govern-meats?

<p>Hon. Members will have seen the statement which the Governors of the B.B.C. issued to the public on 26th January. A reorganisation of the B.B.C. necessitated by the war-time expansion of its services has been in progress for some time. In order to facilitate the task of the Governors in carrying out this reorganisation, the late Director-General, Mr. F. W. Ogilvie, placed his resignation in their hands. The Governors accepted it and appointed Sir Cecil Graves and Mr. Robert Foot to discharge the duties of Director-General jointly for the duration of the war.<br/>
I was informed beforehand that this joint appointment would be considered. I felt, however, that this was a matter which the Corporation should decide for themselves and upon which I could offer no advice on behalf of the Government. The relations between the Ministry and the B.B.C. are in no way affected by this change. I should like to pay tribute to the arduous work of the retiring Director-General over a period of four years, during the latter half of which the services of the B.B.C. have developed into a most potent weapon of war. I would only add that I have full confidence in the ability of his two successors to fulfil their onerous task.</p>

<p>The Question has been carefully considered, but it has been found impracticable to name ships after districts which have subscribed certain sums to Government securities, because
<ol>

<li>(<i>a</i>) there are not enough vessels of each type to permit the allocation of a warship of the appropriate size to each town, and to ma ke distinctions would naturally be invidious and undesirable.</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) it is necessary, for administrative reasons, to assign distinctive groups of names to each class of warship;</li>

<p>Non-attendance at school in Jamaica is due not only to social and economic conditions but to inadequate accommodation, and until further accommodation can be provided any extension of the areas in which attendance is already compulsory is inadvisable. A number of steps are being taken to diminish the serious non-attendance factor among children already enrolled, including the framing of proposals for the more effective application of compulsion in the compulsory attendance areas.

<p>The warning given to the Press by the Governor of Nigeria specifically referred to the publication of incorrect and misleading statements. The Governor has special war-time powers under the General Defence Regulations to take action against newspapers publishing such statements when, in view of the present emergency, their publication, in his opinion, is likely to have results which might be inimical to public order. Certain newspapers have, in fact, offended against the Regulations and thus rendered themselves liable to penalties. The Governor has attempted to deal with them by making a personal approach. He reports that this has had no effect, and that he therefore issued a warning in a broadcast speech from Lagos that in future cases action would be taken where necessary under the Regulations.</p>

<p>It is only right that I should say a word on this, in order to call specific attention to an extension being made in the travelling facilities provided for Members of this House. Hon. Members know that the practice has been for several years that travelling facilities&#x2014;either first-class or third-class, as hon. Members may wish&#x2014;are provided for hon. Members between Westminster and their constituencies. At the beginning of the war the natural extension was made to provide travelling facilities for our hon. and gallant colleagues between Westminster and their military stations. That extension was an <i>cjusdem generis</i> of the previous facilities, and it was not thought necessary to bring it further before the House. There has been this year another extension, which I announced in reply to a Question on 4th September, which makes available to hon. and gallant Members travelling facilities between their military stations and their


constituencies. I think it is an extension which will be found agreeable to hon. Members. As a matter of fact, it is impossible to give any estimate of the cost of the extension, but it is obvious that it will be only a very small sum, and it is possible to argue that it will effect an economy. It all depends on whether the military station and the constituency are on the same side of London or not. At present, if a Member is stationed on a different side of London from his constituency, he can get a ticket from his military station to Westminster and then get a ticket from Westminster to his constituency. If his military station is on the same side of London as his constituency, he will have to come up to London from his station, and then go back again to his constituency. Under the new arrangement, that double journey will be avoided. That is why I do not think that the proposal is likely to involve any extra charge.

<p>This expenditure is due to another action by this House, in one of its representative capacities. Most of us belong to the Empire Parliamentary Association. That Association decided during the year to invite delegates of the Dominion Parliaments to visit us. We had the pleasure of receiving delegates from Canada and South Africa. Unfortunately Australia and New Zealand were not able to be represented, owing to the recent extension of the war. In order to defray the expenses of that visit, it is necessary to ask for this Supplementary Vote.</p>

<p>The question of the travelling expenses to and from is a matter which is settled in different ways on different occasions. As hon. Members who are versed in the arrangements of the Empire Parliamentary Association know, it is normal for the entertainment to be provided in the country to which the delegates go, whether this country or the Dominions. Whether in this particular case the payment covered any of the actual travelling outside this country I am not certain, but I can let the hon. Member know. He can rest assured that if it was so, it was because it was considered by the Association very important that these visitors should come. It may be that the Dominions did not have the traveling facilities themselves. Of course, when they come here they are entertained by the Association, which provides travelling and hotel fees and arranges such small social gatherings as may be necessary in order that the delegates may achieve the purpose for which they have come, to maintain contact with this country, and, more especially, with both Houses of Parliament.</p>

<p>This Vote is required because in the main Estimates we did not take any money for this purpose. When the Estimates for the year were being prepared, it was the height of the blitz period, and it did not then seem


likely that much Government hospitality would be required, to judge from what it had been in the previous period when the figure had considerably dropped. Since this is a continuing Fund, there was a sufficient balance to cover what we then thought would be required, if those conditions continued. As hon. Gentlemen know, however, not only did those conditions not continue, but a great number of opportunities arose for His Majesty's Government to offer hospitality to distinguished persons, such as representatives of the Dominions and of Allied Governments and other delegations who came to this country. It is for that purpose that I ask the House to vote this money. I give as an example of the very great pleasure which the Government had in being able to show hospitality in this way and through this Fund, the case of the Prime Ministers of Australia and New Zealand. There is also the case of His Majesty the King of Greece and the members of the Greek Government when they came here, and various other delegations.</p>

<p>This Vote covers two different points. First, there was the decision by His Majesty's Government to give a new, a more important and an independent status to the Agricultural Research Council and, in fact, to bring it up to the status of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and the Medical Research Council. The need for research into many agricultural matters is so great, that if a change of status in that way helps to accomplish what is required, I am sure hon. Gentlemen will not see any objection to it. Those recommendations are being put into effect. One of the results of that is to change the source from which this council has been financed&#x2014;the Development Commissioners have previously found the money&#x2014;and to put it directly upon the Votes. That does not make much difference because, by and large, Parliament finances the Development Commissioners by grants in aid and this is merely putting this particular expenditure on to another Vote. It is a purely technical matter which arises as a result of raising the status of the Council.<br/>
There is also a deficiency in appropriations-in-aid which appears under sub-Head "Z". Under the first sub-Head "M" there is an increase on the original Estimate of &#x00A3;26,000. That additional sum is required in order to meet the growing needs of the Agricultural Research Council for research stations and administrative expenses and research purposes generally. Therefore, what this Vote really means is, first, that we are raising the status of the Agricultural Research Council and we are for the rest of the year giving it a larger sum than had been anticipated in the


main Estimates. In any case, it will be getting those moneys not through the Development Commissioners but directly from the Vote, though that last point, in itself, as I have explained, does not make any real difference.</p>

<p>Of course, there is an enormous number of grants and technically they come under the Department of the Lord President of the Council, as do other scientific grants, and I am merely answering for him at the moment. I do not know whether any of the sum which is dealt with in this Supplementary Estimate is going directly to the colleges. But these are, I understand, largely grants for work done through or by agents of the colleges&#x2014;for instance, the School of Agriculture at Cambridge, the School of Animal Pathology at Cambridge, the Institute of Agricultural Parasitology, grant to Rothamsted, grant to Reading University and many others. I think this is the normal procedure under which the financing of this work is carried out, and if there are any specific or detailed questions on which hon. Members require information, I think it would be more convenient if they were put down at Question time and dealt with by the Minister concerned.</p>

<p>I think it will be clear from what I have said that they come into both. The instances which I quoted to my hon. Friend the Member for Leominster (Sir E.

<p>In view of the growing importance of agricultural development as a result of the war and other causes, is the Minister satisfied that the amount now provided is sufficient to meet all these expanding purposes? I ask this question because, to my knowledge, scientific research generally in this country has been far behind that in other leading countries. That was certainly the case in pre-war days. It is a position which should be rectified and the present may be an opportunity of doing so, as far as agriculture is concerned.</p>

<p>I think it would be for the convenience of the Committee if I gave a brief explanation of this Supplementary Estimate. The first item is an increase in the contribution of His Majesty's Government towards the funds of the International Red Cross. I do not think that it is really necessary to explain to the Committee the very great value of the work which is being done by the Red Cross. It is of the greatest help in the sending of parcels to prisoners of war and facilitating communications between prisoners and residents at home and a great many other works. I am sure that relatives, and this country generally, are under considerable indebtedness to the International Red Cross Society for the work that they have done. This work has to be financed. It is financed in the main by the International Red Cross itself, but there are contributions also from the various belligerent Governments. The cost of this work does not go down but increases all the time. We have decided to give an additional grant of &#x00A3;12,500 towards this work, and I hope that the Committee will not feel that this is wrong.<br/>
The second item is the grant-in-aid towards the relief of distress in. China. Last year His Majesty's Ambassador in Chungking drew the attention of His Majesty's Government to the very great difficulty which the Chinese Red Cross was experiencing from lack of transport; and in answer to a Question by my hon. Friend the Member for Derby (Mr. Noel-Baker), my right hon. Friend said that we were going to give the sum of &#x00A3;50,000 to help the Chinese with their transport difficulties. That sum is being administered by the British Fund for the Relief of Distress in China, in co-operation with a Committee set up for the purpose by His Majesty's Ambassador at Chungking for assisting the distress of British and Chinese nationals. The Friends' Ambulance Unit, incidentally, provides the personnel for ambulances.<br/>
The final item is an anticipated saving on the grant-in-aid to the British Council. I think the Committee generally are agreed that the British Council does very valuable work, and the fact that there is this reduction does not mean that that

work has become any less valuable or that it is any the less appreciated. It is simply that owing to the developments of the war the activities of the British Council in several parts of the world have been reduced, notably in the Balkans, and the reduction of the work in the Balkans has caused the reduction in the Estimate.</p>

<p>The Committee will agree with the hon. Gentleman in paying tribute to the excellent work done by the International Red Cross. He made one remark that intrigued me when he stated that contributions were being made from the various belligerent Governments, and I was wondering what is the basis of contribution.

<p>I am afraid that I cannot tell the hon.

<p>Can my hon.

<p>With regard to the first point of my hon. Friend, the grant in aid is specifically directed towards the relief of the distress of prisoners of war, and I do not think it applies to the question of foodstuffs for Greece. The International Red Cross operates in all occupied countries in Europe. The situation is a little obscure with regard to the Far East. The International Red Cross, as my hon. Friend is aware, operates under the Prisoners of War Convention. The Japanese are signatories to the Convention, but they have never ratified it, and we do not yet know, though we have asked


them, whether they intend to observe it or not. We cannot really tell, until we know this, what the position will be in the Far East as far as the Japanese are concerned. I can assure him that the International Red Cross are very much alive to the importance of the Far East and that they are doing everything they can to regularise the position there.</p>

<p>That, I understand, is a figure which can never be anticipated or estimated with any degree of accuracy. It really depends upon whether farmers who, some years ago, bought farms and obtained advances for the purpose of doing so, have a good year or a bad year. If they have a good year they are apt to pay off the money borrowed before it becomes due.</p>

<p>There are one or two questions which I would like to put to the right hon. Gentleman, in perfectly good faith. Everybody agrees that we need maximum food production, and I think the Department have been doing good work in that direction. In this Estimate we are spending, quite rightly, a good deal of money on research, and I want to ask whether any experiments are taking place, under the aegis of any Department, with what is called hydroponics&#x2014;that is, soilless cultivation. This is a subject to which in these days it is well worth paying some attention. Some time ago I put down one or two Questions to the Department on this subject. My interest in it was first brought about during a crossing of the Pacific, where, at Wake Island, hydroponics has been practised quite successfully, although, of course, the climatic conditions there are much different from those in this country. But in this country quite a number of separate organisations and people have been paying some attention to this matter, and I would like to know from the Minister whether his Department are co-ordinating or collecting the results of these experiments with a view to seeing whether or not intensive production could be brought about during the war.<br/>
Secondly, I want to raise a question which has been causing some concern in


the countryside. I want the Minister to believe me when I say that both sides in the industry are working very well together in trying to obtain maximum food production. I think the Committee would agree that any matter that is likely to cause irritation and any suggestion of hostility ought to receive attention and be removed, if it can be legitimately removed. We have heard, and do hear, especially in war-time, about the need for a prosperous and healthy countryside. Everybody seems to have made up his mind that when this war is over never again will we allow agriculture to go back to the position it was in a few years ago. Quite frankly, I believe that we ought to have, after this war, a healthy and happy countryside and agriculture&#x2014;</p>

<p>I beg your pardon, Colonel Clifton Brown. That was a slip, but we have at the moment a Committee dealing with rural education. This Committee was appointed by the Minister, and on it there are some men and women who will do their best to think out a good system for rural education. Unfortunately, however, the Minister will not allow on that Committee any representative of the organised agricultural workers. The argument, I am told, is that if he allows any such representative to be on the Committee he must then allow representatives of other organised bodies to be on the Committee, but I would point out that at the present time&#x2014;</p>

<p>May I reply to the hon. Gentleman's question about hydroponics? The Agricultural Research Council naturally deal with a very wide range of subjects, and I make it my business to read their proceedings. Speaking from memory, I believe I have seen something about hydroponics lately, but I would not like to be cross-questioned about it at the moment. I will, however, find out and let the hon. Member know.</p>

<p>I see that there is a sum of &#x00A3;133,000 for animal diseases, and I see also that it mainly concerns expenses in connection with foot-and-mouth disease. But important as that disease is, there are others. If this sum covers only foot-and-mouth disease and a little swine fever, I must point out, as the Minister knows, that tuberculosis, Johne's disease and mastitis are very serious diseases of the dairying industry which are causing tremendous losses every year. I know the Minister has a scheme in hand which, owing to certain technical difficulties, cannot for the moment be put into operation, but I hope he will be able to give some assurance that something will be done. Although I do not want to see the sum raised unduly&#x2014;we must all be careful in these times to see that money is not unnecessarily spent&#x2014;I would like to see something more than an expenditure on foot-and-mouth disease.<br/>
As regards the amounts for agricultural research, the increases, I see, come to about &#x00A3;27,000. It is not easy in these times to carry on agricultural research, as the universities and research stations are


having their staffs very much reduced and the younger people are being called up. But I hope this research work will be carried on. The agricultural industry is faced with special problems in war-time which were not present in peace-time, and it is, therefore, important to keep agricultural research going. For instance, the feeding-stuffs given to cattle now are different from what they were in peace time. Much less is imported, and indeed, very little is imported; much more homegrown feeding-stuffs are used, and in my opinion this is much better for the animals. Further research is needed into the values of feeding-stuffs such as silage and the various home-grown things which we are producing. This research work through the Universities and research stations must be continued, and the Committee must not stint the money necessary for this work.<br/>
Under Item H.3, there is a reduction of &#x00A3;5,290 on the National Stud. Does this mean a general reduction in the work which the Ministry have done hitherto in improving livestock? The farming community has been much concerned because it has not been possible to get fees granted from the Ministry, as they were formerly granted in peace time, to various societies which exist for the purpose of sending round stallions to improve the breed of horses. I do not think we can altogether ignore the horse in these days. It is an age of tractors, but even now the horse has enormous value. It is causing considerable concern to the farming community that nothing is now being done to keep alive the breeding of good cart horses. Does this reduction of &#x00A3;5,290 mean that nothing is to be done in this respect?</p>

<p>That is what I wanted to know. I understand the position. In regard to Item J.5, there is a reduction of &#x00A3;90,000 in respect of land drainage grants. Does this mean that work in this respect is decreasing? As a result of the last Agriculture Act, we were glad to think that there were very considerable facilities for farmers to carry out upland drainage and also grants to local catchment boards, and that these would remove the difficulties which there had been hitherto in carrying out all-round

drainage schemes and dealing with waterlogged land. I should like to have some explanations on the points I have raised.</p>

<p>Then I shall have to raise the matter in another way, because it is time it was raised. Diseases in cows are very prevalent indeed, and owing to the poverty of many of the farming community, there is no examination of their cows. The veterinary officers do not attend from one year to the next. Therefore, I want to ask the Minister whether he will schedule tuberculosis as being a liability on the community in such cases, so that herds which are notoriously tubercular can be examined in the public interest</p>

<p>With regard to agricultural research, I understand that generous grants are being made to the various agricultural schools at Cambridge and also to Rothamsted and Fareham. I should like to have an assurance that the results of the activities of these various bodies are co-ordinated and that there is not overlapping in the research work which they are doing. I do not think it is possible to lay too great emphasis upon the value of agricultural research. Recently we have been told of the value of vitamins in order that we may get the greatest possible value out of the food we consume. Similar studies in regard to the values of foods which plants can absorb from the soil and the air are essential. To my mind, it is no good getting theoretical results from research unless


those results can be practically applied. I understand that in various parts of the country the Ministry have established experimental farms where these results can be practically applied, and if that be the case, I should think it is the most valuable asset which the Ministry could present to agriculture at the present time.</p>

<p>With regard to the Item concerning the exportation of pedigree stock, there is an expenditure of &#x00A3;900 in connection with the upkeep of the quarantine station at Glasgow. I am not quite clear what the &#x00A3;900 means, and I should be glad if the Minister would explain it.</p>

<p>The answer to the hon. Member for West Perth (Mr. Snadden) is that the &#x00A3;900 refers to the Ministry's contribution towards the expenses of the quarantine station at Glasgow, although I am not certain at the moment of the period of time which this Item covers. My hon. Friend the Member for the Forest of Dean (Mr. Price) referred to diseases of animals&#x2014;Johne's disease and tuberculosis&#x2014;and I need hardly say that that is a matter which is receiving active consideration constantly. The amount of money that is made available for research into diseases of animals generally is being increased rather than decreased all the time.<br/>
The second question related to G.4, Agricultural Research Expenses. It is obvious to anyone that this Supplementary Estimate has been increased, but, in spite of the continued increase to the Treasury, I think that the value to agriculture has also been increased. Next comes the question of the National Stud. This matter can be explained away in a few sentences. The National Stud bred two beautiful racehorses which were leased to His Majesty. They both won many races and added materially to the Exchequer. Some of the other horses were sold for good prices, and I am hopeful that we shall be as fortunate again this year. My hon. Friend the Member for Consett (Mr. David Adams) referred to milk. That question is certainly worth consideration. He will remember, of course, that all milk premiums paid to farmers are intended to assist in clearing up tuberculosis and other diseases. It is a slow process, which I should like to see

expedited, and I can assure my hon. Friend that no efforts will be spared in trying to safeguard the health of children and others.</p>

<p>That matter hardly comes within the scope of this Supplementary Estimate. As my hon. Friend knows, the cost of examination is borne jointly between two bodies, but it is rather a big question, and one can hardly deal with the whole field of animal diseases on this Vote. Agricultural research is co-ordinated by the Agricultural Research Council. Unfortunately, in the past there has been too long a gap between discovery and translation of discovery to the farmer. My right hon. Friend has recently set up an Agricultural Improvement Council, whose duty it is to see that as rapidly as possible the discoveries of scientists are handed on to the farmers. I am convinced that the revision which has taken place will be of inestimable value to agriculture, and that it will ensure that agriculture derives the maximum benefit from the researches of the "backroom boys" of agriculture.</p>

<p>The apparent saving of &#x00A3;90,000 was due to certain schemes which had to be approved by the Department.

<p>It would save considerable trouble and unnecessary repetition if I explained at this stage that the next six Votes are purely technical Votes, required owing to our accountancy procedure. They have little or nothing to do with the Departments concerned. Ever since 1894 the Annual Appropriation Acts have set specific limits to the Appropriations-in-Aid for each of the Votes. These limits are the amount shown in each of the Estimates under the headings of Appropriations-in-Aid. Of course, in the case of these War Services and Unclassified Services, where we deal in the region of &#x00A3;100 and &#x00A3;10 token Votes, it is quite clear, unless we came and asked for further permission to use Appropriations-in-Aid, that the Department concerned would have to surrender to the Exchequer all sums over &#x00A3;100 and &#x00A3;10. As I say, a &#x00A3;10 Vote is only to be taken as a token Vote. The result would be most inconvenient, since it would mean that you would be unnecessarily swelling both the Exchequer and Budget accounts, because you would have to pour in the large sums which, under present circumstances, are received as Appropriations-in-Aid.<br/>
The more sensible thing to do is for the Department concerned to use what it gets from various sources under these Services as its own Appropriations-in-Aid, and use them as a set-off for its own expenditure. These figures cannot be estimated early in the year, because one does not know the region they will reach. Hon. Members can see that the Appropriations differ very much&#x2014;one is for &#x00A3;10, one for &#x00A3;3,500,000 and one for &#x00A3;7,000,000. It is to deal with that purely technical point that I rise to make this explanation to the Committee. I am sure Ministers of the Departments concerned will be prepared to answer any questions, but we must bear in mind that these matters are confidential because they deal with war supplies. I think with that explanation I may have put at rest any anxieties hon.

Members may have that there is something strange in this procedure.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 1, line 11, after "business," to insert:
<q>or on offer to let for any of these purposes.</q>
The reason for this Amendment is that it should give power to disclaim on requisitioning on the part of leaseholders who have temporarily vacated their premises, a right which is possessed now by occupying tenants. Unless this is altered, it appears to me that another injustice will be added to the very many which are suffered by leaseholders who have had to vacate their premises, owing possibly to enemy action or police advice or sickness, or perhaps for urgent family reasons. In most of these cases they would rather have remained in their premises, but they have been compelled to vacate them, and it seems a little unfair that the benefits of


the Bill, which are really rather considerable, should apply only to those in occupation of their premises. It may be said that if the premises are empty, they need not trouble about the requisitioning, but there is always a financial loss where property is requisitioned, the unfortunate leaseholder is not able to sublet it and must continue to hold it as long as the Government remains in possession, and he cannot enter into possession of the property again while it is requisitioned. For all those reasons I think the case is on all fours with that of an occupying tenant.</p>

<p>I should like to support the Amendment. My hon. Friend has put the matter very clearly. The Amendment appears fair, just and equitable. It seems to me extraordinary that a tenant who is not in possession should be put in a disadvantageous position as compared with a tenant in possession. It may well be that a tenant who is out of possession had to leave the premises for some reason connected with the war, something beyond his control. It may well be that the Government will retain possession for a very considerable time&#x2014;and the tenant not in possession will have the lease hanging like a mill-stone around his neck, whereas the tenant in possession will be free to disclaim. We do not know how long the war will last&#x2014;and I feel that Parliament should do everything it can to protect and help people who have suffered by it. It is not always possible to protect everyone but we should do everything we can when opportunity offers. I feel that when it is possible we should do this, and this, in my opinion, is a fair case. I therefore ask the right hon. and learned Gentleman to adopt this Amendment, or an Amendment that will do something similar in substance and spirit. In these words I beg to support my hon. Friend.</p>

<p>I am sorry that we cannot accept the Amendment. This Clause deals only with the case where premises have been requisitioned, and it follows the lines of the report made by Mr. Morris, who investigated this question. We have to hold the scales evenly and fairly, as far as we can, between landlord and tenant. Landlords are not all rich people who need not be considered. The landlords

have given voice to some complaints about this matter for the following reason: We are giving the tenant an option, and he will exercise it only where it suits him. Where premises have been requisitioned, they may be, for instance, on the East or South-East coast, where they have gone down considerably in value, or they may be in the suburbs of London, where they have gone up in value. In some cases the tenant will make a good thing out of the requisition, because he will get from the occupying Department more than he is paying to his landlord. In other cases he will do badly for he will get less than he is paying to his landlord. The grievance of the landlords is that the tenant will always exercise the option in cases where it is to his advantage and not in the other cases, and the landlord will be left with the latter cases.<br/>
We have, following Mr. Morris's advice, limited this matter to a strict class of case; that is to say, we have dealt only with cases where tenants are in actual occupation. Short leases where the tenants are in actual occupation seem to us to be cases of special hardship, and we think it right to deal with those cases. If, however, we once go round that and open the door wide and depart from Mr. Morris's recommendation, all the landlords will be saying that this Bill is a monstrous injustice. That is why we do not think it proper to go beyond the narrow limits to which we have deliberately confined the Bill.</p>

This proposal should be of real service.

<p>I beg to bring before the House a subject to which I have addressed myself by Question in this House and in other ways for a considerable time. I refer to the permitted allowance of imports of geneva or gin into the Gold Coast, and to the Ordinances connected therewith. In the decade following the close of the Great War, there was a vast increase in the importations of liquor into West Africa generally. In


particular, gin importations from 1919 to 1926, seven years, grew by no less an amount than 716 per cent. This general increase of gin imports was particularly large in the Gold Coast where, in 1926, the percentage of imports of gin to all other imports of spirits was no less than 91.34.<br/>
The resultant degradation and misery among the native population came to be generally admitted. When Lord Passfield was Secretary of State for the Colonies, an Ordinance came into operation, after long investigation, a special Commission having sat on the subject, in the beginning of 1931. Under that Ordinance there was to be a gradual decrease of the amount that could be imported, by 10 per cent. each year, until the quantity of geneva or gin was completely eliminated by 1940. While those who had at heart the interests of the natives in this regard were waiting for this promised time, an Ordinance was passed by the Governor of the Gold Coast entirely departing from the old Ordinance, and this was followed in December, 1939, by a Proclamation of the Governor permitting the importation of 150,000 Imperial gallons into the Gold Coast during 1940.<br/>
It was pointed out by deputations, and by other people interested in this matter, that this was a very large amount, especially when it had been expected that the traffic would come to an end. We are grateful to the Ministry and to the Under-Secretary of State, but it was represented to the Governor that he might reopen the question. At any rate, the Under-Secretary of State was able to announce on 5th February, 1941, a year ago, that the quota for 1941 for civilian requirements in the Gold Coast was being fixed at 73,500 gallons. In fixing the former figure of 150,000 gallons, regard had been had particularly to what had been allowed, and admitted in 1937, the highest year of the nine years, and the only year in which the amount consumed exceeded the amount allowed.<br/>
In fixing 73,500 gallons an average was taken over the previous nine years, although regard was not had to the fact that in the last of those nine years the amount imported and consumed had fallen as low as 22,332 gallons. If those responsible took the average importation for the nine years, why should they not

now take the average of the two years of the new r&#x00E9;gime? That would give an allowance, as far as I have the figures, of 8,217 gallons, as the average imported for 1940 and 1941, the amount fixed being about nine times that amount. When the former figure of 150,000 gallons, which however has passed out of our view was fixed, the consumption for that year&#x2014;1940&#x2014;was 7,934, and the quota fixed was 19 times that amount. Why are they retaining these inflated figures? Why not take the average of what has been coming in, adding slightly to it perhaps for contingencies? I hope I am doing no injustice in suggesting it, but it seems almost as if a wide open door is being kept for the trade after the war in maintaining the figure at 73,500 gallons when the actual importation is 7,934 gallons in 1940, that for 1941 being some 8,000.<br/>
The Government give two reasons for departing from the former policy. The first reason is that if they carried out the policy of the prohibition of the import of gin, it would be likely to result in a further growth of illicit distillation. The fear of illicit distillation has been brought forward whenever there has been a demand for some drastic restriction on the liquor traffic whether at home or abroad, but we are still left without proof that this illicit distillation has grown on the Gold Coast, or would grow to any extent, as a result of such restriction. I attach considerable importance to the view of those on the spot, and particularly to the mission stations and to the governors of missions in those parts. The secretary of the Scottish Mission of the Church of Scotland in the Gold Coast Colony, writing to me from Accra on 28th May last said this:
<q>There has been illicit distillation, although actually, at the moment so far as is known to me, it is less prevalent than it was two or three years ago. The Government, however, bring out this bogy of illicit distillation as an excuse for increasing the quota of gin imported. It is even stated in the 'Gazette,' where the object of the new legislation is fully set down, that this was designed to prevent an increase in illicit distillation, but there is however no proof at all that there has been any such increase; and indeed one of the Governor's own publications states as much.</q>
The second reason is that the chiefs are now against prohibition and that the unofficial members of the Legislative Council, both European and African, are in favour of the new Ordinance. The


latter are elected from provincial councils which, themselves, consist of chiefs representing various native states on the Gold Coast. I believe that is the case, and I am not going to question the representative character of those who have so determined; but I am of opinion that those bodies of chiefs, the legislative councils and others, are subject to changes of policy just as much as political leaders in this country; and that their doctrines, there as here, are often fashioned to the varying hour. At least some of those who support the new Ordinance have spoken strongly against the evils of this traffic, and have declared themselves as much opposed to gin as to geneva. I am not very well versed in these distinctions between geneva and gin, but I understand that geneva is gin manufactured in a pot-still instead of in a patent-still. But going back to the days of Lord Passfield, when the chiefs asked, in the first instance, for the exclusion of geneva, I think I am right in saying that Lord Passfield insisted that the same restrictions should, in fairness, be put upon gin as upon geneva. He also recognised at the time that it was the wish of the Government and of the people of the Gold Coast that gin as well as geneva should not be allowed to enter.<br/>
May I quote what was said by a paramount chief of the Gold Coast, Sir Oforio Atta, when addressing the West African section of the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce on 17th July, 1928. He said:
<q>Imports of gin had become a serious menace to the prosperity of his people; if the African was to become the right type of man and useful to the Empire, let the export of gin from this country be stopped. If this country stopped, Holland would stop too.</q>
I would like to ask whether these spirits, gin or geneva, have lost their potency in any way, that there should be such a Change of policy? I want to make it quite clear that I am making no general accusation of drunkenness amongst the natives of the Gold Coast, but there are great excesses in connection with certain customs of that country and particularly in connection with funeral Customs. On the 28th March, 1928, the Bishop of Accra wrote in the "Times" describing his observations of those funeral Customs in a village and he said:
<q>For a week at a time every man and woman and not a few children are drunk, some of them in a torpid and some in a raving condition.</q>

That is a good way back, but I wanted to give this testimony as near as I could get to the present time, and we have no testimony of the kind during these war years. But the Rev. Kenneth Horne, a Methodist minister in the Gold Coast, and now secretary of the Christian Council of the Gold Coast, speaking in London on 21st October, 1935, said:
<q>Drunkenness is not now so common but that at funerals a large amount of liquor is consumed, resulting in much demoralisation and debauchery.</q>
These funeral ceremonies sometimes go on to the eighth day after the decease and sometimes to the fourteenth or later days. The chiefs have sought, from time to time, to remedy matters, but, so far, with little result. One way in which they tried to remedy it was to prescribe that amounts spent on spirits should not be more than one-third of the total expenditure on the funeral. Another way was by drawing up schedules limiting expenditure according to the rank of the deceased.<br/>
Thus, for the death of a paramount chief, they were allowed to spend from &#x00A3;150 to &#x00A3;200; for the death of a divisional chief, &#x00A3;25; for the death of common persons, &#x00A3;5 to &#x00A3;10; and a labourer was rated from &#x00A3;2 10s. to &#x00A3;6. How much of this quota which the Minister allows is being devoted to the upkeep of these Customs? Would it not be possible for him, along with the chiefs, who have asked, time and again, for the restriction of these practices, to bring about a better state of things? The other occasion on which much liquor is consumed is in connection with the installation and deposition of chiefs. When a chief rises to what we would call Cabinet rank there are great rejoicings, accompanied by much drinking. Also at the deposition of a chief, when he loses his rank, there are similar jollifications and excesses. We can think of what jollifications there might be if some of our Cabinet were to lose their rank.<br/>
How is this matter related to the general policy of the Government? I would pay a tribute to the high ideals that have always inspired the Colonial Office of this country. I refer particularly to the Colonial Development Act of 1929, whereby the spending of up to &#x00A3;1,000,000 a year on colonial development is allowed.</p>

<p>I thank my hon. Friend. It was &#x00A3;1,000,000 in the original Act. I am glad to know that, and what he says still further emphasises my point. In the eleventh and final report of the Colonial Development Advisory Committee, I find that &#x00A3;8,870,000 was spent in the years covered by the first eleven reports. The objects for which these advances were to be made were these:
<q>The aiding and development of agriculture and industry in their territories, and the promotion thereby of commerce with, and industry in, the United Kingdom.</q>
Traffic in gin is not really commerce, nor does it aid industry. The word "trade" is a misnomer, and has been a misnomer in the past in this regard. When the slave traffic existed in this country it proudly bore the name "the trade"; and it was justly said at the time that it was war and not trade. There is a trade in this country which we euphemistically or ironically sometimes call "the trade"; and we might say of it that oft-time it has been more war than trade. As regards policy, I was greatly interested in Lord Moyne's despatch on 5th June last on "Certain Aspects of Colonial Policy in War-time." He said this:
<q>The low standards of living of vast populations throughout the Colonial Empire was distressing.</q>
He further said:
<q>It is an imperative duty to do all that is practically possible to raise the standard of living of such people, even during the war period, alike for humanitarian, political, economic and administrative reasons.</q>
I would say that the quantity of gin imported is in inverse ratio to what you will do in the fulfilment of these high ideals. I would call the attention of this House to the high ideals it has always expressed on this subject. At the end of every war there has been a movement to bring to an end, or greatly restrict, this deluging of the natives of various countries with liquor, be it gin or geneva, or any other form. It is interesting to know that at the close of the Boer War Lord Milner, in promulgating an Ordinance prohibiting, under severe penalties, the supply of liquor to natives in the Transvaal and the Orange River Colonies said:
<q>There is no doubt that the new Administration has before it a severe struggle with

one of the most powerful, as it is one of the most degraded, agencies for making money by the corruption of one's fellow-creatures.</q>
And again, after alluding to the great difficulty of making the law effective, he made use of the following striking words:
<q>The whole credit of this Administration is at stake in the matter, and I feel confident that His Majesty's Government will support us in the view that no effort and no expense should be spared in carrying out a policy which, if successful, will mean a tremendous triumph for civilisation in this part of the world.</q>
So, at the end of the last war the right hon. Walter Long, M.P.&#x2014;whom no one could accuse of being over-prejudiced in favour of the temperance cause, or in favour of prohibition&#x2014;as Secretary of State for the Colonies immediately after the Armistice, on 28th December, 1918, declared:
<q>It will be my duty to advise the representatives of the British Government at the Peace Conference to take steps on their own initiative for the abolition of the liquor traffic in West Africa. We ought to put an end to it, for it certainly has been conducive to great evil and great misfortune.</q>
Again, I ask, have these liquors lost their potency, that a much different attitude is now being taken up from the attitude taken by statesmen like the late Walter Long?<br/>
And we must never forget as entirely relevant, and still binding, the exacting doctrine of trusteeship. That doctrine was never better stated than by the Duke of Devonshire as Colonial Secretary, in his historic memorandum on "Indians in Kenya." He gave it as the considered and definite opinion of His Majesty's Government that:
<q>The interests of the African natives must be paramount and must prevail.</q>
He added these words:
<q>His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African population, and they are unable to delegate or share that trust, the object of which may be defined as the protection and advancement of the native races.</q>
I trust that the Noble Lord who is now Secretary of State for the Colonies, and the Under-Secretary will seek to give embodiment to these words, and that the interests of the natives will be paramount, and their advancement and protection the supreme consideration. Let us not forget this high doctrine of trusteeship. Let us not degrade, let us not exploit the natives, but purify and uplift them in all


these matters in their forward march to self-government, and in their upward and onward march, as we trust, towards a higher, purer and better life.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend has waited very patiently for this opportunity of raising a matter in which he is very interested. He has made a speech, as he usually does, of very great eloquence and force. I, like a number of my hon. Friends, have listened with a good deal of pleasure to the speeches of my hon. Friend in the past. There was one thing lacking in his speech to-day. We are always very pleased to hear his quotations from his national poet, but today he did not bring him in to support this request for the suppression of liquor in West Africa.</p>

<p>I should be very sorry to interrupt my hon. Friend or to hold him back in what he was about to say, but I am very jealous for the good name of my national poet. As a matter of fact, he tells about the good resolutions which he made and which, he says,
<q>were three times over upset by the savage hospitality of the tavern.</q>
There is a "savage hospitality" of importation as well as of the tavern. The other thing that he said, in his Commonplace Book was that he adjured:
<q>All who in after time shall ever light upon his pages, by a devil's dear-bought experience, to shun his example in this regard.</q></p>

<p>I am very pleased that I have drawn my hon. Friend into that quotation. I am glad that he made no charge of drunkenness against the people of the Gold Coast. When one discusses this question of the importation of liquor, the general public are inclined to think that there is a good deal of drunkenness or debauchery among the natives of West Africa. My hon. Friend has rightly said that there is no truth in that. When commenting on the recommendation of the local commission of inquiry regarding the consumption of spirits in the Gold Coast&#x2014;which was referred to by my hon. Friend&#x2014;the then Secretary of State, Lord Passfield, said that he felt greatly impressed by the diversity of views recorded by the various witnesses, more particularly as to the prevalence of drunkenness. It seems to be generally agreed that the natives of the Gold Coast are not

drunkards, although on occasions which were described by my hon. Friend they are liable to drink spirits to excess. Lord Passfield called special attention to the evidence of some of the witnesses, especially Mr. McKay, a member on the Gold Coast Bar and of the Legislative Council. Mr. McKay said:
<q>I have always been strongly impressed with the general sobriety of the people of this country. There are occasions no doubt, when a considerable quantity of alcohol is consumed, but at those celebrations which I have attended I have not seen the wild orgies which are alleged to take place at them. There was much noise and excitement, which is natural to the people, and which might be mistaken for drunkenness.</q>
The commission themselves said:
<q>The general impression of the witnesses is that the people of this Colony are temperate, that there is very little drunkenness, and that the situation is better in this respect than before the war.</q>
That means, before 1914. If the evidence of these witnesses is to be trusted, a good deal of the agitation about the bad effect of the consumption of spirits loses its force. But one should point out that, as I have already mentioned, at these funeral Customs and other ceremonial occasions, a good deal of spirit has been drunk. It is difficult for the Government to deal with many of these native Customs. Ceremonial drinking includes libation, which, to many people, is worse than drinking, because instead of being drunk, the spirit is poured on the ground. The funeral Customs are a deep-rooted tradition on the Gold Coast, which appears to go back before ale importation of any spirit at all, when palm wine and other native drinks were used for the purpose. The idea seems to be the payment of honour to the dead.</p>

<p>I have never seen drink purposely poured on the ground in this country for any purpose at all. The basis of the speech of my hon. Friend deals with conditions which existed before 1930. I hope to show that there has been a considerable improvement since that date. I agree with my hon. Friend that in 1926&#x2013;27 a good deal of spirits was drunk. The major portion of the spirits imported or drunk then consisted of gin. A Committee was appointed in 1928, and that


Committee went fully into these customs, and made very strong recommendations as to how much of this excessive drinking at these customs could be reduced. They recommended an amendment of the Liquor Licence (Spirits) Ordinance, and this amendment came into effect in 1929. Until 1929, the licensing law of the Gold Coast was substantially the same as when the spirit licences were first introduced, except for the increase made from time to time in the rates of duties paid for licences. Clauses inserted in the amending Ordinance provided for the publication of applications for the issue of new licences and for the lodging of objections thereto. The further amendments which came into force on 1st January, 1929, were of a more drastic nature. The duty payable for the ordinary retail licence to sell spirits, which had hitherto been &#x00A3;40 per annum in towns to which the Town Councils Ordinance extended and &#x00A3;20 elsewhere, was in both cases substantially increased, and the hours of sale were reduced from 15 to eight per day, and confined to hours between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. As my hon. Friend knows, from reading the report of the Commission, the drink obtained for these ceremonials was obtained very largely by indebtedness. On the death of a member of a family, the family came together and decided how much money was to be spent on the celebration. Each member of the family pledged himself to regard it as a debt of the family, the debt being divided between the members. In almost every case, the drink was obtained on credit.</p>

<p>That I cannot say. Anyhow, that did not account for the celebration at his passing. The right of obtaining drink on credit was abolished as a result of this Ordinance, and in one year, from 1929 to 1930, the number of licences was reduced from 3,245 to 1,547, a reduction almost entirely as the result of the legislation based upon the recommendation of the Newlands Committee. There was a reduction of 52 per cent. in the number of licences issued. It is interesting to note the reduction in the importation of spirits, including gin, into the Gold Coast. My hon. Friend rightly said that in 1927 the total imports of spirit was 1,312,000 gallons, which included 1,181,000 gallons of gin. In 1928 the import of spirit

was 1,185,000 gallons, and there again the amount of gin was well over 1,000,000 gallons. Compare the change as a result of the improvement of the new Ordinance. In 1929 the import of spirits was reduced to 736,000 gallons and we could see the downward trend in imports of gin.<br/>
I do not want to weary the House with too many figures but it is very interesting to note that, from 1929 to 1936, the total import of spirits is down to 181,000 gallons. The percentage of gin at that time was 64.2. In 1938 the total import of all spirits amounted to 107,000 gallons, whereas the importation of gin was 49,000 gallons, or 46 per cent. of the total import. In 1939, the total import of spirit was 81,000 gallons and the total import of gin 22,000 gallons, or 27 per cent. In 1940, which are the latest figures, the total import of spirits was down to 45,000 gallons and the import of gin to 7,900 gallons, or 17.3 per cent. of the total import of spirits. From 1929, taking no account of the very bad years referred to by my hon. Friend of 1926&#x2013;27, when the importation of spirits was up to 1,300,000 gallons, the proportion of gin to the total import of spirit had been reduced from 77.3 per cent. to 17.3 per cent. so that it cannot be said that there has not been any improvement as a result of the agitation which took place from 1927 to 1930.<br/>
My hon. Friend referred to a change of policy which had taken place as compared with 1930. It is true that there was a good deal of agitation against the importation of Geneva and not so much against the importation of, gin. As my hon. Friend rightly said, "geneva" is a term to denote gin manufactured in a pot still, and gin is manufactured in a patent still. What the difference in taste really is, I am not competent to judge, but it is very evident that the complaint and the cause of the difficulty prior to 1930 in the Gold Coast was the question of geneva. There was an agitation for a complete prohibition of geneva. The then Secretary of State said he could not distinguish as between geneva and gin, but there was a very strong recommendation from the Gold Coast by the Governor and by members of the Legislative Council that there should be a prohibition of the importation of gin and geneva by a reduction of 10 per cent. each year for 10 years, completely prohibiting the importation of gin and geneva by 1940&#x2013;41.<br/>
It is surprising how those who advocated the total prohibition of gin and geneva in 10 years changed when they saw that there was the possibility of its prohibition coming into operation. My hon. Friend referred to Sir Ofori Atta, who was the leading protagonist in connection with the prohibition of the importation of geneva and who, as a result of his efforts, certainly stirred up a good deal of feeling in respect of this matter. But, in 1935 the Governor expressed his opinion that the policy embodied in the 1931 Ordinance should be reconsidered in a year's time. He himself sent questionnaires which were submitted to native councils, and as a result of these, it was disclosed that a large majority of the State Councils favoured the repeal of the Ordinance. One of the paramount chiefs, the one to whom I have already referred, himself supported a motion for a further investigation into liquor restriction. He with other provincial members of the Legislative Council and members of the Executive Council were fully consulted prior to the enactment of the new Ordinance in 1939, and, with one exception, favoured the continued importation of gin, and that one exception was a member who objected because he wanted legalisation of what is now illicit distillation. Not only the Legislative Council and the chiefs, but the Press of the Gold Coast, who are usually very vocal in voicing opposition to any legislation which the Government may enact if they feel that it is against the wishes and desires of the people of the Colony, in fact every newspaper in the Gold Coast, supported the change which was brought about as a result of this new Ordinance.<br/>
The present position is that the new Ordinance provides for the fixing of a quota by the Governor to be approved by the Secretary of State for a period of three years, and at the end of three years the whole question will be the subject of further review. As far as we can see as a result of the legislation based upon the recommendation of the New-lands Committee, there is a substantial reduction in the importation and in the consumption of liquor. This is so much

so, that we are inclined to think that it is very much better to bring about the reduction in the consumption of liquor in the way that is being done in the Gold Coast at the present time, and that is, by an improvement in education. The inconsistency of the case of my hon. Friend is that he wants to prohibit the importation of gin only; he is prepared to allow all other spirits to be imported.</p>

<p>Well, the case which was submitted not only to my Noble Friend but to his predecessor, the late Lord Lloyd, was based entirely on what was regarded as a change of policy in relation to this question of gin. No suggestion has been made that there should be a total prohibition of spirits, even into the Gold Coast, and as far as other West African colonies are concerned, no suggestion has been made that the supply of gin should be interfered with in any way whatsoever.</p>

<p>I apologise for interrupting a second time, but the difficulty at home and abroad is that the white man insists upon having his liquor and, therefore, it becomes impossible, or a matter of great difficulty, in India or Africa to prohibit gin to the native while the white man insists that whisky, brandy and other drinks should go into these countries. It was not for lack of will but for lack of power that I did not ask for the prohibition of these liquors also.</p>

<p>I can assure my hon. Friend that if he studies the figures I have put before the House he will see that the percentage of gin imported into the Gold Coast has dropped from 77 per cent. to 17 per cent. I do not think the distribution of 70,000 gallons of gin among the total population of the Gold Coast will give rise to very much insobriety among those people. However, I want to assure him again that this matter will be reviewed at the end of the next three years, when the term of the Ordinance comes to its conclusion.</p>
