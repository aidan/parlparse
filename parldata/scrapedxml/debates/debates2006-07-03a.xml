<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-07-03a.543.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1432" speakername="Brian Iddon" colnum="543"  time="017:06:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060703/debtext/60703-0724.htm#06070310000662">
	<p pid="a.543.1/1">It is important that we are having this debate on an Estimates day. The subject is complex. The report from the Science and Technology Committee contains many chapters and much material that needs to be debated, and in the short time available today we shall not be able to do it justice. Let me say to the Minister that I hope this will be the first of many debates on the subject before we change the legislation, as we must.</p>
	<p pid="a.543.1/2">When we embarked on the debate, I hoped that it would not be hijacked by the abortion issue. That is not because I do not consider the issue important. The Committee deliberately avoided debating it, however, because it had been debated so often in Government time on the Floor of the House and elsewhere in the Palace of Westminster. I rather hoped that today we would concentrate on other issues, which are not aired as frequently as they should be.</p>
	<p pid="a.543.1/3">I regard my membership of the Select Committee as one of the most important duties that I perform in this place on behalf of my constituents. The Committee's members believe that they have influenced Government thinking in a number of policy areas, and have also influenced organisations outside the House. A number of debates are taking place at present, of which this is only one.</p>
	<p pid="a.543.1/4">During my time in the Committee disagreement has been rare, but the fifth report of the 2004-05 Session was an exception. It resulted in the eighth special report of that Session, which makes it clear that five of the 11 Committee members disagreed with the publication of the fifth report. That probably reflects the divided views of Members across the House, which is why we are given free votes on most of these difficult issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.543.1/5">After a lengthy inquiry and prolonged discussions, the Committee met again on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-14">14 March</phrase> last year, faced with 130 further amendments to an already amended report. It was clear to me then that the report would not see the light of day, especially as we knew that Parliament was shortly to be dissolved. A great deal of effort had gone into compiling the report. It had also cost a lot of money, particularly because of visits to Stockholm and Rome&mdash;including a visit to the health ministry at the Vatican&mdash;and to clinics in various parts of this country. We collected a large amount of evidence, and the inquiry lasted for an entire year. If the report had dropped out of sight, it would have been costly for Parliament, and it would have been a shame in the context of today's debate. Therefore, I did an unusual thing in a Select Committee: I moved a guillotine. That caused quite a rumpus. On that day, the meeting began at 3.30 in the afternoon and the guillotine was for 8.30 in the evening. Even though it upset some of my colleagues on the Committee, I do not regret taking that action, because if we had not taken it, we would not be having the debate on this important report this afternoon.</p>
	<p pid="a.543.1/6">Our report states:</p>
	<p pid="a.543.1/7" class="indent">&quot;the evidence suggests that the scale of intrusion into the private choices of individuals seeking to have a family can no longer be justified. We do, however, accept that the research uses of the embryo of the human species remain a legitimate interest of the State.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.543.1/8">Other members of the Committee felt that that was too liberal a statement and they moved an amendment against the libertarian approach of certain members of the Committee, but the majority prevailed and the report was published.</p>
	<p pid="a.543.1/9">I accept that these issues are difficult to grasp and even more difficult to legislate for, but it is now generally accepted that the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 is in need of review and I believe that our report forms an excellent platform for that review to take place. As in many other areas, advances in technology in this field are racing ahead of our ability to consider reform of existing legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.543.1/10">As I have said, the Committee deliberately excluded abortion from its inquiry and it excluded surrogacy, too. I want to touch on one or two aspects in the report. On the status of the embryo, we agreed with the Warnock view that embryos should have special status. As the present Chairman of the Committee has pointed out, we took the &quot;gradualist approach&quot; that a human being is not created at the point of natural fertilisation but emerges gradually towards birth. However, we respect the 14-day rule that allows research to be carried out on an embryo during the period before the primitive streak emerges, which is the first sign that the nervous system, the spinal cord and the brain are beginning to develop. It is my personal view that no change to the law should be made in that respect, although there are arguments being advanced both to reduce that 14-day limit and to increase it to20 days, or even beyond that. Baroness Warnock has admitted that that time scale of 14 days is &quot;arbitrary&quot; and it is based on the reasoning that I have already given.</p>
	<p pid="a.543.1/11">The 1990 Act defines an embryo in section 1(1) as:</p>
	<p pid="a.543.1/12" class="indent">&quot;a live human embryo where fertilisation is complete&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.543.1/13">which includes</p>
	<p pid="a.543.1/14" class="indent">&quot;an egg in the process of fertilisation&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.543.1/15">The term &quot;gamete&quot; covers live human eggs or sperm, but not eggs in the process of fertilisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.543.1/16">Today, that definition is inadequate because artificially created gametes can be produced and embryos can be created through the process of cell nuclear replacement, or cloning, the process used to give birth to Dolly the sheep at the Roslin institute nearly 10 years ago. Our Committee believes that attempts to define an embryo in any new Act would be counter-productive because it would lead to legal challenges, as the definition of the embryo in the present Act has led to legal challenges.</p>
	<p pid="a.543.1/17">On sex selection, I agree with the majority of our report's recommendations, but not all. I spoke against sex selection for nonmedical reasons&mdash;Members have used the phrase &quot;for social reasons&quot;&mdash;either by sperm sorting or by pre-implantation genetic diagnosis. However, for the avoidance of sex-related disorders, I do support sex selection.</p>
	<p pid="a.543.1/18">Some communities value boys more than girls; India and China are examples. I believe sex selection to be discriminatory and that it should not be sanctioned in this country. The policy of the two countries that I mentioned has serious demographic consequences. However, I recognise that there are arguments for family balancing, especially when a mother has given birth to a significant number of children of the same sex. Alan and Louise Masterton, who have four sons, lost their three-year-old daughter Nicole in 1999 in a domestic accident and campaigned for the right to rebuild their family with a daughter. If families cannot achieve what they want in this country, they will probably go abroad to achieve their ends. That applies to other areas of this debate as well as sex selection, but I have no ready answers to &quot;reproductive tourism&quot;. We have to face the fact that if people cannot get what they want in this country and it is legally available in other countries, they will go there to have that treatment, possibly under less safe conditions than would apply in this country.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-07-03a.562.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1656" speakername="Emily Thornberry" colnum="562"  time="018:19:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060703/debtext/60703-0726.htm#06070315000181">
	<p pid="a.562.5/1">Yes. Women who have abortions late are very young, or women going through the menopause, women who do not speak English, women who come across the one fifth of GPs who say they are broadly anti-abortion, women who have had difficulty accessing services and women who are scared, ill educated or marginalised. It is those people who are confronted with such a decision and who, with the assistance and support of medical services, make that extremely difficult decision. It is for them and not for the hon. Gentleman to make that decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.562.5/2">There have not been any dramatic scientific breakthroughs in recent years. The survival rates are still very low for foetuses aborted before 24 weeks, and those that do survive frequently survive with severe disabilities. Last June, doctors at the annual conference of the British Medical Association overwhelmingly rejected a motion calling for the upper limit to be cut from 24 to 20 weeks&mdash;77 per cent. of doctors voted against it.</p>
	<p pid="a.562.5/3">The spark that has reignited the debate on time limits is not medical advances, but the beautiful and highly emotive 4D images of foetuses offered by Professor Campbell in his private London clinic. Foetuses can be seen opening their eyes, kicking their legs and sucking their thumbs, but as Allan Templeton, the secretary of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has said, the images add little to the science. If we want a debate about the science, let us talk about the science. He says:</p>
	<p pid="a.562.5/4" class="indent">&quot;Observing these developments and physiological movements is not changing anything about the time of viability. These images however have given rise again to the question as to whether or not there should be a reduction in the time limit of24 weeks. It is distressing that so much of the comment has been so ill-informed.&quot;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-07-03a.605.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1498" speakername="Andrew Tyrie" colnum="605"  time="020:49:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060703/debtext/60703-0731.htm#06070327000243">
	<p pid="a.605.3/1">I should like to think carefully about that before agreeing with my hon. Friend. I am keen to speak for less than 10 minutes, so I will not think aloud at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.605.3/2">I want to end by making the five proposals that I have already made in a submission to the Committee on Standards in Public Life. First, the Electoral Commission must concentrate on its core tasks instead of engaging in all these other activities. That will also lead to financial savings. As a former Treasury adviser, savings interest me a good deal.</p>
	<p pid="a.605.3/3">Secondly, the Electoral Commission must exercise leadership right now with regard to what it will probably have to take on board through its new responsibilities for the boundary commissions. We cannot carry on with boundaries that are always 10 to 15 years out of date in relation to the population statistics and with constituencies of such widely differing sizes. These problems are readily resolvable, but that requires leadership from the commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.605.3/4">Thirdly, we need much more rigorous and independent thinking to implement reform on postal votes. It cannot be right for us to go into an election as we did last time, with so much scope for scandal. Again, the Electoral Commission must be much more vigorous in public debate to ensure that we do not carry on as we are.</p>
	<p pid="a.605.3/5">Fourthly, we need much more accurate data on party funding. For example, we cannot carry on with the pretence of transparency but the reality of still not knowing&mdash;I hope that Members do not think that this is a party political point&mdash;how much and by what means trade unions are supporting the Labour party.</p>
	<p pid="a.605.3/6">We must also sort out the accountability arrangements, to which many hon. Members referred. It is not the Electoral Commission's fault but ours that they are in such a mess. How on earth did we get into a position whereby the commission is accountable behind closed doors, with no verbatim minutes published, when it scrutinises more than &pound;25 million of expenditure? There is a case for a statutory committee to do the work, chaired by a senior Opposition Member of Parliament, along the lines of the Public Accounts Committee, rather than expecting the Speaker to do it. It is burdensome for the Speaker. The Constitutional Affairs Committee also has a role to play. I have raised that matter in private hearings on several occasions, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1404" name="A J Beith">the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith)</phrase>, who chairs the Constitutional Affairs Committee, knows.</p>
	<p pid="a.605.3/7">My final point is about the Committee on Standards in Public Life. It brought us to where we are and it is important that it considers carefully what we should do now. We cannot and should not meddle with the relevant legislation indefinitely. We must make one more change and allow matters to settle down. Continual change is a recipe for the further erosion of public confidence. My advice to the Committee on Standards in Public Life is, therefore, to think carefully about the matter, get it right and, to sum it up in one phrase, expect the Electoral Commission to do less and do it better.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-07-03a.614.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1831" speakername="Simon Hughes" colnum="614"  time="021:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060703/debtext/60703-0732.htm#06070333000130">
	<p pid="a.614.3/1">No, by all parties, if the papers can be used to support the party in any way. We could have that dispute, but I shall be happy to continue the conversation outside.</p>
	<p pid="a.614.3/2">However, there is nothing wrong with asking the Electoral Commission to look at by-elections, which is the relevance of this debate, and I have no objectionto that. I share the view that has been expressed on both sides of the House and elsewhere that party expenditure is properly an issue for the commission. In many ways, I regret the fact that that job was suddenly taken from the commission's remit and given to Hayden Phillips&mdash;not that I have anything against him, but it seems logical to give the commission the task of looking at spending. There is clearly an issue in respect of the spending that starts in seats&mdash;whether the hon. Gentleman's seat, mine or any other&mdash;not just a month before the general election, but six months, a year or two years before. That is local spending, although it is technically disguised as part of a national budget. All those things justify giving the Electoral Commission the responsibility of looking further at expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="a.614.3/3">I welcome this debate on the Electoral Commission. My colleagues and I are grateful to the Liaison Committee for proposing the first debate of this kind. We each have a maximum of 10 minutes for our wind-ups so, on behalf of my party, I shall simply make the points that I think are most important. I apologise to colleagues, therefore, for the fact that I cannot reflect on all the other contributions.</p>
	<p pid="a.614.3/4">The proposal for an Electoral Commission was a good one and we supported it. It is right that the commission came into existence; it has done an important and good job and we support its continuance. The commission has spent a significant amount of money, but that has been scrutinised. Apart from one year, when there was a critical comment about some of the spend, the scrutiny process has endorsed the commission as having spent its money wisely. That is a good commendation, much better than what we hear in many areas of public life, not least Departments such as the Home Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.614.3/5">The debate plays into the review undertaken by the Committee on Standards in Public Life, which was the genesis of the Electoral Commission, and is thus especially timely. Like <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1596" name="Peter Viggers">the hon. Member for Gosport (Peter Viggers)</phrase> and others, I have given evidence to the Committee and we await with interest its conclusions at <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1833" name="David Kidney">the end of the year. Like the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney)</phrase>, I come in to bat strongly in favour of the Electoral Commission. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1404" name="A J Beith">my right hon. Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith)</phrase> said, both on his own behalf and reflecting the views of his Committee, when the Electoral Commission proposes something, the assumption should be that it has the authority to carry the day unless there is a strong argument against it. But that requires two or three things to happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.614.3/6">First, a minority of the commission's members should be from political backgrounds, because that will provide the antennae and there will be authority from inside and outside. Nobody will be able to say, &quot;You don't know what you're talking about&mdash;it's not like this in real life.&quot; The real life element will have been inserted. I am clear that that should happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.614.3/7">I am clear, too, that the structure of accountability, which was conceived for the best of reasons, needs to be reformed, so that it becomes a fully open and accountable process of scrutiny and moves from the present position whereby the Speaker, quite properly, cannot participate fully, because it would be prejudicial to his role as the independent guardian of the House's interests if he were to express views. Therefore, whether with Mr. Speaker or his successors, we need to find another structure to open up the process.</p>
	<p pid="a.614.3/8">Such things should happen in open forum and the minutes should be recorded, and the Committee might therefore meet more often and be able to take more political responsibility. That would pick up some of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1943" name="Barbara Keeley">the issues raised by the hon. Member for Worsley (Barbara Keeley)</phrase> and other hon. Members. Any failings&mdash;for example, on service voting&mdash;might have been picked up much more quickly and action taken much more rigorously. It would have helped the Electoral Commission to do its job better. I can see no disadvantage&mdash;but, yes, there must be a minority of political appointees. Four such appointees in a commission of eleven or more would seem entirely appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.614.3/9">One topical debate is still going on: we are debating whether personal identifiers should be part of the registration and voting process, and the Electoral Administration Bill is still before Parliament. My view is that if the Electoral Commission makes a proposal, there should be a mechanism whereby that proposal comes to the House, and that if the Government want to amend the proposal, that is seen as a Government amendment to the independent proposal. We will need to find a mechanism whereby that legislation could be promoted, for example, by the Committee and given special status. That is not impossible and there are parallels in other legislatures.</p>
	<p pid="a.614.3/10">The next big question is whether Electoral Commission has tried to do too much, and whether it has concentrated on the right things. My judgment is that it has sought to do what it thought were the relevant things. There are some very good election reports on all the major elections, including on specific sub-issues, such as expenditure at certain elections and the electronic counting of votes, which was tried for the first time at the London elections. Some good policy reports have added to information. An example of one of the ones that matter is the funding of electoral services, which are often underfunded by local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.614.3/11">There is an argument that political advertising should be subject to the Advertising Standards Authority. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> Seriously&mdash;I have argued for that on many occasions before. Those are real issues, on which the Electoral Commission should be able to do the work. I would not join those who say that it must do only its core job; it can do other jobs too, and it has done them well, by and large. It is clear that it chose to concentrate on party funding. That is very important; the electorate want the reforms to be made. Mercifully, we are moving in the right direction, but we are not yet there.</p>
	<p pid="a.614.3/12">There has been a set of exchanges about the boundary commission reviews. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1596" name="Peter Viggers">The hon. Member for Gosport (Peter Viggers)</phrase> confirmed that the boundary commission review of local government boundaries in England had been done well. I am clear that the Electoral Commission should take over, as soon as possible, the review of UK parliamentary boundaries, and I am clear that there should be one UK parliamentary boundary commission for this Parliament. That would save a lot of money to start with. We would not necessarily get constituencies of absolutely the same size. There are some very good Scottish examples. In my view, it would be illogical for the Western Isles, and Orkney and Shetland, as well as Anglesey in Wales not be seen as natural constituencies. However, the same principle could and should apply across the UK. If there is a case for smaller electorate in a very depopulated or rural area, that principle should be seen to apply equally in Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland, but we must not continue with different electoral norms for this Parliament in the four countries. That is no longer acceptable. We should have the same electoral norm for this Parliament, other than for exceptions that could arise in any of the four countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.614.3/13">I want to make two last substantive points. What key issues are now on our common agenda? One of them is to ensure that we increase the number of people who are not only registered but vote&mdash;an issue that has been raised by other colleagues. A guy called Gordon Spencer, whom I met at an organisation in my constituency, has recently undertaken, as part of his degree, a piece of research based on my constituency, focusing on what makes people turn out to vote, or why they do not vote. I have a copy of that, and it contains examples of the information that we all need. The information shows, most tellingly, not that people were uninterested but that there were practical issues that made a difference. For example, people were away on the day and had not registered for a postal vote; polling stations were not in convenient places, and were not open for long enough in the day. There are many practical answers to the question of how we can increase the ability of the electorate to participate in elections, and we should do that. We are moving in the right direction, but we have a long way to go.</p>

	<p pid="a.621.1/1">No, because I must leave time for the hon. Member for Gosport to speak at the end of the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.621.1/2">Sam Younger has already set up small panels on matters such as candidates' expenditure and fraud, so he may well be open to setting up a group of the type that I have described.</p>
	<p pid="a.621.1/3">On fraud, in its press release on its report the Electoral Commission states:</p>
	<p pid="a.621.1/4" class="indent">&quot;The majority of people (55%) did not think that electoral fraud was a problem at the elections, although allegations of electoral fraud and the way candidates fought their campaigns were a key feature in some areas and in the media.</p>
	<p pid="a.621.1/5" class="indent">Those who felt fraud had been a problem said they were influenced by media coverage (51%) rather than first hand experience (4%)&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.621.1/6">Perhaps the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire will bear that in mind. He continually bangs the drum and suggests that electoral fraud is widespread in this country. It is not.</p>
	<p pid="a.621.1/7">Where the commission should report is a tricky issue. The commission sees many benefits in reporting to the Speaker's Committee, which highlights its independence from Government. The chairman of the Constitutional Affairs Committee, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1404" name="A J Beith">the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith)</phrase>, made a good point when he said that his Committee will of course want to examine some aspects of the Electoral Commission's work, so it should have a role. I ask the House to wait to see whether, as a result of the evidence that is put before it, the Committee on Standards in Public Life takes a view on whether it would be more appropriate for the Electoral Commission to report to a body other than the Speaker's Committee. I assure Opposition Members that the Department for Constitutional Affairs is not suggesting that it should take that responsibility; we would much prefer it to be left to some aspect of Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.621.1/8">Finally, let me say a few words about the future. Since its inception, the Electoral Commission has been successful in meeting its wide-ranging remit. There have been differences of view on policy in some areas, but that has not prevented an effective partnership, and those differences are a sign of the commission's independence. We believe that the Electoral Commission's operational role is crucial and probably the area in which, in the next few years, it can add most value to the running of elections and democratic services between elections.</p>
	<p pid="a.621.1/9">As we have said in our evidence to the Committee on Standards in Public Life, the Government have developed a stronger policy-making capacity since 2000, so it might now be appropriate for the Government to lead in policy development and for the commission to concentrate on ensuring that electoral services are delivered successfully. Meanwhile, we shall continue to involve the commission, administrators and other stakeholders in policy and legislation development to ensure that the electorate's needs are being met. Another area in which it might be time for change is how to ensure that, while retaining the commission's independence, there is political input into its work&mdash;a point that was raised in the debate.</p>

	<p pid="a.626.1/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1900" name="David Winnick">my hon. Friend the Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Winnick)</phrase> on securing this very important debate. I also offer <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1437" name="Tobias Ellwood">my condolences to the hon. Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood)</phrase> on the loss of his brother. I fully understand the issues that he raises, and I will touch on them later if I can. I thank them both for the spirit in which they made their contributions.</p>
	<p pid="a.626.1/2">The question of help and support for the victims of the 7/7 bombings is very much in our minds as we approach the first anniversary of those dreadful events. My thoughts, and I am sure those of the whole House, go out to those who suffered a bereavement or an injury, whether physical, psychological, or emotional. As my hon. Friend says, none of us can forget those horrific events of last year. This timely debate gives me the opportunity to bring the House up to date with the facts on how we have been able help those who were injured or bereaved by the bombings. I am pleased that the Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1765" name="Jim Fitzpatrick">my hon. Friend the Member for Poplar and Canning Town (Jim Fitzpatrick)</phrase>, who is Minister for London, has joined me on the Front Bench for this important debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.626.1/3">As my hon. Friend said, it is widely known that 52 innocent people were killed in the bombings and that more than 700 people were injured. The national health service, the police, local authorities, and the special assistance centre and telephone helpline established in the aftermath of the tragedy have each played a key role in offering support and help to those affected. We should never forget those who are committed to the emergency services for the work that they do, and did on that day.</p>
	<p pid="a.626.1/4">The survivors and the bereaved were eligible for compensation from the criminal injuries compensation scheme, the statutory scheme that pays out compensation to victims of violent crime in Great Britain. Compensation claims are handled by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority&mdash;CICA&mdash;which, as hon. Members will be aware, is an executive non-departmental public body. The authority is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the scheme. It interprets the scheme's rules and decides how much compensation claimants are entitled to according to its terms.</p>
	<p pid="a.626.1/5">Ministers are precluded by law from getting involved in individual cases or from commenting on CICA's handling of individual applications or its decisions in individual cases. However, CICA, in administering a statutory scheme, is bound by the terms of the scheme as set by Parliament. The authority has limited discretion in applying the rules in individual cases. In that respect, the scheme differs from, for example, the London Bombings Relief Charitable Fund, which, as an independent charity established specifically to help 7/7 victims, was free to set its own rules and guidelines and can make charitable grants at the discretion of its trustees.</p>
	<p pid="a.626.1/6">As I said, I cannot talk about individual cases. However, I can give the House some more general information about claims made to CICA and describe how it is dealing with claims from those who were more seriously injured, which is the issue of particular concern to my hon. Friend. At close of business on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-23">Friday 23 June</phrase>, CICA had received 516 applications for compensation in respect of the 7/7 bombings. It had also received 12 applications related to the attempted bombings two weeks later on <phrase class="date" code="">21 July</phrase>. However, I am not including information about the 21/7 incidents, because none of those victims sustained severe physical injury but have sought compensation only for the mental trauma they suffered. Of the 516 7/7 applications, 18 have been turned down, although some of the claimants have appealed against that decision. CICA has paid 370 awards totalling &pound;2.3 million, comprising a mix of interim and final awards. In 217 cases, a final award has been accepted and paid, thereby bringing the case to a close.</p>
	<p pid="a.626.1/7">As for serious cases, CICA has interpreted that as meaning cases where the claimant has lost an eye or a limb or has sustained severe burns or other injury of comparable severity. It has received 17 claims where the principal injury meets that definition of seriousness. According to CICA, in every serious case it has made substantial interim awards on account. In most instances, that interim award has been the tariff award for the most serious injury sustained. Therefore, in several cases the interim award has been well in excess of &pound;100,000. CICA is not yet able to finalise these seriously injured cases, because they all involve claims for compensation additional to the basic tariff award for loss of earnings and special expenses. In all those cases, the final prognosis for recovery is not yet clear and CICA is not yet in a position to make a final assessment of the claim for financial loss.</p>
