<p>The Secretary of State has taken a long time to instigate that survey. Does he realise that women are the major users of public transport? The GLC has carried out the only survey of women by women to identify the difficulties which they experience on buses, underground trains and so on, and in badly lit streets. Over three quarters of them said that they felt unsafe at night. Will the right hon. Gentleman examine the findings of the GLC and proposals from other metropolitan authorities, and improve the safety of women, by recruiting more conductors and other staff, rather than relying on machines, which cannot respond to cries for help?</p>

<p>The hon. Lady is a little over-critical. We have set up a study into the problems on the Underground. The problems of bus staff are being examined, as is violence to road passenger transport staff, by another of my Department's working groups, which will report shortly. A great deal is being done to investigate what can be done, and a lot is being done. If the hon. Lady would like to go to the Bank station, she will see the plans for modernising it, making it better lit and better laid out. Those are the sorts of ways in which to prevent crime, and the hon. Lady will find that the Government are doing a lot in that direction.</p>

<p>I thank my right hon. Friend for his announcement today, which I am sure will be given a greater welcome by women in general than it was by the Opposition Front Bench.

<p>I think that that is true, but I am sure that the ways that are being examined by London Regional Transport to improve the situation will all help. For some time efforts have been made to improve lighting and the safety of ticket and other staff, and to increase the presence of the British Transport police and inspectors in order to improve the situation.</p>

<p>Has the Secretary of State read the GLC women's committee's pamphlet "Women on the Move" which, to make the point in another way from my hon. Friend the Member for Barking (Ms. Richardson), makes it clear that only 17 per cent. of women feel safe travelling on public transport at night. In order to try to increase the number of women who want to travel on the tube and buses, and feel safe doing so, will he ask London Regional Transport to drop its proposals for further one-person operated buses and the reduction of guards on tubes, both of which add to the feeling of insecurity among women travelling on London transport?</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman must understand that it is taking a little time to get the London Underground more efficient, safe, and attractive to passengers. We took the system away from the GLC only 18 months ago and we have had remarkable progress in rectifying the GLC's errors.</p>

<p>Has the Minister learnt from his discussions that the effect of abolishing the South Yorkshire county council, coupled with the implementation of the last two Transport Acts, will be to treble at least

the fares, to cut services substantially and to make some hundreds of the staff redundant in an area of high unemployment? Does he regard this as a mark of progress in a civilised society?</p>

<p>It is important to get a better balance between the amount paid by the user and the amount paid by the ratepayer. The high level of rates in South Yorkshire has undoubtedly contributed to the high level of unemployment there. In South Yorkshire the subsidy on transport amounts to 62&#x00B7;8 per cent. of the cost in cash terms for operating the service, while only 22 per cent. comes from fares. Nowhere else in the country is there such an extraordinary state of affairs.</p>

<p>In the relevant years&#x2014;1990 to 1993&#x2014;the railways' provisional programme of investment is such that, even with investment in the Channel fixed link, it will be investing less than at present. The answer to the hon. Gentleman's second point is that the costs of the Ashford line are included in the investment plans which British Rail has put forward as an immediate consequence of the Channel Tunnel Group's proposals. British Rail estimates that if it has high-speed trains working between London, Paris and Brussels the investment will be &#x00A3;390 million, but that if it has conventional-speed trains it will be &#x00A3;290 million.

<p>I was careful to ensure that the bones of an agreement were reached between the two railways and between the combined railways and the Channel Tunnel Group before the decision was finally taken. The agreement is that there will be a 50-50 joint venture between BR and SNCF. They will be able to decide jointly on the services, the costs, the share of the revenue and the investment. I believe that that is a thoroughly satisfactory deal for BR. BR is content with, and has agreed the


schedule of, tolls to be charged on trains passing through the Channel tunnel. I cannot at the moment speak definitely for SNCF in that respect.</p>

<p>I was opposed to the original scheme 11 years ago because it was to be paid for by taxpayers.

To try to increase employment in the railway engineering industry I have agreed with the chairman of British Rail the new arrangements whereby BREL's activities will be split into repair and new build.

Is he aware that there is no motorway between Darlington and Doncaster, which is something that industries in the north-east desperately need?</p>

As to the other BL businesses, it remains the policy of Her Majesty's Government to return them to private ownership as soon as practicable.

<p>The Secretary of State's statement reveals that discussions are at an advanced stage, but the House has not been told anything until today.

Is it not appalling that the Government are willing even to contemplate the disposal of the largest part of the British truck and bus manufacturing industry to an American competitor?

<q>after lengthy discussions, Vauxhall is not yet ready to go further in proving that it really is a British car producer."&#x2014;<i>[Official Report,</i> 23 October 1985; Vol. 84, c. 285.]</q><br/>
In that context, is it not naive and foolish to expect that company to preserve any British element in what it acquires? Is there no part of British industry that is safe from the destructive purposes of the Government? Is there nothing that is not for sale? Will the Secretary of State confirm that a team from General Motors is currently in Leyland compiling a detailed dossier of our business? As the purpose of General Motors in buying Leyland would be to buy a market share, or rather to buy out the British market share and get its hands on modern facilities, which have been provided on a publicly financed basis at a cost of &#x00A3;320 million in the recent investment programme, will there not be large job losses in Bedford as well as Leyland? What is the estimate of the number of jobs that will be lost in both Bedford and Leyland?<br/>
What will the future be for the Land Rover and the Range Rover? Will not the job lot disposal of these prestigious British products be seen at home and abroad as a dreadful and shameful British retreat? Is it not a sad day when the British Government can even-think of such

a thing? If this deal goes ahead, will it not be the case that the British armed forces will have almost no British owned suppliers of the vehicles upon which they depend?</p>

<p>Why does the right hon. Gentleman believe that it is so good for the employees that no talks have taken place with the trade

unions? Indeed, it has been denied to the trade unions that talks are taking place. What does the right hon. Gentleman mean when he says that the majority of products will be manufactured here? What will be the effect on the component industry, particularly in view of General Motors' poor record on buying components in Britain? Will he confirm that the bus and coach division could go to the wall, with the loss of 1,000 jobs?

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. You will recall that on Friday last the Protection of Military Remains Bill was passed unanimously by the House. All its stages were passed unanimously, which is almost unique in the House. It is dismaying to see on the Order Paper today motion No. 4 in the name of the Leader of the House:
<q>That the Proceedings of 31st January in Committee and on Third Reading of the Protection of Military Remains Bill be null and void.</q>
In effect, the Leader of the House is saying that a Bill, which was proposed by the hon. Member for Hampshire, East (Mr. Mates), shall be null and void despite the decision of the House that it should pass all its stages without a single vote.<br/>
We know that the Government are anxious to get away from Westland to matters of national importance, but is this not carrying things a little too far? The Leader of the House is trying to get a motion passed, presumably without debate, which rescinds the unanimous decision of the House last Friday. It shows contempt towards the House, and I invite the right hon. Gentleman to withdraw the motion and allow the Bill to proceed.</p>

<p>I think that I can help the House on this matter. The Bill passed all its stages without notice. Normally, as the House knows, Bills do not pass all their stages in one sitting.

<p>With permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to make a statement on the teachers' dispute, which has caused disruption of children's education for the past year.<br/>
The House will be aware that, with assistance from ACAS, a provisional agreement has been reached between management and teachers on a settlement for 1985, an end to disruption, and assisted negotiations across pay and other conditions of service for 1986. The Government greatly welcome the prospect of a firm agreement of this kind along with the restoration of normal working in the schools. The disruption has not only damaged children's education. It has put heavy burdens on parents, head teachers and on many classroom teachers. We all want to see it end. I hope therefore that the provisional agreement will soon be formally adopted by management and teachers.<br/>
The NUT is not at present party to this agreement. I nevertheless hope that all the teachers' unions will join in the negotiations that lie ahead for 1986. The Government accept the case for an increase in teachers' pay to recruit, retain and motivate the teachers needed for the high quality school education our children need and deserve, along with improvements in the pay structure and a clarification of teachers' responsibilities. The Government have set aside additional resources for this purpose. I therefore hope that the forthcoming negotiations will soon make sufficient progress towards the Government's objectives to justify my releasing those resources.</p>

<p>Does the right hon. Gentleman accept that he and his Department did, and have done, nothing to help bring about a settlement of this highly-damaging teachers' dispute, and that his statement today does nothing to make a long-term settlement of the teachers' grievance more likely?<br/>
Is it not the case that the right hon. Gentleman has not offered the local education authorities any extra money to help pay for the provisional settlement, nor has he offered to increase the Government's contribution towards a longer term settlement next year?<br/>
When will the right hon. Gentleman grasp the simple truth &#x2014; a truth that is well understood by local authorities, parents and teachers alike &#x2014; that raising educational standards and giving teachers decent salaries requires substantial extra investment?<br/>
Does the Secretary of State understand that his announcement that he will not be standing at the next election has transformed him overnight into the lamest of lame ducks? If he really cares about our children's education he should announce that he is resigning as Secretary of State.</p>

<p>The Government have long taken the view&#x2014;a view that we have every reason to confirm &#x2014;that teachers deserve to have more pay in order that people of the right quality shall be recruited, retained and motivated. The Government have accepted that. We also believe that it would not be right for additional money to be given to teachers from the taxpayer without, at the same time, the teachers agreeing to a new pay structure with ample extra promotions and to implementing their duties.<br/>
The House is united in wanting an end to the disruption in our schools. There is, however, a difference between the Government and the Opposition which I must emphasise. The Government see a bargain for children in calling for extra pay and a new pay structure for teachers, but we also believe that there should be an acceptance by the teachers' unions of duties. The hon. Member for Durham, North (Mr. Radice) is active in seeking extra pay for teachers, and I can understand that. However, he completely refuses to accept that teachers, for their part, should accept duties. When he was asked that in a recent debate, he refused to confirm that it was the Opposition's view that duties are a necessary part of the bargain.</p>

<p>If there is to be a complete resolution of the dispute, does my right hon. Friend agree that it is crucial that rank and file teachers should be persuaded to accept the outline of the ACAS agreement? Is it not therefore most important that, to persuade them, the Government should make it clear what benefits are on offer in the later negotiation for 1986 onwards?

<p>I accept what my hon. Friend said. It is important that teachers in unions should well understand what is on offer and that the Government have already set aside a substantial sum of money to be released on condition that the bargain to which I have referred is made. The Assistant Masters and Mistresses Association has already called off the disruption. I welcome that, as I am sure the House does. The National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers is balloting its members. We understand that the ballot will take much of this month. I hope that the National Union of Teachers, which has called off the strike on which it provisionally decided, will decide to call off the disruption which it proposes at the moment to continue.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State said that he would make sufficient progress towards the Government's objectives. Will he confirm that those objectives are the same as those that he spelt out to the House previously? Does he accept that the more intransigent he is, the more succour he gives to the hard-line unionists? I wonder whether he read today's leader in the <i>Daily Mail</i> which finishes:
<q>The Cabinet should empower Sir Keith to give a kindly&#x2014;and astutely kind smile &#x2014; (cash to follow) before he finally bows out.</q>
Perhaps he would like to manifest that.</p>

<p>I join my right hon. Friend in deploring the damage that has been done to our children's education by this long dispute. Does he agree that we must somehow find a way of encouraging those moderate and conscientious teachers who intensely dislike the strike weapon and who, in many cases, have rejected it? Can we not in the longer term move towards some kind of professional teachers' council, and hope that we can move towards negotiating a no-strike agreement?</p>

<p>I agree with my hon. Friend and pay tribute to all those teachers, in particular head teachers, who have carried on without disruption.

<p>In his statement, the Secretary of State used the words, "normal work in schools". Do I take it that he was referring to the time before the teachers' dispute arose when teachers performed many out-of-school activities including taking children for Saturday morning football matches and that type of thing? The feeling that I receive in my constituency and beyond is that in the foreseeable future&#x2014;certainly not in the Secretary of State's lifetime&#x2014;teachers will not go back to normal working in schools. Even if there is a settlement, normal working in schools, as we recognised it before the dispute, will not return. Teachers are resisting the demands for out-of-school activities made upon them.</p>

<p>I beg to ask leave to move the Adjournment of the House, under Standing Order No. 10, for the purpose of discussing a specific and important matter that should have urgent consideration, namely,
<q>the Draft Single European Act final text.</q>
I emphasise "final text".<br/>
On 18 December, when my hon. Friend the Member for Southend, East (Mr. Taylor) was discussing the European treaty with my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, the Secretary of State said:
<q>It was agreed that we should not speak of the establishment of a European union."&#x2014;<i>[Official Report,</i> 18 December 1985; Vol. 89, c. 302.]</q>
The first paragraph of the preamble to this treaty gives a commitment
<q>to transform relations as a whole among their States into a European Union,&#x2026; to implement this European Union &#x2026; and to invest this union with the necessary means of action".</q><br/>
In 1973 we joined the Common Market. At a later stage we had a referendum to sustain membership of the Common Market. The British people have never been asked whether they wish to be dragged unknowingly, unconsulted and unconsenting into a United States of Europe. This text is final and would mean that the United Kingdom would cease to be a sovereign state and would be merely a province of a larger United States of Europe. It is an important issue.<br/>
Secondly, as in important issue, it states in this final text that we are
<q>convinced that the European idea &#x2026; and the need for new developments correspond to the wishes of the democratic peoples of Europe, for whom the European Parliament, elected by universal sufferage, is an indispensable means of expression,</q>
This is bunk. If, Mr. Speaker, you speak to your constituents, or if I speak to mine, or if one looks at the figures of those who voted for this institution at the last election, there is no doubt that it is bunk. It is not only bunk, because if one looks at article 6 one sees that this dangerous institution is about to be given yet more power.<br/>
Throughout the treaty we have talked about the European Assembly. Now, in article 6, we read that "After consulting the Assembly" is to be changed to "in cooperation with the European Parliament". I am not sure

what the language means, but I think that a Parliament is different from an assembly, and that co-operation is different from consultation. In this treaty this institution is to be given a great deal of power. As political power and parliamentary power is by and large a zero sum, if more power goes to Strasbourg and Brussels there will be less power here in this Parliament.<br/>
This is a matter of such fundamental importance that there is a risk that as a result of this Denmark will feel forced to secede from the European Community. It is urgent because the next business of the House is to consider giving parliamentary approval to an illegal budget passed by the European Assembly. It seems to me that it is the wrong way round for the Government to wish to give money to this bandit institution. Surely we should first discuss in Parliament whether we wish to give more powers to this institution.<br/>
As a matter of great urgency the Government have said that they must provide the extra money because they are taking the case to the European Court of Justice. The European Court of Justice is not only about justice; it is also about the increase of power of European institutions. If the Government first provide more money through Parliament and then say that they want the institution to have more power, and Parliament does not even see fit to discuss that increase in power, what is the outcome likely to be at the European Court?<br/>
You are a wise and powerful Speaker, Mr. Speaker. You are here, not to support the Government or their programme, but to support the sovereignty of the House. I implore you to grant leave for this urgent debate to take place.</p>

<p>I beg to ask leave to move the Adjournment of the House, under Standing Order No. 10, for the purpose of discussing a specific and important matter that should have urgent consideration, namely,
<q>the restriction on the right of free speech imposed on the Police Federation of Northern Ireland.</q><br/>
The matter is specific, in that the Chief Constable of Northern Ireland has tried to gag the elected chairman of the Police Federation of Northern Ireland by issuing a force order cancelling regulation 35 of the Royal Ulster Constabulary discipline code.<br/>
Regulation 35 reads:
<q>Nothing in these regulations will preclude the spokesman of any of the constituent sections of the Police association for Northern Ireland making or issuing any statement to the news media concerning the welfare and efficiency of their members.</q><br/>
Last week, the assistant chief constable, acting on the Chief Constable's instruction, handed to the chairman of the Police Federation a paper, of which I have a copy, saying that regulation 35, which establishes beyond peradventure the right of the federation to speak out on any matter which the House has made its business, had been amended thus:
<q>Statements and interviews and the publication of articles in any journal or periodical concerning matters of general Force policy and actions, or expressions of opinion on police problems or duties are not permitted without the express consent and approval of the Chief Constable &#x2026; Where any aspect of welfare or efficiency may relate to Force policy or actions, police problems or duties, the Chief Constable shall be consulted and approval obtained, before any statement is made or any article published.</q><br/>
Those words have no meaning other than that the Chief Constable of Northern Ireland intended, and intends to prevent the federation from making any comment in public which he has not specifically approved in advance. This is not only censorship. It is, and is meant to be, a gag.<br/>
During the weekend, the Chief Constable went further. He withdrew the amendment that I have just quoted and substituted for it his force order cancelling regulation 35 &#x2014;the federation's free speech regulation&#x2014;</p>

<p>I am obliged, Mr. Speaker. I merely wanted to say that the matter is specific because the force order contains the words:
<q>Regulation 35 is cancelled".</q><br/>
The matter is also urgent because, if the Chief Constable's force order is allowed to stand, not only is free speech denied, but when the chairman of the Police Federation meets the press on Wednesday or Thursday his superior officer will have no choice but to charge him with a disciplinary offence. That is why it is urgent for his matter to be dealt with.<br/>
The matter is important, too, for the Chief Constable's action in Ulster could pose a threat to the free speech of the Police Federations of England and Wales and of Scotland as well as that of Northern Ireland. The federations on this side of the water will go to the aid of their Northern Ireland colleagues if this oppressive order is not withdrawn.<br/>
I therefore invite you, Mr. Speaker, to allow the House to debate this matter as it touches on one of our most fundamental rights&#x2014;that of free speech&#x2014;and strikes at the heart of the morale of 8,000 brave men and women who make up the Police Federation of Northern Ireland.<br/>
The matter is specific, urgent and important. I beg to ask that leave be given for it to take precedence over other business.</p>

The hon. Gentleman has raised a very important matter and I have listened with great care to what he has said. However, I have to give him the same answer as I gave to the hon.

I regret that I cannot find that the matter that he has raised meets all of the criteria laid down in the Standing Order, and I cannot, therefore, submit his application to the House.

<p>I beg to move,
<q>That a supplementary sum, not exceeding &#x00A3;135,917,000, be granted to Her Majesty out of the Consolidated Fund to defray the charges which will come in course of payment during the year ending on 31 March 1986 for expenditure by the Treasury in connection with payments to the Budget of the European Communities not covered by direct charges on the Consolidated Fund under section 2(3) of the European Communities Act 1972, as set out in House of Commons Paper No. 177.</q><br/>
The special Supplementary Estimate which is before the House today relates to our contributions to the 1985 and 1986 budgets of the European Communities. There are two relevant documents, apart from the Estimate, of which Members will wish to be aware &#x2014; a memorandum submitted by the Treasury to the Treasury and Civil Service Select Committee on 24 January, and a transcript of oral evidence taken by the Committee on 30 January.<br/>
I hope that it will be helpful to hon. Members if I first remind the House of the purpose and content of the Special Supplentary Estimate. I propose then to discuss the Government's policy on the disputed 1986 Community budget and our contributions towards it, and finally to say something about the statutory basis for our contribution to the disputed budget and the procedures for obtaining parliamentary approval.<br/>
The Estimate contains two elements. The larger concerns the provision of some &#x00A3;118 million towards meeting a Commission request to member states to bring forward a payment of traditional own resources &#x2014;agricultural levies and customs duties&#x2014;from December to November 1985. I should stress that this sum does not represent an increase in Community spending. It is purely a question of the timing of the payment of own resources collected during October 1985. They would normally have been paid to the Commission in December, but instead they were paid on 20 November. Our December payment was reduced by a corresponding amount and there was therefore no effect on the public expenditure planning totals.<br/>
The need for the November advance arose because one element in the financing of the 1985 budget &#x2014;supplementary contributions under the 1985 intergovernmental agreement&#x2014;was not received before the very end of 1985. We had taken provision of &#x00A3;820 million in Main Estimates and Summer Supplementaries to cover

these advances during 1985, but had not expected them to continue to be required as late as November. Consequently, when the Commission asked member states to bring forward the &#x00A3;134 million December contribution into November, only &#x00A3;16&#x00B7;1 million could be covered by the amount remaining in the Vote. The balance of &#x00A3;118 million was paid by means of a drawing on the Contingencies Fund. Parliament was duly informed of the advance payment on 21 November. The Supplementary Estimate now proposed is needed to reimburse the Contingencies Fund before the end of the current financial year. The Commission's cash flow difficulties caused by late payment of the 1985 IGA have now been resolved. There should therefore be no need for further advance payments of traditional own resources in the immediate future.<br/>
The second part of the Estimate relates to the disputed 1986 budget. It seeks provision of &#x00A3;18 million in respect of our contributions during the first quarter of the year towards that part of the budget added by the European Parliament in excess of its powers under the treaties.<br/>
As hon. Members will recall, the European Parliament adopted in December a budget for 1986 which made provision for some 629 million ecu&#x2014;about &#x00A3;400 million &#x2014;of spending above that agreed by the Council. The Government have decided to join the Council and several other member states in asking the European Court to annul the disputed elements in the budget. In the meantime, the Government propose, in common with all other member states, to pay in full to the budget on a without prejudice basis. Since, however, we do not accept any legal obligation to contribute towards the disputed elements, this element in our contribution cannot be charged direct to the Consolidated Fund under the European Communities Act 1972 and we need instead to seek Parliament's authority through the Estimates procedure.</p>

<p>Further to the point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. You have said that the case is before the European courts and cannot be subjected to the same sub judice rule as applies to a British court. When we went into the Common Market&#x2014;dragged in without a vote, and some of us have been protesting ever since &#x2014;we were told, without reservation, that in those areas where United Kingdom laws conflicted with European laws, the Common Market laws would supersede our laws. The Minister is telling us that the case is before the courts, which means that it is sub judice. We know that we cannot talk about Liverpool and Lambeth because you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, have said that those cases are sub judice.

<p>Further to the point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker.

The House is being asked to pass an illegal Act. The Government&#x2014;thank God&#x2014;with the other Governments, are to fight it through the Euro-court.

<p>Further to the point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I wonder whether you would explain the sub judice rule further to the House, because there is a distinction between drawing attention to the fact that proceedings are taking place and commenting upon the substance of those proceedings. The hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Heffer) was merely pointing out that proceedings were under way. He was not offering an opinion on whether they were justified, but was simply saying that proceedings are taking place. The purpose of the sub judice rule is to prevent legal proceedings from being affected by what might be said in the House. The hon. Gentleman was not offering a comment on the legal proceedings. He was drawing an analogy, and to draw the analogy he pointed out their existence.</p>

<p>One of the reasons for the sub judice rule is to ensure that cases are not prejudiced by anything that is said in the House. Drawing them into an argument could easily prejudice a case. That is why the House, in its wisdom, has had the rule for a great many years.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I apologise for coming in&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "No."]&#x2014;on the point of order. I apologise also to my hon. Friend the Minister. Surely, Mr. Deputy Speaker, your ruling is bound to be right, because the case to which the hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Heffer) referred is a domestic case involving individuals. By implication, in raising that matter the hon. Gentleman is perhaps a little sympathetic towards those individuals. My hon. Friend the Minister is referring to an international case, where the debate technically revolves around the payment of a supplementary additional amount, rather than around the underlying arguments, although they will form part of the debate.</p>

<p>The two main issues are budget discipline and treaty violation.<br/>
On budget discipline, the Government first expressed their concern at the Council's "Second Reading" discussion on 26 and 27 November. On that occasion the Council voted by qualified majority to increase non-obligatory expenditure by some 1&#x00B7;2 billion ecu on payment appropriations. In the Government's view, it would have been compatible with the spirit of the budget discipline agreement to increase non-obligatory expenditure by some 1 billion ecu, comprising 440 million ecu permitted under the statutory maximum rate of increase for this expenditure


plus some 550 million to 600 million ecu earmarked for Spain and Portugal in the first year of the enlarged Community. The 1&#x00B7;2 billion ecu voted by the Council somewhat exceeded this figure. The United Kingdom therefore voted against the Council's "Second Reading" budget as representing a threat to budget discipline. We did not, however, regard it as a flagrant violation. The non-obligatory expenditure totals exceeded budget discipline levels, strictly interpreted, but the excess was more than offset by the new own resources &#x2014; net of refunds&#x2014;which Spain and Portugal will be bringing to the budget.</p>

<p>When we agreed to increase the level of our VAT contribution to the Community, it was pledged in return that we would get budget discipline. Is my hon. Friend saying that even if we win the case against the European Assembly the Council's "Second Reading" budget will still be in breach of those undertakings?</p>

<speech hansard_id="380213" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1986-02-03a.43.1" hansard_membership_id="3735" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2471" speakername="Mr. Brooke" colnum="43" time="16:26:00">
<p>I repeat that the non-obligatory expenditure totals exceeded budget discipline levels, strictly interpreted, but the excess was more than offset by the new own resources&#x2014;net of refunds&#x2014;which Spain and Portugal will be bringing to the budget.<br/>
At the December Budget Council the Council decided, with the United Kingdom again voting against, to offer a further 242 million ecu of non-obligatory expenditure in an attempt to reach agreement with the Parliament. The Parliament rejected the offer, which the President of the Council then withdrew, and took instead the regrettable step of voting and then adopting a budget providing for non-obligatory expenditure at a level 629 million ecu above the Council's "Second Reading".<br/>
The budget as adopted by the Parliament is clearly incompatible with the Council's budget discipline conclusions on non-obligatory expenditure. It does not follow that budget discipline as a whole lies in ruins. The single most important element in the budget discipline agreement is the guideline for expenditure on agricultural market support, and the budget as proposed by the Council and adopted by the Parliament respects that guideline. There is headroom of some 170 million ecu within it. The problem area is non-obligatory expenditure. That is where the Parliament's action, and to a lesser extent the Council's December offer, were manifestly incompatible with the budget discipline agreement.<br/>
The breach of budget discipline is a serious matter. To be fair, however, the Parliament has never subscribed to the Council's conclusions on budget discipline and is not legally bound by them. What is even more serious, therefore, is that the Parliament exceeded its powers by adopting a budget for 1986 with levels of non-obligatory expenditure going well beyond what was available under the treaty. The treaty provides that, if the statutory maximum rate of increase in non-obligatory expenditure is to be exceeded by more than the Parliament's statutory margin of manoeuvre, the Council and the Parliament must agree on a new maximum rate. In the event, the Parliament unilaterally adopted a budget which included a level of non-obligatory expenditure for which the Council's agreement had been neither sought nor obtained.<br/>
In the Government's view, the Parliament cannot be allowed to get away with this. If it were, there would, as

my right hon. Friend the Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) has put it, be a substantial shift of real power in the Community. The balance of budgetary power between the Council and the Parliament would shift markedly in the Parliament's favour. The Parliament would be able to add substantial sums with impunity each year to the Council's proposals. These implications for future control of the Community's expenditure are even more serious than the amount of some 629 million ecu which is immediately at issue in the current year.<br/>
The Government have acted swiftly in response to the Parliament's action. We have taken three steps. First, we urged the Council to bring a case against the Parliament before the European Court under article 173 of the EEC treaty. This the Council agreed to do, by a seven to three majority, on 20 December &#x2014; a bare day after confirmation of the decision by the President of the Parliament to adopt the budget. The Council's legal services are expected to deposit pleadings with the European Court in the middle of this month.<br/>
Secondly, we have ourselves initiated a case against the Parliament before the European Court, alongside the Council's case. Our application to the court was completed on 28 January and deposited on 29 January. The pleadings cannot be published, but have been made available to the Select Committee on the Treasury and Civil Service. Copies have also been placed in the Library of the House for Members' use.<br/>
The Government's decision to bring separate national proceedings alongside the council's case was influenced by three main considerations: first, the need to insure againt the slight risk that the Council's case might be found inadmissible because of the wording of the relevant treaty provisions; secondly, the need to insure against the risk that the majority in the Council in favour of the court action might at some stage be lost; and, thirdly, our ability to deploy in our own case legal arguments which we believe to be most compelling. Four other member states are likewise bringing national cases&#x2014;France, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.<br/>
The substance of our case is that the Parliament acted unlawfully by adopting payment and commitment appropriations which failed to respect the maximum rate provisions of the treaty, and also by including unauthorised appropriations for certain items of obligatory expenditure over which the Council has the last word. We are asking the court accordingly to annul the 1986 budget as adopted in so far as it exceeds the Council's own "Second Reading" budget of 26 and 27 November.</p>

<p>My point concerns the action taken by the British Government, quite apart from the actions initiated by the Council and by other member states on the use of this money. Is there not a danger that the Commission will have spent the &#x00A3;18 million in this Supplementary Estimate before our interim measure comes before the court? Would not the best way of preventing the Commission from spending the money be for us not to pay the money? How will the Commission pay the money back if it has already spent it?</p>

<p>My hon. Friend has put his finger on the point. We have announced that we will take that interim measure before the court. We are bringing the interim measure before the court for a number of reasons which are not simply associated with the immediate payments.


We are concerned to place the application before the European Court. This is a novel action in the Community's history. We are concerned that the case should be considered at the earliest possibility. As I said to the Select Committee on the Treasury and Civil Service, if the Commission has spent the money when the court makes its decision on the final case, by definition, the money has been spent. However, a most important battle will have been won in terms of establishing the distribution of power between the Parliament and the Council. If, on any future occasion, Parliament sought to do the same thing, an interim application would immediately become admissible and be decided on the precedent of the previous case.</p>

<p>The Commission has presented its demand to the United Kingdom for payment, and that is the subject of today's debate. It is on that ground that we intend to move our interim application that the demand is inappropriate in terms of the margin. Once the demand payment is paid, the resources can be spent under the Commission's powers. Failing our first request to the court, we are asking it to annul the budget in its entirety; in other words, to find that no valid budget exists.<br/>
Our third action is to ask the court for an interim order in effect suspending implementation of the illegal elements in the budget until the court has given judgment. We shall be applying for this order within the next week or so. Our application will ask the court to suspend implementation both of the excesses of expenditure in the budget above the Council's "Second Reading" levels and of the extra contributions required to finance these excesses. Our advice is that the court is unlikely to reach judgment on the substantive cases before the end of this year, or quite possibly later. In our view, this reinforces the case for requesting an interim order, on which we would expect the court to decide within a few weeks. Other member states are likewise considering whether to request interim orders, but we are the only country to have decided firmly to do so.<br/>
The other policy issue which the Government have had to address is how much the United Kingdom should pay towards the disputed budget in the meantime, pending rulings by the European Court. The Government have decided, after careful consideration, that the best course is to pay in full towards the budget as adopted, on a without prejudice basis, pending the court's rulings. That is why we decided to present the special Supplementary Estimate.</p>

<p>I am trying to follow the logic behind my hon. Friend's argument. I simply cannot understand how we can pay money on a without prejudice basis, which will then be spent and become unrecoverable.

<p>There would be freedom for us to deduct that amount from a subsequent contribution. However, obviously that would be contingent upon the decision of the court in responding to our interim application.<br/>
The first and most important consideration is that the Council and individual member states must win the court cases if a major shift in power towards the European Parliament is to be avoided. The Government's legal advice has been that payment in full would enable the United Kingdom to appear before the European Court in the best possible posture. On the other hand, failure to pay in full would impair the United Kingdom's posture and tend to prejudice the substantive cases brought before the court and, still more, the United Kingdom's application for an interim order.<br/>
A second important consideration is that all other member states have decided to pay in full. We ought not lightly to break ranks with the rest of the Council.<br/>
A third consideration is that the United Kingdom would incur a potential liability to penal interest charges&#x2014;</p>

<p>As I was saying, a third consideration was that the United Kingdom would incur a potential liability to penal interest charges on delayed payments if we failed to pay in full. The penal rate is currently nearly 21 per cent., and rises with each month of delay.<br/>
It may be helpful to my hon. Friends if I expand a little on the legal background. Although the Government have been advised that they are not legally obliged to contribute to the disputed part of the 1986 budget, there is a contrary view &#x2014; which we understand to be held by the Commission, among others&#x2014;that the budget must be treated as valid unless and until it is annulled by the court. If the Government refused to contribute to the adopted budget in full, they would almost certainly be challenged by the Commission. Indeed, it is possible that the Commission could ask for an interim order against the United Kingdom. If, at the end of the day, it was held that the United Kingdom should have contributed to the budget in full at this stage, any delayed payments would be subject to the penal interest charges that I mentioned.<br/>
Several members of the Treasury and Civil Service Committee argued last week that, contrary to the argument which I have given, payment in full would tend to prejudice the case rather than failure to pay in full. The Government do not accept that view. In our view, the only sensible way to proceed in such cases is to be guided by the judgment of those who are expert in the areas concerned, and our advice has been that it is failure to pay in full that would tend to prejudice our cases, and in particular our request for an interim order.<br/>
There are three particular points. First, our advice is that the court is likely to be more impressed if the Council and member states adopt a common approach than if different member states pursue different courses. The dispute is effectively between the Community's institutions. The more an institution shows itself divided, the weaker its position will be. We have therefore been concerned to co-ordinate our approach with other member states and the Council. Although we shall wish, where appropriate, to bring additional arguments to the attention of the court, we do not want to fragment the Council's position or divert the court's attention from the main area of dispute. As I mentioned before, all other member states will be contributing in full.<br/>
Secondly, the court may be expected to have some regard to the reasonableness of the conduct of the parties before it. Our advice is that our case will not be helped, least of all our application for an interim order, if we act in a way which appears to pre-empt the very judgment that we are asking the court to make. It is worth bearing in mind that our application for an interim order in the present circumstances will, from the Community's point of view, be novel and controversial.</p>

<p>I shall not give way. I have given way at least 10 times already.<br/>
Thirdly, our advice is that there is advantage in being plaintiff rather than defendant throughout the nexus of cases surrounding the disputed budget. Our posture will be strengthened by standing on the high ground rather than being on the defensive. If we did not pay in full, we should almost certainly find ourselves on the defensive. The Commission would almost certainly sue us for the amounts not paid and for penal interest charges on these amounts. It takes the view that member states have an obligation to pay in full towards an adopted budget unless and until the court has ordered otherwise. We would then be defendants in one of the nexus of court cases and our posture would consequently be impaired.<br/>
To sum up, the important thing in the Government's view is to win the court cases, or the European Parliament will gain substantial power at the expense of national Governments and Parliaments. I freely acknowledge how tempting it is not to pay in full in the meantime. However, in the Government's view it would be quite misguided to act in ways which, on the best available legal advice, would tend to prejudice the court cases.<br/>
I turn to the parliamentary and payments procedures. The Select Committee on the Treasury and Civil Service questioned me at some length on these issues last week, and I want to say at once how much I respect and share its wish to protect the rights of this House in matters of Supply.<br/>
Before coming to the substance, I want to stress that the procedures that we are now adopting &#x2014; the Supplementary Estimate and the debate in the House today &#x2014;are those suggested by the Committee's predecessor in the last Parliament in 1982. The Government have complied with its suggestion and that is why the House has the opportunity today to debate the issues fully before any payment is made towards the disputed part of the budget.</p>

<p>On substance, I should like, first, to say something about how payments will be made and financed. The due date for our first VAT payment towards the 1986 budget as adopted by the Parliament is today &#x2014; January's payment is based by convention on the draft budget&#x2014;and the Commission will seek to charge penal interest in the event of any delay. The Government therefore intend, if the House approves the Supplementary Estimate, to credit the Commission's account today with some &#x00A3;12 million in respect of January and February. This will be financed initially from the Contingencies Fund pending formal proceedings in due course on the March Consolidated Fund Bill.<br/>
As I have already mentioned, the Government are applying to the European Court for an interim order suspending implementation of the disputed part of the budget. If our application succeeds, we hope that it will not be necessary to go on contributing to the disputed elements of the budget. If we do not succeed, it may be necessary to make further ex gratia payments in early March and during 1986&#x2013;87. Any such payments would similarly be financed initially by advances from the Contingencies Fund. From April onwards these advances would be made pending parliamentary approval of a 1986&#x2013;87 Estimate and the Appropriation Act next summer.<br/>
Several members of the Select Committee on the Treasury and Civil Service suggested last week that payment should be delayed until the House has passed a


Consolidated Fund Bill. I have considered these suggestions most carefully, but have to say that I cannot accept them. Payment is urgent, and the best interests of the United Kingdom taxpayer require that we should credit the Commission's account tonight.</p>

<p>Can my hon. Friend assure the House that the Government have investigated fully the ability to pay to the Commission on an escrow basis? Such a payment would not prejudge the court's decision, and interest would accumulate for the United Kingdom if we were proved to be right in our application to the court. That is a common practice in commerce.</p>

<p>The Government have investigated that course, but we could not proceed on that basis because of the effect of current European regulations.<br/>
It was not possible to plan on having sufficient time to complete all stages of a Consolidated Fund Bill in both Houses and obtain Royal Assent. These procedures, which are now formal, will be completed as part of the usual March Consolidated Fund Bill. The well understood and recognised role of the Contingencies Fund is to provide for payments that are urgent, in anticipation of Supply procedure. In accordance with the long-established practice, therefore, the Government are justified in assuming that if the House votes in favour of the Estimate tonight, it will not vote differently in the formal proceedings on the Consolidated Fund Bill.<br/>
Finally, I shall say something about the Government's statutory authority for making payments towards the disputed element of the budget. This, too, is a subject which was raised by members of the Select Committee on the Treasury and Civil Service. As the special Supplementary Estimate makes clear, this will be one of the many cases where expenditure relies on the House's approval of the Estimate and, in due course, of the confirming Appropriation Act. In the Government's view, such authority is sufficient and by no means uncommon. I should like to explain to the House rather fully why the Government are in no doubt that this is a perfectly proper way to proceed.<br/>
As long as the House of Commons provides any necessary funds, a Minister can carry out any appropriate function which has not been prohibited by statute. In the present case, there is no legal restriction which prevents the Treasury from making an ex gratia payment to the Community, and funds are available from the Contingencies Fund initially and then through completion of the Supply procedures.<br/>
There are, I accept, cases where specific statutory authority is appropriate, although not legally necessary. The relevant doctrine is based on exchanges between the Treasury and the Committee of Public Accounts in 1932. The Treasury and the PAC reached general agreement on the subject of when an Estimate and the Appropriation Act would not suffice, and I cannot do better therefore than to quote from the relevant Treasury minute on the PAC second report of that year. The Treasury then agreed that
<q>practice should normally accord with the view expressed by the PAC that, where it is desired that continuing functions should be exercised by a Government Department (particularly where such functions involve financial liabilities extending beyond a given year) it is proper that the powers and duties to be exercised should be defined by specific statute.</q>
In all other cases, by implication, the Treasury and the PAC agreed that specific statutory authority was unnecessary.<br/>
The Select Committee on the Treasury and Civil Service referred to "Erskine May", page 791. Our proposed method of proceeding does not fall into either category described by "Erskine May" as having been criticised by the PAC. First, this ex gratia payment is not illegal under any existing statute. Secondly, as I have already implied, we do not propose to create a continuing function of Government involving financial liabilities extending over several years. Perish the thought! The procedure that we are adopting for obtaining the consent of the House is, therefore, fully in accord with established practice and with the recommendations of the PAC.<br/>
There are two conclusions which emerge clearly from what I have been saying. First, the Government are pursuing the right policies with regard to the disputed Community budget for 1986. Secondly, we are seeking Parliament's approval in the right way. I therefore have no hesitation in commending the Supplementary Estimate to the House.</p>

<p>It is incumbent upon me, on behalf of the Opposition, to welcome the Minister of State to the first of his many EEC budget debates. It would not be an exaggeration to say that he has marked his debut at the Dispatch Box by not fully taking the House along with him as he advanced his arguments. Basically, the Government's argument, as I followed it, could be summarised by the example of a Mafia mobster saying, "Here is your demand for protection money. I suggest that you pay it. If you do, you will not have a case for going to the police." That seems in logic to be the way in which the Government's argument is being pursued.<br/>
The outside observer would regard the Government's posture this evening with incredulity, and wonder what it was all about. Is an ex gratia payment really being made by the Government to an illegal budget in Europe? Is it really a Tory Government, who have arraigned Liverpool and Lambeth councillors in the dock for their illegal budgets, who are happily paying over &#x00A3;6 million a month to the EEC in response to an illegal demand? Is this not unreasonable extortion by the extravagant Brussels machine on the understanding and long-suffering British taxpayer, or is it something entirely different?<br/>
On the surface, it seems that we are being presented with a mystery, and the issue was more mysterious when the Minister resumed his place than before he explained the Government's case. In reality, we are faced with a piece of organised hypocricy. We have been presented with a self-generated smokescreen and much of the smoke has been generated by Conservative Back Benchers. The purpose is to disguise the real purpose of the payments.<br/>
The Government have brought in yet another duo of Ministers to deal with complex subject. We have another duo to succeed the great Rifkind-Stewart duet, which sang to us in so many previous debates. It was interrupted only by the Halley's comet of the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Gow), who burst on the stage and made a number of grandiose promises. Before any of us could even quote them, he had disappeared to the Government Back Benches.</p>

<p>I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would like an interpreter for these debates but if he listens carefully he will hear an argument that will appeal even to him.<br/>
In September the Council produced the 1986 draft budget, which made no provision for the costs of the accession of Spain and Portugal, or for the so-called burden of the past. The burden of past commitments is not yet paid. The European Parliament then chose to add those commitments to the budget. Rather than say that the European Parliament was wrong, the Budget Council of Ministers added 900 million ecu to the budget. That included about 320 million ecu for the cost of enlargement which it had omitted from the original draft budget, no doubt through some misunderstanding. The European Parliament was still not satisfied that the budget would meet all the commitments, and the Council of Ministers then offered to add a further 242 million ecu, but the European Parliament turned it down.<br/>
The 242 million ecu is a significant sum. If it had been accepted by the European Parliament it would have reduced the illegality, with which we are so consumed this evening, from 629 million ecu to 387 million ecu. That 242 million ecus would have reduced the illegal supplementary margin to barely 1 per cent. of the total EC budget for 1986. The original climbdown by the Council of Ministers was a visible admission that the original draft budget of September 1985 was wrong and wholly irresponsible, as it was massively short and could not meet the Community's commitments for the following year. If the budget is illegal, the bulk of it is illegal because of the actions of the Budget Ministers, and the Minister was more culpable than most, as he attended the meetings. They knew that they were framing a budget which was inadequate for the demands on it, and they had to admit it to the tune of the 950 million ecu increase that they offered in December.<br/>
In the European Parliament the budget Minister's spokesman confessed in December that a further supplementary budget would be necessary later this year. Yet the Ministers, including our Minister, insisted on artificially cutting the amounts that everyone knew would be needed this year. In January the budget rapporteur, Mr. Christodoulou, offered a compromise to the Ministers. He said that if they would agree to a specific amount for the supplementary budget, a deal could be done because the supplementary budget would be necessary. He was spurned, and the Minister led those who rejected and demanded more cuts in the regional and social funds. He continues to insist on the fairy-tale fantasy of budget discipline and farm spending cuts. He is responsible for the budget.<br/>
This crisis of illegality is self-created, as is the looming and much greater financial shambles facing the Community. It is pure humbug and pedantry of the worst kind for the Government to attack and lambast the European Parliament, whatever its manifest failings, as a cover for the budget Ministers' short-sighted, weak-willed abdiction of control over the common agricultural policy's appetite for Community cash.<br/>
Why this great speed? By midnight tonight the House must agree the payment through one of the most unique forms of parliamentary subterfuge. In April 1985 Ministers passed the intergovernmental agreement to cover the shortfall in the 1984 budget. It was agreed in April, came before the House in June, and the Government

delayed ratification until November and did not make the payment to Europe until a final demand was made by the budget Commissioner at the end of 1985.<br/>
Many hon. Members who questioned the Minister will be interested to know that in 1984, the last full year for which accounts are available, the Court of Auditors' report shows that the European Parliament also added expenditure to the European social and regional funds. Ninety four million ecu was added to the budget, but not a single ecu was spent by the Commission on items outwith the Council of Ministers' budget. Although we shall pay the European Commission, it will not spend the money on the items that are laid down by the European Parliament. Every hon. Member knows that the Commission will spend it by and large on the obligatory side of the equation which grows inexorably every day &#x2014; on more and more Community farm spending. Taxpayers are the last people likely to get back anything from that. In 1984 the Commission ignored the additional provisions, and the money simply disappeared yet again into the vortex.<br/>
The crux of the matter, of which Conservative Members will undoubtedly make a meal, is: if the Government are so sure of their ground on illegality, why are they capitulating so easily and quickly? The supplementary memorandum to the Select Committee makes it absolutely clear. It states:
<q>The Government's lawyers have advised that there is no legal obligation on the United Kingdom to pay the disputed amounts.</q>
That could not be clearer. Why are the Government, who have arraigned councillors and threatened them with disqualification, surcharge and bankruptcy, laying down their arms and surrendering before the European Parliament, if their case is so strong?</p>

<p>Payments to the EEC are made on a monthly basis. If we are right, we can stop those payments at any time and make sure that the balance is kept at the end of the financial period.<br/>
How limp and lame the Minister's explanations are this evening. It is doubtful whether anybody in the House accepted the limp and lame excuses he has given. They seem even more limp and lame when set against the backdrop of the penal sanctions levelled against rate-capped councils in this country. Of course, it does not just smell of that. It smells of a cover for something else which has nothing to do with the claimed illegality of that 1 per cent. of the budget which the Parliament has added to its estimate. The truth is that it is yet another payment to fuel the mighty and uncontrollable engine of the CAP, which is yet again driving the Community into another horrendous financial crisis. This is not a payment on account and it will not be returned to this country even if the court action over the 1 per cent. is a triumph for those self-same legal masterminds.<br/>
In his evidence to the Select Committee the Minister said:
<q>the disputed elements in the budgets are likely either to be repaid to the United Kingdom or to be broadly offset by extra receipts from the budget: the disputed elements related mainly to the Regional Development and the Social Funds.</q>
On Monday December 2 in the <i>Financial Times</i> the regional commissioners of the EEC made it clear that
<q>Britain is in danger of suffering most from the freeze on EEC spending on the social and regional fund next year".</q><br/>
Even if the Minister's prognostications come true we shall not find ourselves in balance, because when the funds for the regional and social fund dry up in the middle of this year, as everybody confidently expects, Britain is likely to lose most. It is simply providing more cash for the EEC to rescue the budget Ministers from the dishonest and shoddy way in which they put together a budget for 1986 which did not add up, will not add up, and cannot add up, and which will inexorably demand more and more cash as the truth catches up with it.</p>

<p>The truth makes the Supplementary Estimate look like a petty cash box. We have a right to expect frankness, perhaps a rare frankness, from the new Minister about the scale of the real crisis and the kind of demands likely to be made on the British taxpayer this year.<br/>
Budget commissioner Hanning Christopherson was right in January when he warned that regional and social fund projects would grind to a halt this year on the basis of present funding. As I said, we have been warned by the regional commissioner that the United Kingdom will suffer most heavily if spending is curtailed. That news is bad enough but as usual there is worse to come. The 1986 budget, even the illegal one over which we are getting

heated this evening, has some vital pieces missing from it. There is no provision in that budget for the 1986 fixing of agricultural prices. We know what that usually leads to. Secondly, and most significantly, there is no provision for a change in the dollar-ecu rate, which has already this year added 400 million ecu to the CAP expenditure. Thirdly, there is no provision for the massive drop in world grain prices, which is likely to bloat European Community costs and keep the price of food ludicrously high for British citizens.<br/>
Mr. Junker, who spoke on behalf of the budget Ministers in the Parliament, was spot on when he warned of an indeterminate supplementary budget to be presented to European taxpayers later in 1986 like some sickening surcharge on a long paid-up continental holiday.</p>

<p>Will the hon. Gentleman bear with me? Many hon. Members wish to speak and I do not want to use too much of the short amount of time that the Government have allowed for the debate.<br/>
The debate is about a European Community, the whole effort of which is now being subverted by a farm policy that has gone berserk and which now consumes 74 per cent. of the entire budget and which again threatens to burst its banks. Agriculture should be at the front of our minds this evening because it is the common agricultural policy that is at the heart of the shambles and that will bring this hapless Treasury Minister, as it did with so many of his predecessors, back to the Dispatch Box again and again this year.<br/>
The newly promoted Secretary of State for Scotland, the predecessor of the new Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, stood at the Dispatch Box on 14 November and used the memorable words "an inbuilt control" when referring to agricultural spending. The right hon. and learned Gentleman has an affectation for not using notes when making his speeches. If one is being generous to him one could say that it was a lack of notes that made him so rash and brave as to utter those words. I think that those words should give comfort to many hon. Members on the Government Back Benches because if someone can say something like that without shame and get in to the Cabinet there is hope for many others to come.<br/>
We now know what he meant by those words. He was talking about a secret report. We know that it is a secret report because we read about it in the <i>Financial Times.</i> That report has been drawn up by Mr. Frans Andriessen and Mr. Henning Christophersen, the farm and budget commissioners. It tells us that the unsold food in store in the European Community is now worth 10&#x00B7;5 billion ecu. That is 10 times the stocks of only four years ago. Cereal stocks alone are up from 6 million tonnes to 17 million


tonnes in the last year. The cost of storage and destocking is up by 1 billion ecu this year, to 4&#x00B7;4 billion ecu. That is nearly one quarter of the entire agricultural budget.<br/>
From the Press Association tapes this evening we learn that the journal <i>Agra Europe</i> tells us that Commissioner Andriessen has today called for an extra &#x00A3;2,000 million over the next three years to set up a special stock dumping fund for special additional subsidies to dump food surpluses on the international market&#x2014;additional money for an additional special fund yet again. That is all happening as farm incomes drop this year across the Community by 8 per cent. and fall in this country by 17&#x00B7;5 per cent. If that is what is known as "inbuilt control" we know precisely how to trust the Government's estimates. All the time the discipline disintegrates as American grain prices fall on the international market.<br/>
In November we reminded the then Common Market team here that the existing budget was only 150 million ecu from the 1&#x00B7;4 per cent. VAT own resources ceiling. We demand and need to know where that is now. There is the extra 400 million ecu for the drop in the dollar-ecu rate. There is the extra &#x00A3;2,000 million over three years for the special fund. The regional and social funds are drying up. The agriculture prices are still unfixed. When all those things are happening, how far are we from the ceiling on own resources? How much will be needed in intergovernmental agreements and cash handouts to the Community this year to keep the bloated food surpluses growing? The House has a right to know, especially in the context of the debate. It is time that Ministers told us what they know to be the truth about what is yet to be demanded.<br/>
The Government come here today telling the House that this is a one-off payment, a temporary payment, until they can get the illegally demanded cash back. They seem willing to face the rage of their Back Benchers, or maybe it is all a big misunderstanding again. Conservative Back Benchers are raging against those payments, made under extortion. The Government want that rage turned away from the incompetence of Ministers, including British Treasury Ministers; away from the sheer irresponsibility of the looming financial fiasco, and what it will mean for this country's taxpayers. The Government want that rage to be turned away from the fact that this is the start of another drip feed, not to food aid or regional or social fund schemes, to which some of us would subscribe, on a regular basis, but to an uncontrollable common agricultural policy. They are willing to face all that rage and embarrassment to protect the pure fiction that this is an ex gratia payment, and a reimbursible one at that. They may fool some of the people in the Chamber, although it seems to be precious few, and they will probably fool a few Conservative hon. Members who vote, but they do not fool the Opposition.<br/>
As the House of Lords report told us in December, the European Community's agriculture budget is out of control because of a "lack of political courage" to do something about it. When the Government and their Ministers representing us in the European Councils have the courage to control farm spending before it bankrupts us all perhaps we shall assist them in putting through measures such as tonight's, but in the meantime, as they watch farm spending spin away again into the red, and

while all the time they champion and protect the charade that budget discipline is working, we shall, with honour and conviction, vote against the motion.</p>

<p>This is the sort of debate for which those concerned with parliamentary control of public expenditure require either a strong stomach or a very strong sense of humour. It raises several serious issues that we shall have little time to debate as we should.<br/>
I do not believe that one's attitude to the Estimate turns on whether one is in favour of or against British membership of the EEC. The plain fact is that it gives rise to more cause for concern for those who, like myself, are in favour of membership of the EEC than for those who take the opposite view. It is a dangerous development that has been described by my hon. Friend the Minister of State.<br/>
I am sorry that the Select Committee on the Treasury and Civil Service was unable to produce a report on the matter because of the short time that we had to go into it. I hope that the evidence that we took, which is available in the Vote Office, will be of interest and help in clarifying a complex situation.<br/>
The Minister of State rightly said that the first part of the Estimate is concerned with repaying to the Contingencies Fund some &#x00A3;118 million, expended at the end of the past year, which meets the tranche of the additional own resources that were paid in advance. I do not wish to comment on that now. I hope that the Select Committee will look further into it. We do not get interest on the advance payment that we have made, and we are now being told that we shall pay penal interest on the ex gratia payment, referred to in the second part of the Estimate.<br/>
We are faced with a budget that is clearly illegal, and raises some difficult questions. It is true that, even if we succeed in the court case and the budget is declared illegal, the budget as it then stands will still be one that the Government oppose as not being consistent with effective budgetary discipline. Yet that is the basis on which the House was persuaded to increase the own resources from 1 per cent. to 1&#x00B7;4 per cent. That is very important. At that time, several of us said that in our view the intergovenmental agreement was not consistent with the treaty, and it was wrong that the situation should arise in which budget expenditure exceeded available revenue. That view has been upheld by the EEC's own Court of Auditors. Therefore, I hope that there will be a further statement on that aspect.<br/>
The Estimate itself raises several important questions about parliamentary procedure, to which the Minister of State referred at the end of his speech. As my hon. Friend said, it is true that in 1982 the Select Committee objected to a system whereby money was paid to the EEC out of the Contingencies Fund and reimbursed by a spring Supplementary Estimate. The procedure now adopted is also objectionable. We have before us an Estimate, but we do not have before us a Consolidated Fund Bill. Under the new procedures nowadays, that is entirely formal. There is no reason why we should not have had a proper Consolidated Fund Bill, even in the short time that is now available to us. That would have been the right procedure for the Government to adopt.


The more important point that gives the Select Committee cause for concern, to which the Minister sought to reply, is the fact that there is no underlying legislation, no primary legislation, which would justify the payment. The House is being asked to make an ex gratia payment that is not covered by existing legislation. As the Minister of State said, it is possible for a Government to put forward an Estimate, a Consolidated Fund Bill and so on, which provides the basis for the expenditure being made. But I question strongly whether what my hon. Friend said in his closing remarks was correct, because the Public Accounts Committee, on former occasions, has drawn attention to the way in which the procedures can be abused. In particular, I refer my hon. Friend to page 791 of "Erskine May," which says:
<q>Expenditure by a department for purposes not covered by its existing legal powers normally requires to be specifically authorised by a financial resolution associated with a bill".</q>
That is not being done in this case. The Minister sought to make a distinction and to say that the circumstances that we now face were appropriate, but "Erskine May" states later on:
<q>There have been cases, too, in which the Appropriation Act has been used, not merely as a substitute for specific legislation, but to override the limits imposed by existing legislation.</q>
The Minister of State did not answer that point. I believe that it is clear that we are overriding
<q>the limits imposed by existing legislation.</q>
That is embodied in the European Communities Act 1972, which in turn is reflected in the treaty. The Government themselves say that what is happening is illegal. Therefore, it seems to me that they are going beyond the existing legislation. That is an abuse of procedure of the sort to which the Public Accounts Committee has objected. I hope very much that the Public Accounts Committee will look into that matter and let us have a considered view. Perhaps such abuses could be prevented in future by the Standing Order being amended, for example.<br/>
It is also objectionable to use the Contingencies Fund if one has time to go through the proper procedures. There is no reason why we should go on this merry-go-round. We could have had the Estimate, a Consolidated Fund Bill and a Bill justifying the payment in the time that is available, short though that has been.</p>

<p>I should like to continue because hon. Members wish to speak, and this is a difficult matter to explain.<br/>
I now come to the substance of the argument. I welcome the fact &#x2014; it is common ground &#x2014; that the Government believe that the way in which the European Parliament has behaved is illegal. In my view, they are right to fight the case, as the Council of Ministers is right to fight the case. It would be an enormous extension of the powers of the European Parliament if it were allowed to get away with what it is seeking to do.<br/>
The Government are right to take the action that they have proposed. Nevertheless, I am very doubtful about the ex gratia payment device. The Select Committee was told that it was essential that this procedure should be ratified by midnight tonight, otherwise there is a danger that we shall be charged interest on the ex gratia payment. This is pure Alice in Wonderland. We ought not to be confronted by such a ridiculous situation.<br/>
I believe I am right in saying that all Conservative Members have grave doubts&#x2014;nobody, apart from my hon. Friend the Minister of State, has expressed a contrary view &#x2014; that our chance of winning the case will be enhanced if an ex gratia payment is made. If the Government have confidence in the strength of their case, that is a very odd approach.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Epping Forest (Sir J. Biggs-Davison) asked whether we would get back the ex gratia payment if we won the case. I was heartened when my hon. Friend the Minister said that it could be deducted from a future payment, but I should like to know the basis for his statement. I was not aware that we could adopt such a procedure.</p>

<p>I am not sure that I understand that answer. We should like to know the basis for my hon. Friend the Minister's statement. It appears to contain a large number of uncertainties.

<p>The fact that interest rates are higher in this country than in most of the other European Community countries suggests, surely, that the penalty factor should weigh less with us than with others, and it is all the more reason for us to be given credit for the interest charged if the payment is found to have been unnecessary.</p>

<p>I agree with my hon. Friend. Most unfortunately, however, the Select Committee understood that we should be charged a penal rate, the highest rate in the European Community, which is over 20 per cent. I am therefore unable to reassure my hon. Friend on that point.<br/>
The argument is simple. It turns upon the legal advice and the expert advice that was given. After two and a half hours of questioning, in which my hon. Friend the Minister of State, Treasury, was as forthcoming as he could possibly be, he failed completely to produce any substantial legal argument which suggested that we stand a better chance in the European Court if we pay in advance than if we do not pay in advance. It was pointed out earlier that it would be very surprising if the European Court were to be influenced by that kind of payment.<br/>
The whole matter gives one very grave cause for concern. There is no evidence that budgetary discipline is effective. The non-obligatory payments are in excess and the obligatory payments for agriculture are far in excess of anything that had been justified in argument to the House. Unless, therefore, my hon. Friend the Minister of State can do very much better in his winding up speech than he did in his opening speech, I fear that I shall be unable to support the motion.</p>

I presume that we should not be going to the European Court unless there was an argument about its legality. I presume that we should not otherwise be going to the European Court to establish whether its action was legal or illegal.<br/>
There is also uncertainty about whether the Government have exceeded their proper powers. I fail to follow why an ex gratia payment should affect a judgment of the European Court. It was suggested in an intervention by the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) that the judges of the European Court are politically corrupt. That may have been a rumbustious way of putting it rather than a serious suggestion. At least, I hope so. In our view, the Community budget&#x2014;</p>

The Community budget is inadequate to meet effectively the redistributive and regenerative roles of the European Community, which have been unable to develop properly. I refer in particular to the regional and social funds. I recall, because I was there, that when the right hon. Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Jenkins) was the President of the European Commission he referred not to a 2&#x00B7;5 per cent. but to a 1&#x00B7;4 per cent. of VAT budget. The Liberal and Social Democratic parties believe that a way should be found to give the directly elected European Parliament more budgetary authority. That was stated clearly in our manifesto.</p>

<p>Before I give way to the hon. Gentleman&#x2014;there must be a record kept somewhere of

such things&#x2014;for perhaps the 54th time, I would remark, as the Minister did en passant during his speech, that the agreement on budgetary discipline, which with some justice has attracted a bit of scorn, has, nevertheless, not yet been breached on non-obligatory expenditure, where, after all, the problem of excessive expenditure arises.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his courtesy. He says that he would like the European Parliament to have greater budgetary powers.

<p>Certainly a sharing of burden. One of the great criticisms of the European Parliament at the moment is that it has the power only to spend taxation without any responsibility for the raising of it. There is no direct accountability, and that is a fair criticism. So, yes, essentially I would agree with the hon. Gentleman, but before I leave that point I must add that we must remember that while it is true that the European Parliament has added to the budget, when it comes to the actual expenditure of that money it is not the Parliament that spends it, but the Commission, and the Council regulates that expenditure and determines what are the proper projects.<br/>
Essentially, I am saying that the situation in which we now find ourselves need not have arisen if the Government had adopted a positive approach in Milan and Luxembourg when there were the makings of an acceptable accord in the Council which Parliament would have considered to represent a reasonable response. We have brought this on ourselves. It is tragic that we should now have got ourselves into what is clearly a thorough-going legal mess, which, in response to an intervention from the hon. Member for Northampton, North (Mr. Marlow) the Minister said could well go on for 18 months or so before a determination is made, and it is likely that the institutional conflict will worsen during that time.<br/>
The way in which the European Parliament has behaved has been heavily criticised by those unfavourably disposed to the EEC in the press and elsewhere, and doubtless there will be criticism during the debate, but, as the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) said in an incisive speech, this is "a self-created crisis" and those responsible are the Ministers whose original draft budget was grossly inadequate and who failed abjectly in a situation in which a rational negotiated settlement could have been achieved. To that failure British Ministers made their full contribution.<br/>
The Parliament has added 1 per cent. of its budget. That is the scale of this issue, as the hon. Gentleman reminded us. I must support the hon. Gentleman on the fact that the regional and social funds may run out. That is a real danger. He is right. That is the sort of thing to which the Government should be addressing themselves anxiously. I also agree that the problem of the CAP is at the heart of this. Although, as I have said many times, it is an illusion to believe that somehow or other that can be dealt with at a stroke, what disturbs me is the absence of a clear forward plan.<br/>
That is the serious issue, not the desire of the Parliament to try to ensure that the Community's limited


social contribution is sustained. Those circumstances do not require one to oppose the Government in the Lobby, even though one is highly critical of the way in which they have conducted affairs.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Hamilton then spoke mostly about agricultural policy, but I agree with the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir R. Johnston) that he put his finger on the reality of what had happened in what amounted to the Council of Ministers' obstinacy and obduracy in failing to grasp the realities of the situation with the enlargement of the Community. What other course did the European Parliament have, faced with that obduracy and refusal to draft a proper budget, even to use the appropriate conciliation mechanism, than to do something that can be regarded in some circles as an illegal act? We may have to reserve our judgment on that until the European Court reaches its decision. It may dig up all sorts of precedents and evidential items which show that the European Parliament had no other realistic course of action. It would be wrong to predjudge that, so we are dealing with only a technical motion tonight.</p>

<p>Is not the argument about what else they could do exactly the same argument used by the Socialist councillors of Camden and Liverpool who took the view that the limitations imposed by the Government did not allow them to spend as much money as they felt was right? Therefore, is not my hon. Friend supporting the Socialist councillors of Camden and Liverpool in breaking the law?</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="380281" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1986-02-03a.61.6" hansard_membership_id="3715" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/14413" speakername="Mr. Dykes" colnum="61" time="17:53:00">
<p>Despite the obvious temptations, my hon. Friend is not right in trying to draw that comparison between the domestic political crisis between local authorities and the Government, and the European situation. The conciliation and consultation procedure in the budget formation of the EC is a different exercise where the parties get together round a negotiating table and negotiate agreed figures, not on obligatory expenditure but on non-obligatory items.<br/>
Once again, it shows that the whole budget procedure is out of kilter because the European Parliament should now have a greater role and should be able to deal with much more than a tiny marginal tranche of total spending in non-obligatory categories unless the Council of Ministers is to be more like-minded with the European Parliament in future on taking budget outlays ahead as the Community expands, both on enlargement and the need to spend more on the regional and social funds.<br/>
Of course, hon. Members and others are right to put their finger on the glaring problem that is building up over

agricultural spending. But in dealing with the motion tonight it is absurd for my hon. Friends&#x2014;there is a glaring absence of Labour Members, who, apart from one distinguished presence on the Opposition Back Benches, do not seem to be interested, and Members of other parties,&#x2014;to express, I hope not in a semi-hysterical fashion, tremendous indignation about what is a technical motion on a Supplementary Estimate. I think that it is literally correct to say that it should excite no one beyond saying that we are all in the business of trying to control, rationally and reasonably, Government spending.<br/>
We all listen with great care to everything that my right hon. Friend the Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) says on this subject. He knows a profound amount about it. But even he faces the danger of always being much more excited and indignant about tiny amounts of money in the EC than about domestic items. We are talking about &#x00A3;6 million a month of extra interest payments to be incurred and &#x00A3;18 million over three months in comparison with huge quantities of domestic Government spending which, if one looks back at the record of what was said in Committee and in the House, he and other hon. Members do not get so worked up about.<br/>
I do not often hear my hon. Friend the Member for Southend, East (Mr. Taylor) referring to the fact that we now spend &#x00A3;20 billion on unemployment benefits because of our huge level of unemployment. Surely that is a much more serious problem than the minuscule amounts of money in the EC. Even the total budget of &#x00A3;22 billion. is tiny in comparison with the total United Kingdom Government's spending of &#x00A3;150 billion. Our portion, moreover, as a result of the budget rebate&#x2014;that has not been referred to so far tonight, although we are only halfway through the debate, and I hope that my hon. Friends will refer to it&#x2014;swamps any tiny amount that we have to pay here, we hope temporarily, as a result of the future court judgment, on the basis, I presume, of expert legal advice.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Minister referred to that and I am content that on the basis of sound legal advice from Government lawyers, they have decided that that is correct. The revelation of Legal advice to Government is always a difficult area. I said that on the basis of what my hon. Friend said. I am content to rest on his recommendation that, on the basis of legal advice received by the Government, it seems right to make that payment. It would look awful and crazy if we were to take a position separate from the other member states who, with their equally clever and highly paid Government lawyers, have decided to pay the money in advance. It would look ridiculous if there were a difference of position. The court would notice that immediately.<br/>
It is important for the position of the Council, even of one disagrees with the larger background which, as a good and enthusiastic European I do, that it and the Government should maintain the same position. Perhaps the Governmment feel that they are likely to win the case anyway, and then the money can be refunded.</p>

<p>If my hon. Friend will forgive me, I shall not give way, because by looking at the clock, I know that it would be unfair on other hon. Members.<br/>
Let me assume that the money could be refunded. To some extent, this is new territory, and I can only say with


my subjective confidence that we shall get most of the money back. This is the only, absolutely essential, way for the Government to establish their moral position in the face of such a course of action. They must be whiter than white as they approach the European Court, and be able to say that they have done certain things that their legal advisers have suggested that they do.<br/>
This may be a historical judgment about the relationships between the institutions of the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament. Tonight's motion is only a small, limited part of the wider scene and it would be wholly irresponsible for hon. Members, particularly those on my side of the House, not to support the Government on the motion, which remains entirely technical. It is not a matter to cause great anxiety and it is much more important to see the wider picture both for the development of the Community budget &#x2014; the 1986&#x2013;87 budget will be even more important because of its expenditure on agriculture&#x2014;and the way in which the Government will respond when the court has had time to deliberate.</p>

<p>I remind the hon. Member for Harrow, East (Mr. Dykes) that big issues can arise from the expenditure of small amounts of money. I refer him to the 1630s and the case of ship money, which eventually involved the country in a civil war. The principle is what is important, rather than the amounts at stake.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) made an interesting speech. Tonight we are dealing with a House of Commons matter, to which there are two aspects. The right hon. Member spoke about one aspect, that of Supply procedures and so on. The PAC, of which I have the honour to be a member, may need to take a look at procedures again. Apparently it has not done so since 1932.<br/>
The PAC should say, in the light of the interim judgment given by the court, whether we should seek to make some other recommendations, if the court were to refuse the interim judgment for which the Government have asked and we were therefore obliged to make these ex gratia payments until the court had reached a substantive judgment later in the year. In those circumstances, we would have to make sure that the Government provided time in the next financial year for us to consider these things properly as this Supplementary Estimate takes us only to the end of the financial year.<br/>
Some substantive issues have been raised. This is a House of Commons matter, and I am concerned about the aspects of the relationship between the Assembly and the Council of Ministers. In a sense, the Council of Ministers is a euphemism for national Governments and Parliaments, because that is what it represents. The issues that we have raised are at least as important as those raised when we discussed the intergovernmental agreement which was outwith the treaties and possibly the most important aspect of our relationship with the EEC institutions since we joined in 1972&#x2013;73.<br/>
I have been pointing out for several years that the Assembly is constantly seeking to increase its powers. I see at least four federalists here today, on both sides of the House, and they will naturally welcome that move. In its

attempts to increase its powers, the Assembly is constantly aided and abetted by the Commission and, where appropriate, by the European Court. I am not as sanguine as the Government that we shall necessarily win the dispute when the Court makes its substantive judgment.<br/>
The Assembly has passed an illegal budget and the Commission is backing that against the Council. This is part of the process of creeping federalism, whereby Community institutions are always working to increase their power, not always but often, at the expense of national Parliaments, and there is a ratchet effect because power once conceded to the EEC is never regained. Therefore, the Assembly, the Commission, the Council and the Court are constantly receiving accretions of power, gained in various ways and through various procedures within the Community. That strengthens their power as against national Governments and Parliaments.<br/>
Control of finance is the key to power, as we know from the history of this country, and the Assembly recognises that. In its budget resolution, the first of two last year, on 14 November 1985 it said, in paragraph 9:
<q>the Commission should submit to the budgetary authority a proposal for a minimum-term course of action taking account of the need for the gradual transfer of certain funding operations from the national to the Community framework".</q>
Funding operations are a means of raising money &#x2014; forms of taxation. That shows the way that the mind of the Assembly is always working. We should always have that in the back of our minds.<br/>
The battle between the Assembly and the Council over funding is a battle between the Assembly and national Parliaments. The House could teach many in Europe a great deal about these things. We also have an important right. Federalists will support the Assembly, and we have already heard one or two expressions of support. However, non-federalists, and even those in favour of the Community, such as the right hon. Member for Worthing, will have to take careful note of what the Assembly is trying to do. Even the Government, in the Treasury minute to the Select Committee on the Treasury and Civil Service, made clear their view that this would be a major change in the balance of power between Community institutions, and therefore between Community institutions and this national sovereign Parliament.<br/>
As is well known, the history of our Parliament started with disputes between Parliament and the Crown over the power to tax people. It was only later that Parliament sought to gain control of expenditure. In the case of the Assembly, the process has begun in reverse, partly because of the powers given to it in the Community treaties. It is starting with the power to spend money. In paragraph 16 of the budget resolution it says that the Assembly
<q>Takes the view that the Community cannot ignore or curtail, via the budget for 1986, the financial commitments it has entered into: is therefore resolved to ensure compliance with this principle throughout the budgetary procedure".</q>
In other words, it is saying that spending must take priority over raising money to finance the expenditure. Eventually that will lead to the Assembly demanding the power to tax as well. We have already heard something about this from the federalists tonight.<br/>
The annual report of the Assembly is entitled "Progress towards Integration" and it shows, in the report of the budgetary committee, that it is working towards this. At long last, the Government have finally woken up to this creeping federalism. It was remarkable that the Prime


Minister, in her statement to the House on the Luxembourg summit, consistently throughout both statement and answers&#x2014;I bet that there were many anguished faces in the Foreign Office &#x2014; used the words " European Assembly" to describe what she had previously called the European Parliament.<br/>
The Assembly has been encouraged in this spendthrift approach by the big increase in own resources that this House and other Parliaments have granted. Its debates show that the Assembly is looking forward to the 1&#x00B7;6 per cent. VAT rate being introduced at a much earlier date than the Council and the Government would wish.<br/>
But that is not the only thing that has encouraged the Assembly in its spending spree. It has now proved possible, through the intergovernmental agreement, to raise money outside the framework of the treaties. Those two facts combined have convinced the Assembly that it an do what it likes on spending&#x2014;we shall see more of this in the future&#x2014;because national Governments will pay in any case, whether the spending is legal or illegal and whether or not it exceeds the budget. That is a cavalier attitude to expenditure and a threat to budget discipline.<br/>
The House must accept that the Assembly does not consider itself bound by budget discipline. Paragraph 12 of the budget resolution of 14 November states that the Assembly
<q>expresses its support for measures to contain expenditure as part of a coherent reform of the common agricultural policy, but demands that the nature of such containment be jointly defined by the budgetary authority and the Commission"&#x2014;</q>
that is, the Assembly and the Commission&#x2014;
<q>and repudiates any unilateral decision by the Council in the matter.</q>
That means that the Assembly will not go along with budgetary discipline until its powers are substantially increased by agreement with the Council and, no doubt, with national Governments.<br/>
The Assembly is now an enemy of national Parliaments in the EEC. It is competing for a share of the real power currently exercised by national Parliaments. It is encouraged by more powers than were given to it at the Luxembourg summit. It has an insatiable appetite for power and it must be stopped. The question is whether the action that the Government are taking will stop it.<br/>
I hope that the Minister can reply later to two semi-legal points. First, the Council is taking action under article 173 of the Treaty of Rome which states:
<q>The Court of Justice shall review the legality of acts of the Council and the Commission other than recommendations or opinions.</q>
Nothing in that article states that the court shall review the actions of the European Assembly. Therefore, it makes it all the more astonishing that, with all their substantial legal advice, the national Governments represented at the last Council meeting did not seek to couple the Commission with the Assembly in the substantive court case. If they had coupled the two, they might have lost on the Assembly&#x2014;because it is not mentioned in the article&#x2014;but they would almost certainly have won on the Commission. I do not understand why the Government weakened their case on the substantive issue by not using the words in article 173 and taking parallel action against the Commission.<br/>
If the Minister cannot reply to my second point tonight, I hope that he will none the less consider it carefully, because it is in the interests not only of the House but of the Government. Later this year, we are threatened with a supplementary budget&#x2014;everyone agrees that that is

likely&#x2014;and my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) made clear what the components of that budget would be and what its causes would be. If there is a supplementary budget, in addition to the budget that the European Assembly increased, will that not weaken our case before the court? We shall be asking national Parliaments for money additional to the budget that was originally approved by the Council and rejected by the Parliament. If I were not parti pris in the matter. it would suggest to me that the European Assembly was right in its attitude to Community expenditure in 1986. If and when the Government are faced with a supplementary budget, I ask them to think carefully about whether it might prejudice their position and that of the Council on the main issue.<br/>
If the United Kingdom loses, the Council and national Parliaments will have serious problems. More power will be granted to the European Assembly and it will mean an end to any semblance of budget discipline. An adverse verdict would lead to a crisis in the relationship between Britain and the rest of the EEC. I look forward to that very much.</p>

<p>Anyone listening to my hon. Friend the Minister of State opening the debate would have concluded that it was a debate of great technicality and that only those who have studied the European institutions and obtained a PhD in law could usefully consider the matter further, but that is not so. The debate is mostly about a relatively simple value judgment as to how people get their will in political institutions.<br/>
We start with the assertion set out in the Government's briefing to the Treasury and Civil Service Select Committee that the legal advice is that failure to pay in full would impair the United Kingdom's posture before the European Court.

He has never &#x2014; as my right hon. and learned Friend the Foreign Secretary would say&#x2014;addressed himself to the question of how the judges could disadvantage the United Kingdom in the proceedings. It must be emphasised that there are multiple proceedings. Of course, the proceedings brought by the Council could be dropped, but separate proceedings have been brought by France, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.<br/>
We know that France, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands have already paid on the nail, so let us consider the likelihood that at least one of those nations will continue with its proceedings. How will it be possible, on this issue of principle, to disadvantage the United Kingdom as against another nation state? My hon. Friend has not explained, and I do not believe that it is explicable.<br/>
My hon Friend has not explained whether he is serious in his implied criticism that the EEC judges are affected by political considerations, but that is perhaps a narrow point.</p>

<p>I share the mystery. Like all great mysteries, it is incapable of explanation. Had it been capable of explanation, I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister of State would have explained it long ago.<br/>
We are talking about political will. Anyone who observes the forces in the EEC institutions and here must have sympathy for a Treasury Minister who is trying to contain expenditure in the EC. The hon. Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Deakins) set out helpfully and with great knowledge the way in which the European Parliament, as it calls itself, wishes to extend its power to the disadvantage of the Council of Ministers, often with the connivance of the Commission. There are assertions that a proper system of budgetary control has been instituted, but we must compare those assertions with our knowledge that the American farmer will be substantially better supported by a new farm Bill. We know that the Americans are trying to reduce the value of their currency against that of other countries, and we know the effect that that will have on the cost of disposing of farm surpluses created by the EEC. Those who see those forces must sympathise with the Treasury in trying to push back this vast tide that is enveloping it.<br/>
We must also consider the political forces. The Labour party says that it favours strict control of expenditure in the EEC, but it also talks about the EEC being an organisation that can reduce unemployment in Britain. Labour Members speak in grandiloquent, even mawkish terms, about the regional and social funds. Even if the present Government are, at best, only lukewarm on industrial intervention, we are led to believe that a Labour Government would favour more EEC expenditure to create jobs.<br/>
The Liberal party is much more open about that. It is in favour of a very much higher level of expenditure, particularly on the infrastructure of the EEC. To that end, Liberal spokesmen say that they would be in favour of a much higher contribution from VAT to the EEC. They are quite open about that.<br/>
The constitutional, economic and political forces are all against the restriction of expenditure in the EEC. What is required most of all from the United Kingdom at the present time is a gesture of political will. We have the opportunity now to demonstrate that gesture, and that would not cost very much. Let us assume that my hon. Friend the Minister is correct in saying that, in this instance, that would lead to the imposition of penal interest charges. We are talking about only &#x00A3;18 million, so the penal interest would not be very high, but the gesture would demonstrate to everyone in this country &#x2014; farmers, those who want extra payments from the regional fund and the multiplicity of interest groups that are ganged up behind increased expenditure in the EEC&#x2014;that the Government are serious on this issue.<br/>
In the face of that, the Government have said that they have received expert legal advice. They do not want to tell us what that legal advice is and they will not be too specific about it. They do not mind junior Ministers coming before a Select Committee and having a disagreeable time for a couple of hours, but they will not condescend to particularities about that. All that the Government want us to know is that they have jolly good legal advice and, what is more, they probably paid pretty well for it.<br/>
Be that as it may, most legal advice of that sort is a value judgment. It is a judgment about how institutions and people respond to a token gesture. We now have an

opportunity for a token gesture. The mood in this country towards the EEC is changing. In 1974 I campaigned for us to enter and remain in the EEC, but I, as well as anybody, now feel a change in mood.<br/>
In the Fontainebleau agreement, the Government, by giving a moral commitment to a further increase in the VAT contribution, while at the same time asserting that they had control over expenditure in the EEC, placed themselves in a difficult situation. If the Government come to the House time after time asking for more and yet more money, at some stage the nation will want to know why the Government did not refuse to pay what they regarded as an illegal demand. It would have been an illegal demand in respect of &#x00A3;18 million only, but the nation will want to know why the Government did not have the guts on this one occasion to say, enough is enough.<br/>
We are not really talking about legal advice. Rather, it is a matter of the Government's desire on all occasions to be seen as Communautaire, to go along with the consensus in Europe. The consensus in Europe, like the consensus within the interest groups in the member states, is towards increased expenditure. That uncontrolled expenditure is deeply damaging to those who hope that this country will continue to remain in the EEC.</p>

<p>Today's debate goes to the heart of the European issue. Many would argue against giving greater powers to the European Parliament as it encroaches upon the sovereignty of our country. That argument comes from the so-called internationalists on the Labour Benches and from those Conservative Members who argue that Britain's sovereignty is being eroded by the EEC.<br/>
It ill suits those who criticise the EEC for being remote and bureaucratic to be against the proposed expenditure, except on the narrow legal grounds touched upon in the debate. The elected EEC Parliament has amended a budget proposal from the Commission that would absurdly have made Portugal and Spain net contributors to the Community &#x2014; Portugal being one of the poorest countries in the EEC. If that had not been corrected, if the Parliament had failed to exercise the proper scrutiny over the EEC budget, there would be no control over the Commission's proposals&#x2014;and in Strasbourg I witnessed the deliberations as the Parliament went line by line, page by page, through a great volume of EEC budget proposals &#x2014; other than the control exercised in these debates by hon. Members. With the best will in the world, that cannot be classified as detailed or even detailed scrutiny.</p>

<p>I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's point, but does he agree that one of the anomalies is that the Assembly, while having some powers&#x2014;now under argument &#x2014; of increasing expenditure, has as yet no powers of taxation? If it were to have both, there would be a unitary state. If the Assembly is to have some power, does the hon. Gentleman agree that it should, as the House did during the 1780s, combine these powers? There is no way out of the conundrum that the hon. Gentleman is proposing.</p>

<p>I accept the hon. Gentleman's point, but there are some hon. Members, and I am one, who believe in the principle of no taxation without representation. If


the European Parliament can continue to extend its financial control over the EEC budget, that will be a step towards greater accountability and representation.<br/>
If the anti-Marketeers were heeded, there would be more power for the Commission and the bureaucrats and less power for the elected representatives of the people of this country. Let us remember that the elected Members of the European Parliament sit as representatives for the people of this country.<br/>
The nitpicking, small-minded, critical tone of EEC debates is sometimes sad to witness. Strengthening the European Parliament is another crucial step on the road towards greater European integration. In 1945 the second great war of this century came to an end. Less than 30 years later, all the main European countries which fought that war, on the Continent that shaped the rest of the world, were joined in a Community which banished for ever war between them.<br/>
That was a political miracle of astonishing dimensions. For a decade, however, little else has happened. The Community has expanded and become a formidable trading block but progress towards the accountability of its institutions &#x2014; that is what is enshrined by the move towards budgetary accountability in the Parliament, and towards political union&#x2014;has moved at a snail's pace.<br/>
To most people, Europe represents the stuff of today's debate. The Community is steeped in obscure financial haggling and there is constant fire from hon. Members on both sides of the House who argue that it is wasting our resources and usurping our national sovereignty. They do not realise that Britain's real sovereignty, our say in determining our own destiny, has already been usurped by the bigger political and economic powers in today's world. European co-operation is the only way of regaining a say in the major issues that affect us all.</p>

<p>I agree with my hon. Friend. Is it not really sad to reflect that the only places where such absurd debates still occur are in this country, in Demark in its slightly eccentric way, particularly given the recent resolution in its Parliament, and in Greece which is very esoteric and bloody-minded anyway?</p>

<p>I agree wholeheartedly with my hon. Friend, although for safety's sake I shall not associate myself with his remarks about the Greeks.<br/>
For 10 years, we have seen Europe ignored as a priority and degenerate into a series of annual bazaars for the allocation of EEC resources, coupled with well-meaning but always frustrated calls for the reform of the Community budget. The wider issues on which Europe can and should be making its voice heard are forgotten. On each of those wider issues there are 12 faint EEC voices&#x2014;not one strong one&#x2014;all of which are lost in the roar of super-power dialogue. The only way that we can regain our sovereignty and our say on those grave issues is to act with greater unity.<br/>
Considerable effort has been made to find a common European view on the Arab-Israeli conflict. Those efforts are to be applauded. How much more important is it that a common position be adopted on the greatest issue facing the Continent since the cold war began &#x2014; that of controlling the arms race before it enters a new, dangerous and vastly expensive phase. Today, the Russian fear of the American strategic defence initiative&#x2014;</p>

<p>Perhaps I can help my hon. Friend return to the subject that we are discussing. He made the interesting point that part of the expenditure was necessary because Portugal, one of the poorest members of the enlarged Community, would be a net contributor. This country is now one of the poorest members of the Community and we are a contributor. Is that one of the reasons why we are so unhappy about this increased expenditure? Does not the breakdown in budgetary control go against the need for unity which I believe he said was the Common Market's greatest strength?</p>

<p>I associate myself wholeheartedly with my hon. Friend's remarks. For most people, Europe is represented by the kind of detail that we have been discussing and is not seen as the uplifting ideal that it once was. I hope that it is not too late to revive the ideal of a united and respected Europe and Community whose values, civilisation and good sense exceed those of the great powers that dominate today's bipolar world and which can act as a bridge between them. In that context, I welcome recent moves towards European foreign policy co-operation.<br/>
If Europe can find a common voice in the world, economic integration and the greater accountability of EEC institutions will follow at their own pace. In the meantime, the House should vote to support the greater accountability of EEC institutions to the people's elected representatives. Let us strengthen powers of the European Parliament. Let us strengthen the cause of Europe and democratic accountability, and let us approve these Supplementary Estimates.</p>

<p>I do not agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, East (Mr. Dykes) that we are discussing a narrow technical point. It is a matter of considerable principle. There are a number of


matters about the current EEC budget and the proposals before the House that I find deeply disturbing. Clearly, time will not allow me to deal with them all.<br/>
If the actions being taken in the court by the United Kingdom and the other four countries fail, the whole agreement negotiated by the United Kingdom when it approved the lifting of the VAT ceiling from 1 to 1&#x00B7;4 per cent. will become worthless.<br/>
Budget discipline was one of the salient points of that agreement. We were assured in the House by the Prime Minister that that agreement would give us effective budget discipline. If the Assembly's action is upheld in the court, it will drive a coach and horses through the agreement. Those of us who opposed the increases in net resources will be completely vindicated. Will my hon. Friend tell the House what contingency plans the Government have should they lose the court case? I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Clywd, South-West (Mr. Harvey) that it is not beyond the realms of possibility that they could lose it.<br/>
I wish to deal with the so-called ex gratia payment into court. I found it disturbing to be told by my hon. Friend the Minister before the Select Committee on the Treasury and Civil Service and in the House today that he had been advised by his legal advisers that if we did not make an ex gratia payment our position in the case would be jeopardised. That is not just against the tradition of British justice; it is against natural justice.</p>

<p>I sincerely hope not. My hon. Friend is a little cynical. The Government are implying that the court is incapable of making a fair and balanced judgment on the issue before it&#x2014;whether it is a legal or an illegal budget&#x2014;but will be influenced by whether this country makes an ex gratia payment in respect of what we submit is an illegal demand. If that is how European justice works, how can we ever expect fair and impartial decisions to come out of the European Court?<br/>
I should like to deal with the subject of interest. It is inconceivable to anyone brought up with the idea of equity before the courts to believe that if we make an ex gratia payment in advance and win we are not paid interest on that payment, but if we do not make a payment and lose we pay a 20 per cent. penal rate of interest. That is unjust and indefensibe.</p>

<p>As I understand it, my hon. Friend is a successful business man. We have two alternatives. We believe that we are right and that we will succeed in the court. If we withhold the money and turn out to be wrong, we will have to pay the money plus the interest. That, however, is a small chance. If we believe that we are right, and we are found to be right, we shall not have paid the money. My hon. Friend is a business man.

<p>Does my hon. Friend agree that, in view of the great sums of money involved in our contribution to the EEC, the interest on &#x00A3;18 million, even at 20 per

<p>My hon. Friend has made a relevant point. He should remember that the total cost is not 20 per cent., because we would save the interest on the money that we would have to pay through the gilt market. The net cost would probably be only 8 per cent.<br/>
Unless my hon. Friend's reply is far more convincing than his opening speech, I, like my right hon. Friend the Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) will find that I cannot support the Government in the Lobby tonight.</p>

<p>On the Third Reading debate of the EC Finance Bill the then Minister of State, Treasury, the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Gow) was asked by the hon. Member for Northampton, North (Mr. Marlow) to
<q>give a commitment to the House &#x2026; that there will be no soft loans, intergovernmental agreements, whip rounds or any other form of temporary subvention to the Community".</q>
The Minister, of course, had the sense to decline, although he did say:
<q>provided that the budgetary discipline that has been agreed is observed &#x2026; there will be no need to come back to the House for another intergovernmental agreement.</q>
He later added:
<q>I find it impossible to envisage circumstances in which the Government will come back to the House."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 22 October 1985; Vol. 84, c. 185-188.]</q><br/>
Neither the Minister nor we imagined this rather extraordinary set of circumstances in which the Government would come back to the House to demand a Supplementary Estimate. It is apparently designed, dare I say, to sweeten the judges so that they will judge in our favour.<br/>
One of the questions that hon. Members have rightly pursued in this debate is what is the exact nature of the European Court. The Treasury itself stated in evidence to the Treasury and Civil Service Select Committee that payment of this kind would
<q>enable the United Kingdom to present its arguments before the Court in the most attractive light, a factor seen as an important advantage".</q>
The Minister will have to tell us a great deal more about how he and his officials view the workings of the European Court in regard to this advance payment. The Government should tell us more about the nature of their own legal advice &#x2014; they certainly have not been so coy about revealing the nature of their legal advice in the recent past. The Minister has many questions to answer.<br/>
The Minister, in his opening remarks, said that it was necessary for the United Kingdom to act in the same way as the other Council members who are also pursuing this case before the court. Why did the United Kingdom, together with the other European members of the Council, not come to a quite different view? Why did they not agree that no one should pay until the court case was settled? Surely that would have been possible by agreement. Why was that not done?<br/>
The reason for the advance payment, before the court case has been settled &#x2014; as the Minister knows well, despite assurances given to the House &#x2014; is that extra funds will be needed anyway. When the Minister was pressed about the possibility of withholding payment if the


judgment goes in our favour, he said that this was possible. The Minister did not say that we would be in a situation where we would withhold payments of that kind.<br/>
The Minister and the Government know that this will not be the first time that the Government will come back to the House this year and ask for more money. This &#x00A3;18 million is only the first request. The spokesman for the Commission, Mr. Junker, has already said that there would be a supplementary budget required during the course of 1986. When will that happen and how much will it be? The Minister and the Government cannot continue to rely on the claim that budget discipline has been achieved and that there will be no need to come back to the House.<br/>
There are two issues on which the Government might find themselves in difficulties. First, there is the question of the regional and social funds. It is true that that is non-obligatory expenditure, but the expenditure which the European Assembly added to the budget was added for two reasons. First, it was added because over 50 per cent. of the regional and social funds element of the budget refers to past commitments. That means that this year the Commission may not be able to meet promises that have already been made for payments under the heading of the regional and social funds. The second reason is that the European Assembly takes the view that agricultural spending, running at 70 per cent. of the budget, absorbs far too much of the budget.<br/>
If the regional and social funds run out of money and if we refuse to pay any additional money into the European budget we shall lose because much of that money would come to us. Have the Government thought about this problem and if so what conclusions have they reached?<br/>
The Government have refused to face up to the problems of agricultural spending. During the course of this debate it has already been stated that any fall in the dollar-ecu exchange rate below 1&#x00B7;2 will lead to budget increases in terms of export refund payments. A fall of 4 per cent. has already taken place this year and that means another &#x00A3;400 million on export refund payments alone. No agreement on cereal prices has been reached but this is not the only problem which agricultural spending faces.<br/>
In the newspapers this weekend there were reports about our food surplus, which increased by 75 per cent. to &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;4 billion last year. Inevitably that means a rise in the cost of servicing the stores of such surplus stocks. <i>The Observer</i> reported that the European Commission is planning to dump &#x00A3;4 billion worth of surplus food on to the world market over the next three years. The cost of that would be at least &#x00A3;2 billion. A secret European Commission report was referred to as the source&#x2014;since it has already appeared in <i>The Observer</i> it is perhaps not all that secret. The Minister should tell us whether these reports are true. Is it true that the cost of dumping and the costs of servicing the storage of the stocks will rise in Britain and in the whole EEC to the extent of &#x00A3;2 billion? If so, agricultural spending will certainly run out of hand again. What will the Government do about this?<br/>
Will the Government come before the House with demands for yet more money for the worst possible reason &#x2014; for the continuing, obscene food mountains and money for the practice of dumping surplus products on the world food markets, with dire consequences for Third world countries? That can only increase starvation and the difficulties that many Third world countries face.<br/>
Why will the Minister not come clean with the House and tell us that the &#x00A3;18 million is to be paid into the European Commission not just to make our case appear in the most attractive light but as a kind of down payment on the calls that will be made on our resources in the coming months of 1986? Why will the Government not admit that there is no such thing as budgetary discipline? Budgetary discipline does not exist because the Government have done nothing to reform agricultural policy within the Community.<br/>
If the Government persist in believing in the existence of the budgetary discipline they are the only member Government who continue to do so. The European Commission has abandoned any such behief. The Commission's annual report on agricultural spending last year made it quite clear that:
<q>Even in those sectors in which substantial reform has already been achieved&#x2014;e.g. milk products and wine&#x2014;much remains to be done by way of stock reduction and supply management.</q>
That is a polite way of saying that the reforms have done nothing to reduce agricultural spending, but rattier it will get out of hand, as it has with cereals.<br/>
The &#x00A3;18 million is only the first instalment. It is a sweetener to the court. The Minister should tell us more about that and when he proposes to demand more money from the House for obscene and wasteful farm spending. He should come clean with the House tonight.</p>

<p>With the leave of the House, I shall reply to the debate.<br/>
This has been an excellent and forceful debate. Some hon. Members have asked questions about Government policy with regard to the disputed 1986 budget, and others have been more anxious to discuss our parliamentary procedures in such a case. I shall do my best to comment on as many of the issues that have been raised as possible.<br/>
I should like to underline three fundamental points in my opening speech. First, the question at issue is nothing less than the balance of power between the European Parliament on the one hand and the Council and national Parliaments on the other. Secondly, the key to resolving the issue satisfactorily is winning the court case. Thirdly, the procedures that we have adopted for seeking parliamentary approval are those recommended by the Treasury and Civil Service Select Committee in the previous Parliament. I trust that the critics of those procedures will not overlook that fact.<br/>
I would not accuse the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) of the Latin American delegate's technique of putting in the margin, "Weak point-shout," but amid his charges of humbug and pedantry he glossed lightly over the illegality that the European Parliament had committed. He either does not understand the process of budget making, or he is saying that breaking the law does not matter if the infringement is small. I am glad that the hon. Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Deakins), with a reference to ship money, issued a powerful corrective from the Opposition Back Benches. Of course it could be argued that this is the thin edge of the wedge, but the critical fact is that what the Parliament has done is illegal, and we intend to reverse that.<br/>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) mentioned the dilemma of our having a short time, which made more difficult the handling of a complex matter. It also made more difficult the Government's


handling of the case in terms of whether a Consolidated Fund Bill could be introduced. The dilemma was serious. As for timing, the preoccupation, apart from the dislike of paying interest, is with not finding ourselves being sued for interest on a payment that we were making without prejudice and ex gratia.</p>

<p>I am sorry, but no. I have very little time.<br/>
As for the method, which was recommended by the Select Committee, the use of the Contingencies Fund is dictated by urgent cases. It is difficult to envisage a more urgent case or one for which the fund would be more relevant.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend said that we were making the payment without prejudice. Without prejudice to what? As we understand it, we are to make a payment but cannot get it back.</p>

<p>We are making it without prejudice in the sense that we are making it not under the authority of the European Communities Act 1972, but under a separate head. In paying, we are saying that we regard the demand as improper, but we need to pay it in the context of the court cases.<br/>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Worthing mentioned page 791 of "Erskine May" and overriding the limits. The payment is not obligatory under existing legislation, but nor is it ruled out, which is the critical feature, as I think my right hon. Friend implied. The Estimate is brought forward on a separate basis, but not one which requires legislation to override the 1972 Act.<br/>
The hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir R. Johnston) criticised the Council of Ministers for its responses, but, in the process, ignored the issue of budgetary discipline, and was, I fear, joined in that by my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, East (Mr. Dykes). I was grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Southend, East (Mr. Taylor) for emphasising that the issues adduced by others as excuses for the European Parliament were simply justifications for illegality.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend has kindly said that I helped him by saying that the payment was illegal. Why should we make an illegal payment which we shall not get back and which the Commission will spend for us?</p>

<p>What I said, and what I thought my hon. Friend joined me on, was that the European Parliament's act was illegal.<br/>
The hon. Member for Walthamstow asked two questions. One related to section 173 of the European Community Treaty and the basis for our case. The very fact that the Parliament is not mentioned there raises the possibility of the Council's action being inadmissible. That is the basis for bringing our own case. The answer to his second question is that we could sue the Commission, and can still sue it, but there is no prospect of the Council of Ministers doing so. In that respect, we should be acting independently. The hon. Gentleman also mentioned the Assembly overspending. I would not have thought, from what he said, that none of his colleagues in the Assembly had voted against the illegal budget, but I agree that he is not responsible for them.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) mentioned the disagreeable time spent before the Treasury and Civil Service Select Committee. I did not think that it was disagreeable at all. I thoroughly enjoyed it and look forward to another occasion. He threw the word Communautaire at me. I suspect that it might well be an unparliamentary expression. The critical thing from the Government's point of view and in the context of the future of the Community is that we win the case. We believe that that can best be achieved by maintaining common cause among member Governments.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, South-West (Mr. Harvey) emphasised the importance to the future of Europe of winning the case. In that respect, he was joined by my hon. Friend the Member for Bridlington (Mr. Townend), although my hon. Friend the Member for Bridlington disagrees about the best way in which to win the case. The disagreement is simply one of tactics.<br/>
The hon. Member for Thurrock (Dr. McDonald) achieved the considerable feat of speaking for 10 minutes on behalf of the Opposition without referring once, as far as I am aware, to the illegality of the Parliament. She raised other issues which are relevant to the debate, but did not tackle the central one, which is the basis for the Government's action. I am happy to deny on behalf of the Government that we are bringing forward this Estimate because extra funds will be needed anyway. We are bringing the Estimate forward to assist the conduct of our case in the court and to reinforce our expectation of winning.</p>

<p>Not at this stage. My right hon. Friend the Member for Worthing asked why we were making the payment to support our case. We are anxious to maintain a common approach among member Governments in this nexus of cases. We do not want to pre-empt the court. As for the interim application, we are uniquely bringing forward the motion.<br/>
When I referred to high ground, my metaphor was as much military as moral. We are anxious to remain the plaintiffs in these cases, not the defendant.<br/>
In conclusion, I express the hope that right hon. and hon. Members on both sides of the House will vote in favour of the special Supplementary Estimate. The procedures for which the Government are seeking approval are those recommended by no less an authority than the Treasury and Civil Service Select Committee in the previous Parliament.<br/>
Several hon. Members have expressed surprise at the nature of the Government's legal advice, but to my memory no one has suggested&#x2014;or at least no one has convinced me&#x2014;that we should ignore that advice.<br/>
The balance between the Government's argument and that of some of my hon. Friends is that they believe that one act of political will in withholding payment is crucial to the future of Europe, and the Government believe that another act of political will is critical, which is acting in unison with our friends in the Community to defeat that illegality by the Parliament in the court. I ask the House&#x2014;</p>

<p>I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.<br/>
Our relations with Australia are of the greatest importance to this country. The Bill will, when enacted, confirm the United Kingdom's recognition of Australia's present-day status as a proud and independent nation. The removal of the old residual constitutional links reflects this country's affection for Australia and is therefore a cause for satisfaction.<br/>
The Bill is at the request and with the consent of the Parliament and Government of the Commonwealth of Australia. The request and consent was expressed in the Australia (Request and Consent) Act 1985, enacted in December 1985 by the Commonwealth Parliament in Australia. That legislation came about as a result of legislation enacted in September and October 1985 by the legislatures of each Australian state. In the passage through state legislatures and the federal Parliament, there was unanimous support from all Australian political parties to the proposals. I am happy to report that the same unanimity was evident in the passage of our own Bill through another place.<br/>
The purpose of the Bill is to remove the remaining constitutional links that still exist between the United Kingdom and the Australian states. The links have their origin in the way that the Commonwealth of Australia was created in 1901 as a federation of what were, until then, individual British colonies. On federation, a number of powers and functions were conferred upon the Commonwealth authorities, but the states, as the then colonies had become, retained many of their previous powers and functions. In law, and in many respects, they retained their status as colonies of the United Kingdom. With that status they remained subject to certain restraints and controls from the United Kingdom which, with the development of Australia to independent statehood, has clearly become inappropriate.<br/>
The quasi-colonial status of the Australian states meant that, in respect of those states, Her Majesty was sovereign in right of the United Kingdom; thus, when exercising her powers in relation to the states, Her Majesty is formally advised by her United Kingdom Ministers. Under the Bill, Her Majesty will continue to be sovereign in respect of the states, but no longer in respect of the United Kingdom. Instead, the Bill provides that when Her Majesty is exercising powers and functions in respect of the states, she will do so on the advice of Australian state Premiers. This mirrors Her Majesty's position in relation to Australian Commonwealth matters when she is advised by her Australian Commonwealth Ministers. The Bill makes no other change in the position of Her Majesty as Queen of Australia.<br/>
The Australian Government's request is made in accordance with section 4 of the Statute of Westminster 1931, which states:
<q>No Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom passed after the commencement of this Act shall extend, or be deemed to extend, to a Dominion as part of the law of that Dominion, unless it is expressly declared in that Act that that Dominion has requested, and consented to, the enactment thereof.</q><br/>
The details of the Bill are the result of extensive consultations between the Australian state and Commonwealth Governments and, more recently, between the Australian Commonwealth and United Kingdom Governments. Her Majesty approved the proposals in the middle of last year. Once Her Majesty had approved them, all the states and the Commonwealth of Australia passed legislation in their own legislatures. Following Royal Assent to the Australia (Request and Consent) Act 1985, passed by the Commonwealth Parliament, Mr. Hawke wrote to the Prime Minister formally seeking enactment at Westminster of complementary legislation. That is the Bill before the House.<br/>
The Bill is drafted to mirror the Australian legislation precisely. Briefly, the Bill will, in clause 1, remove the British Parliament's power to make laws for Australian states&#x2014; thus it achieves the complete legislative independence of Australia from the United Kingdom. By virtue of clause 10, the Bill will terminate the responsibility of the Government of the United Kingdom for the government of any Australian state.<br/>
The Bill will also remove certain restraints which at present exist in relation to the legislative powers of Australian states. By clause 8, it will remove certain powers of Her Majesty, as the Queen of the United Kingdom, exercisable on the advice of United Kingdom Ministers, to disallow or to suspend the operation of state laws. By clause 3,it will remove certain restrictions, for example, under the Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865, on the legislative powers of Australian states.<br/>
Turning to judicial matters, clause 11 will terminate appeals to the Privy Council from state courts. However, it will not affect an appeal instituted before the commencement of this legislation, or an appeal for which leave has been given before the commencement of the Act. Those will continue to be dealt with in the same manner as before, as if this legislation had not been enacted.<br/>
As regards the powers and functions of Her Majesty and governors in respect of states, clause 7 makes new provisions. Her Majesty's representative in each state continues to be the governor. It is the governor alone who will exercise the powers of Her Majesty, except on the appointment or the termination of the appointment of a governor, and at times when the Queen is personally present in the state.<br/>
On those two matters, the Bill provides for the Queen to act on the advice of the Premier of the state concerned, although when she is personally present in a state, any such advice to the Queen would be tendered only in accordance with the mutual and prior agreement between the Queen and the Premier. That arrangement was agreed between the Australian federal and state authorities and the Palace.<br/>
Finally, in clauses 13 and 14 the Bill amends the constitution Acts of Queensland and Western Australia respectively. The constitutions of those two states are the only ones that include specific provisions relating to the appointment of their governors. The clauses are


consequential upon termination of the powers and responsibilities of United Kingdom Ministers in respect of states.<br/>
I am sure that the whole House will wish to join the Government in welcoming the Bill. It represents and embodies Australian wishes. All parties and all state legislatures in the Commonwealth Parliament support the proposals outlined in the Bill. As I said at the beginning of my speech, legislation has been enacted in all state and Commonwealth legislatures smoothly and without controversy. It is right that this House should agree to the request of the representatives of the Australian people for the removal of these residual constitutional links.<br/>
The decision to propose changes has not been made lightly. While it is true that the Bill will remove certain, largely formal, legal links, it will in no way weaken the deep practical relationship between our two countries. Moreover, it will substitute new arrangements that accurately reflect Australia's well-established status as a modern and sovereign nation. The Bill also acknowledges Australia's proud independence under its Queen and the true balance of our relationship today.<br/>
I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="380335" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1986-02-03a.83.0" hansard_membership_id="419" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2336" speakername="Mr. Donald Anderson" colnum="83" time="19:22:00">
<p>I thank the Minister for his clear and helpful speech. It is obvious that the Government have not materially altered their position since Baroness Young outlined the Bill in another place on 16 July.<br/>
In no way will the Opposition seek to delay or amend the Bill. On the contrary, we shall do everything that we can to speed its passage through the House in the hope that Her Majesty the Queen can proclaim its coming into force when she visits Australia early next month.<br/>
On one level, it would in any event be quite unrealistic for us to raise obstacles. It would be inappropriate to seek unilaterally to amend matters which have been agreed by all Australians, and which should properly be within their competence. We note the unanimous approval in Australia, the passage through the state legislatures in September and October last year and the Royal Assent in Australia on 4 December. It has been agreed by all parties in Australia, by all states&#x2014;even by Western Australia, which in the 1930s had a secessionist movement&#x2014;and by the Commonwealth Government&#x2014;even those individuals who have been most loyal to the old Commonwealth relationship. One contrasts the reception in this House for the Bill with that for the Bill that eventually became the Canada Act.<br/>
Wih such unanimity of approval, how can we oppose the Bill? It is the recognition of a change in relationship from the time of the establishment of the Australian Commonwealth in 1901&#x2014;the residual element of that quasi-colonial relationship whose very existence contains at least a chance of potential conflict between the Crown, our legislature and Australia.<br/>
Nevertheless, there were positive elements in the old relationship, especially in the co-operative development of the common law. All Bar students and civil practitioners will be aware of the distinguished Chief Justice of the Australian High Court, Sir Owen Dixon, and of the Wagon Mound case in 1961, which decisively altered the concept of liability in our civil law, defining the limits of liability

for a negligent act. All that arose from a mishap in the harbour at Sydney. The personal relationships between members of the Bar in Australia and this country will continue, and I am sure that the legal co-operation generally will also remain.<br/>
The tide has passed, and, as the Minister said, it is quite anachronistic that, for example, Her Majesty the Queen, in exercising powers in the Australian states, acts on the advice of United Kingdom Ministers. When the Bill becomes law, in exercising such functions the Queen will act on the advice of Australian state premiers. Another example of an anachronism is that this House should have certain functions in respect of legislation for the states of Australia.<br/>
There is a new reality. There is the development of two wholly independent, nations, in no way dependent the one upon the other, enjoying a warm and close bilateral relationship &#x2014; two proud democracies, homes of the common law. When problems arise on a bilateral level, such as those following the McClelland commission report on nuclear tests in Australia, those potential forces of an explosive conflict will, I am confident, be settled on a basis of mutual good will and long-standing friendship.<br/>
We do not need these remaining residual quasi-colonial ties to define our relationship with Australia&#x2014;something that is based on far broader and wider foundations. We have fought together, we have talked together as parliamentary colleagues in the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and the Inter-Parliamentary Union, we mix together, we have a network of family links between this country and Australia&#x2014;there can hardly be a family in the United Kingdom which does not have some personal link with Australia&#x2014;and we play together.<br/>
My only slight criticism of the Bill is that our negotiators have not done a tough enough job, because there is no reciprocity. Perhaps, as a swap for giving the Australians their constitution, we should have insisted that Alan Border remain in this country for five years.<br/>
A new relationship has indeed developed. When Sir Robert Menzies used to say that he was British to his bootstraps. that was anachronistic even then, as I cannot imagine that many British people were wearing bootstraps. We now look forward to the British-Australian bicentennial celebrations to be held next year. The old is dead, long live the new relationship. At last, Australia has achieved her legislative independence.</p>

<p>It is welcome and uplifting to take part in a debate in which both sides of the House seem united in wishing progress to a Bill. I compliment the Under-Secretary of State on giving a new definition to the term "Second Reading", in that he read for the second time what his noble Friend had read so well in another place, while inserting one or two interesting adverbs, which were recognised by the occupants of the Opposition Benches.<br/>
On behalf of my right hon. and hon. Friends, who are so much better represented proportionally in the Chamber this evening than are the Government or the official Opposition, I am pleased to say that the Bill has the full support of the Liberal and Social Democratic parties. It was anachronistic to have judicial and residual administrative rights over Australian legislation, and we welcome their termination.


Australia is a mature and civilised country which I have had the privilege and pleasure of visiting on a number of occasions. The last occasion on which I visited it was as a member of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. If ever there was a country which deserved to look after its own destiny without unnecessary interference from us, it is Australia.<br/>
It used to be said in olden days that one could tell the difference between an Australian and yoghurt because only one of them had culture. That is no longer so, and the arts in Australia flourish now as probably in no other Commonwealth country. The Australian cinema is enjoying a marvellously exciting new life. The Melbourne opera house is one of the architectural gems of the world, and the Australian theatre flourishes. Perhaps more important is the fact that the Australian arts are customer orientated. When I was in Melbourne, even matinees of quite heavy operas were fully attended, with people waiting for returned seats.<br/>
In sport, Australians need no interference or guidance from us. There is perhaps a moment for gloating over cricket, but in all other sports they are almost fearless. Their racing is brilliant, in that they have removed elitism from it. Spectators do not necessarily wear hats, and they are not barred from going into various enclosures by virtue of how much they have paid. The bravery and knowledge of their commentators is brilliant as well. Our BBC and ITV commentators will never commit themselves if horses finish within half a length of one another. The Australian commentators call results when they are by a whisker, and they are steadily proved right.<br/>
I observed the Australian prison service and found it to he excellent. Their rate of recidivism is very much lower than ours, and there is genuine understanding, and investment in, the well-being of prisoners. I spoke to the director of prisons in the state of Victoria, and he explained that it was the state that took away individuals' liberty and that the prison service tried to replace that with dignity.<br/>
Australian agriculture needs no help from us. The CPA delegation visited an avocado plantation in Western Australia which was irrigated by means of a computer, with one man sitting in a hut with a hydrometer measuring the dampness of the earth and spraying it where necessary.<br/>
There is oil in the north and the wine from the Hunter valley in the south can take the place of any wine in the world. The state parliaments are decently run and, unlike us, sit no more often than is necessary. The Senators are well paid and they all, as well as Members of the state Parliament, enjoy free rail travel anywhere in Australia. That is something from which we should learn.<br/>
The Bill will have an effect on the conferment of honours on Australian citizens. I am pleased to say that that was not picked up by anyone in another place, and one tries in this place to be to some extent original when debating something which began in another place. Clause 7(5) reads:
<q>The advice to Her Majesty in relation to the exercise of the powers and functions of Her Majesty in respect of a State shall be tendered by the Premier of the State",</q>
which means that no longer will honours have to be filtered through the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. From now on they will be recommended by the state premiers to Her Majesty, who in her capacity as the Queen of Australia will confer honours on her Australian people.<br/>
I believe that our friendship will be stronger if we allow Australia, a mature and civilised nation, to run its own ship of state. It has shown the ability to do so, and I do not believe that anything that has happened recently on our side of the ocean is likely to persuade it that when it comes to governing a country we have all the answers. I welcome the Bill, and my right hon. and hon. Friends and I will support it.</p>

<p>I shall not indulge in a travelogue, like the hon. Member for Cambridgeshire, North-East (Mr. Freud). I found it fascinating, however, to hear about his racing experiences in Australia.<br/>
As my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State said in introducing this small but important Bill, it is largely a formal measure. One is tempted to ask why the formal powers have been retained for so long. A similar sort of Bill came before us a short while ago that dealt with Canada. I do not know of the intricacies that lie behind such measures, but perhaps we should have proceeded jointly instead of taking a piecemeal approach. One of the most comforting and heartening features of the debate is the complete agreement on this measure that has been expressed from both Front Benches. It is comforting and heartening also to know that the Bill is in accord with the thinking of the separate states in Australia. That must be good.<br/>
I detect that everyone in this place believes that it is essential to retain full links with the Commonwealth, especially with the old Commonwealth. Our ties with Australia remain strong and they are not to be underestimated. Nor are they to be neglected. It must be understood that they should never be taken for granted. There have been suggestions in the past on the part of Australia that it should break from us while still retaining a loose association within the Commonwealth. Having been to Australia, like the hon. Member for Cambridgeshire, North-East, I detect an enormous amount of good will among Australians; that is evidenced by the many young people who come to Britain from Australia. Many of the younger generation still regard Britain as their motherland.<br/>
The ties that we are debating are anachronistic and they serve no useful purpose. It is right that the statute book should not be littered with laws that no one has any intention of implementing. Therefore, it is wise that we should be taking the step that is marked by the Bill. Wherever I go&#x2014;I am sure that this will be echoed by all hon. Members&#x2014;I find that there remains enormous goodwill between Australia and Britain. I am a member of the British delegation to the Council of Europe and it is interesting that among the most regular visitors from parliaments outside Europe are those who come from Australia. It is usual for Australia to send a strong team to Strasbourg about once a year to participate in debates and to make contact with European parliamentarians of the 21 nations which form the Council of Europe. That is all to the good, and we should do everything we can to encourage it.<br/>
Australia has enormous potential. It has a tiny population compared with its land mass. Long after our time it will be much further developed than it is today and with a larger population, when certain climatic barriers have been broken. Australia is a formidable and essential


part of the Commonwealth. The Bill has a great deal to commend it, not least because it gives us an opportunity to emphasise the strength of our ties with Australia.</p>

<p>In 1982 the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> carried a story written by Nicholas Comfort, a perceptive analyst, in which he said:
<q>Politicians at Westminster are bracing themselves for a Bill to make changes in the Australian Constitution, in the hope that it will arouse less controversy than last winter's debates on Canada's.</q>
About that time I opened a file on Australia, and four years later the file is thin because the contrast between the Australia Bill and the Canada Bill is enormous. I suspect that Australian politicians, seeing how badly the issue of patriating Canada's constitution was handled by the Canadian Federal Government, resolved to ensure that when, eventually, legislation was introduced for Australia, it would not be subjected to the same intense debates.<br/>
If the public was asked whether it appreciated that Britain still had a residual responsibility for Australia, many people would be as bemused as hon. Members were in the late 1980's when it was pointed out that we had a significant residual responsibility for Canada.</p>

<p>If the hon. Gentleman reads <i>Hansard</i> he will see that I said that the issue surfaced in the late 1970s. In 1979 I presented a lobby of 250 Canadian aboriginals. The Canadian issue scarred Canadians and the parliamentarians involved. Fortunately, the House is not being put through the same traumas with Australia. Australian politicians realised that they should not go through that process and did what Canadian politicians did not do, which was to secure compliance among all the federating elements in the Australian political system and all political parties, so that there was unaminity in presenting the legislation.<br/>
The contrast is startling. The Canadian Prime Minister sought not simply to patriate the constitution, but to alter the balance between federal and provincial Governments. That caused consider<ob/>ble opposition in both Canada and the United Kingdom, and resulted in long hours of debate. Eventually the federal Government of Canada had to climb down and secure a different agreement with the provinces. The Australian position is very different. Although some of the characters involved in the debate five years ago are present today, the circumstances are completely different.<br/>
There was a time when such a debate would not be automatically peaceful, as clearly it will be today. The precursor to today's legislation may have been the traumas of the mid-1970s which involved the Governor-General and the dismissal of the Government of Gough Whitlam. Fortunately, there has been agreement in Australia, although there is the issue of republicanism, but that matter is exclusively for Australians. This final constitutional tie is being severed, and we wish the new arrangements all good fortune.<br/>
The issue of Australian aboriginals&#x2014;those who are left &#x2014; will not be debated today, or in our future

debates. That is not to say that we regard the position of Australian aboriginals as something Australians can view with pride and pleasure. However, Australian aboriginals, for whatever reason, have not lobbied British parliamentarians. If they do not see any enhancement of their status through debates in the Houses of Parliament, that is up to them. But I certainly would not like it to be thought that the Australian record was any better than that of Canada, because in many respects it is worse.<br/>
The Australians have a legacy of Westminster government which they have nurtured and developed in their own unique way. Indirectly, Australia had colonies, and Australians can be proud of the political system that they have established and of the system that they have bequeathed to their former colony of Papua New Guinea. A few months ago when the Prime Minister there was defeated on a vote of no confidence, he resigned, for the second time, and took his place on the Opposition Benches. The success of that political system may be because Australia, not the United Kingdom, was the colonial power.<br/>
The number of column inches in <i>Hansard</i> devoted to Australia will be limited. The measure is not being subjected to intense political debate, which is welcome. I presume that the remaining stages will be as uneventful as the Second Reading because Australians have proceeded more intelligently than their fellow Commonwealth parliamentarians in North America.<br/>
The House should wish the Bill well. It has secured unanimity here and in Australia. It is right that the Australian Government have introduced the legislation, and I hope that their future political developments will be successful.</p>

<p>During more than 25 years in the House I have seen incompetently drafted Bills causing unanticipated troubles. I do not admire those who draft Bills incompetently. The Hon. Member for Walsall, South (Mr. George) does less than justice to the institutes of learning, which he has not dignified by his presence, in believing that British people have been wholly ignorant of the constitutional position between Australia and the United Kingdom. I should have thought that every university, except for the one which he has illuminated by his academic advice, and a huge number of people were well aware of the constitutional position of the British Parliament vis-a-vis the Commonwealth of Australia.<br/>
I rise to point out that the word "Commonwealth" is understood wholly differently in Australia and in the United Kingdom. It so happens that tonight we are passing United Kingdom legislation. In the United Kingdom the word "Commonwealth" means the British Commonwealth. I notice that the hon. Members for Paisley, South (Mr. Buchan) and for Swansea, East (Mr. Anderson) are not listening. I ask for their attention, because I am not making a party political point, but am trying to ensure that when we pass the last definitive Act which affects the great Commonwealth of Australia, we get it right instead of wrong.</p>

<p>Indeed, and nit-picking lawyers would agree with the hon. Gentleman: but he would have been wiser to wait until I had finished before making such inappropriate observations. My reading of the Bill has also reached clause 16. In fact, I have reached later in clause 16 than has the hon. Gentleman, to where it says:
<q>'State' means a State of the Commonwealth and includes a new State".</q>
I suppose that when we were all at primary school we knew the silly games, which were not even played by parliamentary drafting lawyers, where one turns to page 5, then page 17, back to page 6 and on to page 30 before one discovers what is intended.<br/>
I am making a substantial point, in that, in clause 1 "Commonwealth" is not used in the sense in which it is always used in the House, as in the Commonwealth Immigrants Act, the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. It is being used in a different sense, which is wholly appropriate within the Commonwealth of Australia, but is not appropriate in United Kingdom legislation. We should not have to wait until clause 16 to discover that the sense in which the incompetent draftsman of the Bill used the word "Commonwealth" in clause 1 is not the sense in which it is normally used in the House, in another place, by our courts, in official designations, and by Her Majesty when she opens the Commonwealth Conference. It is used in the Australian internal sense meaning the "Commonwealth of Australia."<br/>
I am not making a Committee point, but I think it would have been more appropriate if the incompetent draftsman of the Bill had put "Commonwealth of Australia" in cluse 1 and had also given a definition in clause 16 reading:
<q>'State' means a state of the Commonwealth of Australia and includes a new state.</q>
I am putting this on record because, although courts often say that what is spoken in debate does not constitute the law, they refer to it as evidence of the will of Parliament.<br/>
We have all suffered so much from incompetently drafted legislation that I wish to use this occasion to protest against an example of it. It would have been so easy to say:
<q>No Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed after the commencement of this Act shall extend, or be deemed to extend, to the Commonwealth of Australia, to a State or to a Territory as part of the law of the Commonwealth of Australia, or of the state or of the Territory".</q></p>

<p>That has already been referred to. If the hon. Gentleman had been listening rather than

chattering to his hon. Friend the Member for Swansea, East, he would have heard his hon. Friend make that point a short while ago.<br/>
I am saying that it is wholly unsatisfactory, shoddy and inappropriate draftmanship to have to wait until clause 16 before one discovers what should be in clause 1. I suppose that as an ex-junior Minister the hon. Member for Paisley, South feels it necessary to support incompetent draftsmanship, because he was a Minister who introduced incompetently drafted Bills to the House. If he had listened to what has been going on, he would have been apprised of the point that I am making.<br/>
I think it is sad that an important Bill, which brings a wholly relevant and deserved dignity to the Commonwealth of Australia, should be sullied by such mean lawyers' drafting, which does not say what it means. One should be able to read a Bill and know what it means as one goes through it, instead of having to play the silly game of referring from one clause and one part of a clause to another until one understands.<br/>
My appeal is for clear and competent drafting of Bills rather than such incompetence, which is only just legally complete, but is not what it could have been or should have been. That is the point I wish to place on record. If the Bill should be tested, as it could be in the British court. an Australian court or, in cases of conflict of jurisdiction, in any other court in the world, I would prefer to have a simple and what should be dignified measure stating clearly what it does instead of starting with avoidable ambiguities without explanation until clause 16.I think that the protest ought to be made even on this occasion, and I assure my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State that I shall continue to make such protests if he employs the same draftsmen for future Bills.</p>

<p>With the leave of the House, l shall respond briefly to the points that were made in the debate.<br/>
The Government are delighted that the Bill has received widespread support throughout the House and I am sure that that shows the close relationship that exists between the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth of Australia.<br/>
The hon. Member for Swansea, East (Mr. Anderson) drew attention to that close relationship and in that respect he particularly mentioned the conversations that have been taking place about the Royal Commission set up by Australia to look into nuclear tests. As I think the hon. Gentleman knows, there were some helpful discussions between Senator Gareth Evans, the Australian Minister who is responsible for the matter, and my right hon. and hon. Friends, at the end of last month. He probably also knows that the United Kingdom has accepted the Australian invitation to participate in a technical assessment group. We have also agreed to be represented on a consultative group, which will examine the issues raised by the Royal Commission.<br/>
The hon. Member for Cambridgeshire, North-East (Mr. Freud) also supported the Bill. I am sure that the Australians will be thrilled to have his imprimatur of their artistic endeavours. I am not so convinced that they will welcome his preoccupation with racing, wine and prisons, which is not exactly the image that they would wish to project of their country. However, I know that everything he said was said in a positive spirit.


The hon. Member for Swansea, East suggested that we might have to have Alan Border back. I think that, in fairness to the Australians and the present poor state of their cricket, we might let them keep him.<br/>
The hon. Member for Cambridgeshire, North-East drew attention to the honours system and the way in which the Bill will change it. I confirm his impression. To complement the new legislation, it has been agreed by all concerned, including Her Majesty the Queen, that in future all honours recommendations will be made direct to the Queen by state Premiers.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Warwick and Leamington (Sir D. Smith) rightly welcomed the Bill, and correctly referred to the anachronistic elements. The hon. Member for Walsall, South (Mr. George) drew attention to the differences between the Canada Bill and the Australia Bill. I well remember the role that he played in the Canada Bill. He mentioned that nothing had been said about the Bill to hon. Members by aborigines in Australia. That is correct. We understand that no representations were made by aborigines to any of the state legislatures or the Commonwealth of Australia legislature during the passage of the Bill.<br/>
I refer to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton (Mr. Maxwell-Hyslop). The whole House is always impressed by his grasp of detail and by the way in which he regularly draws attention to the importance of the drafting of parliamentary Bills. I should like to consider the points that he made, but as Opposition Members said, there is a reference in the long title of the Bill and in the preamble to the Commonwealth of Australia. The Bill is taken directly from the wording adopted by the Commonwealth of Australia Parliament. It is an exact replica of that Bill. Therefore, any amendment that we sought to make to the Bill in the House would have to be returned to the Parliament of the Commonwealth, and probably to the state legislatures as well. I am sure that we would wish to avoid that if at all possible.</p>

<p>Has my hon. Friend really been advised that to use the phrase "Commonwealth of Australia" in our legislation to make explicit what is internally explicit in Australia would have to be returned to Australia, when there is no change in meaning whatever? He knows the answer as well as I do. If my hon. Friend is trying to persuade the House of Commons of

that, does he honestly believe it himself? The Bill is not like the Canada Bill. Its substance was affirmed by a foregoing Canadian enactment. This Bill will be an individual Act of the United Kingdom Parliament. Does my hon. Friend believe what he is saying?</p>

<p>I hope that my hon. Friend will not do me an injustice. Of course I believe what I am saying. I said that I would consider carefully the point that he made. He was courteous enough to tell me earlier that he was likely to make it. I had to point out to my hon. Friend that there was a complication. I did not make any assertion as to whether his point would apply, when I said that any change that we made in the House would have to be referred to the Parliament in Canberra. I wanted to register that point. I was not using it as a definitive argument, nor would my hon. Friends expect me to do that because the Committee stage is still to come.<br/>
As all hon. Members have said, the Bill is widely welcomed in all parts of the House, as it was in all state legislatures and throughout Australia. The severance of the residual constitutional link that the Bill represents in no way weakens the deep practical bonds between our two countries. Those bonds are based on mutual friendship, and need no legal backing. The Bill acknowledges that. I believe that all hon. Members will wish to recognise that fact, and will be pleased to assist in the removal of the anachronistic links.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I feel that I should at this stage explain why the proposed new clause 2, which was in my name, was withdrawn last week, and what I propose to do about it.<br/>
In Committee I undertook to consider further the need for the production of regular reports by the board of governors on the activities of the museum to be required by law. That was in response to an amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Paisley, South (Mr. Buchan). I accept the need for that additional overall statutory obligation. However, I have been advised that the new clause was hybrid and could have introduced additional and lengthy delays. I have a clear sense of obligation to the Committee. I therefore undertake that the Government will table a new clause in Committee in another place which, broadly described, will put a statutory obligation on the Secretary of State to lay regular reports before both Houses on the exercise of the board's functions. I hope that that explanation will be helpful to the House.</p>

<p>We understand what the Minister has said, and we are glad that he took our proposal on board. We look forward with interest to the new clause that is to be tabled. The Minister is fortunate because if he had tabled a potentially hybrid new clause in front of the hon. Member for Tiverton (Mr. Maxwell-Hyslop) we might have been here for a long time.<br/>
I should like to raise a concomitant point of order, on new clause 1. It was debated in Committee for about an hour. We were just beginning to consider the ramifications of the problem when I decided, with the approval of the Committee, that it would be more appropriate to debate such a major matter of principle on the Floor of the House. Therefore I did not put it to the vote, despite pressure from many of my hon. Friends. I thought that it would be better for the House as a whole to have a look at what has become a major matter of principle. We have learned today, from the tapes, that the number of attendances at the Victoria and Albert museum since the introduction of charging has dropped by almost half. We warned the museum at the time that that would happen. For this reason I hope, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that you will reconsider the decision about selection. It is a matter of urgent importance. The unions are keen to have an answer. No answers were given, since the questions were never put to the Committee. For these reasons, I ask that we should be allowed to discuss the new clause.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br/>
In the short time available it has not been possible to deploy all the arguments. However, they can be dealt with when the Bill goes to another place. I have no doubt that that will happen. I look forward with immense confidence to the Bill returning to this place after it has been passed by the House of Lords with new clause 1 added to it.<br/>
New clause 3 is a probing amendment. However, it goes further than that. We are anxious about the pressure that can be brought to bear upon the trustees and governors of museums. That is why this amendment has been tabled. We want an assurance from the Government that no objects in the Museum of London will be flogged off without the utmost consideration and care and without reference back to the Minister concerned.<br/>
8.15 pm<br/>
The Minister will appoint half the governors and trustees of the museum. A rampant and crude commercialism is the ideology and philosophy of this Government. They are cutting grants and support for the museums and thereby compelling boards of governors 10 behave in this way. Furthermore, because of the nature of certain appointments, action is taken that is in line with crude commercialism, instigated by the philosophy of the Prime Minister and this Government.<br/>
I have been very disturbed by what happened at the National Museum of Wales. There has been a great deal of correspondence about it, including a report in <i>The Guardian.</i> The keeper of the National Museum of Wales accepted an offer from a body called Brains Trust Incorporated to transfer to Japan one of the finest and best collections of impressionist paintings outside any capital city in Europe. It is an even better collection than the Glasgow collection, which is one of the most important of the provincial collections. Brains Trust Incorporated offered &#x00A3;250,000&#x2014;although later evidence suggests that it offered &#x00A3;140,000&#x2014;for the whole collection. It meant that the people of Wales would be deprived of the collection for a year while it was sent on exhibition to Japan. It would not have formed part of an educational tour, involving the British Council. The collection was to be shown inside a department store. It was a further extension of commercialism&#x2014;the use of impressionist paintings to attract customers into a department store.</p>

<p>That is quite true. When they can afford to pay this kind of money they have good reasons for doing so. However, without let or hindrance this collection of extremely valuable paintings went to Japan without the benefit of proper curatorial care. We do not want that to happen to the Museum of London's collections. We want to ensure that if it is the wish of the governors to lend any part of the museum's collections it should be done on a reciprocal basis. That has always been the case with art collections.

<p>The hon. Member for Paisley, South (Mr. Buchan) believes, it seems, that museums should never dispose of any of the objects in their collections. He has referred to his apprehension about the Government's rampant commercialism. I am apprehensive about the rampant reaction of the hon. Member for Paisley, South. He is the Bourbon of the world of the arts and the heritage.<br/>
To call somebody a Bourbon in the context of the arts and the heritage is not to disparage him, as hon. Members will recognise, but my anxiety about the hon. Gentleman is that he believes that nothing should ever change.<br/>
He reminds me of Charles X of France. The point of comparison is not that, as a young man, that monarch led a life of scandalous dissipation, although that is true, but that to a very high degree he believed in tradition. That was exemplified by the proceedings at his coronation service at Rheims which ran for very many hours. It was part of the antique ritual of that ceremony that the monarch should be pricked by a golden bodkin. It is easy to imagine or to fantasise that if the day comes when the hon. Member for Paisley, South finds that he is Minister for the Arts a similar grandiose and very beautiful ceremony will be performed. Charles X prostrated himself for 12 hours during the ceremony. One can imagine the hon. Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) as his acolyte administering the puncture with the golden bodkin. One could also fantasise about the hon. Gentleman attempting to press the bodkin home a little deep. But, be that as it may, if I were to pursue that line of thought no doubt you would rule me out of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker.<br/>
However, I want to advance a serious objection to what is being proposed by the Labour party. It is the mark of all good collectors, whether private or museums, that they seek to improve the quality of their collection. It would be a mistake in the case of an important museum such as the Museum of London, which has a serious responsibility to preserve and archive material of great importance relating to the history of London, to rule that neither the directors nor the trustees should ever have the power to dispose of objects that were of trivial or minor importance and not

worthy to be in the collection. We should be prepared to advance and to be a little more open-minded in that respect.<br/>
There must, of course, be safeguards. It is important to provide that a future director should not be able to succumb to the caprices of collecting fashions and dispose of objects at his sole discretion which might, by a wider judgment and the judgment of posterity, be objects of genuine importance that should be in the collection. But one can provide against that by requiring that the trustees should have a right of ultimate decision or by some such procedure. But it would be a mistake not to provide that there should be power to dispose of objects of second-rate importance.</p>

<p>I do not think that that is essential to the point of principle that I am trying to establish. For example, in America it is a much more widely accepted practice that museums should be free to dispose of minor objects. That is one reason&#x2014;among many others&#x2014;why the quality of collections in many American museums and galleries has been enhanced over the years. I do not want to debar that possibility from the Museum of London.<br/>
Finally, it is curious that Opposition Members, who are rightly anxious that more funding should be available to our museums and galleries, should want to preclude one minor, but none the less not insignificant, source of possible additional funding.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth) told us in his concluding sentence all that we wanted to know in defence of the new clause. One would expect an hon. Member representing the constituency that the hon. Gentleman does to introduce into his speech so many literary and historial references. I can assure him that the people of Newham, North-West have still not finished talking about the coronation ceremony of Charles X.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman's last sentence lies behind this new clause. He said that there is this one way of raising money &#x2014; renting out exhibits to other countries. I am completely in favour, as are all my hon. Friends, of the interchange of exhibits between museums internationally. One would want to see that happen. My hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South (Mr. Buchan) referred to the National Museum of Wales, and we have the feeling that that museum did what it did at precisely that time in order to raise funds because there was a great shortage within its budget. Therefore, its reason was not the high-flown one that we would support. Instead, it was done on a straightforward commercial consideration.<br/>
The Opposition have said consistently in Committee and on other occasions that we can see the time coming when the Government, in attempting to cut public expenditure as they have attempted to do unsuccessfully for years, will look to the soft underbelly of the arts, the museums and library services in order to try to make some token savings, forcing those arts institutions into the market place in a way that is conducive neither to the interests of the museums nor to the interests of the consumer&#x2014;the public who pay through their rates and taxes for the museums and art galleries to be maintained.


Just as we saw the National Museum of Wales accepting a pretty measly amount of money for the cream of its exhibits for a year, we can see in the figures that have been released tonight from the Victoria and Albert that it has been forced into introducing a scheme for voluntary admission charges, not because, as one understands from the director of the Victoria and Albert, they want to do it as a matter of principle, but because they have been forced to do it through not having sufficient funds for the museum's activities.<br/>
The Minister might say that we are being somewhat alarmist, but it is our duty to look to the future. After all, the future is with us, not with the Conservative party. We are worried that in the short time before a Labour Government are restored and my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South is gracing the Government Front Bench as the new Minister for the Arts, perhaps museums will start selling off some of their exhibits in order to raise cash because the Government have squeezed them.<br/>
Those are the reasons for the new clause, and I commend it to the House.</p>

<p>I must speak on this new clause because it is rubbish. It is greater rubbish than any new clause or amendment that was tabled in Committee. Not only is it nonsense, but it does not even mean what Labour Members intend it to mean. It says that the museum shall not dispose of any of the objects in its collection. Surely, if a person rents out an item he retains ownership of that item, while losing possession temporarily. Therefore, the clause would not debar anybody from renting out property.<br/>
Secondly, I wonder just how sterile it is to fetter directors of the new Museum of London right from the start in not being able to dispose of certain objects on display. Not all the objects are ancient artefacts. Some are models which the museum might want to sell to schools for educational purposes or to other museums to demonstrate the history of London.<br/>
Thirdly, I wonder whether the new clause is consistent with the Labour party's policy on museums. If the British Museum were to transfer the Elgin marbles to the Museum of London, the Museum of London would not be able to sell the Elgin marbles. If this new clause were to apply to the British Museum, the Elgin marbles could not be returned, which I believe is the Labour party's policy. For those three reasons the new clause is nonsense and I beg the House to reject it.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I too might have thought that the new clause was otiose or went too far by way of safeguard. But I do not feel that today after having sat in Committee and knowing a little of the extent to which the Government and their representatives and nominees are going in respect of Britain's assets.<br/>
The hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley) spoke of the Elgin marbles. They are not Britain's assets; they are the assets of Greece. We know that there has been some discussion about their future. Almost by definition
<q>any of the objects in their collection"&#x2014;</q>
presumably, at the time that Royal Assent is obtained&#x2014;relates specifically to London. That is the difference between this museum and the British Museum or the National Museum of Wales.<br/>
Therefore, by definition, if anything at all is to be sold it will be sold to either a London organisation for storage

or display inside London&#x2014;the Inner London education authority has been mentioned&#x2014;or it will be sold outside London altogether. That, almost by definition, would be undesirable, or at least there would have to be a strong case for so doing in terms of sale rather than by loan or overseas exhibit.<br/>
Unfortunately, the members of the governing body who would take such decisions will be nominees of the Prime Minister of the day. I do not know how long the present Prime Minister will stay in her position&#x2014;there have been a number of varying estimates in the past day or two &#x2014;or who her successor might be, or whether there will be a Tory successor. The other governors will be nominees of the City of London. We have been over this in Committee but I say again that such a board of governors would not enjoy the same confidence of a Labour Government as would the existing board of governors.<br/>
8.30 pm<br/>
A few weeks ago, one might have said that any reasonable person would not be irresponsible in selling off artefacts or exhibition material from London, for example from some useful and interesting exhibit of the 1930s. The London museum has a 1930s shop &#x2014;a Boots or a Woolworth&#x2014;which is well laid out.<br/>
The Government are selling off all sorts of national assets. Who would have believed even two years ago that a Government would tell the House that they were expecting to dispose of Land. Rover? If the Government can do that, their nominees can act irresponsibly towards the objects that have been collected to represent London.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth), at an early stage, asked us to use our imaginations to the full, and he discussed issues such as the coronation of Charles X. Tempted though I am, I shall not be drawn into this exciting debate. In the second part of his speech my hon. Friend made the important point, which was backed by my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley), that we should not fetter the museum. We should not allow the total immobility in the movement of objects of art between museums that the clause would bring about. It says:
<q>The Board of Governors of the Museum of London shall not dispose of any of the objects in their collections.</q>
Therefore, it is extremely restrictive. It would be wrong and impracticable for an institution such as the Museum of London to have such a clause imposed upon it.<br/>
The existing Museum of London Act 1965 has in section 5 a thoughtful and carefully drafted provision, which gives adequate safeguards and provides a sensible flexibility to the board of governors. The 1965 Act allows the board to dispose of objects, but only if the object is a duplicate or if it is not, in the opinion of the board, required for retention in the collection. It goes on to say that at least two thirds of the members of the board of governors must approve of any disposal before it takes place. It makes other safeguards for objects vested in the board under particular trust conditions.<br/>
We can count on the board to maintain and enhance the museum's collection, to present a picture of London's history that is as complete and representative as possible. That is one of its main aims, but the 1965 Act rightly allows for a little manoeuvre o dispose of duplicates and certain other objects as well. The present law should stand.<br/>
The hon. Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) suggested, at least by implication, that the


Government were likely to starve museums of funds. It has now been confirmed that the City Corporation will match our contribution of &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;25 million to the museum, and therefore there will now be a 10 per cent. increase in the budget for the coming financial year. There could not be a better sign of our commitment to the museum. There is no question but that we shall continue basic funding. There is that assurance.<br/>
The law has worked perfectly well under the 1965 Act, which has been in operation for 10 years. With the criteria about the disposal of objects of art, it has worked successfully. I see no reason why we should change the present rules. It would be wrong to impose immobility on the movements of objects of art, which is what the new clause proposes. It is better to have the existing safeguard under the board of governors, which is in an appropriate position to make sensible judgments. I ask the House to reject the new clause.</p>

<p>I must express my intense disappointment at the extraordinary way in which the probing amendment has been received. I had thought that the Minister would immediately accept the principle that inspired the amendment and would have agreed to the House of Lords bringing in a more appropriately worded amendment. However, we are dealing with a Government that are very different from that who brought in the 1965 Act. Proper qualifications were written into the 1965 Act, but they are not qualifications with which I would trust this Government. Nor are the nominees that they will appoint necessarily the ones I would agree to.<br/>
A Labour Government brought in the 1965 Act. It says that there can be no transfer of objects unless it is approved by
<q>not less than two-thirds of the governors for the time being.</q>
That was at a time when the board was made up of three separately appointed thirds, but now it is a board entirely composed of Government nominees and, of all "uncommercial" bodies, the City of London. I would not trust my bodkin to such a body. There are good reasons why we put this to the "&#x00E0;l 'outrance", as they probably said at the time of Charles X, because we cannot trust this lot.<br/>
There is another reason for the clause. We are not saying that it is necessarily a bad thing for museums to interchange or to loan. There may even be an occasion when such a provision might extend to other sections, for example when there are duplicate copies of instruments. However, we want such movement to be rare, qualified and taken care of by a properly democratic board of governors, not one appointed by this Government.<br/>
A final reason for the new clause is that we shall be in power in two years. We are willing to have an absolute regulation, not for all time to come, but a stop placed on the actions of this Government and their board during the following two years. Given the disappointing answer, we can no longer treat this as a probing amendment but as a correct and firm amendment and a moderate assessment of the position that we are facing.</p>

<p>Amendments Nos.1, 3 and 4 are consequential upon each other. Their purpose is to eliminate the Corporation of the City of London from that part of the Bill which allows nomination to the museum's board of governors. The continuity of the museum's board will be broken on 1 April 1986 when, with the abolition of the GLC, that council's nominees will not longer be able to serve on the board.<br/>
In Committee the Opposition were consistent in opposing extensions of nominating rights to the City of London. On reflection, we now wish to remove the City of London entirely from the right to nominate to the board. The Bill is before the House only because of the abolition of the GLC. We would not be considering changing the board's composition were it not for the disgraceful abolition of the GLC&#x2014;something on which I have spoken many times in the House and on which I shall continue to speak until citywide government in London is restored. I agree that we shall have to await the next Labour Government, but I can be patient for about two years.<br/>
In the meantime, we should bounce this matter straight back at the Government. We must say to them, "You have caused the mess in London because of an act of political vindictiveness by the Prime Minister, who personally wrote into the 1983 Tory party election manifesto the abolition of the GLC and then added the metropolitan county councils for good measure." The Government are only now realising the mess that will be left in London and elsewhere because of abolition. The Bill represents only a small part; it is not the messiest part of abolition. The provision of sewerage and waste disposal services will be a far messier consequence of GLC abolition than altering


the composition of the board of the Museum of London, but they stem from the same irresponsible, undemocratic act&#x2014;the authoritarian approach of the Prime Minister, who said that, because she did not like the people who controlled the GLC, she would abolish it.<br/>
That might sound an unlikely thing for the Prime Minister to say, but I refer hon. Members to the speech made by the chairman of the Tory party&#x2014;the right hon. Member for Chingford (Mr. Tebbit)&#x2014;who, in his inimitably gallant and moderate way, said that because the new divisive Labour party controlled county hall, the Government would abolish the GLC. He is the only Conservative to have spoken the truth publicly about the abolition of the GLC. It was an act of political vindictiveness inspired by the Prime Minister, and this Bill is a consequence of it.<br/>
I want the Government to pick up the entire tab for the Museum of London and to give all the rights of nomination to the Prime Minister, because she caused the problem. Another reason for my wishing to do so&#x2014;this is much more pleasant from the Opposition's point of view&#x2014;is that the City of London has no long-term future. The next Labour Government will have to consider the structure of London local government&#x2014;</p>

<p>I shall tell the hon. Gentleman why. I am certain that, when the Labour Government do so, the City of London will not avoid the fate that it has dodged since the 19th century. At that time, the City of London had an opportunity to expand its limits to those of the natural London at the time, but it declined because it wished to retain its ancient rights and privileges.<br/>
I remind the House that the Herbert Commission, which reported in 1960, said that if logic had anything to do with it, it would recommend the amalgamation of the City of Westminister and the City of London; but logic had its limits and, for its purposes, the City of London lay outside them. What an amazing statement: the City of London can defy logic. It might have been able to do so until now, but it cannot defy the democratic wishes of the incoming Labour Government, and I look to that Government to do something about the City and the democratic structure of London.<br/>
8.45 pm<br/>
My amendments anticipate that event. We do not wish to have to introduce a Museum of London Bill in 1989 and again change the structure of the board of governors. The hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley) asked why we wished to abolish the Corporation of the City of London. I refer him to the structure of the City, with 13,000 electors controlling the wealthiest part of London. The City retains the business vote, although it was abolished in the rest of Britain some years ago. It retains aldermen, who were abolished throughout local government elsewhere. What is more, those aldermen are elected for life. Can one imagine the uproar if I came to the House and said that GLC members should be elected for life? There is a good bunch of GLC members over there, and they deserve to hold office for life&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh!"] Not all of them; occasionally one has to take prisoners on board, and one cannot always pick and choose the people with whom one travels. We should have met great opposition had we introduced such an undemocratic proposal. That is what happens in the City,

and that is why we do not want the City to have nominating rights to the board of governors. Central Government should accept the entire burden.<br/>
The Museum of London is not the museum of the City of London. Another reason for our objection to the corporation's power of nomination being enhanced was our fear that a museum designed for all of London would become more limited in its scope and vision because one of its major paymasters was the City of London. A concentration on the square mile would not be in the interests of Greater London as a whole, nor in the interests of the museum generally&#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I realise that interesting meetings are occurring in the Chamber; clearly my hon. Friends are already completely convinced of the argument and need not listen to my speech. However, from the attentive faces of Conservative Members, I know that the power of my rhetoric is swaying them. They understand the basis of my argument. They realise that right is on our side in this argument, as in all others, and in that confidence I urge the amendments on the House.</p>

Amendment No.3 suggests that those nominees should be replaced by a further 12 governors to be appointed by the Prime Minister. That is the most curious amendment, because in Committee and on the Floor of the House during the past half hour we have heard several attacks on the suggestion that my right hon.

<p>&#x2014;about the appointment of governors.<br/>
I am delighted that the Opposition have such trust in my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister. It is excellent news that they believe my right hon. Friend would make a good range of appointments to the board. It is marvellous news that the Opposition have now changed their mind after all the discussions in the debate. At least we have managed to convert the Opposition to the wisdom of the Government's approach and my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister's sensible appointments to the board of governors.<br/>
I must rightly and firmly stick to the fundamental point that I have made throughout. It would not be sensible to divorce the appointment of governors from the funding arrangements &#x2014; that is to say, 50 per cent. from the Government and 50 per cent. from the City of London. it would be sensible and consistent to stick to that approach.</p>

<p>Unlike the hon. Gentleman, who seems to be totally inconsistent so far in his contributions, I am trying to be consistent. The Government are giving 50 per cent. of the funding, and the Corporation of the City of London is giving the other 50 per cent. It makes absolute sense that each should have nine nominees out of the 18, and we should persist with that broad approach. If the City is contributing 50 per cent., it is certainly not unreasonable that it should have that role in the appointment of the governors.<br/>
I must reiterate that I have always taken seriously the important points about the Londonwide nature of the museum. That concept is built into the Bill in clause 2, which was debated to a considerable extent in Committee. I repeat what was said in Committee and during the earlier stages of the Bill, that in making these appointments to the board of governors my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister and the City of London Corporation will take full account of the Londonwide nature of the museum.<br/>
I wholly and utterly reject the attack made by the hon. Member for Newham, North-West on the City and his claims that the City is unsuitable as a body to make these nominations. I must tell the House that the corporation has a long and distinguished tradition of serving Greater London and the surrounding area. We should remind ourselves that the City Corporation established the Guildhall museum, which was a forerunner of the Museum of London. The corporation has played a major part in the creation of the Museum of London. I ask the House to reject the amendments.</p>

<p>The Opposition cannot get reason through to the Government. The whole point is that since this mess was created by the Government and the Prime Minister, the sensible thing is to let them get on with it for a couple of years, not involve the City of London with all the problems: leave it to the Government.<br/>
The Opposition have made every attempt to secure some democratic representative content in the governing body. We do not regard appointment by the Prime Minister and the Government as particularly democratic, and it is certainly not representative. We do not regard the City of London as democratic or representative. For that reason we tried different methods, successive bodies, a combination of the boroughs, the question of ILEA and so on. It seemed to us that at least the Greater London Arts Association has concern for the arts&#x2014;and there is no guarantee that the Prime Minister or City of London nominees would have that&#x2014;and that was one final, modest attempt to get the matter resolved.</p>

That particularly foolish act has affected Sadler's Wells and the Arts Council which will have difficulties as it has been completely under-funded.

<p>The hon. Gentleman must do me no wrong on that point. I have never, at any point, attacked any member so far appointed by the City of London.

Above all, we have disputed the suggestion that its power in relation to the board should be increased. We have no doubts about that but I made no criticism of present members, despite the actions of the Government.<br/>
The only advice I would give to whatever directors are appointed, is that they should not write any solicitors' letters and, above all, they should not go near the Solicitor-General while this Government are in power.<br/>

<p>The Opposition have been consistent throughout about the City of London. There has been no criticism of any governors, either those appointed by the City of London or by the Greater London council. I still hope that when the Minister announces the names of the new governors, he will bear in mind the service and contribution of a number of the GLC nominees, who have been drawn from across the parties, to the success of the Museum of London.<br/>
This is a matter of principle. The Opposition have opposed the extension of powers for the City in terms of nominating rights because we do not believe that, in local government terms, the City of London is the correct and democratic institution to have such powers.<br/>
I have many personal friends within the City of London. In my term of office as chairman of the Greater London council, which still has some weeks yet to run, I have had many courteous exchanges with past and present Lord Mayors of London, and very charming and pleasant people they are. But I stress that this is a matter of principle not a personal matter. The reason behind the Opposition amendments about the City is that we want to minimise the disruption to the composition of the governing body by the City of London. It is the full, firm and stated intention of the Labour party when it is returned to power in a couple of years time, to deal with the City of London. There will


not be abolition in the crude sense; rather I trust it will be through the incorporation of the City of London into the surrounding boroughs.<br/>
County hall may well have been sold as a hotel or supermarket or for some other obscene purpose promoted by the London Residuary Body supported by the Government. We might have to transfer the government of London to the Guildhall and the Mansion house. I look forward to a new Lord Mayor of London who will represent all Londoners and not just the 13,000 residents within the square mile.<br/>
9 pm<br/>
When that day comes and I, as the last chairman of the GLC, greet the new Lord Mayor in the Mansion house, I shall be able to say, "We tried in 1986 to stop further disruption of the Museum of London governing bodies, but it looks as though we failed." That is one of the consequences of the incorporation of the City of London. We are merely trying to anticipate what will happen in two years' time. Clearly, the Minister does not want to take the opportunity to look into the future.</p>

<p>Mr. Deputy Speaker, you suggested that we should sensibly take these amendments as a group because each one flows from the other.<br/>
The purpose of amendment No.6 is to make it clear that the Museum of London or any other body or person in conjunction with whom it may be working in connection with the provision of archaeological services in London may publish information deriving from archaeological investigations and research.<br/>
I gave undertakings in Committee to consider an amendment along those lines. The amendment follows the spirit of the amendment tabled by Opposition Members. However, the wording of their amendment was not sufficiently clear and did not sit easily with the Bill's existing wording. There are three points. The first is that we have detached publications from the non-specific powers to provide and promote archaeological services. Secondly, we have linked the power to publish to the result of the specific investigation and research being carried out under the terms of the Bill. Thirdly, the wording follows the pattern of similar provisions in existing legislation.<br/>
As I explained to the Committee, I did not believe that the amendment was strictly necessary, but there are precedents in the London Government Act 1963 and the

Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979. I must be fair to the hon. Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) who said in Committee:
<q>excavation is not completed until it is published".&#x2014;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee</i> E, 21 January 1986, c. 101.]</q>
I agree with that. I should not wish there to be any doubt about the powers to publish information under the Bill. For that reason, I commend the amendment to the House.</p>

<p>The amendment excludes part of the compound, complex clause 2 which does a number of things. The amendment would delete clause 2(4) which provides:
<q>(4) The Board shall not acquire or dispose of any land or any estate or interest in land without the consent of the Secretary of State and the Corporation and such consent may be given subject to such conditions as the Secretary of State and the Corporation consider appropriate.</q><br/>
We are all aware that the increased number of members of the governing board will be nominated entirely by the Prime Minister and the City corporation. The powers of those bodies, by virtue of their powers of nomination, will be increased indirectly. The indirect power of elected persons&#x2014;members of the GLC&#x2014;are not just being decreased, they are being extinguished. That in itself would give additional powers to the Government, and the corporation, but an additional power is being written into the Bill which we did not discuss a great deal in Committee. The sanction of the Secretary of State and of the City of London Corporation will be required, to acquire or dispose of land or property.<br/>
What is more significant is that either of those or both can place limitations on the discretion of the governors in pursuit of that activity. The Minister may tell us that such and such an Act has been passed in relation to other museums or, indeed, national monuments where these powers are inserted. Be that as it may, the Minister has to make out a specific, proper case for increasing the powers of both these authorities. We know that it is not necessarily to be used in a way related entirely to acquisition and disposal.<br/>
I imagine that people, when given power, like to use it. I can imagine that the Secretary of State, the Minister, or those who advise him at the third or fourth level, or some people in a committee of the City of London corporation, when asked: "May we buy this land, this warehouse, or that historic house in the City or


elsewhere?" will say "Yes, you may do so as long as &#x2026;"The "as long as" may set out the conditions which may require that the board of governors should perhaps make a charge or dispose of what are regarded as surplus assets &#x2014;both are matters which we have already discussed. It may require the Board to do something which it may not be inclined to do otherwise.<br/>
These powers do not look great, but could be exercised in a way which would provide less scope for the governors. It behoves the Secretary of State or the Minister to tell us why. The Minister should tell us what he has in mind and the type of condition which may be imposed in these circumstances. Unless he does I do not think we can decide our views on the matter, although in principle, we think the clause should not go through. The case was not made in Committee.<br/>
Amendment number 11 relates to the corporation's powers in this respect. Let us suppose that the Secretary of State says, "All right, half the money is coming from me and I can make those conditions." Is there any reason why the corporation should as well? The Minister will no doubt reply, "Ah, but the corporation is providing part of the money, so it should have these powers as well."<br/>
That is arithmetically true, but as has been made abundantly clear in this debate, the City of London Corporation is acting for the whole of Greater London in that it is the only London body specifically involved in nominations. It is providing money in an unrepresentative way. The Minister, when he replies, will have to justify his having the powers. But he must make out a specific case for the corporation having them too. Even if there are precedents in other legislations, I would think that these additional powers are unnecessary because the additional members of the board of governors are appointed by the corporation and the Secretary of State.</p>

<p>I believe that the clause as it stands, unamended, is wholly desirable. As we discussed in Committee, the Museum of London is tantamount to being a charity. It is treated as a charity in all legal respects. It is common in charitable law that a restriction is imposed on the distribution, sale or any other disposal of assets especially of land. The doctrine of cy pres should apply. That is that the property should go to the next nearest object of similar worth. I can see that there is a difficulty and that it might be thought desirable for property to go to some other body, but it is only sensible that those who have paid for the organisation should have ultimate control over the disposition of any property that is sold. I doubt whether the Secretary of State or the corporation will be in conflict with the board that they have so carefully appointed.<br/>
The clause is wholly sensible and ensures that assets are disposed of only with the agreement of the Secretary of State and the corporation. I see nothing wrong in it.</p>

<p>Will the Minister consider accepting amendment No.10, which provides a small extension? I shall not repeat our arguments on this subject. We have expressed our doubt about the Conservative party and those it will appoint to look after the museum. The Bill is restrictive and amendment No. 10 would facilitate the exercise of the Board's functions by providing that acquisition

<q>will facilitate the exercise of their functions by the Board of Governors and that the acquisition or disposal is in the best interests of Greater London generally".</q>
We have been worried by the narrowness of view that has been expressed generally and which appears to have been taken towards the museum. We are anxious to ensure that Greater London and the region round about is taken care of. I therefore ask the Minister to consider accepting amendment No. 10, if only for the greater comfort of the leigis.</p>

<p>I can give a strong assurance that the interests of Greater London will be taken into account.<br/>
Amendment No.9 would delete section 3(4)of the Museum of London Act 1965, as proposed in clause 2.That subsection empowers the board of governors to acquire or dispose of land, subject to the consent of the two funding authorities&#x2014;the Government and the City. The provision which the amendment would delete brings the Museum of London in line with the National Heritage Act 1983, which applies more specifically to the Science Museum and to the Victoria and Albert Museum. It is essential that I, on behalf of taxpayers, who will find half of the museum's costs, should be able to have a say in the expansion of the museum's estate. The plans to acquire or dispose of land are already subject to scrutiny by the funding authorities in considering the museum's annual budget. It is right to include that more formally in the Bill. That is also important from the point of view of accountability.<br/>
Amendment No.11 would require the consent of the Secretary of State to the acquisition and disposal of land and property, but not that of the City of London corporation. I must reject that, too, for the reasons that I have already given. It is wholly appropriate for the City, as one of the two funding authorities, to have a say in changes in the museum's estate. As I said, it will already do that when considering the museum's annual budget. It is right to include this more formally in the Bill as well.<br/>
The hon. Member for Paisley, South (Mr. Buchan) implied that, if we will not accept amendments Nos.9 and 11, the Opposition would like to impose conditions on whichever Minister is responsible before he is able to consent to the acquisition or disposal of land by the board of governors. That runs counter to the amendment moved by the hon. Gentleman, but I appreciate that the main purpose of the amendment was a probing one. I readily accept that the conditions mentioned in amendment No. 10 are among those on which I and my successors would wish to be satisfied. However, they would be among several factors to be taken into account in the overall responsibility.<br/>
9.15 pm<br/>
We get into more difficulty if we try to imagine every set of circumstances in which the board of governors would have to take account of the acquisition and disposal of land. It is more sensible to remain consistent with the National Heritage Act 1983, with which the Bill is in total line and which allows for accountability on the part of the Government and the City. With that in mind, I ask the House to reject the amendments.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) will wish to put his own view on amendments Nos. 9 and 11. In the middle of this general discussion, I wish to comment on amendment No. 10, to which my name is attached.<br/>
It is all very well referring to the National Heritage Act 1983,but clause 2 substitutes section 3 of the Museum of London Act, which gives general powers. When this matter was discussed in Committee, we argued that the remainder of clause 2, because it detailed a number of functions, but not all the possible functions, left open to question whether those functions not mentioned could be ignored. The Minister will remember the argument. We argued that we would prefer general powers to the listing of some powers.<br/>
In relation to the listing of some powers, the Minister said that he accepts the qualification as being among several qualifications, but not all. However, he turns our argument back on us and says that he cannot accept the qualification because it could throw in doubt the other purposes with which subsection (4) might deal. He cannot accept proposals regarding subsections (1),(2) and (3),and prevent additional qualifications and purports from being written into subsection (4).The purpose of amendment No. 10 is that it should in the best interests of Greater London generally. To be consistent with the line the Minister has taken of listing several objectives rather than the general powers in clause 3 of the parent Act of 1965, he has compelled us to adopt his philosophy and structure of clause 2 and extend it into subsection (4).<br/>
To be consistent with changing a simple eight line general powers section into a long and extended section by including functions, I ask the Minister, for our comfort, to add in subsection (4) that it must be done in the best interests of Greater London. Otherwise, he will be faced with the problem that he tried to argue about in Committee. His argument was that the proposal sets out the objectives and purposes. Everyone is entitled to believe that the fact that the amendment is missing suggests that it need not have been included. We are asking that it is included and we hope that the Minister will reconsider it.</p>

<p>I am not sure of the procedure, Mr. Speaker. Amendments Nos.9,10 and 11 are being taken together because they are on the same point. Amendments Nos. 9 and 11 seek to remove the additional powers that the Bill gave to the Secretary of State and the Corporation of the City of London respectively in imposing conditions on the governors of the Museum of London. Amendment No.10,to which my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South(Mr. Buchan)has just referred, is not consistent with the provisions of amendments Nos. 9 and 11. In a sense, my hon. Friend's amendment says that if the Minister cannot accept my measures to delete these power, we should at least insert a safeguard.<br/>
I seek your guidance, Mr. Speaker. If I withdraw amendments Nos.9 and 11, will it be possible to put the Question on amendment No. 10? Although I do not like the increased powers given to the Secretary of State and the Corporation of the City of London, especially in view of the increased representation that they already have, and

although I am not entirely persuaded by the arguments on the Science museum, the Victoria and Albert museum and the National Heritage Act 1983,there is some logic in them. Therefore, I do not seek to press amendments Nos. 9 and 11. I hope my colleagues agree that there is some sense in what my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South said about safeguards and that we are able to express a view, even if it is negative, on amendment No.10.</p>

<p>I beg to move amendment No.12, in page 3, leave out lines 14 to 19.<br/>
As I said in Committee, clause 2 has many parts. The amendment will delete new section 8(2), which states:
<q>The Board may allow any premises occupied or managed by them to be used by other persons (for payment or otherwise) for purposes not connected with the Board's functions under this Act if the Board are satisfied that to do so would not conflict with those functions.</q><br/>
The aim of new section 8(2)is to widen the board's discretion in the use of the premises in the way outlined. Normally, one might say that that is a good thing and that it gives more scope and options to the board. However, because of the actions of the Government and, perhaps, of some of their nominees, I am unhappy with the breadth and scope of that measure. Clearly these activities., for which payment may or may not be made, are likely to be entirely outside the museum's purposes.<br/>
Those purposes are fairly wide in terms of cultural and other activities. Under this measure the board of governors may, as it were, turn its premises to commercial advantage. The Barbican and the City of London would be ideal premises for all sorts of social or business functions to take place. The Minister will say, "The board must be satisfied that this does not conflict with its functions." There could be much discussion by the board, because, of course, that is a matter of judgment.<br/>
If conditions are to be laid down on the sale of property, the Secretary of State may say, as he has said to many local authorities&#x2014;if he can treat elected authorities in this way, he can treat the board of governors in the same way &#x2014;"You may do that, but you had better make a bit of money for yourself. You have the power. Advertise and let the property for the price that the market will bear."<br/>
Despite the qualification that there must not be a conflict with the functions of the museum, such conflict is a matter of judgment. The commercialisation of the premises would be a real danger. I hope that the Minister will at least give an indication of the thinking of the Secretary of State, if not of the City of London Corporation.</p>

<p>The purpose of the amendment is to remove the part of the Act that gives the power to the board to


<q>allow any premises occupied or managed by them to be used by other persons (for payment or otherwise) for purposes not connected with the Board's functions under this Act if the Board are satisfied"&#x2014;</q>
I stress that&#x2014;
<q>that to do so would not conflict with those functions.</q>
That is important.<br/>
The provision stems from an equivalent provision in the National Heritage Act 1983, which has proved useful in practice. The idea is simple&#x2014;it is to give the board of governors the option to allow the museum premises to be used for functions, events and so on which are outside the direct objectives of the museum as defined elsewhere in the Act.<br/>
The provision allows the board to raise money for the museum by charging for the hiring of its premises for occasional events. I do not see why I should not urge the House to agree that that objective should be encouraged.<br/>
In answer to the probing of the hon. Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing), I must stress that that power is not confined to the Museum of London, but is already allowed for with other museums such as the Science and the Victoria and Albert museums. I remind the hon. Gentleman that the activities must not conflict with the functions of the board.<br/>
It is wholly sensible that the board should have that small degree of latitude, if it so wishes, to allow the premises to be used, if they are not at that time being used for their normal purposes, to raise money for the museum through hirings. After all, such an option is at the discretion of the board of governors.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend is right. Experience since the 1983 Act has shown that such a provision can be useful. We should give that latitude to the board of governors, provided that it is in keeping with the objectives of the museum.<br/>

<p>With the leave of the House, Mr. Speaker. I am afraid that the Minister's words confirmed my worst suspicions. In effect, he said, "Let the board make the best use of its assets, even if it is for purposes not connected with the purposes of the museum."<br/>
I accept that the Minister said that such purposes should not conflict with the museum's purposes, but if there must be a balance to compensate for the reduction in Exchequer contribution, there could be a possible conflict in the use of the premises. My public library, because of pressure from the Government, has become a disgrace because of the hours that it is not open. It is not used by anyone when it is closed. With any other Government in office I would not have pressed the amendment, but in view of the well-known predilections of both the City of London Corporation and the Prime Minister, if not of the Secretary of State, I feel that the Question should be put.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.<br/>
We have had about 15 or 16 hours of debate on Second Reading and in Committee and now the Bill is being debated once more on the Floor of the House. The House has shown the importance that it attaches to the Museum of London by the amount of time that it has been prepared to give to scrutinising the Bill. We may not have agreed on a number of issues but, whatever is said, we all wish to see the museum succeed.<br/>
We are seeking to make adequate arrangements for the museum's funding and for appointments to the board of governors after the abolition of the GLC on 1 April. I believe that the Bill succeeds in doing that. The Government's strong commitment to the museum is demonstrated by the fact that we have, jointly with the City Corporation, increased the museum's budget for the coming financial year by over 10 per cent.<br/>
We have had full debates about the museum's responsibilities towards archaeological services and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment has made it plain that additional sums are being made available to the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission so that it can undertake archaeological services in conjunction with the museum. Against that background, I express the view that the museum has a great future. That future has been reinforced by the Government's recently announced funding arrangements and by what I hope will be the passing of the Bill.</p>

<p>As the Minister has said, we have had about 15 or 16 hours of debate in considering the Bill. It is not one of the larger measures that the Government are to bring before the House this Session, but it is an interesting Bill. It has given the House and the Committee a chance to discuss various aspects of arts policy, and it is sad that the House seldom has an opportunity to explore and debate them. We have been able to discuss the problem of acquisition and the relationship between the arts and education. We have also discussed the more fundamental issues of accountability and general policy and attitude towards the arts. For that reason&#x2014;that of lack of opportunity &#x2014;the the House has welcomed the chance to enter into these debates. It is sad, however, that the opportunity arises in considering an extremely ill-judged and ill-conceived Bill.<br/>
Our consideration of the Bill has provided us with the chance to hear the views of a newly appointed Minister, and we have had the opportunity to assess him. We welcome him in his new job and welcome specifically the fact that we have a Minister with responsibility for the arts


who is answerable in this House and with whom we can debate and discuss arts policy. That is something that we lacked for two years prior to his appointment. We also welcome the Minister's flexibility in listening to our arguments in Committee and amending the Bill tonight. However, despite those quiet and modest gestures of approval, it has been clear during the passage of the Bill that the Minister, for all his kind words and solicitations, is as hamstrung and straitjacketed on arts policy as his predecessor was by the Government's ideology and determination to subject the arts to pressures and rigours to which they are not suited, and in pursuance of which it does not best serve the British people &#x2014;neither the audiences nor those who live and work in the arts.<br/>
Although the Bill is small it has been extremely important, both for the museum and the Government's general policy towards museums. It is undoubtedly a bad Bill, and wholly unnecessary. It flows from the Government's vindictiveness towards the Greater London council. Because the museum was but a small part of the GLC's functions and work, the Bill has received precious little thought from the Government. I am sure that when the Prime Minister took it into her head to attack the GLC, she little knew that one of its powers and functions was to oversee the heritage of our capital city&#x2014;its archaeological, industrial, social and cultural archives and records which reside in this excellent museum. She did not know and certainly did not care about that. Therefore, when it dawned on her civil servants and Ministers that, as a consequence of her determinaton to abolish the GLC, the Government would have to deal with the museum's governorship, the Government had to cobble together this little Bill to amend the Museum of London Act 1965. As a result, this is an ill-considered Bill, and will do nothing to improve the governorship, management or future of the museum.<br/>
All hon. Members know that it is a museum of London. Therefore, logically, it should be controlled by democratically elected representatives of the people of London. All hon. Members are democrats and know that that follows from the inevitability of having a museum of London. The only sensible way to administer it is through democratically elected representatives, which is how at least part of the governorship of the museum has always been in the past. But the Bill is removing that one democratically elected representative part of the governorship which has a direct interest in and accountability to the people of London. In doing so, the Government do no favours to the museum or the people of London.<br/>
All hon. Members know that that is true, and that the management and administration of the museum to date has been extremely good. When the Minister replies I defy him to say how the Bill can possibly improve the quality of the museum, or of its accountability to the people of London. Because of the museum's good management, it may continue as well as before, but the Bill does not improve the quality of the museum. The Government have been meddling in the administration of the museum simply because of their vindictive attitude towards the GLC. That cannot be a good reason to alter the governorship, powers and functions of the museum. The Minister knows that that is the case. In Committee he could not give one way in which the Bill would improve the museum, and he knows that it will not do so. The Bill does not improve the museum one jot or tittle.<br/>
The greatest nonsense of all is that, because of the absurdity of having to introduce the Bill, the Government have found themselves turning their own policies on their heads. The Government are determined to cut expenditure in every area but because of this Bill they are increasing Government expenditure on the Museum of London.<br/>
The Minister has come before the House and the Committee saying how good and virtuous the Government are and how well intentioned they are in planning to spend &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;5 million a year on the museum in the future. That is an increase in the museum's overall budget of 10 per cent. The Opposition welcome that and thank the Minister for it. We hope that that increase will continue in subsequent years. However, the Minister has not told the House that that &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;5 million is a much greater sum than the Government contribution to the museum last year. Therefore, we have the absurdity of a Government committed to cutting Government expenditure having to increase Government expenditure on the museum because of their facile and stupid attitude towards the Greater London council. There cannot be any greater absurdity for the Minister for the Arts to find himself in.<br/>
For all the kind words, concern about standards and intelligent interest in the conditions of the museum arid its future which the Minister expressed in Committee, the truth is that the Government's basic philosophy towards the arts, not only their political philosophy towards local government and democratic representations in London, is not consistent with a good, sane and improved administration of the arts.<br/>
The arts should not be solely for the market place. There is a national and public interest in the arts and in our culture which goes beyond that. That is something which the Government have missed and not understood in the Bill and because of that, the Bill brings no credit to the Government. I am sure that the Bill will be repealed by a future Labour Government when they return democratic government to London.</p>

<p>It would be wrong for the Bill to pass to the other place without a tribute being paid to those who work in this excellent museum. One of the great advantages of being selected for the Standing Committee was the opportunity, which many of us took, to visit the museum and see it with a fresh mind. It was a great privilege to be able to see behind the scenes. However many times many of us may have been to the museum, it had previously been impossible to see behind the scenes.<br/>
The museum is an iceberg. It may be a clich&#x00E9; to say one eighth above water and seven eighths below, but that is true of the museum, in that the artefacts on display are but a tiny proportion of the total amount of paintings, prints and relics which are lovingly restored and lovingly catalogued. They left a deep impression upon me. The way in which the people work behind the scenes with such great dedication is something of which the people of London and the country should be proud.<br/>
When I visited the museum there were only two matters pressed upon me by those who wished to discuss the impending Bill. Those matters were not political, but sensible alterations or clarifications to the Bill. The first was that we should have regard to the contribution of the London boroughs in appointing people to the board. That has been guaranteed by my right hon. Friend. It is not just


a museum of the City of London. It is a museum of London, of all its people and the area around London. That has been clearly set out by my right hon. Friend.<br/>
Secondly, the people at the museum wanted to ensure that the archaeological side of the museum would be guaranteed. It has been, and is consistent with the other powers of the board of the museum. I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for what he said in that regard.<br/>
There is a third matter which is one of my own. I had hoped that a report might be presented, at least once every three years, or more if circumstances determine, because of extra funding. I am glad that my right hon. Friend has said that that will be dealt with in another place. I am grateful for the extra funding which the Government are providing for the year to come.<br/>
The Museum of London shares in the honour that my right hon. Friend received. No doubt the idea of making my right hon. Friend a Privy Councillor was swayed by his appointment as Minister for the Arts. It is a tribute to the way in which Conservatives view the arts that he has been so elevated. Therefore, on the Bill passing to the other place, I congratulate my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Arts and the Government on their commitment to the historical arts of London.</p>

<p>That was a brown-nosed job of a speech, but it was made in that wonderful voice that the hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley) has, which no doubt will guarantee him future appearances on party political broadcasts for the Conservative party.<br/>
When I saw the Leader of the House come in, I thought that we would have the tumultuous news that the abolition of the GLC was just an ugly rumour, but I now realise that the right hon. Gentleman is probably more interested in the speech on the Adjournment, which is perhaps nearer to his heart than are the arts. That is on his own admission. He has said that he is probably the worst philistine in the House. It is a brave claim, even for the Leader of the House, given the company he keeps.<br/>
The Bill is one of the easier aspects of the abolition of the GLC.I correct the Minister. The GLC will be abolished at midnight on 31 March. It is the Government who take over on All Fools' day on 1 April, not the GLC. Although the Bill is one of the easier aspects of GLC abolition, in other areas of the arts in London the consequences are likely to be more fraught and dangerous. We have heard talk about Sadler's Wells. If the Minister for the Arts wants to show his total commitment to the arts, let him, even at this late stage, make an announcement when he speaks on Third Reading that the Government will step in with the necessary funds to save Sadler's Wells. That will be the way of guaranteeing that this otherwise largely unreported debate will get some coverage tomorrow morning. Let us see whether the right hon. Gentleman would like to reach out for that.<br/>
There are problems not only with Sadler's Wells but with the Half Moon, the Theatre Royal in my constituency, the Riverside, the Tricycle, the Warehouse, and all the many small theatres, particularly in community and ethnic arts. They will suffer because of the abolition of the GLC. The Greater London Arts Association has estimated that between 25 and 100 bodies are likely to go because of GLC abolition. No one can quantify the

number. However, the Bill represents an easy part of abolition. The Minister will have many more pressing problems on his plate from 1 April. I do not think that he will have such an easy ride when he deals with those aspects of GLC abolition.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher) said how strange it was that a Government who advocated the abolition of the GLC, at least on one ground, that of cost, now find that they have to dig deep into the public purse to pay for services and interests previously maintained efficiently and effectively by the GLC on behalf of Londoners. I suspect that, as with the problems for the arts, problems about the public expenditure consequences of GLC abolition will come back time and again to haunt the Government before their demise at the general election.<br/>
I shall always seek to catch your eye, Mr. Speaker, to rub in the message on GLC abolition long after 31 March when it has been abolished. However, this evening we are dealing with a small aspect of the abolition of the GLC.I join the hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes and my hon. Friends in wishing the Museum of London well in future. The future is no better now than it was when the GLC was partly responsible for the museum's affairs. I pay great tribute to the role of the GLC and to the support that it gave to the museum.<br/>
I give particular credit to the GLC nominees on the governing body of the museum. I remind the Minister once again that those nominees were not selected on the basis of the Prime Minister's dictum, "Is he one of us?" They were selected on a cross-party basis and included Tory as well as Labour nominees. I hope that the Minister will bear that in mind when he appoints the governors after the Bill has received Royal Assent. I hope that he will also bear in mind the service rendered by the GLC nominees, both Conservative and Labour.<br/>
We shall have to return to this matter in a few years' time. After the election of a Labour Government, the restoration of citywide democracy and the abolition of the City of London, we shall have to look again at the functions of the Museum of London, and in particular at its board. We shall remember this evening. The Opposition wish the Bill well in another place. It is a necessary Bill, because of abolition, and we do not wish to oppose it.</p>

<p>I rise in support of my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Arts. I, too, wish this measure to be enacted. During the Second Reading debate on the Museum of London Bill I referred to private sponsorship of the arts, which is relevant both to the heritage and to the Museum of London. It may be of interest to those hon. Members who were present on that occasion to know that, subsequent to the adoption of my report on this subject by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, a favourable response has been received from the Committee of Ministers. It shares the view that
<q>the potential resources for cultural financing can be increased by combining state and private efforts.</q>
In the opinion of the Committee of Ministers, such a combination has been made especially relevant as member states seek the most effective use of the resources that are available for culture and turn increasingly to forms of co-funding with other bodies. However, despite such

<p>I shall not give way to the hon. Gentleman. There was enough to-ing and fro-ing in Committee for us to know exactly where all hon. Members stand in their commitment to the arts and the heritage. I see no reason for the proceedings of the House to be held up once again. I believe that the Bill will assist the Museum of London. It will also assist the people of London and my constituents who live outside London. I wish the measure well.</p>

<p>I rise to make the last Opposition speech before the Bill goes to the House of Lords, where I suspect many amendments will be made to it.<br/>
This is not a happy occasion. Indeed, it is a very sad one. It is the first measure to have emerged after the introduction of the stupid, malevolent and ill-thought-out concept to abolish the Greater London council and the metropolitan counties. It has been done out of malevolence and pique, and without considering most of the consequences that will flow from abolition. Above all, it was done with no consideration of how properly to replace any democratic say in the various institutions of London. The Museum of London is only one aspect but it is a serious sign that the Government intend to maintain this undemocratic approach throughout the many other problems that will arise.<br/>
Several hon. Members have referred to the fact that we have had between 15 and 16 hours of discussion. One of the problems was the interminable intervention of Conservative Members, which limited the useful discussions of the Opposition. We accept that some hon. Members&#x2014;even in Committee, difficult as it was to discern&#x2014;may he interested and concerned in the arts. I go further. I believe that the new Minister, perhaps without any direct experience, is learning fast. I think that he learned during the course of the Committee. Attention has been drawn to the desire to bring in the London boroughs and to emphasise archaeological aspects. That largely stems from pressure that we brought to bear. While at the end of the day amendments were not required, there was a commitment that we welcomed.<br/>
We have been accused of making nothing but anticapitalist statements. In fact we have brought a change of tone and attitude towards the Bill. We have even

recognised Government amendments. To talk about anticapitalist remarks reminds me of Karl Marx's comment that the bourgeoisie built statues to the great writers of the past but that if they had ever read their books they would have burned them. We congratulate the Minister on his first venture only because it is his first venture, not because of the nature of the Bill.<br/>
A number of issues still face us in relation to the arts in Londong. The narrowness of view in relation to the Museum of London has borne fruit in recent weeks. At the time of abolition, both of the metropolitan authorities and the GLC, we warned that among the areas of our life that would be in deadly trouble were the arts. Pledge after pledge made by the previous Minister and repeated by the present Minister, maintained that the arts were in no danger and that funding would be brought forward to replace the funding that would be lost from the metropolitan authorities and the GLC.<br/>
Of course, it was said that there would be cuts. Of the &#x00A3;20 million that was required, &#x00A3;4 million would come from the boroughs. That proved to be a complete misunderstanding &#x2014; an under-estimate. In fact, even with the additional &#x00A3;10 million for the arts, there is still a &#x00A3;19 million shortfall. The Arts Council says it needs &#x00A3;10 million because it knows it will not get the &#x00A3;9 million from the Government.<br/>
We are seeing the consequences. The Government say that they are under-funding deliberately because the successor bodies will come forward to support the arts, yet the first thing that happens is that no successor body&#x2014;no borough, no council&#x2014;is represented in the first piece of legislation. That is some evidence of what can be done by the successor councils when they are treated with such contempt.<br/>
But the Government know and we know, and events have proved, that what we said was right. Local councils have had their rate support grants cut and have been rate-capped. Indeed, it is those who are most generous towards the arts who have been subjected to rate capping. They cannot replace the funding that came from the metropolitan authorities and the GLC. We hear the Minister saying that he is proud of the &#x00A3;2 million-plus that the Government and the City of London have added. Yet it is astonishing that the Government have been led into additional expenditure which they did not think about when they abolished the GLC. We must remember that the rest of the arts remain in trouble.<br/>
The Museum of London has been saved but the Government have, for example, plunged Sadler's Wells, with its 300 years of theatrical history, not only of national importance and fame but international importance and fame, into closure. It is unthinkable, but it will happen. We have seen the Cottisloe theatre close, and now Sadler's Wells will go. We know that in the north-east, the Empire in Sunderland, the royal theatre in Newcastle, and the royal philharmonic hall in Liverpool are also in bad trouble. This is linked to what the Bill will bring about. The two things are integrally linked because they stem from the same narrow, petty, mean-minded attitude of the Government. We are seeing the apotheosis of Mammom and a growth of Philistinism.<br/>
We hope that&#x2014;</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way. I have been trying to catch his eye, but it is rather difficult when he speaks with his back to me. He spoke about the City of London. Many things have been said about its role and the additional money that it is making available to the Museum of London to match the Government's increased contribution. My hon. Friend will be interested to know that the City of London, already the wealthiest borough in London, will make a considerable amount of money out of the abolition of the GLC. This is because a number of new schemes will be carried out on a per capita basis, and as the City has only a small population, it will benefit enormously in terms of a reduction in its contribution. Even the additional money that it is giving to the Museum of London is not an act of generosity but is paid out of profits that will accrue because of the abolition of the GLC.</p>

<p>My comment about the apotheosis of Mammon was right.<br/>
The multitude of arts bodies that have been supported by the GLC, both small and professional, such as the ethnic and community arts and theatres such as the Half Moon and the royal theatre in Stratford are in London, but there are others beyond London.<br/>
We cannot take too much pleasure in the &#x00A3;4 million-plus going to the Museum of London. We are pleased that the Minister has secured that money, but we are displeased with the undemocratic and unrepresentative nature of the museum's governing body that he has inherited and will now establish. Will he take back the message to his mistress that the biggest single act that she could take, both to win our co-operation on the Bill and, more importantly, to save the arts in Britain, which are such a ferment of fear and anxiety, is to restore the money lost to the arts through the Government's ill-conceived schemes?</p>

<p>I am extremely pleased to have the opportunity of this debate, particularly as events in the Scotch whisky industry are so topical. However, the debate is on the industry and not just the immediate developments in it.<br/>
The Scotch whisky industry has had a difficult few years. Volume sales have declined from a peak in 1979. The number of distilleries has reduced since then from about 130 to 100, and employment has fallen from over 25,000 to about 16,500. While smaller companies have performed fairly well, especially those selling single malt whiskies, the industry leader, Distillers, has generally not done well, and the facts show it.<br/>
The industry is obviously extremely important, to Scotland, but it is also important to the whole of the United Kingdom. It provides manufacturing jobs, many of them in areas where there is little or no alternative, and it still represents a major export industry, with sales approaching &#x00A3;1 billion a year. It is important to maintain and develop its employment and export potential.<br/>
The recent developments began in the middle of 1985, when Guinness took over Arthur Bell and Sons plc for &#x00A3;356 million and so acquired the top domestic brand of whisky. The Fosters lager consortium, Elders IXL, has put in a bid for Allied Lyons, which includes William Teachers, whose two distilleries are in my constituency. Teachers is the second largest United Kingdom brand. That bid has rightly been referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, involving as it does the acquisition of a key product by an Australian group, which must be examined carefully in this strategic industry.<br/>
It is not surprising that bids and counterbids have been launched for a company such as Distillers, which seems to be under-achieving its potential under its present management. The first bid came from James Gulliver's Argyll Group, which offered &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;89 billion. When the bid arrived, there were calls for it to be referred to the MMC. On competition grounds that did not seem to be justified, but in relation to the strategic national interest the bid warranted at least deep consideration about whether it would secure jobs and promote exports.</p>

<p>In that context, does the hon. Gentleman recall the words of my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard), the Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, who said that in addition to competition there might be referrals
<q>where the destiny of a vital national capability is at issue?</q></p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for mentioning a factor that must be considered in all bids. I am anxious that the bids are treated equally and fairly and that similar considerations are applied in all cases. That is the critical factor.<br/>
Nevertheless, the Argyll bid was cleared. Then Guinness made a bid, which was agreed with Distillers &#x2014;it invited Guinness in and offered to pay its expenses &#x2014;for &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;19 billion. If that merger were to go ahead, it would create a group that accounted for 35 per cent. of the whisky market. There is a dispute as to how much whisky


production that group would represent, but it is between 35 and 50 per cent.&#x2014;probably nearer to 35 per cent. The group would also own, as Distillers still does, 50 per cent. of United Glass, which accounts for half the sales of bottles to the whisky industry.</p>

<p>When the hon. Gentleman produces statistics about the capability of the Distillers-Guinness conglomerate, will he take into account the spare capacity that is available to Distillers and not rely on a suggestion of actual output? Distillers has a considerable amount of capacity which is at present unused but which could come back on stream.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I intend to deal with the point later.<br/>
As Guinness has acquired Arthur Bell, it would, with Distillers, become a bigger group than Distillers alone and would be bigger than a Distillers group owned by Argyll. That presents a dilemma, because it is difficult to believe that a bid to create such an enlarged group should not be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, although the Government may take a different view. However, if that merger is referred, it would leave Argyll clear and free in the market and would handicap Guinness. Not to refer it would undermine the credibility of the Office of Fair Trading. Could it say, "We will not refer this bid because we did not refer the Argyll bid; but had there not been an Argyll bid, we might have referred it"? We must have a clear statement, whether or not the bid is referred, of the reasons for so doing. The Minister and the Government must take that point on board.<br/>
That clearly leaves the Government with limited options. If the Guinness bid is not referred to the commission there must be a clear explanation for that, as it is difficult to see why it should not be referred. If there is a good reason, it should be made available.<br/>
If, on the other hand, the bid is referred to the commission, the Ministers responsible have two further choices. They can either review the decision of Argyll on the ground that they need to consider all the implications for the industry and it would be fair to consider both bids at the same time, or they can state, as this would be the effect of their decision, that they are effectively endorsing the Argyll bid, at least by implication, and explain that they are happy for that to happen. How the bids are referred and judged should not be left to luck. Both bids have every right to be treated fairly. All the factors, jobs, exports, management potential, the merits of the bid and the implications of competition should be considered equally for both bids.<br/>
The sheer scale of these bids and the wide issues that they raise require a clear statement by the Government of their position. I do not think that we can accept a "hands off" approach, unless it is a genuine "hands off" approach. There should be no under-the-counter meddling over the decision to refer or not to refer. That would have a perceived effect, and that fact must be taken into account.<br/>
It is unfortunate for those of us who are caught in the middle of these battles that they frequently degenerate into an argument between the management of the two different companies. There are claims and counter-claims, which does not add to the clarity of information on both sides. The merits of both companies are such that there is no doubt that if either of them were to take over Distillers there would be a re-invigorated whisky industry, using the

brands to lead a new attack on the export market. That would be desirable. It is important that the relative accounts of both companies are considered.<br/>
Argyll launched its bid with an attractive statement&#x2014;attractive to me as a Scottish Member&#x2014;which claims that the company will bring Scotch whisky back home. It would establish a new company in Scotland. Its management team would be based in Scotland and the industry would be run from there. Argyll claim that its management team has a marketing background which can revitalise the industry, and it feels that its actions are a logical development of its own business.<br/>
Guinness countered that by claiming that it had greater international marketing expertise which would be much healthier and better for the industry. It also claimed that it would establish headquarters in Scotland. We should be grateful that there now seems to be renewed enthusiasm for operating international businesses within Scotland. All Scottish hon. Members will be glad to see that it seems from that point of view that we cannot lose. We shall get an enlarged whisky management group in Scotland.<br/>
I should not at this stage take sides in the issue other than to ensure that a fair deal is secured. I accept that the Scotch whisky industry needs a boost and injection of new creative management. It needs aggressive and creative marketing. I am looking for, and I believe that the Minister should want, a commitment to centering employment and management in Scotland and to securing the quality of Scotch whisky as a product and to ensuring that it is backed with effective, creative marketing to beat off the challenge it has suffered from its competitors, namely white spirits, white wine, brandy and so forth.<br/>
Although it may be invidious to mention the two together, I think we can learn something from the way the producers of Armagnac and Cognac have established the imprimatur on their quality product in a way which Scotch whisky could benefit from if it is to establish itself as top of the heap.<br/>
One of the difficulties in relation to white spirit in competition with Scotch, which will lead me to make specific recommendations at the end of my speech, is that there is, of course, no ageing process, no skilful blending and no mystique. One can make gin today and sell it effectively next week. There is no difficulty involved in forward planning, no expense in stock holding, and no creative skills are required. Yet, in the long run, that is not in the best interests of Scotland or the United Kingdom. It would certainly not create jobs in rural Scotland and it does not have the export potential that whisky has, as gin can be made relatively easily almost anywhere. Pure, good quality Scotch whisky can only be made in the right circumstances, in the right place&#x2014;in Scotland.<br/>
The Scotch whisky industry is vital to rural communities and towns in Scotland which have blending and bottling plants. Teachers has its only two distilleries in my constituency and employs 50 people in two relatively small communities. Distillers had a distillery in my constituency but closed it many years ago. I am pleased to say that Morrisons of Glasgow took it over and not only generated employment by producing malt whisky but produces tomatoes and house plants from the waste heat. The company has generated some imaginative tourism on the back of those products.<br/>
The importance of the industry to rural areas can be explained by the example of a minister whom I met. He told me that he went for a charge in a rural parish and was


asked, "Do you take a dram, minister?" Normally, a minister would assume that the correct answer was no. On this occasion he would have been wrong because the parish was entirely dependent for its employment on a malt whisky distillery. Fortunately, the minister gave not merely the right answer but the honest answer. He admitted that he took a dram and finished up with the charge.<br/>
After considering the points that I have made about the two bids the Government should make their position clear. That is critical. They should ensure that they take account of the interests of Scotland and the United Kingdom market. They should treat the bids fairly and evenhandedly and explain their position clearly.<br/>
There are three further things that the Government should do for the Scotch whisky industry. I should like to address those points to the Minister. The Government should recognise their responsibility to work with the industry to ensure a good quality product. As the Minister will recognise, a definition of Scotch whisky is required by law. The ageing process is required by law. There are one or two further areas where legislation could strengthen and develop the Scotch whisky industry.<br/>
The first point is controversial. The Government should legislate to ban the export of bulk malt whisky. I accept that some distilleries would have some difficulties as a result, but I believe that it would protect the quality of our market. We export bulk malt whisky to Japan where it is blended with the local inferior product so as to pass it off as a more acceptable product. The result is that it is harder for Scotch whisky to penetrate the Japanese market. We face the possibility of the Japanese launching a major export assault on third markets using as a base bulk malt Scotch whisky. That is nothing like as advantageous as us selling Scotch whisky to those markets. In the long term such legislation would be in the best interests of the quality of the product and the market.<br/>
The Government should insist that the legal definition of Scotch whisky should provide that it should be full strength, at least three years old, distilled, matured, blended and bottled in Scotland and contain a statement of the percentage of malt whisky included.</p>

<p>I must press on, because the Minister needs time to reply.<br/>
I know that the Minister will have to consult her colleagues on these points, but these are important issues. The Government should re-introduce stock relief to the Scotch whisky industry. The abolition of stock relief was effectively a tax on the quality of Scotch whisky. Scotch must be matured for three years. The cost of that three-year maturing process is estimated to be &#x00A3;53 million in lost stock relief. That &#x00A3;53 million would be much better deployed within the industry expanding the market. The re-introduction of stock relief would be to the Government's advantage.<br/>
I do not believe that the position of the Scotch whisky industry was appreciated when stock relief was abolished. It put Scotch whisky at a disadvantage compared to competitive products when it was facing a major assault from those products.<br/>
I urge the Minister to explain to her colleagues that Scotland feels that it should have a thriving and developing Scotch whisky industry, and they should recognise that bids of the scale that we are now witnessing fall, effectively to be the Government's responsibility. They should ensure that all the strategic considerations are taken into account, that the bids are treated fairly and equally and that Scotland obtains the best possible Scotch whisky industry, with local management, control and ownership and growing export sales. That is what we want, I hope that the Minister will be able to give answers which show that the Government are prepared to take on board their responsibilities and ensure that that is what we get.</p>

<p>One of the delights of my job in the Ministry has been the opportunity to visit some of those fine Scottish distilleries, so I welcome this opportunity for a debate on the Scotch whisky industry. The hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) has paid tribute to the industry as well as challenged it, and I wholeheartedly endorse what he has said. The Government fully recognise the importance of this industry as an important source of employment&#x2014;some 16,500 jobs, many of them in disadvantaged areas&#x2014;and as one of the United Kingdom's top five net export earners, the value of exports last year having topped the &#x00A3;1 billion mark. At home, the industry is very important, making a similar level of contribution to the revenue. There can, therefore, be no question but that the Government fully recognise the important role of this industry in the country's economy.<br/>
I recognise, however, that the hon. Member, in seeking this debate, is concerned at current trends in the industry and especially the effect of several recent major bids. As the House well understands, responsibility for monopolies and mergers policy does not rest with my Department. The Ministry, however, has responsibilities for the Scotch whisky industry and that is why I am pleased to reply to this short debate. As regards competition policy, as my right hon. Friend the then Secretary of State for Trade and Industry made clear in a statement in this House on 5 July 1984, references to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission would be made primarily on competition grounds. "Primarily" does not of course exclude other considerations. For example, the major consideration behind the recent decision to refer the bid for Allied-Lyons plc by Elders IXL Ltd., was the method of financing, which was thought to raise issues deserving of further consideration. On the other hand, the decision not to refer the Guinness bid for Bell's and Argyll's bid for Distillers was guided primarily by considerations of competition.<br/>
I know that there has been comment on these decisions. Reference decisions, whichever way they go, often arouse controversy. I do not want to stray too far into the responsibilities of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, but I should point out that there were significant differences between the financing of the Elders and the Argyll bids which led my right hon. friend to his different decisions on the need for a reference.


The hon. Member has also raised the question of a possible referral of the recent Guinness bid for Distillers. This decision of course rests with my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. He will take that decision on the basis of advice submitted by the Director General of Fair Trading. It would not be appropriate for me to anticipate that decision or to comment on the matter at this stage.</p>

As the hon. Member for Gordon will be aware, my hon. and learned Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State with responsibility for corporate and consumer affairs, the hon. Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard), has announced that a review of the Government's competition policy will begin this year. The precise scope of the review has not yet been finalised but will be announced in due course. In the meantime I am sure that the interesting points made in this debate by the hon. Member will be considered in the review.<br/>
The hon. Member has mentioned several problems which are worrying the industry. As he is aware, the distilling sector working group of the National Economic and Development Office, which includes representatives of the industry, Government and the trade unions, has carried out a wideranging review which was published as recently as October 1984. This followed an earlier review in 1978. Matters have been examined carefully in a short time. The report identified all the major issues of current concern to the industry, several of which the hon. Member has mentioned, and made recommendations for action by Government and the industry during the next five years. We are still very much involved in implementing these recommendations and, of course, we are ready to play our part with the industry in tackling any new issues that may arise.<br/>
The possibility of the Government restricting bulk exports, particularly of malt whisky, has been suggested because of the benefits that would bring to the UK in employment and in other respects. I should point out that this issue was examined in the 1978 report, which concluded that the industry was insufficiently united voluntarily to regulate its bulk exports, while Government were restrained from such action by their international commitments under the GATT and by Community obligations. The 1984 study reached similar conclusions. Nonetheless, its analysis suggests that such exports have tended to stabilise around the 1978 levels, and figures just released in respect of last year's exports show a substantial fall in this trade. I am sure that that will reassure the hon. Member.<br/>
As for the abolition of stock relief in the 1984 corporation tax changes, the Government are well aware that because of its large stocks of maturing whisky, the Scotch whisky industry has been particularly affected by these measures, although in the longer term, as

corporation tax rate falls, the industry should pay slightly less tax even without stock relief than it did before the 1984 changes.<br/>
In his decisions on taxation at the last Budget, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer recognised the difficulties faced by the industry. I cannot of course anticipate the decisions that he will take in this year's Budget, but I am aware that the Scotch Whisky Association has made detailed representations.<br/>
The Government are working closely with the industry in several areas in which there is agreement that progress can be made. For example, the Government are currently considering proposals for whisky definitions to be prescribed in new regulations under the Food Act 1984. Any proposals will be subject to the usual consultation with all the interests concerned. We are also giving strong support to Community proposals laying down clear definitions of the spirit drinks most commonly traded within the Community. The industry is keen for the enactment of measures which should help the competitive position of Scotch whisky in export markets. We shall aim to press ahead with these proposals during our Presidency of the Community in the second half of this year.<br/>
We maintain regular and close contacts with the industry on the trade barriers it faces throughout the world and we pay special consideration to its efforts in the far east. The Government also have the interests of the industry very much in mind in their approach to the EC Commission's proposals on the harmonisation of the structure of duties on alcoholic drinks. Our joint aim is to help establish fairer terms of competition for the industry throughout the Community.<br/>
I know that the Scotch whisky industry has been through a difficult period during the past six years. World recession, coupled with changes in drinking fashions, has contributed to a drop in sales in many key markets. I would not, however, like to conclude on such a pessimistic note, which would not, I think, reflect current attitudes in the industry. In the past year or so, the industry has made substantial efforts to bring maturing stocks more into line with sales expectations. There is also some evidence now that the decline in world sales may be taking a turn for the better. In the domestic market, there was a 6 per cent. rise in consumption in the first nine months of 1985 as compared with the same period in 1984, with considerably greater growth in the as yet small malt whisky market. These are encouraging indications which we hope foreshadow a sustained improvement in the industry's performance to the benefit of the whole economy.</p>

<p>Will my hon. Friend bring home to my right hon. Friend the Chancellor the strength of feeling in the debate and the number of hon. Members who attended it? We want a revitalised Scotch whisky industry. The only way in which there can be a dramatic improvement in the near future is through budgetary measures. I hope that my hon. Friend will bring that point home to my right hon. Friend the Chancellor.</p>
