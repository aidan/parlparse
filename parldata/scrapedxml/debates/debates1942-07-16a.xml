<p>asked the Minister of Labour whether he is aware of the satisfaction given by the organisation of enjoyment for the people brought about by the circular issued by his Ministry; is it intended to make this a permanent feature; will he consider later the experience gained in order to increase and improve the facilities; why no action was taken in the large industrial area of Sal-ford; and will he give the industrial areas where no action was taken in the OFFICIAL REPORT?</p>

<p>The reports I have so far received indicate that the "Holidays-at-Home" schemes organised by local authorities have been most successful, and I should like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation of these local efforts. Whether they will be a permanent feature of our social organisation is not a matter which I can forecast but steps are being taken to keep a careful record of this year's experience as a guide for the future. As regards Salford, I understand that the annual holiday was commonly taken at Whitsun, and that it was not possible to organise holiday activities locally so early in the year. I regret the information asked for at the end of the Question is not available.</p>

<p>asked the Minister of Labour the outcome of previous independent investigations into the desirability of establishing trade boards in the catering industry?</p>
</speech>

<p>The only inquiry into the question of establishing trade boards in the catering trades was made in 1930, when the late Sir Arthur Colefax was appointed as Commissioner to hold a public inquiry with regard to proposals for applying the Trade Boards Acts to the catering trade. His report was concerned mainly with legal aspects of the proposals and did not deal with the desirability of establishing trade boards, as he took the view that this was a matter solely for the Minister of Labour. He expressed the conclusion, however, that subject to certain views which he expressed as a matter of law with regard to the form of the special order that would be necessary, the objections to the establishment of a trade board which were relied upon

at the inquiry did not provide any sufficient reason why the Trade Boards Acts should not be applied to the industry if the Minister considered that course to be expedient.</p>

<p>In the case of items in respect of which an import licence was required before 1st July for imports from the United Kingdom, any licences already granted will remain valid. In the case of items in respect of which an import assistance recommendation has been issued by the Government of India, an import licence will be granted as a matter of course on application by the importer in India. It is, therefore, safe for such items, to be shipped from this country in anticipation of the issue of the licence. In other cases exporters are advised to delay shipment until they have ascertained that an import licence has been granted in India. The Government of India are advising importers in India to take the initiative in applying for licences in respect of outstanding orders and informing suppliers here promptly when these have been obtained.</p>

sidered pending the report of that Committee, which is expected to be received in the next few months. I would remind my hon.

<p>While I am glad to pay tribute to the services which are being rendered to the Allied cause by the French and Danish communities, I regret that I should not feel justified in extending automatically by general order to the nationals of States which are not at war with the Axis powers the privileges recently granted to nationals of Allied States. I have, however, considered whether any steps can be taken to meet the special case of the French and Danish civilian and unofficial communities, and I have decided to give to individual French and Danish nationals, who satisfy me that they are trustworthy and loyal supporters of the Allied cause, exemptions of a general character from the restrictions upon the movements of aliens. Individual French and Danish nationals who desire to obtain general exemption from these restrictions should communicate with the police of the district in which they reside.</p>

<p>The alien to whom I assume that my hon. Friend refers was brought back from Canada for consideration of the question of his eligibility for release. The fact that he has been offered employment is not in itself sufficient reason for authorising the release of a man who does not fall within any of the categories of civilian internees eligible for release from internment, as laid down in the White Paper (Cmd. 6233) of October, 1940, which still remains the basis of the Government's policy. The position of this particular case was explained to my hon. Friend by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in a letter of 24th June, and I am still awaiting the replies to the inquiries which had then already been initiated.

<p>I will do all I can, but I cannot accept the view that there was delay in the Home Office. Inquiries had to be made by the Ministry of Labour, and I do not think there was any undue delay there, because the alien arrived back on 12th May but unfortunately did not register with the Ministry of Labour, and, indeed, it was left to the Home Office to approach the Ministry of Labour on his behalf.</p>

<p>Persons detained in prison under Regulation 18B who are guilty of breaches of discipline are liable to punishment as provided by the Prison Rules and may be reported and dealt with as circumstances require in the same way as prisoners. As such persons are detained for custodial purposes, and not by way of punishment, they are allowed certain privileges which are not accorded to ordinary prisoners: and this difference in methods of treatment is liable to cause difficulties to the prison staffs&#x2014;to whose good work in overcoming these difficulties a tribute of appreciation is due. Most of the persons detained under Regulation 18B have been sent to the Isle of Man. There are, however, a few persons who for various reasons, including the temporary accommodation of persons coming from Isle of Man to attend before the Advisory Committee, are detained in prison. I recognise that there would be advantages from the administrative point of view if all such persons could be accommodated elsewhere than in prison, but I regret that for the present at any rate the difficulties of providing and staffing separate establishments with suitable accommodation are such that this course is impracticable.</p>

<p>The House will recall that on 17th June I undertook on behalf of the Government, but without anticipating or duplicating the work of Sir William Beveridge in framing any long-term scheme, to carry out an immediate examination into the present position of old age pensioners and widows so far as it is now accentuated by war-time conditions. That inquiry has been duly made and the Government have reached the conclusion that the present position can be met by an increase in the scale rates governing supplementary pensions, by improvements in winter allowances and by steps to make good any lack of clothing, bedding and other household necessaries from which supplementary pensioners may be suffering in view of the increase which has taken place in the cost of such articles.<br/>
The Assistance Board are submitting draft Regulations increasing the scale rates for supplementary pensions, and these draft Regulations, when made by the Ministers concerned, will be laid before Parliament as soon as possible with a view to their approval by affirmative Resolution. The increases in the scale rates proposed will be 2s. 6d. for each person of 16 and upwards whose needs are taken into account, and 1s. for each child under that age. Thus, the increase in the case of a married couple without dependants will be 5s. Similar Regulations will also be submitted with reference to unemployment assistance. Arrangements can be made to bring these increases into effect within three weeks of the date on which the Regulations receive the approval of Parliament.<br/>
Winter allowances are given to meet the excess of winter over summer consumption of fuel and light. The amounts normally given have hitherto been 1s. 6d. for a person living alone, and 2s. for a man and wife, and the period for which they have been given has been from the beginning of November until the end of March. The Government are informed that the Assistance Board had already reached the conclusion that the normal amount of the allowance should be increased to 2s. 6d., whether for a person living alone or for a man and wife, and that they now propose to extend the period of the allowance until the end of April.<br/>
The action which the Assistance Board are taking with regard to clothing, bedding and other household supplies was described in the reply given by my right hon. Friend the Minister of Health to my hon. Friend the Member for Abertillery (Mr. Daggar) on 2nd July. Grants will be made in cash, except in the case of blankets, for which special arrangements are necessary owing to difficulties of supply. The total cost to the Exchequer of all these measures will be some &#x00A3;10,750,000 per annum, in addition to the cost of the special grants which may be anything up to &#x00A3;1,000,000 in the present year.</p>

My Noble Friend is looking to this Committee for the general supervision and inspiration of Colonial research, and not for detailed work.

<p>I would like to make this clear; it is an important matter. The proper way of carrying out research is not to set up rival organisations to existing bodies, but rather to organise the placing of research in the proper quarters where it can be carried on. That is the function of this Committee, to organise and manage the carrying-on of research by other agencies.</p>

<p>It would not be for me to object as to what questions are raised by hon. Members, and I imagine that any question that arose on the Home Office Vote would be in Order.

<p>As it is the practice on these occasions for one main subject to be got out of the way before another main subject is started, would the Lord Privy Seal therefore be prepared to consider representations, through the courtesy of Mr. Speaker or the Chairman of Ways and Means, to have this done in that way?</p>

<p>That is the usual practice, but, of course, if the House feels that there is something else that urgently needs discussing, no doubt arrangements can be made. It certainly is the hope of the Government that the main part of the

<p>I wish to put a stronger point than that. It is not for the Government to decide whether they will have Supply Days or not?

<p>Perhaps I may now proceed to answer the other question which was put to me by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Wakefield (Mr. Greenwood). On 9th July, I made a short statement to the House giving reasons why the Debate on shipping should be held in secret, and not in public, and I can certainly add nothing to those reasons in public. The right hon. Gentleman asked me whether a statement would be made in the course of the Secret Session on why the decision of the Government in this matter had, apparently, undergone a change. I explained this matter on 9th July as will be seen from column 953 of the OFFICIAL REPORT of that date, and I do not think it necessary to repeat that explanation. If the House so desires, it will be possible to have a statement in Secret Session amplifying the reasons why the Government consider it necessary to hold the shipping Debate in Secret Session, but no such amplification could be made in public.</p>

<p>I am obliged to my hon. Friend for reminding me of that. So long a period has elapsed since the right hon. Gentleman's original Question was put to me that I forgot to answer the third part of it. That matter has now been considered, and it is felt that to secure the agreement of the whole House upon any

long form of summary, which would be the only alternative to asking Mr. Speaker himself to draft whatever form of summary he thought right, would be so difficult that it would be impracticable to do it in the course of the Debate to-day, and that therefore it is better to maintain the practice that has been followed during the course of the present war with regard to Secret Sessions.</p>

<p>There is plainly a misapprehension. Is this not an illustration of the danger into which the House falls if it abrogates its essential character as the focus and centre of public opinion? Of course, the Government have secret information about shipping as upon other subjects, but this House is, in its essential character, the focus of public opinion. If there are doubts and apprehensions, this is the place where they should be expressed. If it is desired to evoke from the nation a particular concentrated effort, in view of the gravity of a particular situation, this is the place in which the matter can be discussed in order that the public opinion may be created. Now, it is plain from what has transpired and from your intervention, Mr. Speaker, that this Secret Session has been asked for upon a misunderstanding. [HON MEMBERS: "It was not asked for."] It has been asked for by the Government on a misunderstanding. We have recently had cases in which Members have been charged with breach of Privilege because of the very misunderstanding to which my right hon. Friend has referred. We would all be in a very difficult situation subsequently if we did convey an impression to our constituencies. Would the Government then consent to have a Debate on shipping upon the known facts and tendencies as they have been discussed freely both in America and this country?</p>

<p>No, Sir. The Government are not prepared to reconsider this


question. As I have said before, they have considered it very carefully. There are many matters which can be discussed in public, and there are other matters which cannot, and this is one of those things which cannot. The Government do not consider it proper that in the House of Commons speeches should be made from one side alone in public and that there should not be a Government reply. They do not think it proper that people without responsibility for the situation can make suggestions and give currency to rumours which cannot be denied by the Government by giving facts which cannot be disclosed, and although I entirely agree with the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Devonport (Mr. Hore-Belisha) that the House of Commons is the proper place for the expression of public opinion&#x2014;a sounding board for the nation&#x2014;it is also, in time of war, the proper place to discuss serious problems which cannot be communicated to the whole of the nation but which can safely be communicated to Members of the House of Commons. In the course of this discussion the Government may get valuable advice and assistance from Members of the House of Commons. The Government on this occasion are anxious to avail themselves of the opportunity of having a discussion with Members of Parliament which cannot arise if the Session is held in public</p>

<p>I do not quite follow what the Lord Privy Seal means. He said originally that Members could give an impression as to the seriousness or otherwise of the situation. Surely it is open to Government spokesmen to do exactly the same. If responsibility is subsequently to rest upon Members, it is a responsibility that can be assumed by the Government.</p>

<p>Is it not desirable that the House should know what the Government have to say in this matter in Secret Session before making up its mind? If we find that the reasons given to the House are inadequate, we can then press that the matter should be discussed in public.

<p>In view of the fact that on the occasion of a previous Secret Session many of us felt that what the Government disclosed to us was not valid for a Secret Session&#x2014;I am not opposing the decision to have a Secret Session if the Government desire it&#x2014;I want to ask the Lord Privy Seal whether he intends to disclose to us facts that cannot be disclosed to the world outside?</p>

<p>Since the Lord Privy Seal cannot accede to the wishes of the House that a report&#x2014;[HON.

<p>Is the Lord Privy Seal aware that our main difficulty arises not out of a desire to resist the Government's demand for a Secret Session? If the Government ask for a Secret Session on such an important matter as this, the House is bound to give it to them, but our difficulty is this, that the Government do not seem to have applied themselves to the seriousness of the problem of how we or they will communicate to the nation as a whole our sense of the gravity of the situation and how the nation can cooperate in dealing with it. We are not in a position to tell the nation what our advice is about this matter, because they will never hear it.</p>

<p>On a point of Order. I want to ask you, Mr. Speaker, in view of the many confusing statements made by those who are at the moment composing the Government, whether, if I hear the Government's statement and I am deeply impressed with the seriousness of the situation, the urgent need for economy and the absolute maximum effort, I am entitled to go among shop stewards and workers and impress them with the terrible seriousness of the situation and the need for economy and maximum effort, without giving any facts?</p>

<p>Before we go any further I should like to say what is my view with regard to the statement which the Leader of the House has made about Members being allowed to give a general impression to their constituents, of what took place in Secret Session. The House will remember what was known as "The Observer" case. When that case went to the Committee of Privileges that Committee used in their Report the word "impression"

and said that a Member need not say exactly what took place in Secret Session but even that an impression must not be given of what took place in Secret Session. It was very largely on that finding that I gave my Ruling in the case of the hon. Member for Shettleston (Mr. McGovern), who had not used the actual words which were used in a Secret Session but gave his impression. It was on that Ruling that I came to the conclusion that a <i>prima facie</i> case had been made out with regard to the hon. Member for Shettleston, so I think it would be wrong to give the impression to the House that Members are at liberty to give an impression of what took place in a Secret Session.</p>

<p>May I put it to you, Mr. Speaker, that the essential difference is this, that if an hon. Member states in words that there has been a Secret Session, and then proceeds to give his impression &#x2014;&#x2014;[<i>Interruption</i>.] May I put my point, as I happened to be Chairman of the Committee of Privileges on that matter? I think the line which the Committee of Privileges took was that whereas the proceedings in Secret Session may impress Members and to that extent may be reflected in their speeches, their impression must not be directly connected in a speech or statement with a Secret Session. I think that is the point.</p>

<p>On a point of Order. May I make this point clear, as I was a member of the Committee of Privileges? A serious constitutional point has arisen. I was a most enthusiastic supporter of my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister as Chairman of the Committee of Privileges on that matter, but I venture to say that my right hon. Friend has given a wholly wrong impression of the Committee of Privileges. Certainly, he is not entitled to speak on their behalf without consultation.</p>
