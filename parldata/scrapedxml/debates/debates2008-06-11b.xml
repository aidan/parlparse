	<p pid="b.289.7/1">International agreement was reached on the urgent need for co-ordinated action to combat the impact of high food prices on the world's poor: in the short term, to address immediate food security needs and in the longer-term, to increase agricultural productivity in developing countries, including through agricultural research, improved policies, a rapid and successful conclusion to the Doha trade round and reduced use of restrictive measures that increase price volatility.</p>

	<p pid="b.289.9/1">My hon. Friend is correct in recognising that the challenge of replicating the agrarian revolution witnessed in India two or three decades ago will be made significantly harder in Africa by the changes in climate that are anticipated. That is why, as a Department, we are taking forward work, not least on building capacity within African countries. We are committing &pound;100 million to adaptation research over the coming five years, including &pound;25 million already under way to support innovation and climate change adaptation in Africa.</p>

	<p pid="b.290.0/1">Will the Secretary of State acknowledge that at present many small farmers in poor countries have difficulty purchasing even seed and fertiliser to ensure that they have a harvest? What can the Department for International Development do to ensure that they have the means and confidence to do that, and possibly some kind of insurance scheme to protect them against the possible collapse of prices at a later date that could force them into starvation?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2008-06-11b.290.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2008" speakername="Douglas Alexander" colnum="290"  time="11:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080611/debtext/80611-0001.htm#08061189000919">
	<p pid="b.290.1/1">The right hon. Gentleman is of course right in recognising that input costs&mdash;principally as a consequence of rising energy prices and the consequential effects on fertiliser prices&mdash;are having an impact on the current planting season in Africa. That is why we continue to work closely, not simply with the World Food Programme on emergency food supplies, but with the World Bank, which is establishing a trust fund, and other international agencies to ensure that supplies are provided during the narrow window available for the next growing season. When in Rome, I took the opportunity to make clear our commitment to social protection and cash transfer schemes, which can make a difference in ensuring that smallholders are able to sustain their livelihoods even in these challenging times.</p>

	<p pid="b.290.3/1">I can give my right hon. Friend the assurance he seeks. As a matter of urgency, I discussed the emerging problems in Ethiopia with Josette Sheeran, the director of the World Food Programme. As a Department, we have already committed &pound;5 million to the first flash appeal for Ethiopia by the World Food Programme. In addition, we anticipate that the Government of Ethiopia will issue a further appeal this week and we shall be providing up to &pound;10 million in response to that appeal when we receive it.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2008-06-11b.290.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1540" speakername="Gary Streeter" colnum="290"  time="11:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080611/debtext/80611-0001.htm#08061189000922">
	<p pid="b.290.4/1">I warmly welcome the recent summit in Rome and the fact that extra money was pledged to help with food security in countries that need it most&mdash;not least the extra &pound;590 million from the United Kingdom that the right hon. Gentleman was able to pledge, which is most welcome. Can he tell us how he will make sure that the money gets through to farmers and food producers in time for the planting season and that it will not be siphoned off by Governments, as we well know can occur?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2008-06-11b.290.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2008" speakername="Douglas Alexander" colnum="290"  time="11:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080611/debtext/80611-0001.htm#08061189000923">
	<p pid="b.290.5/1">A significant portion of the money that was announced is going into agricultural research. I arrived in Rome with a clear sense that we face three fundamental challenges&mdash;short, medium and long term. The short-term challenge is to make sure that we get immediate humanitarian relief to the up to 850 million people around the world who are vulnerable to hunger as a consequence of rising food prices. That is why we are working both with the World Bank and, in particular, to support the World Food Programme initiatives. Secondly, in the medium term, we need a successful conclusion to the Doha development round and we continue to champion that cause in international venues. Thirdly, we need a significant uplift in agricultural productivity, principally in sub-Saharan Africa, which is why we, as a Department, have committed up to &pound;400 million to agricultural research over the coming years.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2008-06-11b.291.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1705" speakername="Tony Lloyd" colnum="291"  time="11:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080611/debtext/80611-0001.htm#08061189000924">
	<p pid="b.291.0/1">Does my right hon. Friend accept that market mechanisms will fail farmers in Africa and other parts of the world? Although it is right and proper that we pursue the Doha round and advances in agricultural technology, there should nevertheless be recognition of the need for proper protection for smaller and more marginal farmers if we are to guarantee local food security in marginal parts of the world.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2008-06-11b.291.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2008" speakername="Douglas Alexander" colnum="291"  time="11:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080611/debtext/80611-0001.htm#08061189000925">
	<p pid="b.291.1/1">Of course we want protection and adequate supplies to be provided to those in need of either food or finance for subsistence, but three factors accounted for India's success in its agrarian revolution, to draw once again on that example. The first factor was improved infrastructure, the second was improved irrigation and the third was improved seed technology. That seems to hold powerful lessons for Africa, where there has been a decline rather than a rise in the rate of agricultural productivity in recent years. That is why we have placed such an emphasis on agricultural research for the years ahead.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2008-06-11b.291.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1862" speakername="Andrew Mitchell" colnum="291"  time="11:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080611/debtext/80611-0001.htm#08061189000926">
	<p pid="b.291.2/1">As the Chairman of the International Development Committee made clear, shipping food to stress areas can often distort markets and undermine local production. Should not the key lesson for us from the Rome conference be that cash transfers and prioritising local, or at least regional, food purchases help to protect the most vulnerable from the dramatic price hikes taking place around the world?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2008-06-11b.291.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2008" speakername="Douglas Alexander" colnum="291"  time="11:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080611/debtext/80611-0001.htm#08061189000927">
	<p pid="b.291.3/1">We often talk about consensus across the House on development issues; this would seem to be an example of an issue on which there is such consensus. We have been strongly encouraging the World Food Programme, in particular, to move towards local sourcing of food supplies instead of using its more traditional mechanism, which is to bring in wheat, often from America, or other supplies from around the globe. I do not think that the choice is between seeing an improvement in the functioning of the international agriculture market&mdash;that is why we want progress on the Doha round&mdash;and making sure that immediate emergency assistance is provided in the way that most supports the development of the local economies where food aid is provided.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2008-06-11b.291.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1446" speakername="Barry Gardiner" colnum="291"  time="11:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080611/debtext/80611-0001.htm#08061189000928">
	<p pid="b.291.4/1">The Secretary of State is aware that for every 1 per cent. rise in food prices, an extra 16 million people go to bed hungry each night. Is he aware of the World Bank's latest research, which shows the link between biofuels and the land-use change that is causing the rise in food prices? What discussions has he had with his colleagues in the Department for Transport about the renewables obligation in that respect?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2008-06-11b.291.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2008" speakername="Douglas Alexander" colnum="291"  time="11:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080611/debtext/80611-0001.htm#08061189000929">
	<p pid="b.291.5/1">The role of biofuels was of course an issue of some dispute at the Rome summit. A speech was made by President Lula, for example, who offered a strong defence of what he called the right type of biofuels. Much of the debate about biofuels, which needs to be better understood, is long on anecdote and short on fact. That is why the British Government have initiated the Gallagher review and I assure my hon. Friend that we are in discussions with the Department for Transport on that review. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has urged the World Bank to take forward work on understanding the impact of biofuels on land use and, more widely, on social sustainability. We are also in dialogue with the European Commission to see whether we can establish a European position on the issue.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2008-06-11b.292.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1965" speakername="Michael Moore" colnum="292"  time="11:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080611/debtext/80611-0001.htm#08061189000930">
	<p pid="b.292.0/1">On that latter point, I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will ensure that the subject is discussed with President Bush when he visits this weekend. The right hon. Gentleman will be aware that the World Food Programme produced a report this week that highlights the fact that in recent years, as prices for commodities have soared, the volume of aid provided has declined steeply. On food aid, will he give a commitment that his Department's purchasing power will be maintained, so that we can ensure that as prices continue to soar, the volume of British aid will not decline?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2008-06-11b.292.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2008" speakername="Douglas Alexander" colnum="292"  time="11:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080611/debtext/80611-0001.htm#08061189000931">
	<p pid="b.292.1/1">In terms of the volume of British aid, the budget for the Department for International Development was set in the comprehensive spending review last July, and it remains the same. However, the hon. Gentleman is right to recognise that, in light of rising food prices, we need to consider where we need to do more in individual countries. That is why we have already supplemented the long-term support that we are offering to the people of Ethiopia with &pound;5 million for humanitarian supplies that are partly in recognition of the significant rise in food prices that has taken place.</p>
	<p pid="b.292.1/2">The hon. Gentleman is also right to recognise that there appears to be a clear correlation between rising input costs, principally those for oil, and the level of hunger being witnessed; that point was made to me by Josette Sheeran when I met her in Rome. She said, &quot;If I look at the oil price, I can immediately tell how many more poor people we will be dealing with through the World Food Programme.&quot; That is why I welcome the latest commitment that Gulf states have given to support the flash appeal from the United Nations World Food Programme. I hope that that pattern will be continued in the years ahead.</p>

	<p pid="b.293.1/1">Trade unions are a vital part of any democracy. That is why my hon. Friend is right to say that, between 2004 and 2007, DFID provided through Unison training for trade union leaders and helped to establish a trade union resource centre in Iraq. This programme came to a natural end in 2007, which coincided with a spike in violence preventing us from renewing the programme. Since then we have successfully focused on supporting the Iraqi Government to provide essential services to their own people and stimulating private sector investment. In April, I met Governor al-Waili, the governor of Basra, who expressed his optimism about the future of Iraq. I assure my hon.

	<p pid="b.297.6/1">Mugabe's attendance was not only inappropriate but, in light of his subsequent actions, morally repugnant. The fact is that somebody who is willing to use the threat of starvation has little credibility or authority to lecture anybody on food prices or production. There is little comfort regarding the current situation in Zimbabwe, but my comfort is that a matter of weeks after the first election, even Robert Mugabe and his closest associates have been unable to claim that they were chosen by the people of Zimbabwe in that last election. We continue to be committed to ensuring that the people of Zimbabwe are able to have their democratic will expressed in their choice of Government.</p>

I would be failing in my duty if I did not report to the House the advice of the police and security services, but I was about to go on to say that I do not rely on that entirely. We have seen in the recent cases that have come before us the amount, sophistication and complexity of evidence that has to be assessed. I refer the House to the airport case in 2006, in which there were 400 computers, 8,000 CDs and 25,000 exhibits. That is why some of the people who were detained were detained for 27 days. I have no doubt that the sophistication and complexity of these cases will require us to do more in future years.

Every week, quite rightly, we stand here and read out the names of those who have fallen, and we must remember every week that behind every name are family and friends who are suffering from the loss of a loved one. The Prime Minister and I have both visited Afghanistan. We know that our soldiers are doing incredible work in difficult conditions on our behalf, and, quite simply, they are the best of British.</p>
	<p pid="b.299.6/2">I am sure that the Prime Minister will agree with me that it is clear why we are there. If we go, the Taliban come back, the training camps come back and there will be more terrorists on British streets. But after seven years of work in Afghanistan, can the Prime Minister give us a frank and candid assessment today, not just of where we are doing well, but where much more work needs to be done?</p>

	<p pid="b.300.0/1">I agree with what the right hon. Gentleman says about the contribution of our troops and the bravery of all our servicemen and women who serve in Afghanistan and every theatre of the world. In Afghanistan, we are making progress in training the Afghan army and police, and in building economic and social development, which means that people in Afghanistan have a stake in the future. In the Afghan elections, 70 per cent. of registered voters voted, so Afghanistan became a democracy, and it was shown to be so by the elections. When the Taliban were in power, there were only 2 million children in education&mdash;none of them girls. Today, there are 6 million children in education and 2 million of them are girls, which is a result of the changes that we are making.</p>
	<p pid="b.300.0/2">I agree with the right hon. Gentleman that this is a long haul, but our duty is to stop the Taliban ever gaining power again and to stop al-Qaeda making inroads into Afghanistan. That is why 43 countries are part of the coalition in Afghanistan.</p>

	<p pid="b.300.1/1">I thank the Prime Minister for that answer. I have seen the work of training the Afghan army, which is fantastic, and I have seen some of the schools that have been built, but is there not a risk that while we are winning militarily in Afghanistan, we are losing at least parts of the country? Has he heard the reports that the security situation around Kabul is deteriorating, and that corruption is paralysing the work of the Afghan Government? I am even told that some of the roads that we have built are being used by the Taliban and other bandits to extort money from ordinary Afghans, who are too terrified to use them. It is now six months since the Prime Minister made a full statement in the House about Afghanistan. Does he not agree with me that one of the lessons from Iraq is that it is only by being candid and frank, and by giving regular updates, that we can take the British people with us in this vital task?</p>

	<p pid="b.300.2/1">I am very happy to give the right hon. Gentleman regular updates of what is happening in Afghanistan, and the Secretary of State for Defence has just returned from Afghanistan where he was looking at the situation on the ground. Nobody is saying that the position in Afghanistan is easy, and everybody knows that in the spring attacks by the Taliban start again, but last year, because of the action against drugs and heroin, the number of poppy-free provinces doubled to 13. We hope this year to see more progress. It is not a case of things going backward; it is a case of us seeing progress. Our strategy, set out in December, which was the &quot;Afghanisation&quot; of the army and the police force, with people being trained by British forces and other troops, and with the police being trained through an operation led by the German police, is gaining ground. Our aim is that Afghans take more and more responsibility for their own affairs. We are able to tackle corruption by opening up local as well as national Government, and we invest, as we have in the dam project, in the economic and social development of Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="b.300.2/2">I have to say to the right hon. Gentleman that if he is doubting the reason for being there&mdash;[Hon.

	<p pid="b.301.0/2">I turn to the issue of the Government's proposal to ask MPs to vote tonight on holding people for six weeks before they are charged. This is an enormous step to take, and we need the strongest possible evidence before the Government can take it. How can the Prime Minister think that the case has really been made, when his own Director of Public Prosecutions&mdash;the very man responsible for prosecuting terrorists and the man who carries the can if it does not happen&mdash;does not support the measure?</p>

	<p pid="b.301.1/1">We have made a judgment, after looking at all the evidence, including the evidence from the police and security services, that this is the right thing to do. I would not want to have to come to the House in a moment of emergency and ask for extraordinary powers, when we could, in a period of calmness, build in a process that will not give the oxygen of publicity to terrorists when we have to take action. The right hon. Gentleman said:</p>
	<p pid="b.301.1/2" class="indent">&quot;When it comes to our national security, I will always listen to the police and security services, and take their advice with the utmost seriousness.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.301.1/3">Ken Jones, the head of ACPO, has made it clear what the police think about the proposal. Hugh Orde, the Chief Constable of Northern Ireland, has made his position clear. Lord Stevens, the man the right hon. Gentleman says he listens to on police matters, says in <i> The Times </i>today that</p>
	<p pid="b.301.1/4" class="indent">&quot;there will be really exceptional cases where the Police Service will need to go beyond 28 days.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.301.1/5">Taking into account the advice of the police and security services, but also looking at the weight, complexity and sophistication of the evidence that must be examined, it seems to me that we should put in place the legislation in a moment of calm. I do not want, in a moment of panic, for people to have to come to the House to bring in emergency legislation.</p>

	<p pid="b.301.2/1">The Prime Minister says that he does not want to come to the House in a moment of difficulty, but under the concession that he is making that is exactly what he is going to have to do. He would have a stronger argument if he had genuinely lined up, if you like, a phalanx of the police, the prosecutors and the security services in favour of his case, but he has not. Yes, there are a lot of police who support it, but there are a lot who do not. When it comes to the prosecuting authorities, they do not support his case, and when it comes to the Security Service, it has not said that it has asked for this step. The Prime Minister has not made the case that the proposal is necessary. Is there not a danger that as well as being unnecessary, it will be counter-productive? When former Attorneys-General and soldiers who served against the IRA in Northern Ireland are all saying that this sort of measure could help the terrorists rather than hurt them, are we not taking a bad step? Is it not clear that the terrorists want to destroy our freedom, and that when we trash our liberties we do their work for them?</p>

In his attempt to save the totem of 42 days, has not the Prime Minister made so many concessions that he has an unworkable piece of legislation? Should not every MP in the House be thinking that this issue is not about the future of the Prime Minister but about our liberties, and should they not vote with their consciences?</p>

The right hon. Gentleman says that it is impossible to be draconian and incompetent at the same time, but is not that exactly what the Prime Minister has achieved? We have a symbolic assault on our liberty that is unnecessary; we have a change in the law that many people, including the former chief inspector of constabulary, say is counter-productive; and we have a procedure that is unworkable. Is not the only way to describe what the Prime Minister is doing today as ineffective authoritarianism? When there is no firm evidence in favour of extending detention in a free and democratic country, should not a supposedly progressive Prime Minister come down on the side of liberty?</p>

The right hon. Gentleman knows perfectly well that the civil liberties protections in this legislation are greater than ever before. I do not like opposition for opposition's sake. We should be facing up to an issue of national security. I would like to have achieved a consensus above party politics, but because it has been impossible to do so, the Government must make a judgment. The judgment is not that this is popular, but that it is right and necessary for the security of our country.</p>

The promotion of the donation of blood, bone marrow and organ is a priority for the Department of Health. We are looking at what we can do.

It will then be for the House to vote on the commencement order and agree that an exceptional terrorist incident has occurred. It is not the business of the House to interfere in the individual case, but it should be able to vote simply on whether an exceptional and grave terrorist threat has occurred.

I repeat to the House that the protections for civil liberties that are built into the Bill, which require the Home Secretary to act and not to have arbitrary treatment, are the greatest that we have seen when dealing with terrorist threats.

It requires the Home Secretary to present to the House a statement showing that there is an exceptional and grave terrorist threat and that the need for action is urgent, and she must ask the House to support the action that she has taken. The legislation does not require discussion of the individual detainees; that would be wrong. The purpose of this legislation, like that of the Civil Contingencies Act 2004, is to get the House to agree that these special measures are needed. That is the purpose of the debate, and that is the right way to proceed.</p>

Friend the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families will threaten hundreds of schools with closure, including 27 in Birmingham. Will he confirm that that is certainly not the plan's intention and that, rather, the aim is to work with teachers and parents, most of whom are already making huge efforts to do the right thing by children and raise standards?

Whatever action needs to be taken in terms of replacing head teachers or improving the service is part of the national challenge. I can also tell him that, in this and other areas, more money is being injected into the school system to make that increase in standards possible.

	DNA Database (Removal of Samples)
</minor-heading>

	<p pid="b.309.1/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="b.309.1/2" class="indent" pwmotiontext="yes">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to require the removal from the DNA Database of DNA samples taken from individuals who are not charged or are acquitted; and for connected purposes.</p>
	<p pid="b.309.1/3">Everyone accepts that DNA has been a massive breakthrough in crime detection, helping to solve the crimes of today and also some of the cold cases from 20 to 30 years ago. However, the Government have pursued this breakthrough in a disproportionate way.</p>
	<p pid="b.309.1/4">The UK has by far the largest DNA database in the world, with 4.5 million people registered. Proportionally, five times more people are on our database than is the case with the next closest country. We think of the US as having a punitive criminal justice system, but less than 1 per cent. of its population is on the US database, whereas we have around 6 per cent. Moreover, it has been estimated that under current laws, the database will expand to include one in four of our adult male population.</p>
	<p pid="b.309.1/5">The number of children on the database is particularly worrying. At the moment, it is estimated that it contains entries for more than 700,000 people who were under 18 when they were arrested and their DNA was taken. In case hon. Members think that some of them might have deserved what they got, I should add that there are estimated to be more than 100,000 children under 18 on the database who have never been convicted, cautioned or charged with any offence.</p>
	<p pid="b.309.1/6">I am sure all hon. Members will have seen various crazy cases across the country. There are examples from every constituency. A quick trawl of press clippings threw up the case of three children who were hauled into a police station because they climbed a cherry tree to build a tree house. They were arrested for criminal damage and had their DNA taken, but the case was never taken any further. Another example is the 14-year-old boy who was a victim of mistaken identity when teachers at his school gave police the wrong name after a brawl between pupils.</p>
	<p pid="b.309.1/7">Even after admitting they had arrested the wrong boy, the police refused to remove his DNA. Whereas in the past schoolboy fights, high jinks and lads climbing trees would have resulted in a stern word and them being taken home, children are now getting criminal records and their DNA is being held on the database for ever.</p>
	<p pid="b.309.1/8">We should also be worried about the sheer number of ethnic minorities on the database and the racial imbalance. Almost 40 per cent. of black men have their DNA profile held, compared with 13 per cent. of Asian men and 9 per cent. of white men, despite the fact that there is no evidence that black men disproportionately commit crime. In fact, evidence suggests that white men are more likely to offend than black men. This over-representation of black men creates mistrust and continues to fuel problems that are much larger, such as the disproportionate representation of black men in our criminal justice system. Also, problems of race relations, community cohesion and discrimination, either perceived or real, are made worse. Moreover, the situation is getting worse. At the current rate, more than half of all black men will be on the database within two years.</p>
	<p pid="b.309.1/9">This highlights one of the main objections to holding the DNA of those who are not charged or who are acquitted. One of the fundamental tenets of British justice is &quot;innocent until proven guilty&quot;. Refusing to destroy samples taken from those who are never charged or who are later acquitted completely blurs that principle. The DNA database assumes that people will be guilty of something in the future; that is why the samples are kept. This is very Big Brother; George Orwell must be spinning in his grave.</p>
	<p pid="b.309.1/10">When the national DNA database was created in 1995, only the DNA of convicted offenders could be held, and samples had to be destroyed if the suspect was acquitted or charges were dropped. Because by 2001 the Government were breaking their own law&mdash;presumably as a result of incompetence rather than design&mdash;the law was changed to allow the profiles of those acquitted of certain crimes to be kept. That was expanded even more in 2004, when samples could be taken from anyone arrested for a recordable offence. By the end of 2005, 200,000 samples which would have been destroyed before 2001 had been retained, and that number has since soared. There are now estimated to be more than 1 million people who have not been charged or convicted on the database&mdash;three times the population of a city the size of Cardiff, where I live. Those are 1 million people considered innocent under British law, but considered potentially guilty by the Home Office. By retaining that DNA, the state is saying, &quot;Well, you might not have been convicted, but we think you may commit an offence in future and we want to make sure we can catch you when you do.&quot; That is not acceptable.</p>
	<p pid="b.309.1/11">It is almost impossible, however, for someone to remove their sample from the database. Since the changes in 2004, fewer than 700 people have managed to remove their profiles&mdash;700 out of the 1 million innocent people on the database. The police control which samples are removed. People have to apply to the chief constable of the force that took the sample in the first place, who is hardly an independent arbiter. The Government may be forced to change this shortly, as there is a case before the European Court of Human Rights, brought by two men from Sheffield&mdash;one of whom was under 18 at the time&mdash;who have applied to have their DNA removed on the grounds that they were both cleared and neither has a criminal record. The ECHR is expected to rule this summer, and a finding against the Government could open the floodgates on this issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.309.1/12">Even if some people might not agree with the civil liberties case for removing the DNA of innocent people, there is a very strong practical case. The Government have already said that they believe that the DNA of the majority of the active criminal population is now recorded, so why the mad rush to take samples from so many other people? The DNA database is not without cost. The costs of sampling increasing numbers, maintaining an expanding database and storing millions of samples will continue to grow.</p>
	<p pid="b.309.1/13">However, there is very little evidence that these increasing costs will have much of an impact on crime detection. Despite the massive expansion in the number of individuals on the database, the percentage of recorded crimes solved as a result of a DNA match has remained fairly constant; the figures I have seen show it to be below 0.4 per cent. A bigger difference has been made at the other end of DNA matching: at the crime scene. At present, less than 20 per cent. of crime scenes are forensically examined, and only a small proportion of them yield any biological material that is then tested. Clear-up rates are much higher when DNA is found at a crime scene, so should we not be putting resources into that end of things, rather than into collecting individuals' samples?</p>
	<p pid="b.309.1/14">One argument often used to justify the keeping of DNA is that it will help to solve cold cases, but that is fallacious. When someone is arrested and their DNA is taken, that should be tested against unidentified crime scene DNA, as is done. That will identify whether they have committed any unsolved crimes, and that is fine, but if they have not, holding their DNA after that point is irrelevant. In addition, the massive cost of holding the samples is borne by police forces. I am sure that I am not alone in thinking that the money might be better spent on front-line policing, to ensure that fewer crimes are committed and our communities are kept safe.</p>
	<p pid="b.309.1/15">Following the European case, the Government may have to change their policy anyway, but I would like to propose a solution. Some countries, such as Scotland, France and Canada, have legislated against retaining DNA samples from those who are acquitted. I believe we should follow their lead, and remove innocent people's DNA from the database. Samples and profiles should be destroyed if the individual is not convicted or cautioned, although there should be an exception for those accused of a violent or sexual offence. Their samples should be kept&mdash;not indefinitely, but for a specified time. In addition, all children under 16, unless guilty of a violent or sexual offence, should have their DNA removed from the database. If we treat them like criminals at such an early age, they may well go on to fulfil our expectations.</p>
	<p pid="b.309.1/16">We are talking about a huge number of people&mdash;1 million of them&mdash;whose deeply private information is being held by the Government when they have not been found to have done any wrong. That goes against fundamental British principles, as well as being a massive drain on public resources for little gain, and this Bill would rectify that injustice.</p>

	<p pid="b.317.0/1">New clauses 20 to 22, 24 to 30 and 32, and new schedule 1, introduce amendments to strengthen considerably the safeguards that we want to apply to any future use of the provision in this Bill for a reserve power to extend the period for which terrorist suspects could be held before charge. The Government believe that such a reserve power should be available, for use if necessary, to protect our national security and, most importantly, our people against the threat that we face from terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="b.317.0/2">That threat is real and serious. First, the threat is unprecedented in scale. Some 65 terrorists have been convicted in our courts since the start of 2007, and there are more than 200 groupings and 200 individuals of concern to agencies in the UK today. Secondly, the threat is more ruthless than any we have faced before. It aims for mass casualties, uses suicide methods, and would use dirty bombs given half a chance.</p>

	<p pid="b.317.1/1">Nobody underestimates the threat that we face, but if the Government are so determined to clamp down on the threat from terrorism, why does not the Home Secretary, as a first step, scrap the Human Rights Act 1998, which has done so much to stop undesirable people who may pose a serious threat being kicked out of the country? If she is so serious about this, she should scrap that Act.</p>

	<p pid="b.317.2/2">Thirdly, the threat is more complex and international than ever before. Terrorists living and working in our society have learned how to use technology to cover their tracks. They travel a network, sharing experiences and learning from mistakes. Terrorist plots in this country now almost invariably involve multiple connections to many countries overseas. That alone creates huge technological and logistical challenges for investigators.</p>

	<p pid="b.318.1/1">The important point that Lord Stevens made this morning is the point that I was about to make about the threat. Given the ferocity of what is planned and the use of suicide methods, the police may well need to step in early to prevent a plot from coming to fruition. It is that combination of factors that means that police may need longer to get to the bottom of who and what is involved and then build a case on the basis of evidence that is admissible in court.</p>
	<p pid="b.318.1/2">We have discussed this with the DPP and he has given evidence to the Committee chaired by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1674" name="Keith Vaz">my right hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz)</phrase> and the Public Bill Committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.318.1/3">The nature of the threat and the need to intervene early have meant that the police have had to hold a small number of suspects for the full 28 days since the higher limit was introduced in July 2006. It is this that leads our most senior police officers to say, as Lord Stevens and others have, that they can foresee circumstances when it may be necessary&mdash;in order fully to investigate and charge&mdash;to hold terrorist suspects for more than 28 days.</p>

	<p pid="b.318.2/1">The Home Secretary is aware that the current system for charging places the responsibility for making that decision firmly in the hands of the Crown Prosecution Service. It is on the CPS that the responsibility falls. If the facts given by the Home Secretary mean that police fears are justified, why have the police been unable to persuade the CPS that there is any necessity for the extension?

	<p pid="b.318.7/1">As many people have made clear during the course of the debate, there are fundamentally different systems in different countries with different thresholds for charging. In Spain, 14 people were arrested in January this year. It was only last week that they reached the stage equivalent to our charging, which means that a form of preventive detention was used that lasted 138 days. There are very different systems in different countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.318.7/2">There are those who say that the advice of the police is not enough. I agree. Their voice is important, but it is not the only one. Striking the right balance between civil liberties and the rights of all our citizens to live free from terrorist attack evokes strong views. It is important to us all. That is why it has been important to me to consult closely.</p>

	<p pid="b.319.3/1">I agree with the principle argued by the hon. Gentleman. It is the principle behind habeas corpus, which is that the court must determine whether it has the power to detain a person. That is already enshrined in schedule 8 to the Terrorism Act 2000, which is the basis of our proposals in our provisions. A detainee will need to be brought before the court after 48 hours of detention and then at least every seven days after that. He or she therefore cannot be detained beyond 48 hours other than on the authorisation of a judge. The hon. Gentleman makes an important point about the principle of habeas corpus, which is enshrined in the principles of the proposals that we are putting forward.</p>

He identifies the wholly exceptional nature of holding anybody in detention beyond 28 days and for up to 42 days. I know that he, like others in the community, has expressed concern about those who have subsequently been released without being charged, and because of the representations that he has made, I have asked my officials to develop an ex gratia scheme that, because of the exceptional circumstances, would be available to compensate those who had been detained and then released without charge, or who had faced any other executive action. I hope that that offers my hon.

Anybody who compares our initial proposals from last July with what we are proposing now will see how far we have moved. We are not proposing a permanent, automatic or immediate extension to pre-charge detention beyond 28 days. Instead, the Bill contains a reserve power that could be used only in exceptional circumstances, only with the support of the DPP, only with the backing of Parliament in a vote in both Houses, and only with strong judicial safeguards, and for a temporary period before it automatically lapsed.</p>

	<p pid="b.322.5/1">Speaking as someone who comes from a part of the United Kingdom that has suffered very badly from terrorism over the past 30 years, I think that the members of our party take very seriously any threat to national security, and any actions that may give publicity to terrorists. On the power that the Home Secretary is seeking today, if the matter is to be debated in the House every time there is a severe threat, will it not give terrorists an opportunity to get the oxygen of publicity that she so much wants to deny them?</p>

As I have said on many occasions, I believe that that would be wholly exceptional, but when we need the power, it will be extremely important that it is in place.</p>

	<p pid="b.323.4/1">No. Some have said that we should use the Civil Contingencies Act if we want to detain suspects beyond the current limit. We do not believe that the Civil Contingencies Act, which is designed to deal with events such as floods and pandemics, could legally be used for the purposes of criminal detention, and we certainly need to ask whether the use of that legislation, which would effectively mean the declaration of an emergency, would give a propaganda victory to terrorists; that is <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1374" name="Sammy Wilson">the point that the hon. Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson)</phrase> made. Incidentally, the use of that Act would also mean that people could be held in detention not for up to 42 days, but potentially for up to 58 days. That is the basis of my contention that that would be a more draconian approach to dealing with the challenge than the approach that the Government have taken.</p>

	<p pid="b.323.5/1">I am grateful to the Home Secretary for giving way; she has been very generous. Will she bear in mind the fact that when the Director of Public Prosecutions gave evidence to the Home Affairs Committee he made the point that if someone was held for 24 or 25 days without at least being charged on reasonable suspicion, it would make the prosecution unsuccessful in many instances? Is that not a factor in deciding whether to go beyond the 28 days? I must say that I am by no means persuaded that there is any justification for what is being proposed.</p>

	<p pid="b.323.6/1">Of course, because the prosecutors and the police would have such a significant role in determining whether a further investigation would enable someone to be brought to charge, it is their responsibility to provide the Home Secretary with a report, so that consideration can be given to whether to bring in the order.</p>
	<p pid="b.323.6/2">To return to the Civil Contingencies Act, while we do not think that it is the right vehicle on its own, there are aspects of the approach taken in the Act that we have been able to adapt in the Bill's proposals, such as the need to define the nature of the exceptional circumstances in which the reserve power could be used, and the need to gain parliamentary approval for the use of the powers.</p>

In response to my hon. Friend, first, we are clearer in the Bill about the trigger for any use of the power. The power could be brought into force only where it is needed for investigating serious terrorist offences arising out of a grave and exceptional terrorist threat. People have asked what that means. We know that people have plotted to devastate our transport system, to blow up Bluewater shopping centre and, as I said, to use a dirty bomb. We have also seen plots to ensure multiple atrocities. We have seen plots on an international scale that would have brought death on a considerable scale to British people.</p>

In addition to that, there are other safeguards. Individual detention beyond 28 days would, as under present proposals, be considered by a judge. Any application for an extension beyond 28 days would require the approval of the Director of Public Prosecutions.

	<p pid="b.325.7/3">The independent reviewer will report within six months of the reserve power ceasing to be available. A parliamentary debate will take place on that report, which will cover whether, looking back, individual suspects were held in accordance with requirements governing detention, whether proper procedures were followed for applications for detention beyond 28 days, and whether it was reasonable in all the circumstances for the Home Secretary to make the order.</p>

I am willing to discuss this at further length with my hon. Friend and others, and I have no doubt that it will be scrutinised in detail when the Bill arrives in the House of Lords, but our intention in proposing the definition was precisely to limit the circumstances in which it will be possible to use the power. I hope that my hon. Friend accepts that that was the intention. It was also the reason why, in a spirit of developing consensus, we looked extremely closely at the wording in the Civil Contingencies Act, and built our definition on that. It is stronger than what we originally proposed, and I believe that it will tightly define the circumstances in which the power can be used. Of course that will quite rightly be subject to further scrutiny, not only today but when the Bill reaches the House of Lords.</p>

	<p pid="b.327.2/1">Earlier today the Prime Minister told us that, under the Bill, the Home Secretary would make a statement in the House showing that there was a grave exceptional threat. In fact, the Home Secretary will have to make a statement saying only that there is a grave exceptional threat. Those words are not a requirement for the triggering of the power; they are simply a requirement of parliamentary liturgy that we will have to go through.</p>

	<p pid="b.327.3/1">It is the role of the Home Secretary to make the order, but it is an important parliamentary safeguard that the making of the order has to be approved by Parliament. As I have said previously, Parliament's role in approving the order is not a negligible or an insignificant safeguard. I am constantly surprised at parliamentary colleagues who believe that their role is so insignificant in the thinking of a Home Secretary. Trust me&mdash;Home Secretaries think very carefully about what they have to explain to Parliament and what they need to have approved by Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="b.327.4/1">I want to take the Home Secretary back to the exchange that we had during Home Office questions on Monday, when I challenged her on her admission in her conversation with Andrew Marr during his programme on Sunday that the security services were not pressing for this extension. She said that I was &quot;plain wrong&quot;. I looked at the transcript, and that is exactly what she said. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1524" name="Richard Ottaway">my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South (Richard Ottaway)</phrase> made clear, the director general of the Security Service made it clear that it is neutral on this matter; it is not pressing for it.

	<p pid="b.328.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is just plain wrong again. I have been very clear in my response as to what the director general of the Security Service has said on the record about the scale of the threat that we face. It is the scale of the threat that we face that is at the heart of the proposals that we are bringing forward and the way in which we seek to address them. If the hon. Gentleman wants to make debating points about the scale of the threat, that is up to him, but I believe that this is a serious threat that we need to address.</p>
	<p pid="b.328.0/2">Terrorism is an assault on our civil liberties, on our democracy and on our values. Our response to terrorism must continue to be based on those values and liberties, ardently pursued through our democratic framework, primarily through our criminal justice system. But we cannot allow ourselves to be lulled into a false sense of security that might lead us to put at risk the liberty of all in Britain to live lives free from the threat of terrorist outrage and atrocity. In opposing terrorism, we must not lose sight of our values. For me, getting the balance right between individual freedom and collective security must always be at the heart of what we do. Our response must reinforce our shared values, not weaken them, because it is on those values that our security ultimately depends.</p>
	<p pid="b.328.0/3">We have approached the Bill to build a consensus on how we can protect those values at the same time as protecting our national security. We have talked, we have listened, we have moved. Other than in circumstances involving a grave exceptional threat, the pre-charge detention limit for terrorist suspects will remain exactly as it is now. Indeed, that limit continues to be subject to annual renewal by Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="b.328.0/4">I hope that we never need to extend the period, but the question that hon. Members need to ask themselves is whether they are confident that we will never need 29, 30 or 31 days to bring a terrorist suspect to charge, to put them in front of a court. The proposals that we will vote on today are better, fairer and more proportionate as a result of the process of parliamentary scrutiny and debate that they have undergone, but the time has come for hon. Members to decide. It is the job of Government, police and prosecutors to protect the public from terrorist attack, and thereby to defend everybody's right to life, but today it is the job of Parliament to give them the tools to do that. We need the support of the House for the proposals in the Bill. We need the support of the House to do the right thing for this country's security, and I commend the amendments to the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.328.1/1">&quot;It is the job of Parliament to give them the tools&quot;? It is the job of Parliament to defend the liberties that we have had for centuries.</p>
	<p pid="b.328.1/2">I rise to oppose the Government's new clauses and to support amendments Nos. 4 and 5 to remove 42 days from the Bill. Today, there are essentially two arguments to deal with. The first is: have the Government made their case for 42 days? If not, this change should be rejected out of hand, because in this country we do not give away freedom without good cause. Secondly, if they have made their case, are the powers proportionate and are the checks and balances to prevent improper use of the powers adequate?</p>
	<p pid="b.328.1/3">The issue of how long we incarcerate those on whom we have insufficient evidence to charge with any crime has become one of the defining debates of the last decade in this country. Notably, this week marks the anniversary of the signing of Magna Carta. For almost 800 years, we have built on the right of habeas corpus, founded in that ancient document: the fundamental freedom from arbitrary detention by the state. The liberty of the person is in our blood, part of our history, part of our way of life; Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats, Democratic Unionists&mdash;all parties. Liberty is the common strand that binds us together, and we have shed blood to protect it, both abroad and at home.</p>
	<p pid="b.328.1/4">Today the Government ask us to sacrifice some of that liberty. The Home Secretary offers a Faustian bargain: to trade a fundamental liberty for a little extra security. Yet, as the debate has gone on, the case for 42 days has first crumbled and then collapsed. So, after months of debate, what are the basic facts? The right hon. Lady said in her speech that the Home Secretary properly takes advice from the police but that that is not enough and we need to examine the evidence that they present. I think that that is what she said, so let us do so: let us look at the evidence that was presented by the Home Secretary's own witnesses.</p>
	<p pid="b.328.1/5">Let us start with Sir Ian Blair, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner. In his evidence to Parliament, the commissioner said explicitly:</p>
	<p pid="b.328.1/6" class="indent">&quot;We have never put forward a case that there is evidence of a need for an extension&quot;.<i> &mdash;&mdash;[Official Report, Counter-Terrorism Public Bill Committee, </i><phrase class="date" code="2008-04-22">22 April 2008</phrase>; c. 11, Q3.]</p>
	<p pid="b.328.1/7">He based his support for 42 days on &quot;a pragmatic inference&quot; based on trends in a number of plots and on those plots' complexity. In support of that, he and his counter-terrorism chief initially claimed that 15 terrorist plots had been thwarted since the 7/7 bombings. It was on that basis that he presented his evidence to the Bill Committee. But then it transpired that there had been a mistake. The corrected evidence revealed the true picture, which is that between 2003 and 2005, there were nine plots, three a year, and there have been four since the beginning of 2006, two a year. So, the number of plots, far from increasing, has actually decreased over the past three years. That is a good thing, but it is not an argument for extra powers, and although we should not underestimate the threat, we should not overstate it either.</p>
	<p pid="b.328.1/8">The second witness who the Home Secretary brought before us was Mr. Peter Clarke. He argued exactly what was argued in the debate about 90 days, and he told us how complex and technical anti-terror cases were becoming. His example of a technically challenging case was that of Dhiren Barot. There is no doubt that it was a technically challenging case, but it was a case in which charges were successfully brought within 14 days&mdash;not 28 days, but 14&mdash;which is hardly evidence that we need three times as long. Mr. Clarke offered the observation that in the Barot case, police officers had occasion to sleep at the office. Frankly, I should prefer that police officers sleep at the office for two weeks than risk putting innocent people in a cell for six weeks.</p>

	<p pid="b.330.0/1">The hon. Gentleman has heard me any number of times say that we will listen to the evidence.

	<p pid="b.330.2/1">In a moment. I want to get to the end of this part of my argument, because it is very important to this particular point.</p>
	<p pid="b.330.2/2">The third witness was Ken Jones, the president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, who said that the police, operating under the current 28-day limit were &quot;up against the buffers&quot;. That is the claim being made: not that we might be, but that we are up against the buffers. He based his judgment on the most complex counter-terrorism investigation in our history, Operation Overt, in respect of the alleged plot to blow 10 airliners out of the sky at Heathrow in August 2006. In that case, five people were held for 27 or 28 days. One can see why that superficial analysis leads us to the idea that we are up against the buffers, but it is only a superficial analysis. I asked Mr. Jones yesterday whether he had examined the detailed evidence in Operation Overt. He told me that he had not had the opportunity. I did look at the evidence. Three of the five suspects were held for the maximum period. More than half were innocent.</p>

I asked whether they were sufficiently concerned to put them under overt or covert surveillance? &quot;No,&quot; they said.

	<p pid="b.330.5/1">The right hon. Gentleman's latter point is very important, because in some of the cases that he cites, a lesser charge could have been offered. From all parts of the House, a case has been put that in respect of post-charge questioning, there is an opportunity for the police to continue doing what today's proposal of a 14-day extension allows in the most serious cases and for the most serious charge. Is it not either muddled thinking or, at its very best, a paradox, that those who are against the extension&mdash;with all the safeguards&mdash;to 42 days are happy for people to be charged with a lesser offence and then to be held in prison while questioning continues?</p>

	<p pid="b.330.6/1">The point that the right hon. Gentleman conflates&mdash;he has heard me argue this&mdash;is that the inability to question post-charge forces police and, more importantly, the Crown Prosecution Service, to defer charging because they are unable to continue gathering information about the case from the individual once the charge has been made. That is not the same point as the point that he makes. It is a very important point, but it is not the one that he made.</p>

Incidentally, of the six cases that John Stevens cited as taking us to the brink&mdash;they are, I think, the words that he used&mdash;half were proved innocent. There is a danger intrinsic in the extension when it involves cases in which there is no apparent evidence or not sufficient evidence in that there is more of a risk of detaining people who are innocent than of detaining those who are guilty.</p>

	<p pid="b.332.0/2">What about the other two cases in which people were held for 28 days? They are implicitly held up as the illustration that, due to the complexity of investigations, 28 days is proving inadequate. Is that really what those cases show? The key question is, when was the evidence available on which the charges were based? Ministers and officials have been asked a number of times&mdash;the Home Secretary has been asked a number of times&mdash;to answer that question, and they have implied that the evidence was obtained very late in the 28-day period.</p>
	<p pid="b.332.0/3">During our numerous meetings, when we were trying to reach a consensus, I asked the Home Secretary three times to show me the facts that demonstrated that evidence gathering had delayed the decision to charge in Operation Overt. But she failed to explain&mdash;even in the most general terms, or on a Privy Council basis, which I would have been perfectly happy to accept&mdash;what the evidence was or when it was acquired. I was forced to establish the facts myself and then to check them with the investigating team at Scotland Yard. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1394" name="Dominic Grieve">My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve)</phrase>, the shadow Attorney-General, checked them with the Crown Prosecution Service.

In one case, it comprised telephone records, handwritten and printed literature, an unencrypted CD and a receipt, all of which were available within four days of arrest. The second case was based on witness statements, mobile phone text messages and a single unencrypted computer file, all of which were available within 12 days of arrest.</p>
	<p pid="b.332.0/4">That does not mean that the police should be criticised&mdash;far from it. They should be commended for their handling of that operation, as I have said on several occasions. Nor does it mean that the CPS acted improperly&mdash;it rightly looked to gather as much evidence as possible under the rules that it is given by this House within the time frame that Parliament sets it. However, it does show that in the most complex terrorism investigation in our history, all the evidence on the only two suspects charged after 21 days was in the possession of the police within four and 12 days respectively. I suspect that that is why the Director of Public Prosecutions does not believe that the extension is at all necessary or foresee circumstances in which it will be necessary in future.</p>

The Home Secretary says that it is not capable of being used, although David Pannick, the Government's counsel of choice&mdash;the man who wrote the textbook on these subjects&mdash;says that it is. I offered to the Home Secretary sufficient changes to make it usable in such circumstances, because it contains some protections that are worth having but are not available in the Bill. That was the &quot;CCA plus&quot; offer that people have read about in the papers. We did that on the basis of the argument made by the Home Secretary's predecessor.</p>

A Home Secretary must take advice from all members of the law enforcement agencies, but she must check and ask questions; she must establish the facts, as we have been doing this afternoon. That is her responsibility. As the evidence in favour of extending pre-charge detention has evaporated under scrutiny, it has been replaced with growing evidence that the pre-charge detention proposals risk making us less, not more safe. The former chief inspector of constabulary has described the proposal on 42 days as a &quot;propaganda coup&quot; for al-Qaeda. They are a gift to &quot;propagandists&quot; that will drive the brainwashed to &quot;acts of martyrdom&quot;, according to one former Metropolitan police commissioner. They are a threat to local community intelligence, according to the Government's own impact assessment on the Bill. The proposal is wrong in principle and dangerous in practice.</p>

	<p pid="b.333.5/1">The right hon. Gentleman has built his case on the instance of the two cases where, he says, the evidence was available on the 12th day, at the latest. Why, then, does he believe that the Crown Prosecution Service kept those individuals in detention through to the 27th or 28th day? Did it do that recklessly, or was there a reasonable belief that further evidence could be uncovered that would be material to a prosecution?</p>

	<p pid="b.333.6/1">The hon. Gentleman raises a perfectly reasonable point. I am not surprised that he does so, because the Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing has attempted on several occasions to misrepresent this point of view. I have said that the CPS did not act recklessly. There are issues that police forces and prosecutors have to decide on in every case. If they have 20 or more suspects to deal with, a prioritisation process inevitably takes place, as we saw in the Overt case. All those charged with the most serious charge of conspiracy to murder were charged before 21 days, and the massive majority of them were charged before 14 days. It is entirely understandable that the prosecutors and the police focus on that area first. That is why I am concerned&mdash;it is not an accusation but a concern&mdash;that one of the effects of this will be to leave until the end of the process the people who are innocent, or against whom there may be a suspicion although they are innocent. There is a serious danger that extending it any further will mean more innocent people being put in a cell for six weeks.</p>

	<p pid="b.334.1/1">I understand my right hon. Friend's point, although I do not agree with it, in truth. However, there is a subtle related point. The CPS will seek to obtain a so-called full code charge&mdash;one with a 51 per cent. plus chance of conviction&mdash;because that is its guidance. If it is unable to obtain it, it may well want to use all the time available to try to do so instead of using the lower so-called threshold charge. The two people I mentioned were charged under the threshold charge arrangements. It is entirely possible&mdash;I do not know; it is pure surmise&mdash;that there was an attempt to obtain a full code charge. That is entirely legitimate and entirely the proper way for the CPS to act. The situation is not its fault, but our fault, because it arises directly out of the rules system that we created for it.</p>

	<p pid="b.334.2/1">My right hon. Friend referred to people being released right up against the buffers, as it were. The Government are saying that the nightmare scenario is that someone would be released after 28 days and then go on to commit some heinous offence. They are also saying that the numbers of people involved in the exercise of 42 days' detention would be very small and in circumstances of grave threat. Surely it is hard to imagine any circumstances where if someone had to be released after 28 days, they would not be under the most intense surveillance thereafter. It is hard to see how even if they were released under those circumstances, they could then precipitate an atrocity on the scale that the Government anticipate.</p>

	<p pid="b.334.3/1">My hon. Friend makes a good point. There are two aspects that relate to a small number of cases involving one, two or three people. This is where the Home Secretary differs from me in wanting the scope to act. It is entirely possible that the security agencies and the police could put a small number of people under close surveillance&mdash;through a control order, I suppose, if one believes that they work. It could be overt surveillance&mdash;there is no reason why a police car could not be put outside a house&mdash;or covert surveillance. All those things are possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.334.3/2">My hon. Friend reminds me of something that I forgot to say earlier. Implicit in some of the arguments made is that the people in question are a threat or danger to the public. The image conjured up is one of some sort of dangerous terrorist who will go out to bomb the nearest station or plane. Indeed, the Home Secretary implied that when she spoke of 28 days' detention putting the public at risk.</p>

They were not the ones charged with conspiracy to murder. In fact, in the two cases that we are talking about, they were subsequently released on bail. If they were released on bail, the courts clearly did not think that they posed an ongoing threat to the public. I am afraid that that argument falls in tatters, too.</p>

	<p pid="b.335.2/1">Can I gently suggest to the right hon. Gentleman that there is a big contradiction at the heart of his position? On the one hand, he cloaks himself in the principles of ancient civil liberties, going back to Magna Carta and so on, but on the other, he goes on to advocate alternative devices to get round those very civil liberties. For example, he advocates the use of the Civil Contingencies Act 2004, post-charge questioning and intercept evidence, and he advocates the charging of someone with a lesser offence and holding them while a potentially greater offence is investigated. That is a contradiction in his position. Is it principled or is it practical?</p>

	<p pid="b.335.3/1">Earlier, I did not pull up the former Home Secretary, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1810" name="David Blunkett">the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett)</phrase>, when he attributed that view to me. It is not my view, and has never been my view. However, let us take one of the hon. Gentleman's cases of an incursion on our civil liberties. He says that the use of intercept evidence in court is such an incursion. No, the incursion on our civil liberties occurs when the intercept is made. That is why there are warrant arrangements and controls on intercepts. Not using such evidence in court has nothing to do with civil liberties&mdash;it is to do with a judicial decision and an intelligence decision. He should have got his case a bit straighter.</p>
	<p pid="b.335.3/2">Some weeks ago, the Government were clearly at risk of losing this aspect of the Bill, so they conjured up a series of so-called safeguards. Interestingly, given what was just said to me, they are an attempt to import&mdash;almost in the words of the Home Secretary&mdash;a diluted version of the Civil Contingencies Act into the Bill. Again, this comes as something of a surprise. The House will recall that Ministers spurned the Civil Contingencies Act model for months and said that it was inappropriate, fundamentally flawed and a draconian response. I begin to wonder who wrote the Act&mdash;I thought that it was this Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.335.3/3">If the Civil Contingencies Act is draconian, it is hard to understand why, in her proposals, the Home Secretary's deliberately diluted the safeguards that are supposedly based on the Act. The Home Secretary says that the 42-day power of detention could be invoked only if there were a grave, exceptional terrorist threat. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1589" name="Mark Durkan">The point was made by the hon. Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan)</phrase> earlier that that is not a condition for invoking an extension beyond 28 days; it is merely a notification requirement. Even then the notification requirement will not refer to that, but to an operational necessity. It is merely a notification requirement, entirely irrelevant to the unfettered discretion that the Home Secretary will retain.</p>
	<p pid="b.335.3/4">Even if it were relevant, let us consider what could constitute a grave, exceptional terrorist threat. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1709" name="Robert Marshall-Andrews">The hon. and learned Member for Medway (Mr. Marshall-Andrews)</phrase> made this point earlier: the small print of the new clause refers to events that cause or threaten</p>
	<p pid="b.335.3/5" class="indent">&quot;(a) serious loss of human life</p>
	<p pid="b.335.3/6" class="indent">(b) serious damage to human welfare in the United Kingdom, or</p>
	<p pid="b.335.3/7" class="indent">(c) serious damage to the security of the United Kingdom.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.335.3/8">I am being charitable on this. Those definitions are so broad&mdash;a massive expansion of the criteria in the Civil Contingencies Act&mdash;that virtually any terrorist plot would satisfy them. The Dhiren Barot plot in 2004 to set off a dirty bomb would easily meet those conditions, but the charging was concluded in 14 days. The Operation Crevice fertiliser bomb plot in 2004 would also meet the definition, but all the charges were brought within 14 days. The 21/7 attacks would certainly qualify, but again all the charges were brought within 14 days. The definition of grave, exceptional threat is not only irrelevant to the power of the Home Secretary to order 42 days' detention, it simply does not matter at all.</p>

	<p pid="b.336.1/1">The hon. Gentleman raises an important point, and I will try to give him the most serious answer I can&mdash;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i><i> &mdash;</i>the one that the hon. Gentleman's question deserves, namely, yes. There are two categories of circumstance with regard to a threat to the state that the Government might face. One is a situation that obviously worries the Home Secretary, where perhaps 25 people are arrested and we are left with one, two or three at the end for whom we do not quite have enough evidence. We can deal with that, as was pointed out by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1724" name="Julian Lewis">my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis)</phrase>, by a variety of other mechanisms, including&mdash;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> Surveillance, I say to the security Minister&mdash;I think that is who he is. It certainly can be dealt with that way, but it can also be dealt with by the threshold test for prosecution&mdash;the reasonable suspicion test.</p>
	<p pid="b.336.1/2">The other circumstance is where there are a vast number of attacks on the state at the same time. The security Minister&mdash;the Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing&mdash;referred to it as the three 9/11s test. Under those circumstances, we would be overwhelmed, and we would need a definition of a state of emergency. This is what the Government object to. The matter is important because full judicial review can apply a test as to whether a state of emergency applies, in a way we cannot as individuals discussing the matter in the House of Commons. That is the point of distinction, which is why we offered the Home Secretary very early on in the process a modification to get &quot;CCA plus&quot;, as it was known in the jargon at the time, if she wanted it. We were willing to do that.</p>

It follows, therefore, that one trigger is already present, and if the Government seek to activate the procedure, the only thing that the House of Commons can profitably discuss is whether the police have in detention persons whom it is necessary to hold for a period longer than 28 days.

	<p pid="b.337.3/1">Having served in Northern Ireland, I suggest to my right hon. Friend that internment was not just a mistake, but counter-productive. It went directly against the armed forces because terrorists were able to go into communities and recruit actively, on the basis of internment, much better than they could otherwise. We do not want to make that mistake in this country with communities from whom we seek co-operation.</p>

	<p pid="b.337.6/2">The other problem is that there are no additional judicial safeguards over and above what we have now for the individual. The House need not take my word for that; indeed, David Pannick QC, a leading practitioner in the field, the Government's counsel of choice and the man who literally wrote the textbook, provided a formal legal opinion on the Bill:</p>
	<p pid="b.337.6/3" class="indent">&quot;Not only do the Amendments fail to replicate the safeguards in the 2004 Act but they fail, significantly or meaningfully, to provide similar or analogous safeguards.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="b.337.6/5">The truth is that the Government's so-called concessions are not a serious attempt to sustain consensus by providing proper checks and balances of the Home Secretary's now draconian powers. They are a vain attempt to save face. The Government have salami-sliced the safeguards, watered down the checks and buried an issue of high principle in a blizzard of fine print.</p>

	<p pid="b.338.0/1">I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for giving way. Why are those Members who are opposed to the principle of 42 days' detention without charge prepared to accept the Civil Contingencies Act or the existing legal possibility of derogating to the European convention on human rights? It is because both the CCA and the power of derogation could be used only in exceptional circumstances. The fear in the Muslim community in my constituency, and in Muslim communities up and down the country, is that if the 42-day period goes on the statute book in the terms proposed, it would become routine, with all the negative consequences for our security and for community cohesion that we have heard about.</p>

	<p pid="b.338.1/3">I have no sympathy whatever for terrorists. However, to put the issue in real terms, not on paper, I want hon. Members to imagine what it feels like for someone who is innocent under the proposed regime. They are taken from their bed in the early hours of the morning, which is what normally happens. They are locked in a cell for six weeks&mdash;1,000 hours&mdash;and they do not know why: not what they are accused of, not what the suspicions are, not what the evidence is. They do not know what is happening to their job. They do not know what is happening to their reputation. They do not know what is happening to their wife or their neighbours. They do not know what is happening to their children, who sometimes face the harsh cruelty of other children. They do not know that for six weeks&mdash;1,000 hours. No money on this earth will compensate for that.</p>
	<p pid="b.338.1/4">What we have is the worst of all worlds: a symbolic assault on liberty that is unnecessary, a change in the law that is counter-productive and a procedure that is unworkable.

	<p pid="b.338.2/1">I begin by thanking <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1608" name="David Davis">the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis)</phrase> not just for giving formal evidence to the Select Committee on Home Affairs when we considered the Government's counter-terrorism proposals, but for the private notes that he sent me and other members of the Committee, which were extremely helpful in allowing us to make our final determination.</p>
	<p pid="b.338.2/2">The right hon. Gentleman and others are quite right: this is an occasion of high politics, because this is Parliament, and of high drama, because of the outcome of the vote. More importantly, however, this is an occasion of high stakes, because we are dealing with the protection not just of our people, but of the liberties of individuals. Everyone, in all parts of the House, will take the issue and this debate very seriously indeed.</p>
	<p pid="b.338.2/3">Last year, the Committee held an inquiry into the Government's counter-terrorism proposals. It began as a short inquiry, looking into the way in which those proposals had developed and at the 28-day period. Shortly afterwards, however, following the Prime Minister's statement to the House, we extended the inquiry to cover a number of other aspects. We took evidence from Sir Ian Blair, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, the deputy assistant commissioner, Peter Clarke, the director of human rights for the police, the director of Liberty, Shami Chakrabarti, and the Prison Service.</p>
	<p pid="b.338.2/4">We sought the opinion of the members of what was called the Forest Gate two&mdash; Mr. Mohammed Abdul Kahar and Mr. Abul Koyair, who had been detained by the police and then released. We also took evidence from Rachel North, a writer and one of the survivors of 7/7, as well as from the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden, speaking for the Opposition, and the then Liberal spokesperson, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1812" name="Nicholas Clegg">the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Clegg)</phrase>. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> We did indeed take evidence from the Home Secretary&mdash;I am coming to her, but she has to wait her turn.</p>
	<p pid="b.338.2/5">Those evidence sessions and the fact that we took evidence from a wide variety of individuals and organisations were important, because we wanted to produce a thorough report and to ensure that we covered all the points that were made to us. We also took evidence from the Home Secretary, who answered 149 questions and appeared before us twice, on one occasion at very short notice, leaving Cabinet before time to get to us. The co-operation that we received from the Government and others was extremely helpful.</p>
	<p pid="b.338.2/6">We came to the conclusion that there was absolutely no evidence to support a permanent extension of the 28-day period to 42 days. We felt that the nature of permanence was such that no information placed before us could justify such an extension.</p>

	<p pid="b.339.0/1">Did the right hon. Gentleman take evidence from Mr. Khurshid Ahmed, the chairman of the British Muslim Forum?

	<p pid="b.339.1/1">Anyone could have given evidence to our Committee. We did not take evidence from that particular gentleman, although he has said that he is in favour of the extension. As the hon. Gentleman will know, we could not take evidence from absolutely everyone involved. I have read a list of those involved, but anyone could have submitted evidence to us.</p>
	<p pid="b.339.1/2">Despite saying that there was no case for an extension of the permanent limit of 28 days, we made it clear not just in the most recent report, but in a previous report, when the Committee was chaired by my right hon. Friend the now Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills&mdash;some of the members who contributed to the 2006 report are still serving on the Committee&mdash;that the current limit of 28 days might prove inadequate in the future. Both the Home Secretary and, more particularly, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner told us that they foresaw circumstances in which an extension would be necessary. The right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden and the former spokesman and current leader of the Liberal Democrats both saw that as a possibility in certain circumstances. We noted that Lord Goldsmith, the former Attorney-General, who was part of the Government when they put forward their proposal for 90 days, also envisaged the possibility of an extension in the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.339.1/3">We considered at some length Liberty's proposals that part 2 of the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 could be used in those exceptional circumstances where we both felt that it would be necessary to go beyond 28 days. We concluded, however, that the Act as currently drafted was not intended to deal with a situation of that kind. I pay tribute to Shami Chakrabarti and Liberty for the way in which they have engaged not just with the Select Committee, but with hon. Members and the Government. It is common knowledge that Liberty met the Home Secretary, the Prime Minister and others to discuss the legislation. It is right to engage with organisations such as Liberty, which has a wealth of knowledge and experience that can be put to great use. We felt that the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 was not the right vehicle, however, because we did not believe that the best way to deal with a situation of this kind was to have a state of emergency. Indeed, as the House knows, if the 2004 Act is adopted, it will take the period well beyond what is envisaged in the Government's proposals.</p>
	<p pid="b.339.1/4">We urged the Home Secretary to begin urgent discussions with other parties to try to build consensus. I know that she and others have been criticised for engaging with Members of Parliament. Some very cynical points have been made&mdash;not so far in today's debate, if I may say so, but outside the House&mdash;about why the Prime Minister, the Home Secretary and the Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing should be discussing matters with Members of Parliament. Of course they should. That is the nature of government. How dreadful it would be if the Government decided on a particular course of action and then never consulted anybody else. I hope that Home Secretary will not mind my having a slight dig at her&mdash;I am, after all, supporting her tonight: if only the Government had done the same thing over police pay, there would have been a different scenario. That aside, this engagement is extraordinarily important and has helped to bring a better proposal before the House; it has certainly moved a long way since the original proposals were made in July last year.</p>

	<p pid="b.341.0/2">To be serious again, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman was seeking to be in making that ridiculous comment, our conclusion was endorsed by 11 votes to one in a cross-party inquiry that included four Conservative Members&mdash;the hon. Members for Newark (Patrick Mercer), for Monmouth (David T.C.

	<p pid="b.341.1/1">The right hon. Gentleman does an excellent job of chairing the Committee and of encouraging consensus there, which is very important for Select Committees. Does he agree, however, that great concern was expressed by some members of the Committee about 42 days and that, in the end, the report was almost unanimously signed off because we wanted to make it clear that if there were to be an extension beyond 42 days, safeguards had to be in place. That did not necessarily imply full support for an extension beyond that period.</p>

	<p pid="b.341.2/1">The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right; of course there was controversy about this issue in the Committee, as there is in the House more widely. The fact remains that by 11 votes to one, the Committee decided that there was a possibility of exceptional circumstances arising in the future and we set out carefully the wording, referring to &quot;grave&quot; and &quot;exceptional&quot; circumstances in which an extension might be sought. The only member of the Committee to vote against was <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1900" name="David Winnick">my hon.

He feared that the Government would use the provision in future to claim that exceptional circumstances demanded a further extension.</p>

Does he also agree that the bizarre aspect of the Government's proposals is that the basis will not be a grave exceptional terrorist threat, which Parliament will be asked to decide on in any case, as we will be asked to vote on an order that is simply a report on an operational need for a further extension of the maximum period of detention?

	<p pid="b.347.3/1">I think that the money will be of great benefit to the people of Islington and Hackney, and to those all over the country, as they seek to work and engage with the Government on this issue. I do not think it right for us to feel that we cannot carry communities with us, although I am keen to ensure that the resources that the Government are allocating are allocated fairly and do the job that they were intended to do.</p>
	<p pid="b.347.3/2">Finally, let me say something about references to the director general of MI5 and the police. I have not heard the director general of MI5 say&mdash;to me or to the Committee&mdash;that he wants the period to be extended from 28 days to 42, and the Government are not maintaining that he has said it to them, because that is not his job. The job of the director general of MI5 is to advise the Government about the threat. In his speech, which was presumably on the record&mdash;if he did not want it to be reported, he should not have made it to the Society of Editors&mdash;the director general, Jonathan Evans, was very clear indeed. Some of the facts have already been given by the Home Secretary. At least 2,000 individuals who are believed to be a direct threat to the safety of our citizens are currently in the United Kingdom, there have been 20 known plots, and 200 suspect groups are being monitored. There have been 15 attempted terrorist attacks in Britain. It is a matter of record, because it is in our report, that the Committee met the director general of MI5. We were not prepared, quite rightly, to discuss what he said to us, but he has said publicly that those threats exist, and are real and growing. That is the advice that he can give.</p>
	<p pid="b.347.3/3">In their evidence, the police&mdash;Sir Ian Blair, Peter Clarke and others&mdash;made it clear to us that they wanted the current period to be extended. I think that Sir Ian Blair talked about &quot;up to 60 days&quot;. The police have made the case, and it is not for the security services to do so; nor is it for the Director of Public Prosecutions to do so. I have enormous respect for Ken Macdonald, and we readily agreed that he should appear before the Committee because he had not given evidence for its 2006 report. He made it clear that he did not consider the current period sufficient, but he also said that it was not up to him to decide whether it should be extended. That judgment can be made only by Parliament, and he will deal with whatever Parliament decides.</p>
	<p pid="b.347.3/4">I think it quite wrong for Members to start passing the buck to those outside, saying that this or that individual is against the proposal.</p>

I shall be voting for it because it is an emergency, temporary provision that will allow a permanent situation to be dealt with for that very short period. I know that the Home Secretary has given us those guarantees, and I look forward to her repeating them when she winds up the debate.</p>

	<p pid="b.348.3/1">I am pleased to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1674" name="Keith Vaz">the right hon. Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz)</phrase>. In my speech, I shall first explain why an extension of detention without charge matters to ordinary people and their freedoms, then I shall examine the weakness of the Government's case for such an extension and the feeble parliamentary safeguards offered by Ministers, and finally I shall argue that such excessive powers may be seen as illegitimate in substantial sections of our nation, and may act as a recruiting sergeant for the extremists.</p>
	<p pid="b.348.3/2">Let me begin by trying to explain why the powers of executive detention contained in the Bill and the amendments are so serious. They are not powers that apply just to other people; they are powers that could apply to any one of us here today. We could be arrested on our way home, in a case of mistaken identity, and locked up&mdash;if the Government have their way&mdash;not for one day or seven days, but for six weeks. What would a person's employer think? What would their family think? Surely, they might say, the police could not really detain someone without some pretty clear evidence, using powers under a terrorism Act. As every street gossip will tell you, there is no smoke without fire.</p>
	<p pid="b.348.3/3">We know, however, that of the six people who have come close to being detained for close to the existing limit of 28 days, half have been released without charge or any subsequent proceedings. Indeed, as was pointed out by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1852" name="John Gummer">the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer)</phrase>, who is no longer in the Chamber, it is inevitable that if these powers go on to the statute book they will be used for lower-priority cases, because the easier cases will have been dealt with first. The number of innocent people who are detained under the new powers is therefore likely to be particularly high.</p>

	<p pid="b.349.0/1">The point, surely, is that if the Home Secretary had evidence that the most serious offences had been committed, there would be no need to extend the period without charge, because she would be able to go ahead and charge the people. My fundamental point stands: on the basis of the existing track record, this will affect people who may well be found to be entirely innocent. We know that three of those six people spent a month of their lives not even knowing what offence they had been accused of committing.</p>
	<p pid="b.349.0/2">We could all name cases in which great injustices have already been perpetrated. One such case is that of the Algerian pilot Lotfi Raissi; an even more tragic case is that of the young Brazilian Jean Charles de Menezes. Most recently, there is the case of the students who were arrested for having terrorist materials, when they were writing a research report on Islamic extremism. The police do a commendable job in difficult circumstances, but they are human and therefore fallible. That is why we have a system of justice, and why checks and balances are crucial. It is also why we should not lightly concede yet another rise in the period of detention without charge.</p>

	<p pid="b.349.1/1">Does the hon. Gentleman accept that holding people for six weeks when they do not know what they are being held for is in itself coercive?

	<p pid="b.349.2/1">I am grateful for the hon. Lady's intervention, and I entirely agree.</p>
	<p pid="b.349.2/2">Let me take the Government's case at face value. The Home Secretary argues that the Government need to extend the period of detention for terrorist suspects from 28 to 42 days because of the increased complexity of terror cases, citing the recent increase in the number of computer files and comparing the alleged airline bombing case in 2006 with the Dhiren Barot case of 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.349.2/3">However, that argument rebounds on the Government in a very simple way. An extension of a mere two weeks would be entirely useless if each bit of evidence had to be waded through and assessed in the way that the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary implied.</p>

	<p pid="b.349.3/1">The argument about increasing complexity is often put forward, but is there not a case for expanding the capacity to deal with complex cases, rather than the length of time for which people can be held without charge?</p>

	<p pid="b.349.4/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend, and she is of course absolutely right, but I want to make another point. It has been said that it might be necessary to read material equivalent to one third of the contents of the US Library of Congress within the proposed legal limit of 42 days. If so, that would require 240,000 police officers working eight-hour shifts&mdash;a total equivalent to all the police officers in this country, plus 100,000 others on loan from a friendly neighbour.</p>
	<p pid="b.349.4/2">In fact, the tools available to the police have also increased in power so that sense can be made of large amounts of data. Clearly, search engines are available to others, as well as to Members of this House. Moreover, the Government do not seem to take the problem too seriously: they legislated in 2000 to make it an offence to withhold data encryption keys, but that offence did not come into force until 2007. So much for the sense of urgency.</p>
	<p pid="b.349.4/3">We have also heard that an inability to sift through data, whether encrypted or not, was not the cause even in those few cases that went close to the 28-day limit. In fact, the essential data issues were sorted out relatively quickly, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1608" name="David Davis">the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis)</phrase> showed very effectively. Liberty has pointed out that in two of the three cases in which people were subsequently charged, the evidence relied on to bring those charges was obtained within not 27 days, or 26 days, but within four and 12 days, respectively.</p>
	<p pid="b.349.4/4">No other common-law country has seen the need to do such violence to its freedoms. The Government like to bog the debate down in comparisons with Roman-Dutch law, but I am leaving countries that use such law entirely aside. I am talking only about countries such as Canada, the US, Australia and New Zealand, which have legal traditions exactly parallel to our own. Canada retains a traditional 24-hour detention period without charge.</p>

	<p pid="b.350.0/1">Is the hon. Gentleman saying that Lord Carlile's statements to the Committee were inaccurate and misleading? He said that the US Attorney-General had executive witness detention capability and was allowed to hold people for up to a year.

	<p pid="b.350.1/1">I am grateful for that intervention, but I specifically did not make a comparison with inquisitorial systems such as the French one. If the hon. Lady had been listening to me, she would have heard me say that Canada retains a traditional 24-hour period of detention without charge. In the US, the period is two days. Australia has extended the period to 12 days, in part because of the special cooling-off periods between interrogations. There are no provisions in the Bill to put in place the equivalent cooling-off periods that might justify an extension of detention along the lines introduced in Australia.</p>

	<p pid="b.350.3/1">I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman was not present for the Second Reading debate, as I remember that another Labour Member made exactly the same challenge. I made my position very clear then. At the moment, I am very happy with a period of 28 days. We should stick with that period because that is what we voted for, but we need to regard it as an emergency measure and keep it under constant review&mdash;especially given the lack of evidence that even 28 days is necessary. The hon. Gentleman asks about alternatives to the knee-jerk, Kafkaesque extension of detention without charge that is being proposed, but I believe that all the alternatives are much to be preferred.</p>
	<p pid="b.350.3/2">The Bill allows questioning to continue after charge, and we welcome that. We should also allow intercept evidence, as is the case in Australia and the United States. The Committee considering the Bill took evidence from Sir Ken Macdonald, the Director of Public Prosecutions, who said that his counterparts in the countries that I have named found our refusal to use intercept evidence astonishing.</p>
	<p pid="b.350.3/3">Most importantly of all, Sir Ken has described the considerable flexibility that the Crown Prosecution Service has to bring charges, which it can do even if it is felt at the time that the chances of a successful conviction are less than 50 per cent.&mdash;the normal test. In fact&mdash;this is crucial&mdash;Sir Ken pointed out that the CPS had had a 92 per cent success rate with terrorist convictions since the beginning of last year. As a result, he is on record as saying that the new powers are unnecessary. That is significant precisely because, if it is possible to secure a 92 per cent. conviction rate in cases brought after terrorist events have happened, as has been the case over the past two years, Sir Ken has the flexibility to achieve even more success should he decide to bring charges before a terrorist event occurs.</p>
	<p pid="b.350.3/4">Detention without charge for terrorist suspects has already risen from seven days to 14 days and then 28 days, just since 1997. The sad truth is that Ministers are using this simple number as a proxy to persuade the public that the Government are tough on terror. In fact, such blunt instruments run the substantial risk of alienating the communities that we need to have on board if we are to fight terror effectively.</p>

	<p pid="b.351.1/1">The hon. Lady may not be aware of a rule of this House that sub judice proceedings can be discussed during discussion of proposed legislation. If she has a fact that she would like to put before us, as opposed to assertions and opinions, perhaps she will do so. As I have mentioned, what we know from ACPO's evidence is that there have been six cases that have gone near to, but not up to, the limit of 28 days. Therefore, it is, I believe, accepted in all parts of the House&mdash;I hope the hon. Lady accepts this, too&mdash;that there is no evidence for any extension beyond 28 days. Even Ministers put the case for an extension in entirely contingent terms, and talk about what may happen in the future if a whole series of other events occur.</p>
	<p pid="b.351.1/2">The police need intelligence, and they need witnesses prepared to give evidence. Britain's most senior Muslim police officer, Assistant Commissioner Tarique Ghaffur, has warned that these arbitrary powers could have counter-productive effects in the Muslim community, exactly as internment had in Northern Ireland in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1589" name="Mark Durkan">the '70s. As the hon. Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan)</phrase> has correctly warned us, internment drove a wedge between communities and the security services. Intelligence dried up, witnesses refused to come forward to give evidence, and the scars remain to this day. Tough macho measures proved horribly counter-productive, exactly as these measures may. I agree that there is not a precise parallel between what is proposed in the Bill and internment, but there is a parallel in terms of the sentiment and motivation behind these proposals and, as a result, there may very well be a parallel in the unfortunate counter-productive effects. Have we not learned the lessons of 30 years ago?</p>

	<p pid="b.353.10/2">Let me now turn to the so-called safeguards in the Government's amendments. First, it would still be up to the Home Secretary to determine whether the conditions for extended detention had been met. In theory, her decision has to be in response to a &quot;grave exceptional terrorist threat&quot;, but that need hardly constrain her, as even the possibility of a threat remote from these islands would be enough. New clause 20 states:</p>
	<p pid="b.353.10/3" class="indent">&quot;In this Act 'grave exceptional terrorist threat' means an event or situation involving terrorism which causes or threatens&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.353.10/4" class="indent">(a) serious loss of human life&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.353.10/5">That is not by any means restricted to the United Kingdom. This could almost be regarded as the &quot;Tongan clause&quot; as it would allow any &quot;grave exceptional terrorist threat&quot; in Tonga to trigger the extension by the Home Secretary of the period of detention without charge from 28 days to 42 days. That is not exactly the sort of safeguard this Parliament is used to having in connection with a matter involving fundamental freedoms.</p>

	<p pid="b.354.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is right to analyse this area of the Government's proposals, because it is key to whether they are workable. However, I am by no means persuaded that the Home Secretary needs the existence of a &quot;grave exceptional terrorist threat&quot; to extend the maximum period of detention, because as the Bill is currently drafted that is not a prerequisite for doing so. All that is required is a report that such a further extension is needed because it is necessary for one or more of the purposes set out in a subsection that is, effectively, about detaining people, obtaining evidence and carrying out analysis of that evidence.</p>

	<p pid="b.354.1/2">Once the Home Secretary had triggered the extension beyond 28 days, there would be a seven-day period within which a debate and a vote would have to be held. Executive detention is thus automatically extended by these provisions to 35 days before Parliament would have the opportunity to set it aside.</p>

	<p pid="b.354.2/2" class="indent">&quot;There must be a genuine national emergency, the discovery of multiple and complex plots aimed at causing massive loss of life, the extent of which would overwhelm the capacity and resources of the police and security services and relate to a life and death situation with hundreds of people caught in a terrorist outrage.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.354.2/3">I am sure we would all agree that in such circumstances there might be a case, but is it correct that this is not the trigger that would give the Home Secretary the powers to ask this House to extend the emergency powers?</p>

	<p pid="b.354.3/1">The hon. Lady is correct to point that out. I have searched in vain for the amendment tabled by the right hon. Member for Leicester, East containing precisely the provisions that he suggested in that article; I fear that it does not appear to have made the Order Paper. Perhaps it will be a last-minute addition, rather like the Home Secretary's letter in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.354.3/2">In any case, it is very hard to see how the House will tread the narrow line between debate that could be prejudicial to a court case and general blather, which would simply boil down to whether the House trusted the judgment of the Home Secretary. That is hardly confidence-inspiring, and it is certainly not a serious check on the potential abuse of Executive power, so those who would believe that there are genuine safeguards in the Bill are misplacing their faith.</p>
	<p pid="b.354.3/3">The fight against terrorism is far too important to be reduced to populist symbols that would substantially curb our hard-won freedoms. This cause is central to the Liberal Democrats' belief in the rule of law, and in checks and balances on arbitrary power. The Government run the risk, with these provisions, of giving the terrorists exactly what they want, which is clear evidence of an insensitive and oppressive state. We must not, and we must never, become what we are fighting.</p>

	<p pid="b.355.0/1">I rise to speak to the new clauses and amendments that stand in my name, which have been tabled to give effect to recommendations made in the Joint Committee on Human Rights reports. I approach this issue with my eyes open; I am not wearing rose-tinted glasses. I remind the House that I was the first to raise concerns over the activities of extremists, from early 1998, when I was warning about Abu Hamza, Bakri Mohammed, Abu Qatada and many others. In those days, everybody thought that I was a bit of a nerd and nobody took any notice of me. I hope that today they will take notice of what I have to say, as they did after 9/11, but not before. As a consequence of what I did, I suffered hate mail, death threats and vitriolic personal attacks. In addition, five of my constituents&mdash;more than the number for any other constituency&mdash;were killed on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-07">7 July 2005</phrase>, so I do not approach this matter with any liberal leanings.</p>
	<p pid="b.355.0/2">I voted for 90 days, because at that time I saw no other option. I have since changed my position, because the Government have not made their case for new powers, we have experience of the 28-day maximum, the safeguards are not adequate, alternatives are available and I do not believe that the proposals will make us safer. In fact, they risk alienation and division in our society.</p>
	<p pid="b.355.0/3">The Joint Committee on Human Rights has reported on 11 separate occasions on counter-terrorism policy, and an array of our reports lie on the Table, tagged for today's debate. They all start from the same basic premise: that the state has a positive obligation in human rights law to protect us all from terrorism and violence; and that the state has a duty to prosecute and to make prosecution more effective and, as far as possible, to do so as part of ordinary criminal law. Each erosion of the normal process is, in itself, a result for the terrorist, who would undermine our freedoms and way of life. We run the risk of doing his work for him.</p>

	<p pid="b.355.2/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention, and I shall come on to that point later.</p>
	<p pid="b.355.2/2">I do not believe that the Government have made their case for the need for 42 days. In the evidence that they have given to us, the threat level has been described as &quot;about the same&quot;. There have been assertions of a growing threat in terms of numbers, but no qualitative analysis or assessment has been provided. We should never underestimate the threat, which is of course serious, but equally we should not over-hype it. We need to give a clear and accurate picture in order to maintain public confidence. I think that it is instrumental that the three most recent attacks have been somewhat amateurish affairs, as we all know.</p>
	<p pid="b.355.2/3">The numbers that we are given could mean either that there are more plots and plotters, which would be worrying, or that the substantial extra resources that we have given the security services mean that they know more about such people than they knew before, when they were below their radar&mdash;that, of course, would be reassuring. The numbers relate to the general level of the threat, and that is not relevant to the 42-day debate at all. What is relevant to the debate is when the plotters are subject to arrest, if and when these plots become crystallised. We do not have much information about such matters, other than in respect of the cases that we know about. Such cases are far fewer in number than the thousands that we are told exist.</p>
	<p pid="b.355.2/4">Although the director of MI5 is prepared to give a lecture to the society of newspaper editors on this issue, he is not prepared to repeat his lecture to a parliamentary Committee and to take questions on it from such a Committee. We invited him to do so. We did not want to talk about the secret squirrel stuff. We wanted only to discuss the broad issues, but he was not prepared to come before us. We wrote to him in December 2007 asking for his assessment of the increase, but we have yet to receive a reply to that letter.</p>

	<p pid="b.356.0/1">When we considered this matter in Committee, we were given some evidence by Sir Ian Blair of a growing threat. I am concerned, as I hope my hon. Friend is, that if we should decide at some point that we would need an extension of the time in which to examine evidence concerning somebody who is suspected of committing a terrorist attack on this country, that should not happen in a heated situation after some event. We should take such a decision after a calm and collected discussion, such as we are having this afternoon. Can he comment on that?</p>

	<p pid="b.356.1/1">I entirely agree with my hon. Friend that we need to discuss this in a rational way, and I shall be giving her an alternative, my amendment (a), which I hope she can support. It answers the point.</p>
	<p pid="b.356.1/2">The Government pray in aid a variety of plots and trials, but they have all been dealt with under the existing arrangements satisfactorily and effectively. The Dhiren Barot case has been trotted out again, but that was dealt with under the 14-day rule. That was one of the cases that they used in the argument for 90 days, which led to the compromise of 28 days, so that is an old argument that was dealt with two years ago. The parliamentary Labour party briefing refers to eight other plots, which were all dealt with under the 14-day rule, except the alleged airline plot, which was dealt with under the 28-day provisions. There is no evidence of anyone having been released when they not should not have been. The 28-day power has not been used for a year, and it has hardly been used at all. Yet, this new power is being sought on spec for what we are told are future extreme cases.</p>

	<p pid="b.357.0/1">I wanted to ask the Home Secretary this earlier. Have we seen one shred of evidence that the figure of 42 days&mdash;or any other number above 28 days&mdash;has been justified?

	<p pid="b.357.1/1">The hon. Lady makes her point, and I shall not demur from it. We are told that the reserve power is needed for a &quot;grave, exceptional terrorist threat&quot;. On <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-23">23 January</phrase>, in the <i> Daily Mirror</i>, my right hon. Friend the Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing asked us to imagine two or three 9/11s. On the &quot;Today&quot; programme on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-02">2 June</phrase> he said that there was a</p>
	<p pid="b.357.1/2" class="indent">&quot;substantial threat against the nation&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.357.1/3">and that we have a</p>
	<p pid="b.357.1/4" class="indent">&quot;backstop for truly exceptional situations&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.357.1/5">He also mentioned the &quot;nightmare&quot; and the &quot;doomsday scenario&quot;. If that is so, the powers are already in place. I am talking about the power to derogate from article 5&mdash;the right to liberty&mdash;and to disapply a fundamental right that goes back to the Magna Carta of 1215.</p>
	<p pid="b.357.1/6">My amendment (a) provides a system to enable that derogation to take place. If there is a public emergency threatening the life of the nation, article 15 permits derogation from&mdash;that is, disapplication of&mdash;the right to liberty. A co-ordinated, large-scale attack on the nation's political, military and financial institutions, such as 9/11 in the US, would meet that test, never mind two or three 9/11s at the same time.</p>
	<p pid="b.357.1/7">Under derogation, the Government are entitled to take the measures that are strictly required for the exigencies of the situation. Derogation is not a new solution. The Belmarsh detainees were held under a derogation power, and the case failed on discrimination grounds. The control order powers in the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 provided for derogating control orders, but they have not been used.</p>
	<p pid="b.357.1/8">My amendment sets out a process to enable the Secretary of State to make a designated derogation order in anticipation of any future need of such a terrorist attack. It incorporates safeguards such as judicial review and parliamentary approval, and this proposal would give the Government everything that they profess to need&mdash;an emergency reserve power for the truly exceptional cases, with appropriate safeguards.</p>
	<p pid="b.357.1/9">Why will not the Government accept my amendment? As has begun to emerge, the Government want the reserve power not for the extreme cases, but for far less than their public statements suggest. They want that power not for two 9/11s or for a substantial threat against the nation. The letter from the Minister to the Human Rights Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-06">6 June</phrase> states:</p>
	<p pid="b.357.1/10" class="indent">&quot;The definition of grave exceptional terrorist threat which we now propose would cover events or situations similar to the bombings in July 2005, or a plot to blow up a shopping centre or a plot to commit terrorist atrocities overseas involving serious loss of life. We do not think any of these are covered by the Civil Contingencies Act definition of an emergency.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.357.1/11">The July 2005 bombings were dealt with under the 14-day regime. The shopping centre example would not be a multiple plot. Atrocities overseas may be nothing to do with us. Today we had another letter from the Home Secretary that said that the attempted airline plot would have been a case in point, but that was dealt with under the 28-day procedure.</p>
	<p pid="b.357.1/12">The implication from the briefing sent to the parliamentary Labour party is that all the cases listed, which were dealt with under 14 or 28 days, would in future be subject to the 42-day maximum. The power is not meant for exceptional cases but for the sort of cases that have been dealt with adequately so far under existing powers.</p>

	<p pid="b.358.0/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a case exclusively based on the application of the European convention on human rights and the Human Rights Act 1998, and the derogation in article 5. Why does he insist on that route, rather than that of habeas corpus, under which the court would have the right to make a proper inquiry if given that power in statute by this House?</p>

	<p pid="b.358.1/1">First, I will come on to habeas corpus, as I promised the hon. Gentleman earlier. Secondly, we are subscribers to the European convention on human rights&mdash;and rightly so&mdash;and I propose a way in which we can lawfully do what the Government wish us to do in cases of major emergency.</p>
	<p pid="b.358.1/2">We have now had experience of the 28-day limit. I remind the House that 28 days was to be an exception, with the norm being 14 days and the issue subject to annual review. The DPP tells us that he has managed reasonably comfortably. Sue Hemming, the chief prosecutor, says that 28 days has proved to be &quot;sufficient&quot;. We have already heard the figures for the alleged airline plot. Six were held beyond 14 days, with two charged just before 28 days and three released just before. The latter were not re-arrested or subject to control orders.</p>
	<p pid="b.358.1/3">The 28-day limit has been used only in two other cases. Up to now we have had no quantitative analysis of those cases, although the Opposition Front-Bench team produced some yesterday, which showed that there was little questioning of the suspects during that period. We have heard today that in fact the evidence to support a threshold charge was probably in place by 14 days for the two who were held up to the 28-day limit. However, until we receive the detail, we cannot be certain that that was the case. We must also take into account the possible urgency of the investigation. If we had had a 42-day limit, would those three people have been held for that time in the hope that some evidence might turn up, rather than for 28 days?</p>
	<p pid="b.358.1/4">The judicial safeguards proposed in the Bill are effectively the same as those for 28 days, save that the DPP and the chief constable have to authorise the application for the extension. The existing process is not fully judicial in accordance with article 5. The Government say that it involves a proper judicial hearing, but the case of Garcia Alva <i> v.</i> Germany in the European Court of Human Rights makes it clear that the criteria that the Government operate do not match those that the court expects.</p>
	<p pid="b.358.1/5">Even if there were no problem with the process for 14 days, or even 28 days, it is wrong to say that neither would there be a problem for 42. The longer the period of detention, the more stringent the procedural safeguards need to be. The Government say that there has been no challenge to the extension process in court on the grounds of incompatibility, but there was: the case of Naseel Hussain, which was one of the first 28-day cases. It failed on a Catch-22: the High Court said that it could not review the decision of the High Court judge to extend the period of detention.</p>
	<p pid="b.358.1/6">That ruling would also, in effect, exclude habeas corpus. That court case decided that the warrant of further detention was a judicial hearing for the purposes of article 5.4. If that is so, that is the judicial hearing that would be required by habeas corpus, so any application for habeas corpus would be struck out by the court as an abuse of process. New clause 35 is very important because it would overcome that particular problem.</p>

	<p pid="b.359.1/1">I support the hon. Gentleman's new clause and I see it as a matter not of either/or, but of both.</p>
	<p pid="b.359.1/2">We hear that there will be an ex gratia compensation scheme. We can infer therefore that the Government accept that the provisions do not comply with article 5, because article 5.5 provides for compensation for someone held in breach of article 5. As the compensation scheme is to be confined solely to cases under these arrangements, and not applied generally to people held on charge and released, one can only assume that that is the case. We must also consider the impact that that would have on other suspects&mdash;for example, those who may have been held on bail for a long time and then acquitted. They will say, &quot;Well, the Muslims are getting money, why aren't we?&quot; That could have an impact on community relations.</p>
	<p pid="b.359.1/3">New clause 1, which I tabled, suggests improvements to the judicial process including entitlement to judicial process; a statement of the basis for arrest; the gist of the material forming the grounds for suspicion to be given to the suspect; a special advocate for the closed part of the hearing; and entitlement for the judge to look at whether there are reasonable grounds for the belief that the suspect is involved in terrorism and, in other words, to check whether the arrest was justified in the first place. At the moment, judges are entitled only to consider whether the investigation was necessary and has been conducted diligently.</p>
	<p pid="b.359.1/4">New clause 37 would provide for judicial review of the Home Secretary's decision, if the existing arrangements stay in place, on whether there is a grave threat, whether a reserve power is needed and whether it is needed urgently. I am not sure whether the Government agree that those should be subject to judicial review; I suspect not.</p>
	<p pid="b.359.1/5">New clause 36 would provide that similar provisions to those in the Civil Contingencies Act should apply to the Human Rights Act and the emergency regulations, so that the courts could intervene and quash them if they were considered to be unlawful. I think that the Government agree with the point and it would be appropriate to include it in the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.359.1/6">On the question of parliamentary safeguards, the independent legal advice to the Home Secretary as to whether the reserve power is needed would ask the same questions as a court, essentially considering whether an individual's detention would be appropriate. That will be passed on to the Select Committee Chairs, including me if I am still in office&mdash;I suspect that I probably will not be, considering the way that I am going. If I were still in office, on Privy Council terms, it is not quite clear what I would be able to do with that information. I would not be able to check whether it was accurate or to get advice on it. I would not be entitled to share it with members of my Committee. I would be entitled only to read it and to think, &quot;Mm, interesting.&quot; I would not even be entitled to refer to it in a debate on extension before the House. Although the fact that it would be shared is welcome&mdash;I am a prurient, nosey chap who likes to know what is going on&mdash;it would not achieve a great deal.</p>
	<p pid="b.359.1/7">The safeguard allowing us to have debates within seven rather than 30 days is welcome, as is the fact that Parliament would be recalled. However, the debate will be even more circumscribed than we originally thought, not just for <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1394" name="Dominic Grieve">the reasons advanced by the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve)</phrase> but because the questions will be the same all the way through. The DPP and police report to the Secretary of State will be in similar terms to the application that they will have to make in an individual case. Independent legal advice to the Secretary of State will again raise the same issues. The advice to Parliament would be redacted to prevent any prejudice to the trial. The same issues will arise with the Secretary of State's order as arise with individual cases, as she will have to be satisfied about them when she comes to make the order. When Parliament comes to approve the order, it will consider the same issues again. Therefore, because we cannot risk prejudicing a trial, the debate may only be very general. It will consider the sort of things that we debated in the previous cases on the back of the statement, which is hardly sufficient to justify the possible deprivation of liberty not only of the suspect in custody but of any other suspects arrested over the next 30 days. Inevitably, too, it would be a whipped vote.</p>

	<p pid="b.360.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that although it is absolutely right that the order would also cover the arrest of anybody else in the following 30 days, the trigger mechanism clearly implies that it will be precipitated by one case? That is the most likely outcome. Those circumstances will make it even more difficult to debate the issues surrounding the making of the order in this House, because the generality probably will not be there. The debate will be entirely dependent on the report, which will be made to the Secretary of State in the first place, on the operational need for an extension, relating probably to individuals.</p>

	<p pid="b.360.1/1">The hon. and learned Gentleman is correct. The same argument will continue in the debate on the reviewer's report six months later. Of course, we do not know when that will happen, because if the period of extension is repeated&mdash;if it is set for 30 days, then for another 30 days, then for another 30&mdash;will that six-month review take place after the expiry of the first 30 days or of the subsequent 30-day periods? Putting that to one side, the chances are that the reviewer's report will come before the House while the suspect is awaiting trial, so there is an even greater risk of prejudice when debating the reviewer's report.</p>

	<p pid="b.361.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is making a very powerful case. Does he accept that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1394" name="Dominic Grieve">the point made by the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve)</phrase> is strengthened if one looks at the detail of what the Government are proposing in new clause 22?

	<p pid="b.361.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is entirely correct, and his point adds weight to the argument.</p>
	<p pid="b.361.1/2">The other safeguard, we are told, is that the power will be reduced in length to 30 days. That is an improvement on what we had originally, but it can be renewed back to back indefinitely by the repetition of the same process. It could go on to 30, 60, 90 or 120 days. Who knows?</p>
	<p pid="b.361.1/3">There are alternatives. The Joint Committee on Human Rights first proposed a package of alternatives in 2006 that offers a coherent, human rights-compliant alternative. For the big emergency cases&mdash;the 9/11s&mdash;we have the derogation process. For all the others, there are alternatives.</p>
	<p pid="b.361.1/4">The most important alternative is threshold charging. Many Members, I suspect, do not understand what threshold charging involves. It means that the individual is charged on the basis of reasonable suspicion of the commission of the offence based on admissible evidence, as opposed to arrest, which can be based on inadmissible evidence. It is predicated on how the investigation is anticipated to proceed. We can compare that test with the normal full code test of &quot;more likely than not&quot;. Some 50 per cent. of terror cases so far have been charged on that basis. It has proved very effective in practice, with a conviction rate of more than 90 per cent. In my view, it is important that that process is made statutory with appropriate safeguards, and my new clause 2 will do that.</p>
	<p pid="b.361.1/5">Incidentally, if we use the threshold test as our international comparator rather than the full code test, we see that the threshold test in some of the other common law countries, such as America and some of the continental countries, is not that dissimilar from some of the questions that investigatory magistrates have to pose. Both sides of the debate have probably overstated their case for and against international comparators, but if the threshold test is used, the position is perhaps a little clearer.</p>
	<p pid="b.361.1/6">The second alternative is the new offence of acts preparatory to terrorism. It is a broad offence, and when charged on the threshold basis and in combination with that threshold test it provides a broad and easy process for the prosecution service to follow. As we have heard, two of the alleged airline plotters were charged within 28 days with acts preparatory to terrorism on the threshold test. If, within 28 days, a reasonable suspicion cannot be established on the threshold basis that the accused has committed an act preparatory to terrorism&mdash;a very broad offence&mdash;the chances of our getting them for anything are probably negligible.</p>

	<p pid="b.362.3/1">I need to make some progress, as many Members want to speak.</p>
	<p pid="b.362.3/2">Alternative No. 3 is post-charge questioning, which we debated yesterday. Alternative No. 4 is my new clause 3, which proposes police bail with conditions similar to control orders for people on the fringe of plots, such as the inciters and funders&mdash;the sort of people we were talking about earlier. They could be closed down entirely while their computers were analysed. They could be prevented from communicating and from going where they want to go. That option was suggested at Paddington Green during our visit there.</p>
	<p pid="b.362.3/3">Alternative No. 5 relates to intercept evidence and the Chilcot review. Alternative No. 6 is more specialisation in the CPS, as is already happening. Alternative No. 7 would be more active case management by judges. Why are judges not tougher on some of the unjustified delaying tactics and obstruction deployed by defence teams? Alternative No. 8 involves a suggestion put to us by the Director of Public Prosecutions and relates to incentives for those on the periphery to give evidence&mdash;for example, lower sentences and witness protection, although obviously with appropriate safeguards.</p>
	<p pid="b.362.3/4">The Government response to that package is that they do not look at it as a package. They accept that such proposals would reduce pressure to go beyond 28 days, but say that they would not entirely eliminate the risk of running out of time. However, for that matter, 42 days or 90 days would not entirely eliminate that risk. As the DPP said to the Public Bill Committee, it is always possible to posit hypothetical scenarios; the question is whether they are &quot;remotely likely&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.362.3/5">When the Joint Committee made its recommendation about putting threshold charging on a statutory basis, the Government response, in terms of the impact on affected communities, was:</p>
	<p pid="b.362.3/6" class="indent">&quot;Communities most likely to be affected may react adversely if they perceive that terrorist cases are uniquely charged on a lower evidential threshold.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.362.3/7">The inference of the Government's position must be that such communities would not react adversely if they perceived that people in such cases would uniquely be detained for 42 days. What a non sequitur. If the threshold charge created an adverse reaction, surely a 42-day period would, too.</p>
	<p pid="b.362.3/8">We have only to look at the briefing issued by the Equality and Human Rights Commission to see what Muslim people really think. The Government say that Muslim communities are no different from any others&mdash;they want to be protected from terrorism. Of course they do. They want to be protected from the backlash. Of course they do. However, it is appropriate to note that in London everybody came together after <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-07">7 July</phrase> and there was the opposite of a backlash. People were concerned to ensure that the Muslim community was protected and reassured.</p>
	<p pid="b.362.3/9">Finally, would the proposal make us safer? It is not a deterrent to terrorism, but an investigation tool. It could make things worse if the consequences are alienation, less co-operation, less information and less intelligence. There are risks in lesser cases&mdash;not in extreme doomsday cases, because derogation deals with those&mdash;that someone who should be charged is released after 28 days with no control order. What if they are released after 42 days? The offence of acts preparatory to terrorism and the other examples I gave offer an alternative package for such cases. The risks need to be balanced against the effect of releasing an innocent person, even with compensation, after six weeks.</p>
	<p pid="b.362.3/10">I regret to say that the Government have not made a case for the need for 42 days. Even if they had, derogation is available. We have experience of 28 days. Alternatives are available. The safeguards are inadequate. The proposal will not make us safer and I hope the House will not accept it.</p>

	<p pid="b.363.2/1">When the House debated the 90-day detention limit last year, I abstained&mdash;not happily, because I do not happily go against the advice of my Front-Bench colleagues, but because I did not feel that the Government had made a sufficiently detailed case for the extension. Since then I have twice said to the Prime Minister&mdash;once in Prime Minister's Question Time and once when he made a statement about security&mdash;that a detailed case would need to be made if we were to be persuaded to change our minds. I am sorry to say that although the Government have gone some way down that road, they have not yet given any concrete reason why the extension is necessary, except to say that it may be required at some future event. That is a reasonable way to go, and I shall come to that point later.</p>
	<p pid="b.363.2/2">Let me refer back to the time when the Operation Crevice plotters were under investigation and on trial, and the Security Service carried out its biggest ever investigation; it should be congratulated on the success of that. Although the Intelligence and Security Committee received regular briefings about the progress of those cases, we did not know whether there had been any problems to do with the length of time for which the people concerned were detained, or whether it was causing any difficulty in bringing the charges and trials to a successful conclusion. It turns out that there was not any such problem in either of those cases, which are the two largest cases that the Security Service and the police have ever undertaken.</p>
	<p pid="b.363.2/3">One of the difficulties today has been that the Prime Minister said a few hours ago in Question Time that it was the Security Service that wanted the measures introduced; his words were very clear. The Home Secretary said exactly the same in her opening remarks today. I have known that that was not the case for some time, but until yesterday I felt myself unable to say why I knew that. Yesterday, on the Security Service website, Jonathan Evans, the director general of the Security Service, made it absolutely clear that that is the Security Service's position, saying:</p>
	<p pid="b.363.2/4" class="indent">&quot;we are not, and never have been&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.363.2/5">advising</p>
	<p pid="b.363.2/6" class="indent">&quot;the Government on pre-charge detention time limits.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.363.2/7">That is absolutely clear. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1394" name="Dominic Grieve">My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve)</phrase>, the shadow Attorney-General, suggested&mdash;inadvertently, I think&mdash;that the Prime Minister misled the House. I do not say that, but the Prime Minister was wrong to say that the Security Service had wanted an increase in the time, and I am sorry to say that the Home Secretary was wrong to say exactly the same thing a couple of hours ago.</p>
	<p pid="b.363.2/8">I do not believe that the case has been made. I do not have a problem with the principle of detaining someone for longer if there is cause for it. Neither do I object in principle to someone saying, &quot;We do not want to do it when or if there is a major terrorist incident.&quot; I am not happy about the Executive taking more powers for themselves, no matter what safeguards they write into a Bill. I am not making a party point; I would say exactly the same if our party was in government. The Government may want to plan ahead, but God forbid there should be an incident in which all the measures that we are discussing are necessary. This is the time to say, &quot;The Executive have quite enough power. We must turn to the judiciary to decide the matter.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.363.2/9">If the Government came forward with a proposal that a High Court judge should consider individual cases when the police or security services said that they were in difficulty and needed more time, and the case was made to the judge, then it would be acceptable for the period of detention to be extended. I say that because I believe that the British public trust the judiciary. I am sorry to say that they do not trust an overweening Executive. Again, that is not a party point. I am afraid that when Governments say, &quot;This has to happen, otherwise something dreadful will take place,&quot; the public view it rather cynically. If a High Court judge were to say the same thing, that would be largely acceptable to the British people.</p>

	<p pid="b.364.0/1">I am grateful to my right hon. Friend, and Friend he is. I have listened carefully. What he is requesting is in the Bill, according to my reading. If an extension from 28 days is to be made, a High Court judge must approve that, on the evidence presented to him or her.</p>

	<p pid="b.365.7/1">Perhaps I can help my right hon. Friend a little. It is low hurdle that the judge has to consider. He does not have to consider whether the suspect is guilty or not; he simply has to consider whether proceedings are marching to time and whether there is likely to be new evidence. That is a low hurdle and does not involve the judiciary as we would accept it.</p>

	<p pid="b.365.8/1">That is absolutely right.</p>
	<p pid="b.365.8/2">There are further problems with the Bill. I accept that the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary have been looking for consensus, and I accept that that should not be a party political matter. The trouble is that the moment the Government realised that they had to start making concessions, they did not make the Bill better&mdash;they made it rather worse. In order to try and buy off some of the usual suspects, if I may use that phrase about some of my friends on the Government Benches, the Government introduced the concession of consulting Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="b.365.8/3">Parliament, of all people, should have no role to play in the matter. I shall not rehearse the arguments that others have expressed much more eloquently than I have about what would happen if a particular case&mdash;because it must be a particular case&mdash;came in front of Parliament to decide, after someone had been in the slammer for more than 28 days. That concession makes the Bill worse rather than better and the one thing that I can say is that that measure has not got a chance of surviving scrutiny at the other end of the Palace because it is not our business to second-guess judicial or Executive decisions of a judicial nature.</p>
	<p pid="b.365.8/4">If the Government, when they finally come back with what will be a much reformed Bill, are prepared to say&mdash;I am prepared to concede that there may be an event that is so cataclysmic, or it may be necessary to prevent a serious event from happening&mdash; that, because of the complicated nature of inquires, there must be detention for longer than 28 days, let that decision be taken independent of the Executive by a senior High Court judge. I believe that would be acceptable and if the Government proposed it, I would support it.</p>

	<p pid="b.366.0/1">It is a great pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1611" name="Michael Mates">the right hon. Member for East Hampshire (Mr. Mates)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.366.0/2">I rarely quote from <i> The Sunday Telegraph</i>, but today I want to quote from an article by Matthew d'Ancona in that paper because he presents the case and asks the appropriate question better than I could when he says:</p>
	<p pid="b.366.0/3" class="indent">&quot;We face a threat that is indeed new in scale, ambition, and complexity. The question is whether we have what it takes as a society to respond to novelty with new strategies.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.366.0/4">I had the privilege of being a member of the Committee that considered the Bill. It was a privilege because, unlike other Committees on which I have sat, it took a significant amount of evidence, so that everyone began to feel that they understood the wide parameters of the Bill that we were possibly attempting to improve, but most certainly hoping to achieve consensus on and support for.</p>
	<p pid="b.366.0/5">The evidence spanned that from the secretary of the Coroners Society, the Home Office terrorism specialist, Lord Carlile, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, the Association of Chief Police Officers, Justice and Liberty. A vast range of excellent evidence was presented and carefully scrutinised by the Committee. We wanted to understand all opinions on terrorism, whether about intercept, pre-charge detention or reserve powers, so that we could ensure that we carefully walked the line that we have to walk between supporting and determinedly enabling individual civil liberties, while at the same time delivering a secure society for everyone.</p>
	<p pid="b.366.0/6">I probably found the evidence of ACPO, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner and Lord Carlile to be the most convincing, but all of it was very valuable. The evidence of ACPO and the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, which was added to by a letter that I understand was placed in the Library, outlined the extreme and exceptional nature of potential and actual terrorist activity. Clearly, the argument made by both was to say: put on the shelf a power that we could need. We have taken cases to 27 and a half days&mdash;only two, that is right; maybe six&mdash;but when that power of detention is required, it should be to hand. That was a persuasive argument that I supported.</p>

	<p pid="b.366.2/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right that we have a great deal of support and affection for each other. I do not believe that I had then the amount of evidence or information that I have now. I have seriously taken time to garner the information that is available, and perhaps I should have done so previously, but the evidence presented by ACPO was clear. In the interval between November 2006 and 2007, it saw a rise in the number of people identified as causing concern, possibly involved in terrorist activity, from 1,600 to 2,000. During the same period, we have had 15 terrorist attempts. I had not previously understood the quantity and capabilities of the terrorist group, but I think I understand them better now, and I hope that the House will respect this information.</p>
	<p pid="b.366.2/2">The add-on factor, which, again, I found quite compelling, was that such people do not just have an identity; they have multiple identities. We are looking at a situation in which many more people are potentially highly problematic to us. Added to that was the complexity of the situation. We have all spoken about the global nature of terrorism and its investigation and about an informal network that is working within communities. In addition, there is the use of mobile phones, internet communications and the rest, which makes the issue very complex.</p>
	<p pid="b.366.2/3">There is one more factor. The House knows about it, but it is important for me to state it. There is a language input. Some languages are becoming more and more a part of a world that could be attached to terrorist activity, and oftentimes we have very few people with the competence to understand them, especially when those languages become colloquial. I say to the House, with a smile, certainly as I look at <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1778" name="Crispin Blunt">the hon. Member for Reigate (Mr. Blunt)</phrase> on the Opposition Front Bench, that one of them is an Afghan language known as Dari. He would have expected that to be a problem, would he not?</p>

	<p pid="b.367.1/2">Crucially, we also wanted to see how the civil libertarian argument could be supported. We held very clear sittings during which we took evidence from Justice and from Liberty. Our concern was to consider the alternatives to extending the 28-day period. Was it true, for example, that we really would become the most anti-libertarian country in the world if we did so? Again, I shall use Lord Carlile as my textbook, but there were others whom I could have used. He said no, that each and every legal system is different, and that comparisons are very difficult to make. In the USA, the detention period is not two days at all. He said that the US Attorney-General has executive witness-detention capabilities and that they can hold people for up to a year.</p>

	<p pid="b.367.3/1">As the hon. Gentleman will guess, Lord Carlile did not make that statement to the Committee. However, he did make statements that many of us checked, including the statement that we are not the most anti-libertarian country at all. We compare very favourably with others. The other statement that I would make quite determinedly is that many of the countries that we compare ourselves with, such as Canada or Australia, most certainly have not faced the hideousness of 15 very serious terrorist attempts, and most certainly have not seen 52 of their citizens die and 800 be seriously affected as a result of terrorism. It is not true that comparisons are easy. I do not choose to make them; most particularly, I state that they should not be made.</p>

The response was that in the view of many in the legal system, which, again, includes Lord Carlile, post-charge questioning is certainly not a silver bullet. They believe that it will make a limited difference to cases. We persistently asked Lord Carlile about threshold testing, which was an important issue for us. He said:</p>
	<p pid="b.368.1/3" class="indent">&quot;It is desirable in as many cases as possible that people should be charged with something approaching the criminality of which it is reasonably suspected that they are guilty and on which a prima facie case will be presented.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="b.370.1/1">I rise to support Government amendments Nos. 4 and 5, which seek to delete the 42-day requirement from the Bill. Amnesty International published a report entitled &quot;2007: The State of the World's Human Rights&quot;, in which Amnesty's general secretary, Irene Khan, says that fear of immigrants, fear of crime and fear of terrorism are used by states to suppress basic human rights. She develops that argument by saying that giving one group of people security at the expense of other people's rights is bound to fail, and that many anti-terrorist measures and laws have failed because they do not give that point enough consideration. They have</p>
	<p pid="b.370.1/2" class="indent">&quot;done little to reduce the threat of violence...and much to damage human rights and the rule of law&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.370.1/3">I regret to say that that those words are a reflection of what has been happening under this Government in this Parliament for some years now. Although the Government have decided that Ministers will no longer use the term &quot;the war against terrorism&quot;, the need remains to ensure that we continue to feel under threat.</p>
	<p pid="b.370.1/4">We must remember that each and every one of us has a right to freedom, and yet the Government are prepared to weaken it&mdash;a task that is far easier against the background of terrorist and violent threats. Everyone knows that Government policies&mdash;whichever Government they might be&mdash;tend to be created in the tabloid press, and it is difficult to have a meaningful discussion on security and penal policy without sinking deeply into the quagmire of superficial politics.</p>
	<p pid="b.370.1/5">In saying that, I also readily acknowledge that the Government have a very difficult job to carry out. No one here would demur from the view that one of the prime duties of any Government is to ensure the security of their citizens. However, that raises the question of the balance to be struck between that obligation and the rights of the state. That balance is key to this whole debate. As Sir Ian Blair told us in evidence to the Public Bill Committee:</p>
	<p pid="b.370.1/6" class="indent">&quot;Your job is to balance civil liberties against the threat. That is what Parliament is engaged in.&quot;<i> &mdash;&mdash;[Official Report, Counter-Terrorism Public Bill Committee, </i><phrase class="date" code="2008-04-22">22 April 2008</phrase>; c. 22, Q26.]</p>
	<p pid="b.370.1/7">I venture to suggest that today's problems cannot be addressed effectively by simply eroding civil liberties.</p>
	<p pid="b.370.1/8">There has been enough talk about balancing the freedom of the individual with the security of society. Of course that is important and it must be central to our debate. However, many people believe that the scales have tipped far too heavily towards the state's interests, at the expense of guaranteed rights that we have recognised for a century and more&mdash;rights and freedoms that meant that we stood out as an example of a civilised system that provided for the interests of the individual, alongside the interests of the society or state. That used to be the situation, at any rate.</p>
	<p pid="b.370.1/9">We saw that keeping individuals under lock and key without going to court was inflammatory in Ireland and that it led to an intensification of the problems there in the 1970s and 1980s. I am not saying that the proposal for 42 days equates to internment, but clearly the same tensions come into play, negating rights that were guaranteed and increasing the number of those who turn to violence. It appears that the Government have simply not learnt the lessons of history. I regret to say that that failure could be very expensive, although I hope that I am wrong about that.</p>
	<p pid="b.370.1/10">To be fair, the Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing has attempted to create a consensus on the issue over the past few months, and his office has been open to Opposition Members. The Bill contains some things that are helpful and acceptable, and they will be supported alongside certain safeguards. However, I am afraid that those on both sides of the Public Bill Committee came to the conclusion that there were misgivings about the Bill and about the mistakes made.</p>
	<p pid="b.370.1/11">The Minister of State did his best to build a consensus, so it is surprising to think that a consensus had been built up over the past two years on the 28-day limit. Many of us who were vehemently opposed to 90 days were eventually persuaded, pragmatically, to fall in line with 28 days. Now, a mere two years later, that consensus has sadly disappeared. One must ask whether there is now a compelling and urgent reason to revisit that decision&mdash;a decision of the whole House that was arrived at by consensus. Sadly, I do not think that such a case has been made at all, and I say that with respect to the Minister of State and the Home Secretary. In all the discussions that we have had in the past seven or eight months, we have not seen any evidence whatever to justify the move, let alone any compelling and/or urgent evidence.</p>
	<p pid="b.370.1/12">Several people have been quoted in this debate and several Committees and non-governmental organisations have been referred to. I shall avoid all that, as it can be taken as read. However, it is telling that both the Home Secretary and Sir Ian Blair say that there have been no cases in which the full 28 days were necessary. I have no desire to reel off all the quotations&mdash;I am sure that they are on the record&mdash;but hon. Members should think of the perfectly innocent people who are brought in and arrested. There seems to be an awful presumption among some people in the House that everybody who is arrested is, by definition, guilty. Good God, we have not reached that stage yet, and I hope that we never do.</p>
	<p pid="b.370.1/13">We must also think about something that has not been mentioned hitherto&mdash;the effect of keeping an innocent person under lock and key without advising them of exactly what charges they are facing. I have represented clients as a solicitor and a barrister. I have seen innocent people in custody being questioned for three or four days and it has left an indelible mark on several of them. It has caused psychological problems in some cases. Let us magnify that up to 42 days and see where we go from there. How will those people's nearest and dearest feel when they return home totally innocent, but wrecked psychologically?</p>

Does he agree that raising questions about compensation almost makes the situation worse, not least in respect of people who have been kept in custody for murder and then released without charge? The whole thing will bring further chaos into the situation. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is wrong to suggest that compensation can somehow make up for six weeks of someone's life and the changes to it that those weeks will bring?</p>

	<p pid="b.372.9/1">That is absolutely right. Offering compensation seems to me a tacit admission that there is a fault with the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.372.9/2">I mentioned pragmatism earlier. Let me be perfectly honest and say that, despite my regard for civil liberties, if proper, urgent and telling evidence had been produced of the need to bring in the proposed law, I would seriously have had to reconsider the position, take off my civil libertarian hat or wig and start thinking carefully. However, nothing of that sort has been produced, including during the whole period of the Public Bill Committee. I have heard nothing to persuade me even the slightest way towards the Government's view. We know that the Law Society has made its view clear, as has the Joint Committee on Human Rights. As I said, I shall not mention the various bodies that have provided evidence, but I stress again that when it comes to evidence, I have seen nothing of a persuasive nature.</p>
	<p pid="b.372.9/3">When the Home Secretary was interviewed on Radio 4 a few months ago, she admitted that she had no idea at all how many days were required. I intervened on the right hon. Lady earlier, but I am none the wiser. If, as we are told, the alleged plots are becoming more and more complex to unravel, why is the magic figure now half that of the previously recommended 90 days? Can anyone explain that?</p>
	<p pid="b.372.9/4">In evidence to the Public Bill Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-22">22 April</phrase>, Sir Ian Blair said:</p>
	<p pid="b.372.9/5" class="indent">&quot;There is no magic figure; that is absolutely fair.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.372.9/6">He went on:</p>
	<p pid="b.372.9/7" class="indent">&quot;Our job is to suggest that sooner rather than later something will happen that will make 28 days insufficient. The Government have suggested 42 days and that is a matter for Parliament to consider.&quot;<i> &mdash;&mdash;[Official Report, Counter-Terrorism Public Bill Committee, </i><phrase class="date" code="2008-04-22">22 April 2008</phrase>; c. 21-22, Q26.]</p>

	<p pid="b.373.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is making a powerful case. Does he agree that, under this procedure, arresting someone who was a terrorist could be a disaster for the anti-terrorism campaign, because there might be no evidence or knowledge of what that terrorist had been up to? They might not know the network and all the other members of it would be alerted by that single arrest. Evidence would then get destroyed, which would make things very difficult.</p>

	<p pid="b.374.3/1">Indeed it does.</p>
	<p pid="b.374.3/2">I shall deal briefly with the safeguard&mdash;the parliamentary scrutiny. It is a complete fig leaf and a waste of time, for two main reasons. If we are given merely an outline of the case and the need for an extension on the view of the Secretary of State, Parliament will nod it through and vote yes. What if the matter goes to appeal and a court says no? Where will we be at that point? That is one of the problems involved with dressing Parliament up in a quasi-judicial function&mdash;a constitutional experiment that is doomed to failure.</p>
	<p pid="b.374.3/3">On the other hand, if we are given all the details, as we arguably should be if we are to supervise the thing properly and scrutinise it, that will make a fair trial impossible. In the rush to try to get Back Benchers on board, the Government have made a complete mess of this part of the Bill. It is not even logical, let alone workable. It is nothing other than a fig leaf and, in the words of the Joint Committee on Human Rights,</p>
	<p pid="b.374.3/4" class="indent">&quot;a virtually meaningless safeguard against wrongful exercise of the power.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.374.3/5">Justice said:</p>
	<p pid="b.374.3/6" class="indent">&quot;By definition, pre-charge detention is detention in circumstances where no evidence has been offered to charge a suspect with a criminal offence. No amount of additional parliamentary or judicial scrutiny can hope to overcome the fundamental lack of fairness caused by detaining a suspect without charge for ever increasing periods of time&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.374.3/7">This part of the Bill is flawed. I have not touched on some of the opinions of various informed people on whether it is compliant with human rights, but I will not go down that road now. I know, however, that the Government have their opinion, and it is a moot point to say the least. Whatever we legislate and whenever we legislate, we should do it proportionately. This part of the Bill is not proportionate in any way. It is bad law, it has no evidential basis, it is unconstitutional and it is downright wrong. It has no place in any modern democracy.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2008-06-11b.374.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1425" speakername="Gordon Marsden" colnum="374"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080611/debtext/80611-0015.htm#08061189001335">
	<p pid="b.374.4/1">I want to focus on new clause 20 and amendment (a). Like many Members, I was a teenager in the 1970s. I was thoroughly aware&mdash;as we all were&mdash;of the terrible events involving the IRA in Northern Ireland, and, of course, the appalling miscarriages of justice suffered by the Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four. Similarly, like so many others here, at the time of both 7/7 and 9/11 I had friends and associates in the eye of the storm. Those experiences, and the history of legislation generally, have convinced me that we must do our best not to legislate in hot blood, and not to make hasty decisions in particular circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="b.374.4/2">I do not mean in anything that I say today to decry anyone's commitment to security or liberties, or to be soft on terror. This is not some macho or self-righteous exercise. Equally, however, I do not want the Bill to become a victim of mission creep, as has happened in other contexts recently. Two or three years ago, for instance, we passed legislation relating to the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 which, in my view, is potentially going down that road.</p>
	<p pid="b.374.4/3">That is why I want to concentrate on new clause 20. It is because we prize liberty so much that the nature and scale of the threat, and the triggers to it, are so important. They are important not merely to the making of a case to convince us here today or the House of Lords tomorrow, but because they must convince, and appear appropriate to, the broader communities in the country&mdash;not just ethnic communities, but others&mdash;who must be kept on board in any democracy and in any legislation that we pass. Public scepticism about politics and politicians will always be prevalent, and is arguably more prevalent now than for many years. That is why we need to go the extra mile to convince people, and to spell out why the Government want this reserve power.</p>
	<p pid="b.374.4/4">Ideally, I should like to hear more details from Ministers about the links between what might happen here in the United Kingdom and what might happen overseas. There has been some reference to that this afternoon, but I want to hear more. As for the broader issue of the sort of incident that would cause the reserve power to kick in, the Home Secretary has given a number of further details, both in response to an interesting and useful intervention from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2031" name="Bob Spink">the hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase> and in the letter to the Joint Committee on Human Rights.</p>
	<p pid="b.374.4/5">Let me return to one of the central questions that have danced around today's debate: the question of whether we as parliamentarians would have a role, or a right to take a view, were the reserve power to kick in. I heard what was said by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1628" name="Andrew Dismore">my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore)</phrase>; I have also spent some time trying to follow the twists and turns of the various reports from the Joint Committee and the most recent letter that he has received from the Home Secretary. I agree with him that our discussion has featured many red herrings, many misleading comparisons between inappropriate jurisdictions, and the bandying of many not very robust and, frankly, intellectually dishonest arguments by Members on both sides of the debate. However, I must say, with all respect to my hon. Friend and his Committee's report, that just as I do not want the Bill to lead to mission creep, I do not want to see it result in judicial creep. One of the issues that we must address this afternoon is the oxygen of publicity, and how it will affect any reserve powers given to the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.374.4/6">I am not a lawyer, but I am an historian, and I know something&mdash;although perhaps not as much as I should&mdash;about the doctrine of the separation of powers. I am rather mystified by the blithe assumption made by several hon. Members that we have a great doctrine of the separation of powers in this country. We certainly do not have it as it exists in the US.</p>
	<p pid="b.374.4/7">There is an enormous inconsistency in this matter, especially among some Opposition Members. They often complain that Parliament does not have a strong enough role in legislation, but when we are given a stronger role, they seem unwilling to take it up. It is not a question of excluding judges and lawyers&mdash;indeed, we have been given chapter and verse today about how they will have a role in the process&mdash;but I do not believe that they should be in the driving seat on this issue.</p>

	<p pid="b.376.0/1">As a Conservative, I do not subscribe to the separation of powers, but I do subscribe to the independence of the judiciary and to the need for a fair trial process. The problem is that that process could be hampered by our debates in this House, and I have heard nothing from the Government that provides any reassurance about that. I do not see how we can carry out the scrutiny that the Government are offering so temptingly without interfering with the fairness of the trial process that occurs thereafter.</p>

Of course we must speak up for our constituents and respect the principle of sub judice when we make representations on their behalf, but we also have a duty to represent what we believe to be their views and concerns at times of national crisis. Each Member of Parliament has the ability to do that, and we must exercise our power in that respect when such matters come before the House.</p>

That is a common theme on both sides of the House, and I do not want to have to tell my Blackpool constituents that we have outsourced all our deliberations on important matters to the lawyers, good though the lawyers may be. I believe that the Government have offered considerable movement on these issues, and that both the safeguards that they have put in place and the reserve powers are significant. I remind the House of the Roman adage that the safety of the people is the supreme law. That law must always weigh heavily in the balance when we discuss changes in civil liberties and in procedure.</p>

	<p pid="b.377.0/1">I regret to say that I do not share <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1425" name="Gordon Marsden">the conclusion drawn by the hon. Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Marsden)</phrase>. I shall vote against the Government&mdash;not because I am soft on terror or because I fail to recognise the seriousness of the threat, but because I believe that the Government's proposals are profoundly mistaken, and that they are wrong in both principle and practice.</p>
	<p pid="b.377.0/2">Much of what I might have said has already been eloquently expressed by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1565" name="Christopher Huhne">my hon. Friend the Member for Eastleigh (Chris Huhne)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1608" name="David Davis">the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis)</phrase>. In approaching this matter, we all have a responsibility to show independent judgment, and we must exercise that judgment in striking a balance between the competing interests of security and individual freedom. If I have a criticism of the debate so far, it is that the second of these interests has formed a smaller part of our proceedings than I would have wished.</p>
	<p pid="b.377.0/3">When I look across at the Labour Benches, I am reminded that for a long time Labour Members voted against the renewal of prevention of terrorism legislation so far as it applied to Northern Ireland. In 1987, after I was elected, I participated in the votes on that. In those days, Labour voted against, but then, lo, there came out of the north-east a new young shadow Home Secretary from the constituency of Sedgefield, and he persuaded his party that instead of voting against, abstention would be sufficient. My point is that Labour Members did all that through exercising their independent judgment, and we too must exercise that when the matter currently under discussion goes to the vote. My objection to the Government position has been echoed by many Members in our debate: they have simply failed to prove the case at this time for the extension of the period of detention that they seek.</p>
	<p pid="b.377.0/4">I do not rely on the judgments of others. That is a kind of political card game: &quot;You play your Lord Stevens, and I'll play my Lord Falconer, and what did Lord Goldsmith have to say about this?&quot;&mdash;or Lord Carlile, for that matter. Such judgments may be persuasive, but they are by no means determinative of the positions we must take.</p>
	<p pid="b.377.0/5">I would have had more respect for the Government if they had been willing to put their case simply, frankly and bluntly. I am not against consultation, but the scurrying around of the last few days and weeks has been demeaning to the Government, and also to Parliament. Compensation for miners is, no doubt, an extremely important issue, as is raising the economic blockade of Cuba, but what the devil have they got to do with the prevention of terrorism in the United Kingdom? Also, from where have come the allegations of Danegeld for the Democratic Unionist party? I hope that none of these stories is true; I hope that they are all the product of fevered imaginations. However, if they are part of what is necessary for the Government to have their legislation, I suspect that they are not a price worth paying.</p>
	<p pid="b.377.0/6">I will vote against the Government because any time any Government seek to diminish the freedoms that are the cornerstone of our system, it is our duty collectively and individually to hold that Government to account and to subject them to the most rigorous scrutiny. That duty transcends all our other responsibilities; it is our primary duty. It is the constitutional reason why we are sent to this place, and, if I may be excused sounding somewhat flippant, I should say that it has nothing to do with the communications allowance, nothing to do with how many prepaid envelopes we use, and nothing to do with seeking to be regarded as the constituency MP of the year. Our job is to hold the Government to account and to scrutinise them as rigorously as we can. When what they are seeking to do interferes with the liberty of the citizen, that duty is even more important than it normally is.</p>
	<p pid="b.377.0/7">That duty transcends the credibility, and even the survival, of the Prime Minister. This debate and the vote that we will have in due course should not be about whether he is strengthened or weakened, because the issue is whether the rights of our citizens are strengthened or weakened by what we do in this place. I shall vote against the Government, because I think that the so-called concessions are&mdash;to use less elegant language than the Joint Committee on Human Rights did&mdash;political boiler plate.</p>
	<p pid="b.377.0/8">The concessions leave far too much to the discretion of the Home Secretary, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1394" name="Dominic Grieve">they are&mdash;as the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve)</phrase> has pointed out in several telling interventions&mdash;complicated to the point of incomprehensibility and ambiguity, and they blur the distinction between the responsibility of Parliament and the administration of justice. If we make a judgment that it is necessary to introduce the reserve power, and if that judgment is based on the circumstances surrounding an individual case, we inevitably become engaged in the administration of justice. The inferences that may be drawn from either a willingness or an unwillingness to accept the Government's case could be substantial in the subsequent disposal of the case against that person. I have searched my memory, and searched elsewhere, but I can think of no other instance when the House of the Commons has been called on to pass legislation based on individual circumstances after criminal proceedings have been commenced against an individual. If that is not a novel constitutional doctrine, I do not know what is.</p>

	<p pid="b.378.1/1">Of course, and that point has been made by some of those who have been cited in the debate as having experience, and as therefore being people to whom we should pay attention.

	<p pid="b.379.0/1">On the subject of Parliament considering individual cases, is it not inevitable that Members of this House will either be given so much information as to prejudice any trial, or so little as to make any responsible decision making impossible?</p>

	<p pid="b.379.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right; indeed, the Home Secretary gave the game away earlier today when she said, &quot;Trust me.&quot; Of course one starts with a presumption in favour of trusting the Home Secretary, but such trust has not always been justified in every Home Secretary who has occupied that Front-Bench post since I first entered this House, and it is not likely to be justified in every future case. Parliament can exercise an informed judgment only if the information is put before it. If the information is put before Parliament in sufficient quantity, and it is of sufficient quality to enable it to exercise that judgment, that raises precisely the point that the hon. Gentleman makes: that the prejudice to the individual may be overwhelming.</p>
	<p pid="b.379.1/2">Once freedoms of the kind that we are debating are removed or even diminished, they are not easily recovered. We should never imagine that what we now take for granted was handed out by benevolent monarchs or by altruistic Governments. They were won. Sometimes they had to be seized physically, and sometimes they could be seized by political or other methods. But they had to be acquired, because the natural acquisitiveness of the Executive means that it takes power to itself as often as it can. If we give the power back, how difficult will it be to restore the freedoms and the personal liberty that we regard as so important?</p>
	<p pid="b.379.1/3">It is not right to legislate on the basis of what might be. It is much less right to legislate on the basis of what might be when that involves an attack on freedom and liberty. The reason why I was a little disparaging about Stevens, Falconer, Goldsmith and Carlile was that we should not be moved by the opinions of others. On an issue of this kind, we should be moved by our own judgment, and that is why I will vote against the Government.</p>

	<p pid="b.379.2/1">As has been said throughout this debate, the first duty of Parliament is the safety of the realm. It is because I believe that the proposals on 42-day detention will make us less safe, not more safe, that I oppose them. I do not take terrorism lightly. I am a Londoner and I heard the last major IRA bomb, at Canary Wharf, from my kitchen in east London. Like thousands of Londoners, I waited for the early-morning call that assured me that friends and family on their way to work and school had not been caught up in those bombings. I will not take lectures from Ministers about not taking terrorism seriously.</p>
	<p pid="b.379.2/2">I do not believe, as Ministers continue to insist, that there is some trade-off between our liberties and the safety of the realm. What makes us free is what makes us safe, and what makes us safe is what will make us free. I ask the House to reflect on how we got here. Two years ago, this House emphatically rejected the proposal for 90-day detention. I do not talk very much about custom and practice in Parliament, but it is custom and practice that when the Government lose a vote on a proposal, they do not bring back a similar proposal in the same Parliament. My hon. Friends in the Whips Office now know why that is so: it is because losing the vote is a clue that the Government do not have the votes. The Government machinery has devoted 10 days to bone-crunching pressure on potential rebels, again because they do not have the votes. Ministers have appeared in the media saying that they have won the argument. They may win the vote, but they have emphatically not won the argument.</p>
	<p pid="b.379.2/3">Two years ago, the House rejected the 90-day proposal. The issue should never have come back, and all this high drama has been caused by bringing back something that the House has already rejected. I voted for 28 days, but I remind the House that I and others did so only under duress. We believed that by voting for 28 days the debate would be finished for this Parliament and an upper limit would be established. Some of us were unwilling to go as far as 28 days. That is why we are so upset that the Government have come back with this proposal, reneging&mdash;as far as we are concerned&mdash;on a tacit understanding that voting for 28 days would finish the debate on this issue for this Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="b.379.2/4">Why have the Government come back with this proposal? Speculation has raged on the Labour Benches as to what has moved the Prime Minister to take this dangerous course. Some people say that he wants to try to do something that Tony Blair could not do. Some people say that he is driven by the polls. Some people say that last year he saw an article in <i> The Sun</i> that said that he was soft on terrorism and he has been heading down this path ever since.</p>
	<p pid="b.379.2/5">In reality and despite everything that Ministers say, nothing has changed since two years ago. The arguments that they used then about computers and complications are the arguments that they are using now. I ask Ministers to spare the House those arguments about decrypting computers. The law exists to deal with people who wilfully refuse to decrypt computer evidence.</p>
	<p pid="b.379.2/6">The Government came back with a proposal that the House rejected two years ago. Interestingly, when they did so it then took them several months to come up with a time limit. Was it to be 29 days, or 30, or 40? At one point, some of us offered to put our hands in a hat and to draw out a number for the Home Secretary. They did not have a number of days because this is not an objective, evidence-driven Bill. It is the purest politics. It is about the polls and about positioning. It is about putting the Conservative party in the wrong place on terrorism. I put it to colleagues that we should not play ducks and drakes with our civil liberties in order to get a few months' advantage in the opinion polls. We have got here through a process that involved the wrong practical politics and was wrongly motivated.</p>
	<p pid="b.379.2/7">Let me remind the House of what is problematic about the proposal. The security services have unusually gone public and said that they are not calling for the change. The Director of Public Prosecutions, unusually, has gone public and said that he is not calling for it. I remind the House that he is the prosecuting authority. We will hear from Ministers about the police, but the police are split on the subject. We have heard about Sir Ian Blair&mdash;whose days might be numbered under the former Member for Henley; hey, that's life&mdash;but the most senior Muslim policeman in the Metropolitan police force, Tarique Ghaffur, has said privately and emphatically that he believes that the risk to community cohesion of the proposal is not worth any marginal operational advantage. It is alleged&mdash;I use that word because I do not want to abuse parliamentary privilege&mdash;that he was called in by Sir Ian Blair and asked to consider his position. The police are split on this subject. Let us hear no more about the police as a whole being behind the proposal.</p>

	<p pid="b.381.0/1">Will my hon. Friend take account of the fact that even those chief police officers who have expressed some kind of support have done so in terms of &quot;it could be workable&quot; rather than &quot;it is desirable&quot;? Everything could be workable&mdash;Buchenwald and Dachau were workable, but they were hardly desirable.</p>

	<p pid="b.381.1/1">Yes, it was said that the proposals could be workable in the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.381.1/2">There are some very clever lawyers in the Chamber today, and it seems to me that much of the debate is locked into the legalities and technicalities. I come at the matter from a slightly different angle. It seems to me that, if someone is in detention for six weeks without knowing why, and they therefore have no notion of whether they will be able to get out without being charged, that detention is coercive in itself. We saw in the big miscarriage of justice cases what people will sign after only a few weeks.</p>
	<p pid="b.381.1/3">The possibility of compensation which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1674" name="Keith Vaz">my right hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz)</phrase> is trying to float will put pressure on the police to charge. Some of my colleagues whom one might expect to be opposed to the change because of its effect on their communities have been seduced by the compensation package, but I have read the letter. It talks about going away and considering the subject, and says that the compensation might be implemented. How will it be sustainable to compensate Muslims for being held for more than 28 days when the police have held them completely lawfully and not to compensate others of whatever religion or ethnicity who have been held for seven, eight or nine days and have not been charged? The compensation package will not survive scrutiny by the courts.</p>
	<p pid="b.381.1/4">If my hon. Friends want to vote with the Government because they want to be loyal to the Prime Minister in his time of trial, they should do so. No one will think less of them for that. But they should not vote with the Government on the basis of a shoddy compensation package that will not stand up and will never come into being.</p>
	<p pid="b.381.1/5">The proposal is problematic. Some colleagues say that the provision will never be used and some say it is unworkable, so why not vote for it? They say that it is just a joke and will never be used, but even if the Government never use the provision I take exception to their saying that it is worth driving a coach and horses through our civil liberties for mere short-term political advantage.</p>
	<p pid="b.381.1/6">As I said earlier, because the Government do not have the votes, they have spent the past 10 days putting good, conscientious colleagues&mdash;who naturally enough want to support the leader of their party, our Prime Minister&mdash;under incredible pressure. People whom the Prime Minister has never spoken to in his life have been ushered into his presence twice in 48 hours. The House should have a shred of sympathy for them. People have been offered Cuba, and no doubt governorships of Bermuda have been bandied about. Any rebel Back Bencher with a cause is confident&mdash;if they vote the right way of course&mdash;that the Prime Minister will make the statement, give the money or make the special visit. That is humorous, but is it right that our civil liberties should be traded in such a bazaar? Is it appropriate or right that we should trade votes at the United Nations on the basis of such political pandering?</p>
	<p pid="b.381.1/7">The reason why the Government have had to put such pressure on people is because they cannot muster the votes. They have only one argument that could sway me, as a member of the Labour party for more than 30 years: the leader of our party is in a difficult situation, there are elements in the party that do not necessarily wish him the very best, so is this the time to vote against the Government?</p>
	<p pid="b.381.1/8">That argument could affect people who are loyal to the Prime Minister, do not want to see him go and do not believe that a new leader can wave a magic wand, but I tell the House this: I became active in politics in the 1980s, at a time of enormous turmoil&mdash;there were riots in Brixton, Liverpool and Bristol, &quot;Scrap sus&quot; was a huge issue and young black men were seen as the enemy within, just as young Muslim men are today. I came into politics because of my concern about the relationship of the state to communities that are marginalised and suspected. It is easy to stand up for the civil liberties of our friends or of people in our trade union, but it is not easy to stand up for the civil liberties of people who are unpopular, suspected and look suspicious&mdash;people the tabloids print a horror story about every day. However, it is a test of Parliament that we are willing to stand up for the civil liberties of the marginalised, the suspect and the unpopular.</p>
	<p pid="b.381.1/9">I came into politics about those issues, and I believe that if there is any content at all in Ministers' constant speeches about community cohesion we must offer every part of our community not just the appearance but the reality of justice and equality before the law. Everybody knows that the provisions will impact disproportionately on the Muslim and ethnic minority communities. Everybody knows that we shall not be detaining the Saudi paymasters of terror for 42 days; just as happened under internment, we shall be scraping up the flotsam and jetsam of communities. Ministers are talking about people such as my constituents, so when Muslim boys and black converts are in prison and their mothers, some of whom may not even be able to speak English properly, come to me and say, &quot;They have had my son for five weeks and nobody will tell me why&quot;, what do Ministers suggest I tell them about a measure that has been brought in only for short-term political convenience?</p>
	<p pid="b.381.1/10">I did not come into politics to vote for such a stratagem, and despite all the current pressures on the party I will not vote for it. The case has not been made up until now and it has not been made in this debate. Of course the public are in favour of the proposal. Of course the people whose rights some of us are trying to defend are unpopular and suspect. But if we as a Parliament cannot stand up on this issue, and if people from our different ethnic communities cannot come here and genuinely reflect their fears and concerns, what is Parliament for?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2008-06-11b.383.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1719" speakername="David Davies" colnum="383"  time="016:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080611/debtext/80611-0016.htm#08061189001350">
	<p pid="b.383.0/1">I have the near impossible task of following one of the finest speeches I have heard since being elected to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1604" name="Diane Abbott">the House of Commons. The hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott)</phrase> need not fret: we will not be on the same side on many issues, although we are on this one. In the Home Affairs Committee and in the Public Bill Committee, I approached the subject with a very open mind. I have not been shy about expressing my view in the House that we need more people locked up in prisons; I have even argued with my Front-Bench colleagues on the subject. We need prisoners to serve longer sentences, and we need a lot more prisons to be built to house them all. I add one important caveat: people should not be locked up in prisons or police cells unless they have been charged and convicted of an offence. That is absolutely fundamental to the liberties of people in this country.</p>
	<p pid="b.383.0/2">When the Home Affairs Committee took evidence, and in the Public Bill Committee, it became obvious that the Government have not properly thought out their case. They were setting all sorts of constitutional precedents that some people have not considered. For example, I think it important that if a public servant, whether they be a police officer or in the security services, believes that a certain measure will be required, it should be up to them to make a case to a Minister, and up to the Minister to make the case to colleagues on both sides of the House. Too many times in the Select Committee and the Public Bill Committee we saw that the Government were not prepared to make the case for themselves; they expected public servants to come to the House of Commons and make the case for them. That is absolutely unacceptable. If the Government cannot make the case themselves, there is no case to consider.</p>
	<p pid="b.383.0/3">We have seen the selective way in which the Government have used the evidence that was put before them, and their selective quoting of the Home Affairs Committee report on the 42-day limit. There was not unanimous support for an extension beyond 42 days. The Conservative and Liberal Democrat Members on the Committee did not support it. Essentially, we said that if there was to be an extension beyond 42 days, there would, of course, have to be safeguards. We went along with that, rather unwillingly, so that there could be some form of consensus, and so that we did not have to divide the whole Committee on the issue. We said that although it would have to be amended, the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 could be used in some form instead of the so-called safeguards that the Government came up with, to which I shall turn in a minute.</p>
	<p pid="b.383.0/4">I was not in Parliament when the decision was taken to invade Iraq. I suspect that I would probably have gone along with the consensus, had I been there, because I have always thought that those bright people of all parties in Parliament must know more than me, even though my gut instinct told me that the invasion was wrong. I even trusted Tony Blair when he said, &quot;Trust in me.&quot; I have learned the hard way that we should never trust Ministers or assume that people in positions of power are any better than us.</p>
	<p pid="b.383.0/5">I did not appreciate the way in which the evidence that the Home Affairs Committee heard was twisted and turned by Ministers. On one of the first times that the Director of Public Prosecutions gave evidence to the Committee, he made it absolutely clear that he was against an extension beyond 42 days, yet his words were twisted and turned. We met the director general of MI5, and I met a senior member of one of the security services. They spoke to us in confidence, but now that a statement on pre-charge detention has been published on MI5's website, it is fair to say that we knew months ago that MI5 was not calling for the measure, yet we had to listen while Ministers gave a different impression. We have heard lots of quotes from Sir Ian Blair, and that is reasonable enough, but we did not hear about all the other senior police officers, such as Sir Paul Condon, who did not believe that any sort of extension was justified. Throughout the process, the Government have quoted selectively.</p>
	<p pid="b.383.0/6">The fact is that the issue comes down to something very simple: if the police have enough evidence to arrest somebody, they must have something tangible to go on. I can say that as a serving police officer. A police officer cannot simply go around arresting people without any evidence that they have done something wrong, and rightly so. Of course, it might take a little while to get together enough evidence for a charge. I am sure that in the past there was a temptation to get as much evidence as one possibly could, so that the strongest possible charge could be bought, but in some ways, the case for doing that has been removed, because we are to implement post-charge questioning&mdash;a measure that all my colleagues and I fully supported. That part of the Government's case no longer arises. As Sir Ken Macdonald said to us, if within 28 days enough evidence cannot be found to bring some charge against someone, any prosecution is likely to be very unsafe.</p>
	<p pid="b.383.0/7">Many colleagues have spoken about the Civil Contingencies Act and the fact that we would have the longest detention in the western world. I shall not add to that, as I want to allow others an opportunity to speak.</p>
	<p pid="b.383.0/8">One would have to be sentenced to more than three months in prison to serve 42 days, because of early release, release on tagging and all the other Government initiatives to turf genuine criminals out of prison. Somebody who has been held for 42 days or longer without charge would have done the equivalent of a prison sentence of more than three months. What is the latest proposal that the Government have come up with today to try to make those people feel better? &quot;Okay, we arrested you at 5 o'clock in the morning, quite possibly at gunpoint, took you off, kept you there for 42 days, didn't even tell you why we had you in there, but here's some money. Don't worry about it. You were innocent, but have some money&quot;&mdash;as if that will make anything better.</p>
	<p pid="b.383.0/9">I challenge the Minister. If he is serious about the Government's proposal, perhaps he will say a word about Lotfi Raissi. He was the trainee pilot who was held in detention in Belmarsh for about five months, and was released in 2002, his career in ruins. He has been fighting ever since for compensation. If the Government are serious about compensating people and they have a compensation package, perhaps the Minister will tell us what he will do for that gentleman, who was held for five months without any charges being brought against him.</p>
	<p pid="b.383.0/10">The Government have relied on emotion to try to get their case across today. They have not relied on facts. I am glad to be able to differentiate myself from rebels on the Government Benches by saying that if they wanted to do something about terrorism, they have had plenty of opportunity. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1816" name="Philip Davies">They could, as my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley (Philip Davies)</phrase> said, have done away with the Human Rights Act, which has given so much succour to terrorists. It has allowed people who we know have been involved in terrorism to come into this country. The Government have then found that they are prevented from deporting them, prevented from putting them in prison until they go back, and prevented even from keeping them in their own homes while tagged&mdash;all because of the Human Rights Act.</p>
	<p pid="b.383.0/11">The Government tried to blame the judiciary, yet they brought in the Human Rights Act, which allowed the judiciary to do that. They could get rid of the Human Rights Act in a matter of weeks, if they wanted to. They could insist that people who come to this country learn our language and start to integrate, instead of allowing them to set up their own communities and maintain practices that are unacceptable in this country, such as forced marriage, polygamy and female genital mutilation, to which a blind eye is being turned by the Government. They should insist on integration, getting people to learn our language and getting them to fit in with our culture and traditions, rather than passing legislation that will do away with the liberties that British subjects and citizens have enjoyed for hundreds of years.</p>
	<p pid="b.383.0/12">Just as King John had to be brought to book by the barons and the lords when they brought in the Magna Carta in 1215, if we lose the vote tonight I hope that, once again, the Lords will come to our rescue&mdash;the rescue of the liberties of British people.</p>

	<p pid="b.385.0/1">It is a pleasure, I think, to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1719" name="David Davies">the hon. Member for Monmouth (David T.C. Davies)</phrase>, whose constituency I look forward to visiting. We will be able to explore his predilection for Taser guns in every home, as part of the Home Affairs Committee inquiry into 21st century policing. On a more serious note, I shall be quick and curtail my remarks, as a number of colleagues on both sides of the argument wish to make important contributions.</p>
	<p pid="b.385.0/2">I speak as a member of the Home Affairs Committee and a member of the Public Bill Committee, so I have had a good go at the issue. I also speak as the constituency Member for Reading, West, a diverse constituency with a substantial and active Muslim population, a constituency that contained one of the people who were blown to smithereens in the 7/7 London bombings, and a constituency on which the extensive and successful Operation Overt by the Metropolitan police impacted.</p>
	<p pid="b.385.0/3">Why legislate now? That is one of the crucial questions that has rightly come up in the debate. There are three issues. The Prime Minister mentioned at Prime Minister's questions today that we have a moment of calm. We can trade quotes in the debate, but we can all probably agree that when the House seeks to legislate in a hurry, it makes a pig's ear of it, whether that is legislation about the poll tax, the Child Support Agency, or dangerous dogs. Whatever it is, when we try to legislate in a hurry, particularly in the face of a tabloid outcry over bodies being pulled out of the latest terrorist outrage, we tend not to make the right decisions.</p>
	<p pid="b.385.0/4">Why legislate now? We must be up front about the fact that this is a precautionary measure. As the Chairman of the Home Affairs Committee said, all of us on the Committee, of all parties, accepted that there was no evidence that the police and the security services were not coping adequately at this time with 28 days' pre-charge detention. We were clear about that. The question is whether we wait until they are not coping adequately with it to legislate, or legislate on a precautionary principle and in an atmosphere of calm.</p>

	<p pid="b.386.1/1">I am not taking interventions. Other hon. Members want to speak and the hon. Gentleman has only just come into the Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="b.386.1/2">It is, by definition, a little too late if we wait until the point at which the police and security services are not coping with the period of pre-charge detention. It is a little too late if we end up letting somebody out of custody who is then responsible for an outrage against the people whom we represent.</p>
	<p pid="b.386.1/3">In considering my attitude to the issue and how I would vote, I have a simple starting point. The first duty of any Government is the defence of their people. Yes, it is the defence of the liberties of the people, but it is also the defence of the rights of potential victims. We need to consider three issues. One is the complexity of current terrorist networks, the second is the level of risk to the UK and the third is whether what is being proposed is likely to help in any way, shape or form.</p>

	<p pid="b.386.5/1">I regret taking that intervention. The Government have doubled resources for the security services and a record amount of resources are going into counter-terrorism work. However, the hon. Gentleman brings me to my point on the complexity of the challenge facing SO15, the Metropolitan police counter-terrorism unit. He himself as a member of the Committee, if he has read his papers, will have seen the SO15 statistics.</p>
	<p pid="b.386.5/2">In 2004, some 19,000 exhibits were retrieved and registered in terrorist investigations. They rose to 51,000 in 2005 and to 68,000 in 2006. Statements, messages and documents created rose from 33,000 to 62,000 to 83,000 to 91,000 last year. Action and lines of inquiries created rose from 16,000 to 28,000 to 40,000 to 42,000. Total records for legal consideration and disclosure rose from 69,000 right up to 197,000 in 2007. There is absolutely no doubt that terrorist networks have become more sophisticated and adept at using information technology and the latest techniques available, first to avoid surveillance, secondly to communicate with each other and thirdly to commit atrocities. We have to be cognisant of that fact. It is a matter of public record that in 1997 the UK security services seized just 19 mobile phones, one computer and seven computer discs in their terrorist investigations. Ten years later those figures had risen to 16,000 mobile phones, 353 computers and 2,541 computer discs. Yes, we can increase resources, no, we should not deny the fact that terrorist technology is on the march.</p>
	<p pid="b.386.5/3">The Home Affairs Committee has been party to private briefings from the security services. We know that there have been a substantial number of plots. We know that about 200 groups and 2,000 individuals give the security services cause for concern. Those numbers are going up, not down. I find it ironic that the shadow Home Secretary is happy to praise the professionalism of the police and the security services in foiling those plots, and we join across the Floor of the House in praising them for that, but when it comes to questioning their professional judgment, somehow we are not so keen to praise their professionalism and to take their advice. That led the Home Affairs Committee, in two separate reports, to a series of conclusions. In June 2006, before I and the hon. Gentleman who just intervened joined the Committee, it, under the excellent chairmanship&mdash;it is excellently chaired now&mdash;of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1827" name="John Denham">my right hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham)</phrase>, now the Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills, came to the following conclusion. Looking at the Government's case for 90-day detention, which was not particularly strong in my view, the Committee concluded:</p>
	<p pid="b.386.5/4" class="indent">&quot;None of the evidence we have reviewed of current and recent investigations would have justified a maximum detention period longer than 28 days.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.386.5/5">The Committee went on to conclude, however:</p>
	<p pid="b.386.5/6" class="indent">&quot;We believe...that the 28 day limit may well prove inadequate in future.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.386.5/7">That was in June 2006. It was the starting point for the extensive Home Affairs Committee inquiry that has just concluded.</p>
	<p pid="b.386.5/8">Both Front-Bench teams have, in exchanges across the Dispatch Box, referred to the acceptance of a case for exceptional circumstances. I am not praying in aid the motives of my Conservative colleagues on the Committee; I do not believe for one moment that they saw their names being attached to that recommendation as praying in aid a case for extension to 42 days. I am very happy to put that on the record, but the Committee accepted that there was a case for exceptional circumstances, as did Liberty and, I have to say, the Conservative Front-Bench team when it suggested that amending the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 could deal with exceptional circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="b.386.5/9">Let us read into the public record what was agreed by all parties:</p>
	<p pid="b.386.5/10" class="indent">&quot;If, in these exceptional circumstances, a temporary extension of the pre-charge detention period is deemed essential to secure successful prosecutions of terrorist suspects, the Government should consider building support for proposals that effectively reform the powers of the CCA, secure Parliamentary scrutiny and judicial oversight, but stop short of the requirement to declare a full-scale state of emergency.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.386.5/11">One reason why the Committee rejected the use of the 2004 Act was that it would be, frankly, ludicrous&mdash;this was the advice that we got from the police&mdash;for us to endorse an approach that declared a full-scale state of emergency in order to give the security services the powers that they might need to apprehend people who were the cause of that full-scale emergency.</p>
	<p pid="b.386.5/12">We were right to reject the CCA and we were right to listen to people such as Peter Clarke. I shall quote people who have supported my argument and people who have contradicted it. Peter Clarke, the former national co-ordinator of terrorist investigations, said on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-03">3 June</phrase> that</p>
	<p pid="b.386.5/13" class="indent">&quot;critics claim that the proposal is a draconian extension of police powers. It is not. Detention would be a judicial discretion, to be exercised following an adversarial hearing with both sides legally represented. This would be no rubber stamp.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.386.5/14">Justifying the point about a precautionary principle, he went on to say that</p>
	<p pid="b.386.5/15" class="indent">&quot;we should legislate now, and not in panic in an emergency.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.386.5/16">Sir Ken MacDonald has been oft-quoted in the debate. He was very honest: he made it clear that he did not see the case for going beyond 28 days at this point. But he said that the proposed legislation</p>
	<p pid="b.386.5/17" class="indent">&quot;would be compatible with the European convention on human rights and I think that it would be Strasbourg-compliant.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.386.5/18">That is significant. He indicated a willingness to use the legislation because, he said, it was his job not to see the Bill into law but to use the tools available to him. He said:</p>
	<p pid="b.386.5/19" class="indent">&quot;I am quite satisfied that this provision would be lawful. As I have said, if it was in law, we would use it if we ever found it necessary to do so.&quot;<i> &mdash;&mdash;[Official Report, Counter-Terrorism Public Bill Committee, </i><phrase class="date" code="2008-04-22">22 April 2008</phrase>; c. 57, Q149.]</p>

	<p pid="b.388.0/1">Did Sir Ken not also say that he thought that it would be very hard indeed for the CPS to bring any prosecution against somebody who had been held for between 28 and 42 days but not been charged with anything until the 41st day?</p>

	<p pid="b.388.1/2">The last person I wish to pray in aid is the Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, Hugh Orde. Hon. Members should bear his comments in mind, because we have considerable experience in tackling terrorism in Northern Ireland. Only a couple of days ago, he said:</p>
	<p pid="b.388.1/3" class="indent">&quot;Sadly the day will come when the number 28 is important as it will not be high enough. It may not be today or tomorrow but we have to plan for it. The overwhelming majority of cases to date fall well under the current limit. But come the day when we face such an assault, we must have the right powers available. Powers that have been debated and thought through right now, and not after an outrage. For that will be too late.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="b.388.3/1">I am happy to be selective in the quotes from Hugh Orde that I use for the purposes of my argument.</p>
	<p pid="b.388.3/2">Safeguards are built into the Bill. Hon. Members have criticised the Home Secretary's proposal as having been watered down or made unworkable; I am not sure which way they are seeking to cut that argument. It is a precautionary proposal for temporary powers. It is dependent on the Director of Public Prosecutions, himself a sceptic, coming forward, together with the relevant chief constable, with a certificate to say that there is a need for those powers in the first place. We are now to get a vote after seven days. What meaningful debate could we have after seven days? During my time here, we debated the Prevention of Terrorism Acts in this House for a number of years. When we were deciding whether to extend the exceptional powers in the PTA, we did not discuss individual republican or loyalist terrorist atrocities&mdash;we discussed the state of the security situation and whether the state required those powers in order to keep people safe. After the Glasgow and Haymarket bombings, we had a perfectly good debate in this House on a statement by the Home Secretary. We had people arrested; we did not fall foul of the sub judice rules; and we were intelligent enough to have a debate without compromising the subsequent criminal prosecutions. That is exactly the debate that we would have in this regard.</p>
	<p pid="b.388.3/3">Let me end with two points. First, it is true that the current proposal could have an impact on community relations, but I have been around my multicultural community for long enough to know that the greatest and most detrimental impact on community relations occurs if a bomber gets through&mdash;that is when the damage is done. Secondly, if the police and the expert witnesses that we have heard before the Home Affairs Committee are right, a bomber may get through at some point in the future. I do not want hon. Members' fingerprints on a vote that might mean that at some point in the future we release out on to the streets someone who will go on to do us and our communities harm.</p>

	<p pid="b.389.0/1">I will not follow the normal custom and say that it was a pleasure to listen to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1774" name="Martin Salter">the speech by the hon. Member for Reading, West (Martin Salter)</phrase>, because there were so many things fundamentally wrong with it that it is not worthy of comment.</p>
	<p pid="b.389.0/2">I would like to touch briefly on two or three aspects of the Bill that deserve our further attention. My greatest fear is that if we pass the measure on 42 days, we are in effect doing the terrorists' job for them. Let us be clear about this. We all accept that terrorism is a threat to this country and to our liberties&mdash;that cannot be disputed. However, this proposal assaults our hard-won civil liberties and the common law of this land. We have already heard many excellent arguments against it. The lack of evidence is one such argument. It is telling that the Government cannot produce one piece of concrete evidence to substantiate their claim that 42 days are required. The intelligence services took the unprecedented step of making a statement saying that they had not called for an extension to 42 days. The Director of Public Prosecutions has already said that he cannot support it either. There is no evidence whatever in support of the proposal.</p>
	<p pid="b.389.0/3">We have also heard how the introduction of 42 days' detention could be counter-productive. I intervened on <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1608" name="David Davis">my right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis)</phrase> on the question of internment because I served in Northern Ireland during the 1980s, when that practice had come to an end, but when we were still picking up the pieces from that disastrous policy. I want to impress on the House just what a disastrous policy it was. It was completely counter-productive. It turned whole communities against us, and the recruitment of terrorists was made so much easier when people in those communities had suffered because of the policy of internment. I know that there are differences between the two circumstances, but the differences are not so great that parallels cannot be drawn for the purposes of today's debate. The bottom line is that people were taken off the streets, put away and not charged because it was thought that they might be a threat. That created a great deal of resentment, which in the end, caused even more bloodshed and loss of life. I ask the House to think very carefully before we go down that road. If we want to engage communities, and to counter terrorism and the threat of terrorism, taking someone off the streets and putting them away for 42 days without charging them is not the way to do it.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2008-06-11b.390.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1948" speakername="Paul Goodman" colnum="390"  time="017:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080611/debtext/80611-0017.htm#08061189001363">
	<p pid="b.390.0/1">If my hon. Friend reads the Government's new clause 20&mdash;one of the apparent concessions&mdash;he will see that the new power that they seek could be applied abroad. It does not merely apply to the United Kingdom, but to threats of terrorism to property abroad. That does not sound much like grave and exceptional circumstances to me.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2008-06-11b.390.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1409" speakername="John Baron" colnum="390"  time="017:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080611/debtext/80611-0017.htm#08061189001364">
	<p pid="b.390.1/1">My hon. Friend makes a valid point. The provision is far-reaching in its consequences and we have to take that point on board.</p>
	<p pid="b.390.1/2">We have heard about international comparisons, but, as ever, the Government have failed to address the fundamental point that other common law countries across the globe do not need more then one week for pre-charge detention. Why do we need six in this country? Why are our police forces so incompetent&mdash;that is the only conclusion one can draw from the Government's measures&mdash;that they need six times longer than most other police forces in other common law countries? Again, no case has been made by the Government. Their argument against Liberty's figures is even weaker when one considers that the Government have admitted, at the Dispatch Box and in written parliamentary answers, that they have not undertaken a similar comparison. They have done no research of real worth on the matter. The force of their argument that such comparisons are not valid does not stand up to the test of scrutiny.</p>
	<p pid="b.390.1/3">Another of my concerns is the suppressed premise in the background to the debate that, deep down, many people are afraid that a suspect released too soon might use their freedom to commit an atrocity. Supposedly, 42 days' detention is needed to prevent another 7/7. But that argument is completely misguided. The purpose of the 42-day proposal is to prolong an investigation after a plot has been discovered or is suspected. It is not to prevent it. The police, the authorities and the security services already have enough powers to deal with an imminent terrorist strike. They do not need those powers; prevention is not the purpose of the 42 days. For one thing, the police could charge a suspect with acts preparatory to terrorism. Meanwhile, surveillance and intelligence gathering could and would continue if a suspect was released back into the community. So let us scotch once and for all the idea that 42 days' detention is needed to prevent another terrorist outrage. That is not its sole function.</p>
	<p pid="b.390.1/4">Briefly, I also take exception to the argument that, because the police have come close to the existing limit on a number of occasions, it is incumbent on the House to allow more time for holding suspects without charge. It might be that sufficient information was obtained earlier and that the police were holding a person for the sake of further questioning, given that post-charge questioning is not generally possible. However, simply because time is used does not mean that it is needed.</p>
	<p pid="b.390.1/5">As for the safeguards, they are weak to the point of being meaningless. Let us take the judicial safeguards first. The hearing before a judge cannot be a meaningful adversarial process. The range of issues that a judge can consider is limited to whether the investigation is proceeding at a reasonable rate and the likelihood of new evidence being brought forward. That is a very low threshold to cross. A judge will not be asked to consider a suspect's likely guilt or innocence in relation to any specific offence, so the individual in question will not have the opportunity to defend himself. Indeed, he might not even be there. The role of the courts is to judge evidence in relation to an offence, not to supervise a police investigation.</p>
	<p pid="b.390.1/6">As for the parliamentary safeguards, the mechanism proposed is both illogical and inappropriate. It is illogical when triggered in response to an individual case, because the higher pre-charge detention applies to all suspects held under anti-terrorism legislation, even if their case does not justify such an extension. The mechanism is also inappropriate, because it is not the role of Parliament to assess whether an individual should be deprived of their liberty, as has been mentioned on a number of occasions. Hon. Members should not be asked to instigate procedures to try to fulfil that function.</p>
	<p pid="b.390.1/7">Would we allow, for example, an accused person to come to the Bar of the House and put his side of the story? The last time that occurred was in the 1950s. Are we going to instigate such a procedure again? I do not think so. Would we have secret sessions, to allow the security services or a Minister to present their case freely? That has not happened since the second world war, and I see no proposals on the Table for it to happen again. The proposed safeguard is almost worthless and meaningless.</p>
	<p pid="b.390.1/8">In truth, no concession or safeguard is likely to be adequate, because to detain someone on the basis of suspicion alone is a fundamental breach of liberty. It is, effectively, to reverse the presumption of innocence in English common law. We have to ask ourselves why it is that we need 42 days. My concern is that, for the reasons set out in what has, overall, been an informed and intelligent debate this afternoon, we risk doing the terrorists' job for them. There is no evidence to suggest that the measure is needed. The international comparisons would suggest that we are making a big mistake if we extend from 28 days. We also risk making the mistake of producing a Bill that would be counter-productive in trying to solicit information from the communities from which we need help.</p>
	<p pid="b.390.1/9">For all those reasons, I urge the House not to extend to 42 days&mdash;to dig in deep and realise that our hard-won civil liberties cannot be traded in on the back of Government misinformation and evidence that is simply not there. I urge the House to give that great thought indeed.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2008-06-11b.392.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1589" speakername="Mark Durkan" colnum="392"  time="017:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080611/debtext/80611-0018.htm#08061189001365">
	<p pid="b.392.0/1">Many hon. Members have made the point that a number of the protections offered alongside the extended power of detention do not add up to very much. That is true&mdash;they add up to less than the sum of their supposed parts. This chicane of hollow protections brings a new dimension to the notion of chicanery.</p>
	<p pid="b.392.0/2">In relation to the Secretary of State's power to activate the extended detention provisions and the question of independent legal advice, proposed subsection (1) of new clause 32 would require the Home Secretary to get legal advice only &quot;as to whether&quot; she &quot;can properly be satisfied&quot;. It does not provide that she should be properly satisfied, referring only to &quot;whether&quot; she is. The Home Secretary is not obliged to follow that legal advice. Proposed subsection (6) sets out the duty to publish the full legal advice, but subsection (7) completely ousts that duty if the Secretary of State believes that such publication would not be in &quot;the public interest&quot;. If the independent legal adviser does not agree to the edited version that the Secretary of State wants, none of the advice has to be published. So much for that protection.</p>
	<p pid="b.392.0/3">What of this House acting in the role of a grand jury? It will do so in circumstances that will at least be triggered by a specific case, although the effects of the extension will not then be case-specific, as they might affect everyone already detained and anyone subsequently detained within that period. That is what the House will be doing. We could be brought back during a recess&mdash;the Bill provides for a recall of Parliament&mdash;yet people are saying that we should deal with these matters only in a calm and reasonable atmosphere, not in reaction to the heat of situations. This could even happen during an election campaign. We saw bombs in Madrid during an election campaign and people know about the political fallout there; they know that there were doubts about how the Government handled, played with and interpreted that situation at the time, and the issues ricocheted through the body politic.</p>
	<p pid="b.392.0/4">We should think about the situation here if we vote for this Bill and the new clauses. We could be creating a situation in a which a terrorist group can deliberately contrive that its plot comes to the proper notice of the police and security services during an election. Hon. Members will be called to this place; some will have seen constituents arrested, and there will be others whose constituents could be affected by the new powers that had been triggered. Their communities will say, &quot;What are you doing for us? We are told that there is significant parliamentary scrutiny and we have been put into the hands of MPs. You stand up and fight for us, and assert our rights.&quot; If they do not do that, what will happen? That could happen close to an election or during one&mdash;and we do not expect it to ricochet in a dangerous way through the electoral politics of different constituencies?</p>
	<p pid="b.392.0/5">Different MPs could be caught. An MP in one constituency might say to his constituents, &quot;Sorry, I am a Government MP and I have to go by what the Home Secretary says. I have every sympathy with you, but there is nothing I can do or say.&quot; Another MP might say, &quot;Well, I opposed that legislation and I will fight it now that it has been activated.&quot; In what position does that leave individual MPs? It leaves them in a completely invidious situation that no legislator, no public representative and no candidate should ever be in. Yet if we allow this Bill to go through, we will be inviting that sort of dangerous scenario, because the measures provide for the recall of Parliament during an election campaign.</p>
	<p pid="b.392.0/6">There is another respect in which the protection is hollow. We are told that the courts will be involved, and some hon. Members have assured us that there will be adversarial proceedings in the courts. Yes, there will be adversarial representatives, but there will not be any evidence. What is proposed is pre-charge detention before evidence is presented. The courts have never refused an extension of detention so far; never ever have they done so, and how, essentially, could they?</p>
	<p pid="b.392.0/7">This chicane of hollow protections adds up to very little. The protections are not only dubious, but dangerous. The thrust of these Government provisions is dangerous. They create a situation that will lead to the exercise of undue powers in unseemly and improperly controlled ways.</p>
	<p pid="b.392.0/8">On detention of up to 42 days, we have seen in the past how people have confessed to all sorts of things that they did not do even with seven-day detention. We should think of the Guilford Four and then the Maguires, who were brought in on the basis of what members of the Guildford Four had said. They were not even brought in to be questioned originally and they did not confess. What others were forced to say about them led to their being brought in.</p>
	<p pid="b.392.0/9">In the case of 42-day detention, will not people not only be in danger of saying all sorts of things about themselves to line themselves up for charging, but be in a position to say all sorts of things about others, in a context where this power will be used in all sorts of other ways? This power will end up, in practice, taking on all sorts of gross and ugly proportions that its supporters underestimate. They seem to think that it will be used in very limited ways, that it has only a limited trigger and that it has only limited application. That is not what the Bill says.</p>
	<p pid="b.392.0/10">We will see communities being fundamentally alienated from the state. We have had chief constables quoted at us the last couple of days. Let us just think what good community constables will say when this power is activated and a portcullis comes down between them and the communities that they have been working with, building contact and confidence. They will find themselves compromised and ashamed simply because, as police officers, they are arms of the state that has behaved in this gross way, leaving people not only resenting what has happened to some, but fearing what will happen to others.</p>
	<p pid="b.392.0/11">We have seen how counter-terrorism powers have been counter-productive in the past. That is the experience of Northern Ireland. It is not just internment; it is the litany of counter-terrorism measures that created that culture of alienation, the propaganda weapons and real new and additional victims.</p>
	<p pid="b.392.0/12">I warn the Government and those who would support them in the madness that is in this Bill: do not feed what you want to fight and do not destroy what this House ought to defend.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2008-06-11b.393.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1824" speakername="David Heath" colnum="393"  time="017:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080611/debtext/80611-0018.htm#08061189001366">
	<p pid="b.393.0/1">I return to something that was said a long time ago by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1710" name="Elfyn Llwyd">the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd)</phrase>: the Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing did a good job in Committee&mdash;I served on it&mdash;in trying to bring the various parties together on the vast majority of the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.393.0/2">There is a great deal of consensus in the House on how we fight terrorism. Sometimes when we have this highly charged debate, we forget that. Is there a threat from terrorism? Yes, of course there is. I was on Capitol hill in Washington DC on 9/11. I was in Aldgate on 7/7. I do not need persuading that there is a threat from terrorists. <i> [Interruption.]</i> I tell hon. Members on the other side of the House that I understand their concerns.</p>
	<p pid="b.393.0/3">However, is there a need for further powers to fight terrorism effectively? Yes, there is. We have agreed the things that need to be done&mdash;the lower-order offences, the offence of acts preparatory to terrorism, the lowering of the threshold for prosecution, the post-charge questioning that forms part of the Bill and intercept evidence, which the Chilcot review is, I hope, providing is admissible evidence&mdash;and the legislation to require the provision of a key to encrypted material ought to be the answer to the question of how we deal with encrypted material within the period required.</p>
	<p pid="b.393.0/4">Is there an increase in the number of complex cases? I am persuaded that yes, there is. My answer to that is something that was decried earlier: we must provide more resources. I know that more resources have already been applied to the problem, but if there is a need for more interpreters, let us pay for more interpreters, pay for more police officers and have sufficient resources to do the job quickly. However, when I come to the question whether there is a case for this extension to six weeks' detention without a charge being placed, I do not agree and there is no consensus because it is unjustified, unfair, unworkable and profoundly unhelpful to our fight against terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="b.393.0/5">I heard the Home Secretary ask earlier, &quot;How would we feel if somebody was released after 28 days and they then committed an offence on the 29th, 30th or 31st day?&quot; I ask how she would feel if, under her proposals, that happened on the 43rd, 44th or 45th day. There will be no limit to this auction of time for detention without charge if that argument is sustained.</p>
	<p pid="b.393.0/6">I do not want to go into the issues of comparability with other jurisdictions&mdash;it is difficult to compare even common law jurisdictions, let alone those that operate on the continental pattern&mdash;but it worries me not that we are so far out of kilter with other common law jurisdictions, although we are, but that we are so far out of kilter with our history, our traditions as a country and how we maintain British justice.</p>
	<p pid="b.393.0/7">I see no justification for what the Home Secretary has presented as a safeguard&mdash;the interpolation of Parliament into a judicial process. It is a most extraordinary proposition that this House should be empanelled as a sort of grand jury. Some say that it will not be dealing with the specifics of a case, but it will, because of the way in which the new clauses and amendments are worded. They require evidence to be put before the Secretary of State in relation to the progress of a specific case, and they require her to present it to the House in as far as she can.</p>
	<p pid="b.393.0/8">The proposition is extraordinary because it defies jurisprudence, constitutionality and any concept of the illusory separation of powers, which we could debate at length. The House would be required to adjudicate on whether the Home Secretary was right in her assertion, but to do so either on the basis of evidence that would render the security services inoperable in the future or, more probably, without that evidence&mdash;perhaps on the basis of a dossier, and we all know what happens when the House decides matters on the basis of a dossier. We would thus be doing nothing more than rubber-stamp, or decide whether we liked the sound of the Home Secretary on the day when she presented the evidence to the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.393.0/9">At one point, the Home Secretary said &quot;Trust me.&quot; I am sure we are often happy to trust her, but that is no basis on which to change essential liberties in this country, and essential elements of our criminal justice system. I want us to have consensus on the fight against terrorism, and I think we established a sort of consensus on 28 days, although it was not my choice; I saw it very much as a temporary expedient to avoid the adoption of 90 days. It worries me that all the noddy heads that supported 90 days are the same noddy heads that now support 42 days. There is a strong contention to be made that those noddy heads would support any number put before them by the Home Secretary.</p>
	<p pid="b.393.0/10">Let me say to the Government that it is not too late, even now, to avoid the defeat that is inevitable&mdash;if not here tonight, as I hope, at the other end of the Corridor later&mdash;and to reach the proper consensus that the country needs in order to fight terrorism effectively.</p>

	<p pid="b.395.0/1">I apologise for my late arrival. I did not arrive until after the opening speeches had begun, because I had to deliver a keynote address in Paris to a seminar on Afghanistan run by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.</p>
	<p pid="b.395.0/2">I remind the House that in 2005 I escaped having to make a decision on the 90-day limit because I was Chairman of the Committee considering the Bill in question, and found no cause to exercise my mind strenuously in that direction. I remember distinctly saying to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1900" name="David Winnick">my hon. Friend the Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Winnick)</phrase> &quot;David, why do you go winnicking on about 28 days?&quot; He thought it rather unkind at the time, but I think he has since found the courage to accept my feeble attempt at humour.</p>
	<p pid="b.395.0/3">It gives me no joy or satisfaction to oppose this proposal, but it seems crazy to me. When the 42-day limit was first proposed, I thought &quot;We agreed to 28 days when they wanted 90 days. Why, when they want to extend the limit again, do they not ask for 90 days again?&quot; That led me to examine the proposal more carefully, and to understand the logic behind much of the argument that we have heard today.</p>
	<p pid="b.395.0/4">I do not want to go into the niceties of the legal terminology. That was done brilliantly by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1628" name="Andrew Dismore">my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore)</phrase>. He referred not only to some of the legal mistakes, but to a range of options that have apparently been rejected&mdash;which is a great shame, because if we were serious about these proposals they could have provided us with a solution.</p>
	<p pid="b.395.0/5">Apart from the standard briefings from the agencies professionally engaged in these considerations, I have received only one representation from a constituent who supports the 42-day proposal. All the other constituents who have got in touch have opposed the measure, but today I received a text on my mobile. I cannot switch it on, Mr. Deputy Speaker, as you well know, but I can reveal the contents of the message. My constituent has asked me not to oppose the Government because of the danger that doing so would pose to the three marginals in Teesside.</p>

	<p pid="b.396.1/1">I will give way when I have finished my point, which is not humorous. Marginals should not enter this debate, as we are not here to talk about the political advantages or disadvantages of the proposal. This is a matter of principle.</p>

	<p pid="b.396.2/1">I thank my hon. Friend for giving way. My constituency of Sedgefield is adjacent to his constituency of Stockton, North, and our constituents are very similar to each other. I have undertaken a survey over the past few days, in which I asked about 3,000 of my constituents about the principle involved in this matter. Some 80 per cent. of respondents have told me that they support the Government. Has he done anything similar? How does he know that he is speaking on his constituents' behalf?</p>

	<p pid="b.396.3/1">In one way that is a fair question, but it is totally unfair in another way. Any survey is based on a question that can be formulated in all sorts of ways to favour one answer over another. I can tell my hon. Friend that I have not conducted a survey, but I am telling the House about the nature of the e-mails and letters that I have received. There has been only one exception to the trend, and I have reported that as well.</p>
	<p pid="b.396.3/2">We are talking about the reaction among constituents, and I had better clear up a misunderstanding caused by one of my earlier interventions. I have frequently referred to the reservoir of resentment that will likely be created by the adoption of the proposed measures. Indeed, that reservoir of resentment has been created already, as is shown by the increasing incidence of suspect plots that has been described already. My fear is that extending detention without trial even further will cause that reservoir of resentment to increase in size. The impact will be felt as a result of what we do tonight, not before.</p>
	<p pid="b.396.3/3">I turn now to some of the pressures that have been brought to bear on me in the past week. The suggestion has come from certain quarters that I have adopted the approach that I have set out because I want to take &quot;revenge&quot; for my &quot;treatment&quot;&mdash;both words are precise quotations&mdash;since 1997. Anyone who thinks that must have a mind so small as to be barely visible with a microscope.</p>
	<p pid="b.396.3/4">It has also been suggested that I wish to bring down the Government. However, I have been deselected already, so for me to try to bring the Government down now would mean that I was trying to declare myself redundant two years ahead of time. The pressure that has been applied to me shows the desperation that the Government have been feeling, but I see that the Whips are smiling and so I assume that the pressure that they have exerted in other quarters has been effective.</p>
	<p pid="b.396.3/5">The Jesuits taught me that there could be no compromise with error. I think what we are considering tonight could become an error. I entered the House 25 years ago this week, and at that time I decided to reject the use of the word &quot;right&quot;, because of its connotations with the phrase &quot;right wing&quot;. I did not want to be referred to as right wing when I was correct, so I rejected that word in favour of the term &quot;proper&quot;. I shall, however, have to break that resolution this evening, because we are talking about rights; we are talking about the right of the individual&mdash;of a man or a woman, old or young, black or white&mdash;to be innocent until proven guilty. When we make our decision tonight, we must let right be done.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2008-06-11b.397.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1844" speakername="William Cash" colnum="397"  time="017:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080611/debtext/80611-0018.htm#080611121001833">
	<p pid="b.397.0/1">In a nutshell, the problem is as follows. The proposals before us contain a procedure for Parliament to be involved in the process, which is extraordinary, because ultimately, what we are debating is the question of habeas corpus. That is why I tabled new clause 39. I am deeply concerned that although in any particular case a suspect has to be produced before a judge within 48 hours, under the arrangements of the Bill the whole process of habeas corpus will be severely restricted. It may not be a total suspension&mdash;great mistakes were made in the nineteenth century in respect of the coercion Act and the suspension of habeas corpus&mdash;but we must ensure that we achieve what my new clause proposes, which is that nothing in this Bill shall prevent or restrict a person detained</p>
	<p pid="b.397.0/2" class="indent">&quot;from making an application to a Justice of the High Court&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.397.0/3">and that there</p>
	<p pid="b.397.0/4" class="indent">&quot;shall be a condition of the detention that the person detained shall be produced forthwith to&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.397.0/5">that justice,</p>
	<p pid="b.397.0/6" class="indent">&quot;who shall enquire as to&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.397.0/7" class="indent">(a) the circumstances of the detention;</p>
	<p pid="b.397.0/8" class="indent">(b) the enquiries that are being made;</p>
	<p pid="b.397.0/9" class="indent">(c) the likelihood of the detained person being charged within 42 days&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.397.0/10">if the provision specifying that extended period is passed&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.397.0/11" class="indent">&quot;of any offence of terrorism or related serious indictable offence.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.397.0/12">Furthermore, if the justice is not satisfied with the inquiries made,</p>
	<p pid="b.397.0/13" class="indent">&quot;that person shall be released forthwith&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.397.0/14">I am not deeply concerned about the number of days; I do not think that that is the crucial question. What is fundamental is the relationship between the person being detained and the procedure of habeas corpus in respect of the judge. That key issue has not been properly discussed. We have witnessed what has effectively been a game of political football over this question. It is far too important for that. It is absolutely crucial that we maintain habeas corpus.</p>
	<p pid="b.397.0/15">I know that other Members wish to speak and that the Home Secretary will need to make some final remarks, so I shall conclude by simply saying that the most important writ available to the English courts is habeas corpus. It has been clearly stated that</p>
	<p pid="b.397.0/16" class="indent">&quot;<i> Habeas corpus</i> is probably the oldest of the prerogative writs. Authorising its issue in appropriate cases is regarded by all judges as their first duty, because we have all been brought up to believe, and do believe, that the liberty of the citizen under the law is the most fundamental of all freedoms. Consistently with this, an application for a writ of <i> habeas corpus</i> has virtually absolute priority over all other court business.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.397.0/17">However, it is only available when there is a question of illegal detention, and the arrangements under this Bill will, effectively, restrict the application of habeas corpus.</p>
	<p pid="b.397.0/18">The most important constitutional authorities have suggested that the Supreme Court Act 1981 should be amended to ensure that habeas corpus is added to the forms of relief, so that it runs at least parallel to the other alternatives. I do not believe that judicial review under the Human Rights Act is the right way to proceed.</p>

	<p pid="b.398.0/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a very important point, and I undertake to look very carefully at his new clause and to talk further with him about how we can be assured that the principles that he has outlined will be carried forward in our proposals.</p>
	<p pid="b.398.0/2">Hon. Members have spoken passionately today about the importance of getting the right balance between national security and individual liberty. I applaud the conviction with which hon. Members have expressed their views. Parliament has shown again how it is a most formidable defender not only of our liberties, but of the protections that we need to have in place to ensure that all in Britain can enjoy those liberties. For precisely that reason, the reserve power that we seek in the Bill will be subject throughout to the most searching parliamentary safeguards, in addition to having to meet high legal thresholds.</p>
	<p pid="b.398.0/3">It is because we understand the value of individual liberty that we believe that the power should be held in reserve, for use only if we need it in exceptional circumstances and only for a temporary period, just as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1674" name="Keith Vaz">my right hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz)</phrase>, who is not now in his place, has argued. He and other hon. Members have also rightly emphasised the importance of the impact of our actions on communities; we must always be aware of that community impact. In addition to the investment that we announced last week, we will review the impact of our counter-terror legislation on our communities, but we are clear that terrorists target all communities, regardless of faith or race, and that our legislation is designed to protect all communities, regardless of faith or race.</p>
	<p pid="b.398.0/4">It is not after we pass a piece of legislation in this House that Muslim children get bullied in the playground or that young Muslim men feel unable to travel on the tube without getting suspicious glances. Such situations occur in the wake of events such as 9/11 and 7/7, where not only do the criminal actions of a violent and extreme minority cause death and destruction, but they can cause recriminations, unfairly and wrongly, against those communities. That is what we need to safeguard against, and that is what our provisions are aimed at.</p>
	<p pid="b.398.0/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1608" name="David Davis">The right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1565" name="Christopher Huhne">the hon. Member for Eastleigh (Chris Huhne)</phrase> have made much today of an allegation that in the case to which reference has been made, where two people were detained for up to 27 or 28 days and then subsequently charged, somehow it would have been possible to charge them before the 27th or 28th day. Others have scandalously referred to that as being &quot;sexed-up&quot; evidence. The claim that there was sufficient evidence to charge suspects after four and 12 days but the charging decision was somehow delayed is a slur on the Crown Prosecution Service and on those who investigated that case. The CPS must charge a person at the earliest possible point, and that happened in this case. The Director of Public Prosecutions has said:</p>
	<p pid="b.398.0/6" class="indent">&quot;When the material is sufficient, and the prosecutor...believes that a charge should be laid, it will be laid. The idea that we have sufficient evidence after 14 days, but...wait until 26 or 27 days to charge is wrong.&quot;<i> &mdash;&mdash;</i>[<i> Official Report, Counter-Terrorism Public Bill Committee, </i><phrase class="date" code="2008-04-22">22 April 2008</phrase>; c. 55, Q141.]</p>
	<p pid="b.398.0/7">Of course, nobody can be detained unless the detention is needed for the purposes of gathering evidence, and we have been clear about that in the Bill. The judge would not agree to continued detention unless it was needed and he was satisfied that the investigation was being carried out diligently and expeditiously. So, alongside a scandalous slur on the police officers carrying out that investigation and on the prosecutors who worked day in, day out to bring a charge, there is also a suggestion that the judges themselves made the wrong decision.</p>

Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis)</phrase> made no slur on the police or the Crown Prosecution Service. He made a statement of a number of facts about when the evidence was available, and I note that the Home Secretary has not challenged those in any way. Those were the only points that he made and he went out of his way to say that he was not suggesting that the overall period of detention was in some way wrong, merely that on the fourth and 12th day that evidence had been available. If the Home Secretary disagrees with that, perhaps she will tell the House that my right hon. Friend is wrong.</p>

	<p pid="b.399.1/1">The clear implication of what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1608" name="David Davis">the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis)</phrase> said was that people could have been charged earlier. That is fundamentally wrong, and what is more, he has had personal assurances from senior police officers that that was not the case.</p>
	<p pid="b.399.1/2">We have also rightly heard concerns about the circumstances in which people would be detained. People have claimed that detainees would not be able to see their families, or that they would not have cooling-off periods. That is wrong. Anybody detained will be told on arrest the grounds for that arrest. Any hearings for extended detention would include specific details of the investigation. Those detained may receive visits from friends, family and others likely to take an interest in their welfare. In any 24-hour period, the detainee must be allowed at least eight hours for rest, free from questioning, thus providing the cooling-off period that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1565" name="Christopher Huhne">the hon. Member for Eastleigh (Chris Huhne)</phrase> suggested did not exist. Detainees should be offered exercise, and cells must be cleaned, heated and ventilated. To suggest that those things would not happen, as some have done, is also wrong.</p>
	<p pid="b.399.1/3">A further misconception in this debate&mdash;and a disappointment to me&mdash;has been the suggestion that there can be no appropriate role for Parliament in this process. I have understandably been challenged about what Parliament will be able to debate in such circumstances. First, contrary to the contention advanced by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1709" name="Robert Marshall-Andrews">the hon. and learned Member for Medway (Mr. Marshall-Andrews)</phrase>, the statement made by the Home Secretary to Parliament will need to be clear that a grave and exceptional terrorist threat has occurred or is occurring. New clause 32 makes it clear that legal advice with which the Home Secretary can properly be satisfied will need to be made available to Parliament in order to support that debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.399.1/4">Parliament will be able to debate the general security threat; the progress of the investigation; the police numbers involved; the number of suspects detained; the outline of the plot; the what, why and when; the number of countries involved; whether the Home Secretary's decision was properly founded; and whether she had indeed received reports from the police and the DPP. That would be a full debate. I believe in the role of Parliament, and we have embedded that safeguard in our proposals.</p>

	<p pid="b.400.1/1">I explained earlier the type of grave and exceptional threat that would be necessary, and I have explained how Parliament could test that.</p>
	<p pid="b.400.1/2">I hope that hon. Members will agree that in this House we should always rely on force of argument and the rule of law to counter terror. Today hon. Members have heard the arguments, and we have all now to make a decision on the protections that we need to ensure that the rule of law continues to run. The British people place their trust in us to take the right decisions to protect them. I cannot and will not wish away the threat from those whose aim and sole intent is to blow up our citizens, of all races and religions, on our streets.</p>
	<p pid="b.400.1/3">When it comes to dealing with terrorism, my view is straightforward. We cannot simply hope for the best. We must have plans in place that mean that we can cope with the worst. The question that everybody needs to answer is whether they are confident that no police investigation would ever need to hold somebody for longer than 28 days. I greatly prize consensus. It has motivated me in bringing these proposals. However, important as consensus is, I prize the interests of Britain's security above it. We should do the right thing to protect our people, and that is what I am asking the House to support me in this evening.</p>

	<p pid="b.424.2/1">On Saturday, I attended an open-air protest meeting with more than 100 driving instructors, complaining about the closure of Wellingborough driving test centre as a result of the Government not getting a derogation from European Union law. I would like to present their petition, which states:</p>
	<p pid="b.424.2/2" class="indent">To the Honourable the Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in Parliament assembled.</p>
	<p pid="b.424.2/3" class="indent">The Humble Petition of residents of the Borough of Wellingborough and surrounding areas,</p>
	<p pid="b.424.2/4" class="indent">Sheweth</p>
	<p pid="b.424.2/5" class="indent">That the Government is forcing the closure of the Wellingborough Driving Test Centre which is a loss of another public service to the local area. Wellingborough is part of the South Midlands and Milton Keynes Core Spatial Strategy and is expected to expand by between a third and a half in the next few years. Driving instructors and pupils will have to travel to Kettering Driving Test Centre, 9 miles away. This will cause inconvenience, increased CO2 emissions, additional cost and annoyance to the residents of Kettering.</p>
	<p pid="b.424.2/6" class="indent">Wherefore your Petitioners pray that your Honourable House urges the Secretary of State for Transport to reconsider her decision to close Wellingborough Driving Test Centre.</p>

	<p pid="b.425.2/1">A Government ready to rely on those friends of liberty, the Democratic Unionist party, to shred the liberties of our own people are almost by definition unembarrassable, but I hope this evening to add to the issues ventilated in a recent Channel 4 &quot;Dispatches&quot; programme to adumbrate the extent to which the tragedy in Somalia, which so many people are now becoming aware of, is another of our Government's dirty little secrets.</p>
	<p pid="b.425.2/2">We must start the story in Ethiopia, where 4 million people, according to the United Nations, are facing starvation and 120,000 Ethiopian children have just one month to live, according to last week's media reports. Television viewers were shocked to see the pictures last week of the widespread suffering redolent of 1984 and the great famine of that year.</p>
	<p pid="b.425.2/3">The US and Britain immediately pledged $90 million in famine relief. Just one week after its appeal to the international community for famine relief, the Ethiopian Government increased their military budget by $50 million to $400 million. The regime in Addis Ababa&mdash;when I knew them in the 1980s, they were pro-Albanian Maoists&mdash;are the most militarised and heavily armed in Africa. They are in a state of perpetual war or preparation for war with one neighbour, Eritrea, and they are supporting anti-Government rebels in Sudan, many believe with western connivance.</p>
	<p pid="b.425.2/4">Most astonishingly of all, the Government of Ethiopia&mdash;that starving country whose little children are fly infested, kwashiorkor swollen, famished and famine stricken&mdash;have been encouraged, armed, trained, financed and otherwise facilitated to invade and occupy their neighbour, Somalia, and create a reign of terror in that land, which is testified to by this voluminous Amnesty International report, which, if I had time, I would extensively quote from.</p>
	<p pid="b.425.2/5">Somalia has lost thousands of dead as a result of the Ethiopian invasion. Millions have been displaced. Somalia, under Ethiopian occupation, is the grimmest prison state in Africa&mdash;far worse than Mugabe's Zimbabwe. Who has done the encouraging, the arming, the training, the financing and the facilitating? The same US and British Governments who donated the $90 million to the same Ethiopian Government who are burning their money and burning the villages, the neighbourhoods and the people of occupied Somalia.</p>
	<p pid="b.425.2/6">This Government are never done talking about the shortcomings of African leaders. Just last week in Rome, the Secretary of State for International Development was roaring at Robert Mugabe, yet there has not been a squeak out of him, or any other Minister, about the much bigger crime in which we are ourselves deeply complicit. Is it any wonder that African opinion considers so much of what we have to say about misgovernance in Africa to be the deepest, most cynical hypocrisy?</p>
	<p pid="b.425.2/7">Two weeks ago, Channel 4's &quot;Dispatches&quot; team took terrifying risks to bring us the latest from occupied Mogadishu. That was undoubtedly an award-winning documentary. It was memorable for many reasons, not least the scene in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office when the Minister of State, Lord Malloch-Brown, his face frozen in horror, was confronted by Aidan Hartley with the central case of the documentary makers. For the benefit of Members who did not see the programme&mdash;the Minister will certainly have seen it; she would hardly be sent out to bat on this wicket without being shown it&mdash;that central case was that, in the grim prison state of occupied Somalia, the fingerprints of our country and our Government were all over the scene of the crime.</p>
	<p pid="b.425.2/8">The President of the puppet regime imposed by the Ethiopian army in Somalia turns out to be British. He spends much of his time here&mdash;well, it is dangerous in Somalia, after all&mdash;and has property and family here. After presiding over a gang of torturers, murderers, grand larceners and extortionists, he flies back to England. Then there is the police chief whose officers kidnap people for ransom, which they extort from people living in our own country&mdash;in Leicester, in Birmingham, in London. They torture people, make them disappear, and kill them if their families will not pay. He too is British. As for the former Interior Minister who presides over an interior of mass refugee camps, starvation and misery, and who stands accused of stealing international aid and diverting food for political purposes&mdash;why, he is British as well.</p>
	<p pid="b.425.2/9">Guess who is paying the wages of the murdering, kidnapping, torturing, quisling police force in Ethiopian-occupied Somalia? That's right: we are. The public dictatorship in Somalia is a very British crime, especially as our own Government&mdash;in particular, that pocket-sized Palmerston to whom I referred earlier, the Secretary of State for International Development&mdash;are so voluble on the subject of other problems in Africa.</p>
	<p pid="b.425.2/10">So how did we get here? How did we get into bed with the former pro-Albanian Maoists of the Government in Addis Ababa? I am afraid that the answer is our old friend, our old acquaintance, the policy of &quot;my enemy's enemy is my friend&quot;. The policy that has got us into so much trouble, from Afghanistan to Iraq and many other parts of the world, is what lies behind this obscene paradox.</p>
	<p pid="b.425.2/11">We are supporting the Ethiopian Government's occupation of Somalia because George Bush told us to: because Somalia is a front line in George Bush's ill-conceived, counter-productive, utterly discredited, &quot;about to be booted out in the United States&quot; so-called war on terror. We were against the former Government of Somalia because they were an Islamic Government, just as we are against the Government in Sudan because they are an Islamic Government, and just as Ethiopia, on our behalf, opposed the Government in Eritrea because they are an Islamic Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.425.2/12">This policy, having been such a disaster around the world, is now in full force in Somalia, and but for Channel 4's &quot;Dispatches&quot; hardly anyone in Britain would know anything about it. No British Minister has come to the Dispatch Box to explain why British taxpayers' money is being paid to a police force in Mogadishu that is accused of kidnapping people and extorting ransom money from British citizens. No British Minister has come to explain&mdash;unless we interpret Lord Malloch-Brown's frozen face as an explanation&mdash;why we are so heavily involved with a puppet regime that is bereft of political and public support in Somalia.</p>
	<p pid="b.425.2/13">This policy of backing anyone whom Bush tells us to back&mdash;this policy of backing anyone who is against those whom we, today, perceive ourselves to be against&mdash;is morally utterly vacuous. Arguably worse than that, however, is the fact that it is a total, dismal failure, as we have found in Afghanistan to our bitter, bitter cost, not least this very week. The very mujaheds whom Mrs. Thatcher's Government lauded, supported and armed are now murdering and killing our soldiers in Afghanistan&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="b.427.0/1">On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. This Adjournment debate was scheduled to begin at 7 pm and last for half an hour. I have spoken for 10 minutes, and the country&mdash;or at least those interested enough to watch on parliamentary television&mdash;will not hear the Minister reply.</p>

	<p pid="b.427.1/1">The hon. Gentleman has misunderstood. The Adjournment debate is now starting, which means that he has so far had bonus time. This is one of the procedures, as far as the House is concerned, we have to go through.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2008-06-11b.427.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1405" speakername="George Galloway" colnum="427"  time="018:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080611/debtext/80611-0023.htm#080611121003486">
	<p pid="b.427.2/1">That is truly magnificent, Mr. Deputy Speaker, as I have plenty to say. Perhaps I will be able to quote Amnesty International in more detail in the time that I did not think that I would have available.</p>
	<p pid="b.427.2/2">This policy is not only morally bankrupt, it is politically disastrous. Afghanistan is the perfect example, but the Ethiopian Government preside over a country where famine and mass starvation stalk the land. They are being helped militarily to invade, occupy and threaten their neighbours. What can that conceivably do for our standing in Africa, or for our credibility when we lecture the Governments of Sudan or Zimbabwe?</p>
	<p pid="b.427.2/3">It would be bad enough if our difficulties in that respect were confined to Africa, but the problem is much worse. The Somalians are the tallest people on earth, but they are virtually invisible, politically, on the international stage and in this country. Yet there are hundreds of thousands of Somalians here, either because they have European Union passports or because they are refugees from the very fighting that we initiated and are now fuelling. Increasingly, young Somalis are furious, bitter and angry. They nurse their wrath as they watch&mdash;on Somali television or other Muslim channels&mdash;the carnage being wrought in their country.</p>
	<p pid="b.427.2/4">Two million people in Somalia are living as refugees, out of a population of 11 million. That is almost a fifth of the total: to scale it up, in our country that would amount to 12 million people. There are another 1 million Somali refugees in neighbouring countries, and God knows how many hundreds of thousands are scattered across the EU.</p>
	<p pid="b.427.2/5">In their bitter exile, the sons&mdash;and may be the daughters too&mdash;of those Somali families are being brought up bitter and furious at the role played by the west in the problems that they see on their televisions screens. We have spent hours this afternoon trying to deal with the problem of terrorism, but we cannot see how that connects with the way that we constantly infuriate young Muslim boys and girls with the double standards and injustices of our policy towards their countries and the countries from which their parents come.</p>
	<p pid="b.427.2/6">We cannot see the connection between the growth of extremism and our actions. The Government are always looking for a cleric or an organisation to ban or to blame for the radicalisation of Muslim youth in Britain. But those young people do not need a cleric or an organisation to radicalise them: they just have to watch the news and see what our Government are doing in Muslim countries such as Somalia.</p>
	<p pid="b.427.2/7">I know that the Minister has seen Channel 4's &quot;Dispatches&quot; programme. She will not claim otherwise, even though she is answering a debate on human rights in Somalia. I hope that she will do a better job than Lord Malloch-Brown did when it comes to explaining how are taxes are being used. Among other things, that tax money could be used to help starving people in Ethiopia. It could be used to keep our pensioners warm in winter or to keep some post offices open.</p>
	<p pid="b.427.2/8">I see that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1765" name="Jim Fitzpatrick">the hon. Member for Poplar and Canning Town (Jim Fitzpatrick)</phrase>, who is Under-Secretary of State for Transport and the Minister responsible for closing post offices, is standing by your Chair, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I hope that that counts as being in the House and that it is therefore in order for me to refer to him.</p>
	<p pid="b.427.2/9">The British tax money that I have mentioned could have been used for a better purpose, but instead it is being spent on the security forces in Somalia, which Amnesty International, as well as Channel 4, accuses of widespread abuses of human rights&mdash;of torture, murder, disappearances, kidnapping, extortion and grand larceny. Why are we allowing the Interior Minister of Somalia to travel back and forth into our country unmolested when he is accused by aid agencies of purloining international aid&mdash;desperately needed emergency aid for hungry people&mdash;for himself and for political purposes for his political clan? Why are the Government not stopping him at the border and questioning him about where the money went that was put into Somalia and has disappeared?</p>
	<p pid="b.427.2/10">Aid agencies will not now, by and large, set foot in Somalia, so catastrophic has the situation there become. I ask the Minister why we are supporting the President, the Interior Minister and the chief of police in Somalia, and allowing them to come and go freely without answering the charges that are being made against them? When will the Government at least condemn the human rights abuses in Somalia? Amnesty has voluminously recorded them, but not a squeak has come from the Government, which has never done roaring at Sudan or Zimbabwe. Why? Because we are deeply complicit in that. Indeed, we are paying for it; we are paying for the security services that are committing these crimes in Somalia.</p>
	<p pid="b.427.2/11">The Government might think that because most Somalis in Britain do not, for one reason or another, have votes, they can be ignored&mdash;that tall as they are, they can be disregarded. However, the truth is that the Somali community in Britain's loathing of the actions of our Government is a ticking time bomb in Britain. I, if not the Minister, am constantly exposed in my constituency, and in Birmingham and Leicester and other places, to the anger of these young Somalis. There is a disaster waiting to happen. I hope that the Minister will announce today that, in the wake of the Channel 4 revelations, she will investigate the allegations properly, and that she will report her findings to the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.427.2/12">I am talking in my speech tonight about not only the current British Government's foreign policy towards the horn of Africa and Afghanistan, but about previous Governments' foreign policies, too. I remember being on the Opposition Benches and accusing the then Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher, of having opened the gates to the barbarians by her support for the so-called mujaheddin in Afghanistan so many years ago. The policy that our Governments have followed of &quot;my enemy's enemy is my friend&quot; has proved to be fatally flawed everywhere that it has been tried, and it is now being tried all over again in Somalia.</p>
	<p pid="b.427.2/13">Many Somalis will be watching our debate this evening&mdash;word is out about it in the Somali community, and it is being shown on Universal TV and other Somali channels. For their sake, I hope that the Minister will come clean about the dreadful problems that exist, and I also hope that she will say some words to the Ethiopian Government.</p>

	<p pid="b.429.0/1">I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on having secured this debate. I apologise for having arrived late for it; I was caught somewhat unawares as it began early. What is best for Somalia and its people is, of course, security. Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the Ethiopian Government are providing security in Somalia at present, and that they want to withdraw from Somalia at the earliest possible moment? Will he also join me in encouraging the United Nations, the African Union Mission in Somalia&mdash;AMISOM&mdash;and the African Union to ensure that troops are put back into Somalia in order to give Somalis that security, which they need? Ethiopian troops want to return to Addis Ababa.</p>

	<p pid="b.429.1/1">I do not accept that at all, and it seems that I know the Ethiopian Government rather better than the hon. Gentleman does. As I explained before he came in, I knew them when they were pro-Albanian Maoist guerrillas in the Tigrean People's Liberation Front. I knew all the leaders&mdash;they are now the Government Ministers&mdash;and I know that they have no intention of withdrawing from Somalia unless they are forced to do so. They want to occupy Somalia because they have been paid to do so by the Government of the United States and our own Government. The Ethiopian Government are doing a job for what they imagine to be the western part of the international community. I see the Minister for closing post offices laughing. His constituency contains many Somalis, as does mine, and I hope that the camera caught him laughing.</p>

	<p pid="b.429.3/1">I shall not go further down that track. Perhaps the camera caught the verisimilitude.</p>
	<p pid="b.429.3/2">The truth is that the Ethiopian Government are carrying out a service for the people who give them weapons, for the people who give them money and for the people who give them diplomatic and political support. They are having a beano in the Ethiopian embassy next week. Perhaps <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1946" name="Mark Pritchard">the hon. Member for The Wrekin (Mark Pritchard)</phrase> will go to it; he will certainly get an invitation in the post following his intervention. The Ethiopian Government are having a beano in the Ethiopian embassy in London to celebrate the 17th anniversary of their coming to power, and it is going to be a very grand event.</p>
	<p pid="b.429.3/3">That event comes at a time when the Ethiopian Government's own people are starving to death. Their children are starving to death&mdash;120,000 children have a month to live&mdash;they are invading and occupying their neighbouring countries and nobody says boo about it. In fact, far from saying boo, people are saying, &quot;Here's some more military and financial aid to do it.&quot; That is because the Government of President Bush, who are utterly discredited and on their way out, with virtually nowhere to go except Downing street on Sunday for one last photo call, regard the defeat of the former Islamic Government in Somalia as part of their war on terror.</p>
	<p pid="b.429.3/4">That is what this is all about. Ethiopia is playing the role of hammer in the horn of Africa for the policy of the United States and its war on terror. That is what Ethiopia is doing, so it will not withdraw until a new American Government, hopefully with a Kenyan-affiliated President, tell them that actually this policy is deeply flawed. The puppet regime of British citizens imposed on Somalia by the Ethiopian invasion would not last five minutes if the Ethiopian forces withdrew&mdash;that regime would have to withdraw with them. So, any Government who come to power in Somalia in the future will be filled with hatred of Britain and the United States.</p>
	<p pid="b.429.3/5">That is the problem that we keep making everywhere; we intervene either to prop up tyrants or to support tyrants because we do not like the tyrants that they are fighting against, and we generate still more problems for ourselves. We wonder why that is, and we agonisingly debate anti-terrorism laws. We wonder why so many people in the Muslim world want to hurt us. We wonder why so many young people in the Muslim world are so bitter and angry about us that they want to hurt us. Is it any wonder? Can it be any wonder to any sane person? I beg the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs to believe me when I say that it is because of the kinds of policies that I have described. I talk to Somalis all the time, and I know that the rage the Somali community both in Britain and around the world feels about Britain and America's role in their country generates terrorists. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1375" name="Ian Paisley">the right hon. Member for North Antrim (Rev. Ian Paisley)</phrase>, who saved the Government's bacon earlier this evening, is in his place and as we spent so many hours discussing anti-terrorism, let me spell it out: we are making new terrorists in Britain with our policy towards Somalia, with our double standards and with our hypocrisy.</p>

	<p pid="b.430.0/1">While the Government of Ethiopia are not perfect&mdash;indeed, there are Governments closer to home who are not perfect&mdash;it is right that human rights abuses by the Somali security services are fully investigated. Nevertheless, does the hon. Gentleman accept that if Ethiopian troops withdrew, it would create a security vacuum in which terrorist groups, including al-Qaeda, would create mayhem in the horn of Africa, which is a key strategic location, and that would come back to haunt us?</p>

	<p pid="b.431.0/1">I said in this House when it was recalled a few days after the atrocity of 9/11 that if we handled it the wrong way we would make 10,000 new bin Ladens. We have handled it the wrong way, and we have made 10,000 new bin Ladens. The problem of al-Qaeda in Somalia has been made worse by the western intervention and the Ethiopian invasion. Far more people have been recruited to a narrow, fundamentalist, separatist, violent Islamism by our policy than ever would have been if that policy had never been formed.</p>
	<p pid="b.431.0/2">The hon. Gentleman obviously has not read the Amnesty International document. The Ethiopian forces are not providing security: they are providing mass murder and terror in occupied Somalia. The refugee camps are full with 2 million people. No one can walk on the streets of Mogadishu. Channel 4's reporters were almost killed making their programme. Some of the team on the same vehicle with them were shot dead live on television&mdash;</p>

The words Somalia and security should not even be mentioned in the same sentence.</p>
	<p pid="b.431.2/2">There may be a need for African Union forces or Arab League forces. This conflict will go on and I hope that the Minister will not claim that the deal reached this week is any kind of solution to the problem.

	<p pid="b.431.3/1">I welcome the opportunity to reply to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1405" name="George Galloway">the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Galloway)</phrase> in this debate. I see this as an excellent chance to highlight how the Foreign and Commonwealth Office seeks to address a number of issues relating to Somalia.</p>
	<p pid="b.431.3/2">As my noble Friend Lord Malloch-Brown, the Minister for Africa, said in his statement this afternoon, we congratulate the Somali transitional federal Government and the Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia on reaching agreement on the cessation of violence. That agreement was signed by both parties in Djibouti on Monday and witnessed by members of the international community. I wish to thank the UN Secretary-General's special representative, Ahmedou Ould Abdallah, on his continued efforts to mediate in the talks between the parties which resulted in the agreement. This is a positive step and we look forward to all parties fulfilling their commitment to cease armed confrontation. We are committed to working with the UN to support this process.</p>
	<p pid="b.431.3/3">Human rights issues in Somalia are longstanding and complex. They cannot be attributed to any one cause, and there are no easy or obvious solutions. Somalia is not like other countries. Serious violence, lack of governance structures and the deteriorating humanitarian situation have been ongoing for 17 years. Many in Somali society have been brutalised by years of violence. It is therefore often individuals, not answerable to any particular group or commander, who carry out abuses on their own initiative. That makes it even more difficult to prevent further abuses and to bring those responsible to justice.</p>
	<p pid="b.431.3/4">Given that complexity and the insecurity in Somalia, there is little opportunity to monitor the situation reliably or gather and verify facts or allegations. Reporting is often biased and may be exaggerated to exert influence on the international community. The only sustainable way to address human rights in the long term is to engage in effective state building, concentrating on developing institutions, parliamentary accountability, an inclusive security sector and delivery of basic services. Short-term fixes that do not focus on state building will mean we return to the issue year after year, prolonging the suffering of the Somali people.</p>
	<p pid="b.431.3/5">Reports of incidents and accusations of human rights abuses by Ethiopian troops are difficult to corroborate and have been categorically denied by the Ethiopian Government. Ethiopian troops in Somalia are carrying out a role that security providers in Somalia do not have the capacity for. Many critics forget that fighting between militias went on for 15 years before Ethiopia intervened, at the invitation of Somalia's transitional federal Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.431.3/6">African Union member nations have not yet committed to contributing sufficient troops to allow for full deployment of the African Union mission in Somalia, which currently has only 2,400 of the 8,000 troops mandated. Further planning for a possible UN mission was called for by UN Security Council resolution 1814, although that is unlikely to be mandated soon. Evidence from other Ethiopian peacekeeping deployments indicates that they make a positive contribution to missions. Ethiopian troops are likely to form the largest contingent of the UN-African Union mission in Darfur.</p>
	<p pid="b.431.3/7">We regularly engage with human rights organisations, listen to their views and appreciate their efforts to gather information and evidence on human rights. We and they fully acknowledge that allegations of abuse are made against all parties to the conflict in Somalia. We sponsored an Arria meeting at the United Nations in New York on <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-31">31 March</phrase> to enable Governments and the non-governmental organisation community freely to discuss human rights and humanitarian issues and to exchange views on how to achieve progress in Somalia.</p>
	<p pid="b.431.3/8">The hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow might be interested to know that in response to a question from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase>, I said:</p>
	<p pid="b.431.3/9" class="indent">&quot;We unreservedly condemn all proven incidents of human rights abuse and expect those responsible to face justice.&quot;&mdash;[<i> Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-03">3 June 2008</phrase>; Vol. 476, c. 832W.]</p>
	<p pid="b.431.3/10">My noble Friend the Minister for Africa, Lord Malloch-Brown, raised the issue of human rights in Somalia with the Ethiopian Prime Minister in late January 2008. Our ambassador to Ethiopia regularly raises the issue of respect for human rights in Somalia at senior levels of the Ethiopian Government. Foreign and Commonwealth Office officials in London and at the UN have also raised the issue with their Ethiopian counterparts.</p>
	<p pid="b.431.3/11">Ethiopia has told us that it intends to withdraw from Somalia and that it has reduced force numbers by more than half since late February 2007. The Ethiopian Government are extremely positive about the newly signed peace agreement, which includes a strategy for their withdrawal from Somalia. Until Ethiopia withdraws its troops completely, we urge them to use only appropriate force, adhere to international humanitarian law and respect human rights. However, for Ethiopia to withdraw from Somalia before an effective alternative force has been established would risk creating a dangerous security vacuum. Somalis would suffer the most from such a development.</p>
	<p pid="b.431.3/12">The UK is a leading contributor to world efforts to rebuild the Somali state. We support the efforts of the UN Secretary General's special representative for Somalia to engage with civil society and to help bring about social and political reconciliation that will lead to greater respect for human rights and religious freedoms for all Somalis. Through helping to shape UN Security Council policy, and our membership of the EU and the international contact group, we press for greater focus on human rights in Somalia. We asked the UN to enhance its capacity to monitor and report on the human rights situation in Somalia and fully supported the Human Rights Council resolution on <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-20">20 March</phrase> to renew the mandate of an independent expert. Both UN Security Council resolution 1814, unanimously adopted on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-15">15 May</phrase>, and the EU General Assembly and External Relations Council conclusions, adopted on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-26">26 May</phrase>, support the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, including the independent expert for Somalia, and encourage them to undertake a fact-finding and assessment mission to Somalia to address the human rights situation.</p>
	<p pid="b.431.3/13">We co-chair the donors group and are the second largest bilateral humanitarian and development donor. We are also the second largest bilateral donor, after the US, for the African Union mission to Somalia. We are a key donor to the UN Development Programme effort to develop a full justice system, including improving the police force and the judiciary and penal systems to an internationally acceptable standard. I understand that the hon. Gentleman thought that that issue was a matter for the Department for International Development, but I can confirm that it is a policy area of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.</p>
	<p pid="b.431.3/14">We value human rights highly. No other states are as active as the UK on human rights issues in Somalia. We urge other states to join our efforts and encourage international human rights organisations to concentrate their advocacy activities on pressing other less active states for support, too.</p>
	<p pid="b.431.3/15" class="italic"> Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="b.431.3/16" class="italic"> Adjourned accordingly at twenty-five minutes past Seven o'clock.</p>
