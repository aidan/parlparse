Members might have seen the hysterical scare stories I yesterday's newspapers about the amount of carbon dioxide being released from Drax power station. Up to April, however, the power station was co-firing coal with biomass up to a rate of 25 per cent. However, the regulations that were imposed from <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April</phrase> this year have reduced the biomass element of the co-firing to 15 per cent. Will my hon. Friend look again at those regulations, to see whether we can increase the levels permitted in co-firing, or move to complete biomass firing?</p>

	<p pid="b.1133.2/1">I declare an interest in the single farm payment. The Secretary of State has given us updated figures today on the welcome progress that the RPA is finally achieving in making payments and part-payments. He has talked about those who have received nothing so far, but he has not mentioned the issue that the NFU is talking to me about: those who have received excess payments. I was told as recently as Tuesday of a farmer who was expecting to receive a cheque for &pound;35,000, but who instead received one for &pound;2.1 million. One can imagine his surprise and pleasure on opening his mail that day. Given this shambles, will the Secretary of State please update the House on the penalty regime? I know that the deadline has been extended and that farmers are now expected to get in next year's application forms by <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-31">31 May</phrase>, but will the Secretary of State please extend it further until the shambles has been sorted out?</p>

	<p pid="b.1135.2/1">Before announcing the business for the week ahead, I wish to express my sorrow at <phrase class="honfriend" id="unknown" name="None">the sudden death of the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth)</phrase>. The Conservative party has lost one of its stars and this House has lost a great parliamentarian. He brightened this place with his ties, his waistcoats and his love of country and western music, but above all with his personality. Eric served this Parliament with great distinction in many capacities, including on Committees, on the Speaker's Panel, in the Chamber and holding court in the Tea Room, offering advice to all comers, including myself&mdash;and very sage advice it was. But the House will recall particularly with great warmth Eric's weekly encounters with the late Robin Cook, when Robin was Leader of the House and Eric was the shadow Leader of the House. Each sharpened his wit on the other, to the great entertainment and elucidation of the rest of us. Our sympathies and prayers go to Eric's wife, Carroll, his three children, his friends and all his constituents.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-05-18b.1152.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1423" speakername="Jack Straw" colnum="1152"  time="012:28:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060518/debtext/60518-0239.htm#060518114000662">
	<p pid="b.1152.3/1">The motion on Members' salaries will give effect to the proposal announced by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-30">30 March</phrase> that the pay increases for Members of Parliament for 2006-07 should be staged, with the full increase being deferred until <phrase class="date" code="">1 November</phrase> rather than being payable from <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April</phrase> last. The proposal is made in the context of the Government's response to the 28th report of the Senior Salaries Review Body, which provides that the award to the senior civil service, to which Members' pay is linked under the formula agreed in 1996, is being staged in a similar way.</p>
	<p pid="b.1152.3/2">Under the decisions taken in 2003 and 2005, annual uprating of the additional salaries for Select and Standing Committee Chairmen is also linked to the senior civil service pay bands. The motion accordingly provides that the increase in these salaries too should be staged.</p>
	<p pid="b.1152.3/3">Under these proposals, the salary of a Member of Parliament will be &pound;59,686 from <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April</phrase> and &pound;60,277 from <phrase class="date" code="">1 November</phrase>. The principle of linkage to the senior civil service pay bands, agreed by the House in 1996, followed earlier systems of linkage. It was intended to avoid the need for a major debate on Members' pay on every occasion when pay needed to be adjusted. However, the system agreed does not cover the present situation, because the pay bands to which our pay is linked would have risen by the full 2 per cent. from <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April</phrase>. If nothing further were done, our pay would rise by 2 per cent. from that date, even though this would not be the case in practice for most of the senior civil service.</p>
	<p pid="b.1152.3/4">When he proposed this staging of the senior civil service pay increase, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister announced that it was to</p>
	<p pid="b.1152.3/5" class="indent">&quot;reflect what is affordable within expenditure plans.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1152.3/6">I accept that the total saving to the public purse from the staging of the pay of Members of Parliament itself will be relatively small. It amounts to less than &pound;230,000 in basic pay, and a little more than that if other factors&mdash;employers' national insurance contributions and Exchequer pensions contributions&mdash;are included.</p>
	<p pid="b.1152.3/7">I hope that colleagues agree that we ought to play our part and show restraint, as we are asking the senior civil service, to whose pay ours is linked, to show equal restraint.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-05-18b.1170.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1430" speakername="Dennis Skinner" colnum="1170"  time="013:35:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060518/debtext/60518-0241.htm#060518114000717">
	<p pid="b.1170.3/1">I am sorry that I was missing for a few minutes. I was in touch with&mdash;not Joe Ashton, although he has been in touch with me a great deal lately, which is why I have risen to speak, but the cardiologist. Just at the moment, that is a bit more important.</p>
	<p pid="b.1170.3/2">Joe Ashton was a Whip between 1976 and 1979, when we had no majority. Well, we did have a majority, but then Stonehouse went missing. He was on a Florida beach, then he turned up in Australia. Then he crossed the Floor, and Joe Ashton was given the job of being one of the Whips keeping our majority intact. They were heady days and all the rest of it, but we formed a relationship. Joe's job was to try to get me into the Lobbies. It did not always work, but I told him all those years ago that I would do him a favour some time. I got on the phone to him when he retired. It has not been mentioned yet, but Joe had a very serious illness. We had many long discussions about how he was getting on. At the time I could see that despite the grim fight that he was undertaking, there was no doubt that the proposal that he had helped to put to the House way back in 2001&mdash;I think that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1484" name="Eric Martlew">my hon. Friend the Member for Carlisle (Mr. Martlew)</phrase> said that it was on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-02">2 May</phrase>&mdash;was still very much in his mind. I promised him on numerous occasions that I would raise it if necessary, in accordance with what he wanted. What I did not know was that Joe had also been briefing my hon. Friend the Member for Carlisle, who has presented most of his propositions today.</p>
	<p pid="b.1170.3/3">Reference has been made to the composition of this place in the old days. Many Members then had formerly worked in factories or the pits. I can speak with some knowledge about pension entitlements in those days. The pension from the pits was only voluntary even in my day, and there was no pension at all when I started working as a miner. Many people who became Members of Parliament received no pension. It is true that they could have money shifted from one place to another, but people who had given20 years' service were receiving about &pound;100 a month&mdash;people who had worked in factories, pits and all <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1824" name="David Heath">the rest. The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome(Mr. Heath)</phrase> was right to say that many Members did not leave with a great deal of money. It is true that the composition of this place has changed dramatically. There are no longer 700,000 miners; you would have a job to find more than 5,000. That is why it is important to remember what the position used to be.</p>
	<p pid="b.1170.3/4">My hon. Friend the Member for Carlisle mentioned nominees for the parliamentary contributory pension fund and the Members' fund. That is what Members are striving for, as of right. If the Commission would consider it, I am sure that my old pal Joe Ashton, Bill Michie and all the rest who helped to form the association will be very pleased. Help with the cost of the magazine would also be appreciated, and Joe also told me that he would like to have the names and addresses of all the Members who had left, so that they could keep in contact.</p>
	<p pid="b.1170.3/5">So those are the proposals. My hon. Friend the Member for Carlisle dealt with them previously and explained precisely what was needed, and I hope that the Commission can deal with the matter. I have done my job. I made a promise to Joe donkeys' years ago that there would come an occasion when he would be glad of my presence. I may not be in the Lobby, but I am speaking up for his association.</p>

In fact, although it is of real importance to a number of constituencies throughout the country, nowhere will the effect of the sale of British Nuclear Group be more acutely felt than in Copeland and in West Cumbria generally.</p>
	<p pid="b.1173.2/2">I want to begin my establishing the unique importance of British Nuclear Group to the Sellafield site, Copeland and West Cumbria. I know that the Minister is well aware of these issues, but they bear repeating. British Nuclear Group is by far the largest company operating on the Sellafield site. It employs more than 7,000 people directly, and the site itself employs over 11,500 people. Employment at Sellafield sustains another 5,000 jobs in the wider local community, so in real terms, the site is responsible for approximately 17,000 jobs. Such employment accounts for the majority of the West Cumbria economy and well over 60 per cent. of the economy of Copeland.</p>
	<p pid="b.1173.2/3">Take-home wages from the Sellafield site are in excess of &pound;210 million per year. The site provides, as the Minister knows, high-quality, highly skilled, highly valued jobs. Expenditure from the Sellafield sitegoing into the regional supply chain is in excess of&pound;600 million a year. It provides the lifeblood of the local service industry companies, the hospitality and retail industries, and the bespoke, high-value engineering industries to be found not only in Copeland, but in Allerdale, in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1942" name="Tony Cunningham">the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Tony Cunningham)</phrase>. Local supply chain procurement by BNG is essential in West Cumbria, an issue to which I shall return.</p>
	<p pid="b.1173.2/4">In addition to that contribution to the local economy, in the past 15 years BNG has committed&pound;20 million to the West Cumbria Development Fund&mdash;a local economic regeneration body&mdash;which, in turn, has helped to lever in a further &pound;10 million worth of European Union funding. BNG has also demonstrated a concerted willingness to work in partnership with the local communities within which it operates, and, crucially, with the trade unions. In my view, it is the trade union members on any nuclear site who are the ultimate arbiters of safety. That is certainly the case at Sellafield, and I am grateful and pleased that the relationship between them and BNG is as strong as it clearly is. It is against that background that my interest in BNG must be understood. I must also state for the record that I am a former employee of the company at the Sellafield site&mdash;a fact of which I am extremely proud.</p>
	<p pid="b.1173.2/5">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-30">30 March</phrase>, the then Secretary of State for Trade and Industry announced the Government's endorsement of the proposal of the board of British Nuclear Fuels Ltd. to sell BNG. This was expected, and given the remit of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority under the terms of the Energy Act 2004, completely understandable. The NDA and the UK as a whole require the development of competition within the nuclear decommissioning industry in the UK, in order to achieve the best value for money for the taxpayer. Although I completely accept the logic of that and the need for competition, I hope that the Minister can explain what, if any, consideration was given to the formation of a public-private partnership for UK decommissioning before the owner-contractor model was chosen.</p>
	<p pid="b.1173.2/6">Accompanying the Secretary of State's announcement, the NDA made the wise announcement that it would grant BNG a new five-year contract to operate the Sellafield site. That contract will keep the company, or its new owner, at the site until at least 2012. The Secretary of State said that he expects the sale of BNG to be completed by the autumn of 2007. For my constituents, that means that from next autumn, there will be a new, dominant company operating the Sellafield site. It is essential that that new company understand my community and become an active partner within it.</p>
	<p pid="b.1173.2/7">I have to say at this juncture that neither the Leader of the Opposition nor the shadow Secretary of State for Trade and Industry have shown the faintest glimmer of an understanding of what any of this means. Following the Secretary of State's announcement in March, the shadow Secretary of State issued a press release claiming that that announcement meant that the nation's nuclear liabilities were being put into the private sector. I can only assume that he has not read, let alone understood, the 2004 Act. Those liabilities have remained, and will remain, within the public sector under the ownership of the NDA. That embarrassing lack of understanding does not bode well for the shadow Secretary of State's time on the Conservative Front Bench, or, indeed, for the Conservatives' approach to the nuclear industry in general.</p>
	<p pid="b.1173.2/8">The Leader of the Opposition recently hand-picked one of the country's most vocal and misleading opponents of the nuclear industry to be his energy and environment adviser. That adviser has repeatedly misled the nation about the health and well-being of my constituents, among whom he has spread fear, anxiety and anger. His claims have no scientific or factual basis and constitute little more than malicious scaremongering. So today, I call upon the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;sadly, he is not here&mdash;to ensure that his high-profile advisers publicly withdraw their comments, or to otherwise sack them.</p>

	<p pid="b.1178.1/1">After the previous debate on MPs' pay, it is good to turn to the calmer and less controversial waters of nuclear energy.</p>
	<p pid="b.1178.1/2">I welcome the opportunity to comment on the future of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1511" name="Jamie Reed">the British Nuclear Group. My hon. Friend the Member for Copeland (Mr. Reed)</phrase> is a great commentator on nuclear policy, and his expertise and experience are always worth listening to. In addition, he has a great reputation in his community, as I witnessed when I visited Sellafield some months ago.</p>
	<p pid="b.1178.1/3">The former Secretary of State, who is now Secretary of State for Education and Skills, announced our intentions in a written statement to the House on<phrase class="date" code="2006-03-30">30 March</phrase>. That statement made it clear that we had approved the BNFL board's recommendation that it should sell BNG through a competitive sale process commencing in April 2007 or earlier. However, there has been much media speculation about how the competitive sale will be conducted. Some of that speculation has been accurate and some of it less so, and my aim today is to provide some clarity on the matter.</p>
	<p pid="b.1178.1/4">I recognise that this debate takes place against a backdrop of some interest in the future of nuclear energy. I shall not say too much about that wider issue, save that I am conducting an energy review on behalf of my Secretary of State and the Prime Minister, and that it will report on these critical questions by the summer.</p>
	<p pid="b.1178.1/5">My hon. Friend the Member for Copeland rightly made some very positive comments about BNG and the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority's achievements since it commenced operations just over a year ago. I should like to echo those sentiments. BNFL did an admirable job in restructuring itself and preparing the ground for the NDA. The management and staff at BNG have coped very well with the transition. I am tremendously encouraged that the NDA's stewardship of the UK's nuclear clean-up has already yielded significant efficiency savings at BNG's sites. It is a very good start, but of course we are looking for very much more.</p>
	<p pid="b.1178.1/6">That is why we believe that a competitive sale is the right route. After careful deliberation, the BNFL board determined a sale to be in the company's best commercial interest and to represent BNG's best chance of operating successfully in the commercial market created by the Energy Act 2004, thereby providing long-term stability for staff. Most important of all, though, the company also convinced us that it would be good for the taxpayer because it is good for the nuclear decommissioning and clean-up programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.1178.1/7">I shall be happy to discuss with my hon. Friend the Member for Copeland the reason why the option of a public-private partnership was not pursued, but essentially it was because BNG would not have the required critical mass.</p>
	<p pid="b.1178.1/8">The decision for Government was not straightforward, and was taken only after extensive consultation with key stakeholders. We were especially keen that the sale should not impact negatively on the NDA's mission, and we have moved forward carefully to ensure that we have fully considered the issues. However, I am absolutely confident that we now have the right result, and one that will contribute to improved clean-up performance for the NDA by introducing external expertise more quickly.</p>
	<p pid="b.1178.1/9">The NDA's competition timetable reflects its broader strategy to prioritise the tackling of the highest hazards. Rather than run its own separate competition for Sellafield, the NDA was able to accommodate the sale by letting a new five-year contract for that site. That will commence next year, at the point when the new owner acquires BNG. The NDA and BNFL will thus work closely throughout the competitive sale process. The aim will be to ensure that the successful bidder is the best available to improve performance substantially, particularly at Sellafield. Therefore, the selection criteria will be focused mainly on issues such as safety, reducing high hazards, driving down costs through better planning and more innovation, accelerating clean-up and improved managed capability.</p>
	<p pid="b.1178.1/10">This debate is not the occasion to discuss the problems involved in nuclear decommissioning, but it is worth noting that they represent some of the really big challenges facing this country in the coming half century. Over the summer, the expert group CORUM will present a report with proposals on what might be called the final resting place for nuclear waste. Those are critical issues.</p>
