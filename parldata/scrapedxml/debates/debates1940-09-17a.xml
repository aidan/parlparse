<p>Instructions have been issued that work of this kind is to be reduced to a minimum, and battalion commanders are provided with administrative assistants to help them in carrying it out. My hon. and gallant Friend will realise that the amount of administrative work will vary from area to area according to the density of the population and the nature of the duties to be performed, but he may rest assured that the Home Guard authorities are fully alive to the importance of this question, and that every effort will continue to be made to keep down the number of returns.</p>

<p>May I ask, not that the Home Guard authorities should be made aware of this, but that the War Office, which is inevitably the final arbiter on this question, should be made aware of it?

<p>Since the return of the British Expeditionary Force from France the Army Council have at my request been considering reports upon the work of the Auxiliary Territorial Service, in which over 30,000 women are enrolled for military duty of various kinds throughout the Military Commands. All these reports have testified to the keenness and efficiency of the Auxiliary Territorial Service, and also to the great value of the work which it performs. Many suggestions have also been received from the


Director and senior officers of the Auxiliary Territorial Service, from the Military Commands, from important women's organisations, and finally from the Parliamentary Select Committee which issued a report on 21st August.<br/>
The general purpose of these suggestions, which have taken many forms, has been to bring the organisation of the Auxiliary Territorial Service, which came into being under very different conditions in September, 1938, into closer conformity with the proved requirements of the present time; to make fuller provision for its welfare and technical efficiency; and finally to raise its numerical strength. The plans for reorganisation, which in some directions affect the Women's Royal Naval Service and the Women's Auxiliary Air Force as well as the Auxiliary Territorial Service, are not yet complete in all respects; but in the meantime various changes have been approved by the Army Council and are being brought into effect at once.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1940-09-17a.93.0" colnum="93" time="">
<p>The following are the changes already approved:&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>(1) An Auxiliary Territorial Service Council is being formed under the supervision of the Adjutant-General, which will consist of the following officers:</li>
<ol>
<li>(<i>a</i>)The Director of the Auxiliary Territorial Service&#x2014;President. The Director is on the staff of the Adjutant-General and will be responsible under him for the administration of the Auxiliary Territorial Service.</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) A senior Auxiliary Territorial Service officer attached to the staff of the Quartermaster-General, who will deal with clothing, feeding and accommodation of the Auxiliary Territorial Service.</li>
<li>(<i>c</i>) A senior Auxiliary Territorial Service officer attached to the staff of the Director of Military Training, who will be responsible for all branches of training in the Auxiliary Territorial Service.</li>
<li>(<i>d</i>) A woman doctor attached to the staff of the Director-General of Army Medical Services, who will be responsible for the health and general welfare of the Auxiliary Territorial Service.</li>
</ol></ol></p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1940-09-17a.93.1" colnum="93" time="">

<p>(2) A Selection Board for the promotion of Auxiliary Territorial Service officers is also being set up. This Board will consist of the Director, Auxiliary Territorial Service, the Assistant Directors, Auxiliary Territorial Service, in all the Military Commands and, when officers they deal with are under consideration the Auxiliary Territorial Service Inspectors of M.T. Companies and Catering. Confidential reports on all Auxiliary Territorial Service officers are to be rendered to this Board at once. The recommendations of this Board will be subject to confirmation by the Adjutant-General. These will deal with:
<ol>
<li>(<i>a</i>) Welfare qualifications, interest in the women serving under them, readiness to advise and help.</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) Administrative qualifications.</li>
<li>(<i>c</i>) Special qualifications, for example, in domestic science, languages, driving, clerical work and business experience.</li>
</ol></p>

<p>(3) The normal type of soldier's ration having proved too heavy for women in some respects and deficient for women in other respects, a new scale is being introduced more appropriate to the needs of the Auxiliary Territorial Service.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1940-09-17a.94.2" colnum="94" time="">
<p>The main changes are:
<ol>
<li>(<i>a</i>) A slight reduction in the heavier foods such as meat, bacon and bread.</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) A supplementary ration of eggs, 50 per cent. extra milk, fruit (fresh when possible), and a higher scale of fresh vegetables.</li>
<li>(<i>c</i>) The supply of a breakfast cereal, a cup of chocolate, and other minor variations of the same kind.</li>
</ol></p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1940-09-17a.94.3" colnum="94" time="">
<p>The general purpose of these changes is to bring the Auxiliary Territorial Service under the control of a council consisting of its own director and three senior commandants; to facilitate promotion on the recommendation of immediate superiors with personal knowledge of the officer or member reported upon; to improve technical training; and to provide more fully for the health and welfare of all branches.</p>

<p>I do not think that the information asked for would serve any useful purpose in the public interest. I may say, however, that the great majority of divisional and corps field cashiers were able to return with their public money intact. The fact that some were unable to do so was due to conditions arising from enemy action which were beyond the control of the officers concerned. Field cashiers do not have private moneys entrusted to them in their official capacity.</p>

<p>The Question involves the assumption that there are a substantial number of cases in which officers have been for some considerable time unable, in spite of repeated applications, to obtain allowances to which they are entitled. It is impossible to deal with generalised assumptions of this nature, which I am not prepared to admit in the absence of concrete evidence. Allegations of this general nature have frequently been made, but when investigated in particular cases have proved in the large majority of cases to be unfounded. If there are any officers who have been unable within a reasonable time to secure payment of allowances to which they are entitled, I should be glad if they would forward their claims with full particulars, through their commanding officers, to the Paymaster-in-Chief, War Office, when they will be dealt with without delay. I should, however, point out that this special procedure should be applied only to cases where payment has been unduly delayed and not to cases where the claim has been already refused as inadmissible.</p>

<p>The deduction of 6&#x00BD;d. a week from a soldier's pay, to which my hon. Friend refers, is a statutory contribution under the Widows', Orphans' and Old Age Contributory Pensions Act. Apart from the question of principle, there would be considerable practical disadvantages in setting these deductions off without book entry against the allowance given in respect of haircutting, etc., with which it has no connection.

(2) whether he is satisfied with the Bank of England machinery and the way it functions, in view of the recent foreign currency prosecution; and whether he will have a White Paper issued showing the names and amounts involved of transactions of this kind through the Bank of England since 1st August, 1939?</p>

<p>Mr. Argenti had, at the beginning of 1939, taken the steps necessary to sever his connection with his London firm, the resignation taking effect on 31st August, 1939, and had arranged to set up in business in Belgium and to purchase a part interest in a factory there. In connection with the purchase of the factory, he applied for permission, in September, 1939, to retain and sell between &#x00A3;2,000 and &#x00A3;2,500 in Belgian securities, which was granted under the regulations then in force. Mr. Argenti took up his residence in Belgium, in accordance with the intention he had expressed before the war, without having any intention to return to this country. He was, therefore, allowed to operate upon his sterling balances, since, as hon. Members are aware, sterling balances of foreign residents are not blocked. In fact, he was treated in accordance with the ordinary arrangements in force at the time. He returned to this country after the German invasion of Belgium. None of the transactions referred to have any connection with the offence for which he was prosecuted, and I venture to doubt whether the learned magistrate was fully seized of the facts relating to them. I may add that, under a regulation made last July, it is not now possible for any


person who has been in this country at any time since the beginning of the war to claim to exercise the privileges of a non-resident.</p>

Friend the Financial Secretary on 25th July, when he explained that it would be illegal for a retailer to charge any percentage on the tax itself. No provision is made for recompensing the retailer on bad or damaged stock and in this respect the tax

<p>I beg to move,
<q>That Mr. Louis Arnold Abraham, a Senior Clerk in the Journal Office, have leave to attend and give evidence before the Magistrate at Bow Street and afterwards at the Central Criminal Court, and there to produce the Journal of the House for the 30th day of July last, on the hearing and trial of a charge of the contravention of Regulation 3 (2) of the Defence (General) Regulations, 1939, about to be preferred against one Roy Townsend Leonard Day.</q>
The Regulation referred to is the Regulation which makes it an offence to report or purport to report the proceedings of a Secret Session. It is necessary for the prosecution on those proceedings to prove the Resolution of the House making that Session a Secret Session. According to the law and practice of Parliament, evidence of this kind can only be given by one of the Clerks of the House if the House give leave for him to give that evidence. The Motion which I have moved is in the ordinary form and has been adopted by the House on many previous occasions.</p>

<p>I do not feel it necessary to make any lengthy statement to the House to-day upon the general war position. Practically all the facts not of a secret nature have already been made public. The advance of the Italian army from Libya is in progress. The two British platoons which have been holding Sollum have been withdrawn. Sharp fighting is taking place upon the desert flank between the armoured vehicles of both sides. The enemy is still some distance from our position of resistance. We must see what happens.<br/>
The deployment of the German barges and ships in preparation for the invasion of Great Britain and Ireland continues steadily, and we must expect that he will make an attempt at what he judges to be the best opportunity. All our preparations must therefore be maintained

in a state of vigilance. The process of waiting, keyed up to concert pitch day after day, is apt after a while to lose its charm of novelty. There is no doubt that it imposes a heavy strain upon all concerned, but we must not under-rate the damage inflicted upon the enemy, who also has to wait, by the very heavy and prolonged nightly bombings upon his concentrations of ships and upon all the focal points of his assembly of troops. Undoubtedly serious injury has been done to his ships and barges, and meanwhile our own strength, I am able to assure the House, develops steadily by land, by sea, and above all in the air. Sunday's action was the most brilliant and fruitful of any fought upon a large scale up to that date by the fighters of the Royal Air Force. The figures have already been made public. To the best of my belief&#x2014;and I have made searching inquiries and taken several cross checks &#x2014;these figures are not in any way exaggerated. Neither side has yet employed more than a portion of its forces, but there are good reasons for believing at the present time that very grievous inroads are being made upon the enemy's superiority of numbers, and we may await the decision of this prolonged air battle with sober but increasing confidence.<br/>
The German attacks upon the civil population have been concentrated mainly upon London, in the hopes of terrorising its citizens into submission or to throw them into confusion, and, of course, in the silly idea that they will put pressure upon the Government to make peace. The deliberate and repeated attacks upon Buckingham Palace and upon the persons of our beloved King and Queen are also intended, apart from their general barbarity, to have an unsettling effect upon public opinion. They have, of course, the opposite effect. They unite the King and Queen to their people by new and sacred bonds of common danger, and they steel the hearts of all to the stern and unrelenting prosecution of the war against so foul a foe.<br/>
I gave the House when I last addressed them the casualty figures up to the end of August and without prejudice to our habit of publishing the figure, monthly. I may now mention that during the first half of September about 2,000 civilians&#x2014;men, women and children&#x2014;have been killed, and about 8,000 wounded by air bombardment. Four-fifths of these casual-


ties have occurred in London. Many hospitals and churches and public monuments have been damaged, but the injury to our war-making capacity has been surprisingly small. We are only now beginning to get the increased flow of production from the great programmes which were started on the outbreak of the war, and it is very agreeable to see that the increases are maintained over so wide a field in spite of the enemy's fire. To show how indiscriminate and wanton is the enemy's attack, one has only to compare the figures of civilian casualties in the first fortnight of this month with the military casualties. There were, as I have said, 10,000 civilian casualties from air attack, but only some 250 of these occurred in all the Fighting Forces.<br/>
The air-raid precautions organisation in all its branches has proved its efficiency, and the greatest discipline and devotion have been shown by all. The fire brigades arc, of course, conspicuous, but in paying tribute to them there must be no disparagement to all the other forms of service which have been faithfully and punctiliously discharged. Of course, the task of preserving the health and well-being of this enormous community in the Thames Valley, exceeding 8,000,000 souls, living under artificial conditions of civilisation, and of supplying them with food and all other necessities and of making provision for those whose homes have been destroyed or who have had to be evacuated&#x2014;all this and much else have, as the House will realise, cast a strain upon the machinery of government which calls for ceaseless exertion by all authorities concerned. I am glad to say that this heavy and intricate task is being efficiently and successfully discharged, and our whole system of life and labour is being rapidly adapted to conditions hitherto unknown to modern society. Constant adjustments have to be made and defects remedied in the light of experience. As I said last time, a great deal of our progress must be by trial and error. We have to feel our way and do our best to meet each defect as it reveals itself.<br/>
I had hoped, as I said when I last spoke during the week that has passed, to promulgate some new rules about air-raid warnings, but the intensification of the air attack has made it difficult to draw precise conclusions, and, in spite of my

desire to make good my undertaking to the House, I feel that it is wiser for the moment to allow the process of local adaptation to run its course. Broadly speaking, our plan must be to use the siren, which, it may be noted, has been cut in two, as an alert and not as an alarm, and to have a system of highly trained what I may call Jim Crows or look-out men, who will give the alarm when immediate danger is expected at any point. Upon this basis everyone must endeavour to carry on his work and see that output and the public services do not suffer or suffer only the minimum interruption. No doubt, we shall work up to a much higher standard than we have at present attained in many respects, but I feel it better to proceed empirically than, at this moment, to try to make precise conditions; because, after all, we must expect that very much more intense examples of air fighting will be experienced in future than we have vet seen.<br/>
There are some matters connected with our arrangements under air attack which I should prefer to discuss in private. I must remind the House that every word spoken in public Session can be telegraphed all over the world; and that there is no reason why we should keep the enemy informed of the details of our arrangements, and thus enable him to inflict the maximum injury upon us. We do not receive any similar information from him about his way of life; although, I am sure, our military staffs would he very much convenienced thereby. There are several things that I wish to say to the House, and I dare say there are many things that hon. Members would like to say to the Government. Therefore, I propose that we should now move into Secret Session, and I declare to you, Mr. Speaker that, casting my eyes around, I spy strangers.</p>
