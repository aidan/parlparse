	<p pid="a.289.0/1">The Secretary of State's Department has been criticised for the use of consultants in Malawi and for the extensive expenses that were built up. Can he tell the House how many consultants his Department employs around the world and what safeguards are in place to ensure that their expenditure is spent effectively?</p>

	<p pid="a.289.1/1">The number varies from time to time and I will see whether I can come back to the hon. Gentleman with a figure. DFID's total expenditure on consultants as a proportion of our bilateral budget has fallen from 10 per cent., as I recollect it, in 1997&ndash;98 to about 5 per cent. now, so it is a falling share compared with the position that we inherited in 1997. We use consultants for a range of activities, partly to help deliver programmes and partly to give us advice.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.1/2">In respect of Malawi, I have to say that some of the criticism was ill founded, because the training programmes that the National Democratic Institute was engaged in were supporting civil society and parliamentarians in Malawi to think about how they could do their jobs more effectively. It included hiring rooms for training courses and feeding people who were attending them&mdash;a normal day-to-day activity that Members of the House and of all organisations engage in. The feedback from participants in those programmes was that that support and training was very helpful in assisting them to do their job as elected representatives.</p>

Increasingly, however, DFID's budget is being spent through partnerships with Governments, multilateral organisations and institutions, and NGOs&mdash;channels that have minimal accountability. Will the Minister say what progress DFID has made since the critical report of November 2003 in monitoring and evaluating the channels through which British taxpayers' money is spent? How will partnership performance be assessed and resources allocated to ensure maximum prevention, and maximum treatment, of HIV/AIDS?</p>

	<p pid="a.291.6/1">I share my hon. Friend's concern about the need to close the gender equality gap and to get all the children in sub-Saharan Africa who are not attending primary school into classrooms. Fulfilling those objectives depends on the capacity of the Governments of developing countries to raise the finance, employ the teachers and build the schools. In particular relation to girls, the task is to address the other factors that prevent girls from getting to school. Something as practical as a lack of toilet facilities can make parents reluctant to send their daughters to school. Another factor could be the lack of clean water, because if water has to be fetched and carried from somewhere else, we know that that burden falls on girls and women. If girls have to fetch and carry water, they cannot go to school.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.6/2">School fees present another obstacle that has to be overcome, as they prevent poor families from sending their children to school. If those poor families have to make a choice, they may choose to pay fees for a boy but not for a girl. Those are the problems that we must address if we are going to help developing countries reach the 2015 target.</p>

	<p pid="a.292.1/1">I share the hon. Gentleman's concern about the problem. As he knows, the real problem involves the factors that drive teachers and other skilled professionals out of developing countries, such as poor pay and working conditions, and the lack of opportunity for career and professional development. In the course of 2005, various commitments have been made to help developing countries improve pay and working conditions for teachers and provide more career and professional development, and the British Government have also increased aid to that end. Another obstacle is the lack of housing for teachers in rural areas: if there is no house to live in, is it any wonder that teachers are reluctant to go and work in a remote rural community? That is what we have to address, and our increased aid is supporting that effort.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.1/2">For example, the new president of Burundi has just abolished school fees. On the first day, 500,000 children turned up for school, 300,000 of whom had not been to school before. Although there is still the same number of teachers in the schools there, we have given the country some financial assistance to help it to begin to address that enormous challenge.</p>

	<p pid="a.297.0/1">We have made changes to try to reach a compromise; that is true. But I want to explain to the right hon. and learned Gentleman and to his hon. Friends why I believe this is so necessary. Let me emphasise again to the House: this proposal did not originate with the Government, it originated with the police and those responsible for anti-terrorist operations in our country. If I may quote from those responsible for conducting those operations, I will do so. The chief constable of Manchester, for example, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/2" class="indent">&quot;The reality of the terrorism threat that we currently face is so horrendous in terms of the implications that we are having to intervene far earlier in the investigation than we ever would have during IRA campaigns . . . because with mass casualty terrorism we cannot afford to take any chances.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/3">Andy Hayman, who is the senior police officer charged with leading anti-terrorist operations in this country, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/4" class="indent">&quot;We are not looking for legislation to hold people for up to three months simply because it is an easy option. It is absolutely vital. To prevent further attacks we must have it.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/5">That is the police saying to us that they need these powers to prevent terrorism in this country. In the last week, we have learned that, since <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-07">7 July</phrase>, two further terrorist plots have been foiled in this country. Yesterday, Australia announced&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Well, perhaps those who foiled the plots might have their advice taken a little more seriously. Secondly&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Did <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1461" name="Charles Walker">the hon.

	<p pid="a.297.4/1">Let me repeat that we all accept that we face a new threat of terrorism and that we all want to take effective action against that threat. Let me remind the Prime Minister of what he said in the past in relation to anti-terrorism issues. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.297.4/2" class="indent">&quot;The view of the police must be taken into account, but . . . the objections received from a very broad range of opinion on these proposals should be properly tested.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report,</i> <phrase class="date" code="1994-03-09">9 March 1994</phrase>; Vol. 239, c. 302&ndash;3.]</p>
	<p pid="a.297.4/3">And what we seek to do&mdash;this ought to be capable of cool and rational debate&mdash;is to test the extent to which the 90-day proposal can be justified. So let me ask the Prime Minister this specific question: can he identify a single case in which it has taken the police 90 days after arresting a suspect to find evidence sufficient to charge that person with a terrorist offence?</p>

	<p pid="a.298.0/1">I really have to say to the right hon. and learned Gentleman that I find it quite extraordinary that he seeks to suggest that there is somehow no evidence that the police are putting forward for the case that they are making. They have put forward detailed reasons as to why they believe these powers to be necessary. For example, just this last weekend, we arrested people on a terrorist operation. There were 750 gigabytes of data&mdash;that is 66,000 ft-worth of data&mdash;that would be printed out and have to be investigated. Just with the events of <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-07">7 July</phrase>, there are two warehouse-fulls of exhibits.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.0/2">We know that each of these terrorist operations has links to abroad. We know, for example, that it took two weeks, just in respect of the bomb factories in Leeds, to make them safe. That is what the police have set out time and again. That is why it is important that they have this power, as they say, to make our country safer, and they have given details of why they say that these powers are necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.0/3">Yes, it is true that we have agreed a sunset clause. Why? Because it is important. If people have these concerns, and I understand them, let us test it over the year. Let us see if the worries that people have are justified, or not. That is a reasonable thing to put forward. We have an independent review of the system&mdash;Lord Carlile will also report on it&mdash;but let us send out a signal from the House that, when it comes to defeating terrorism, we are going to give the police the powers that they need and back them.</p>

	<p pid="a.299.1/1">First, Andy Hayman's letter and document set out very clearly why the 90 days are necessary. Let me explain again the basic argument of the police. Most reasonable people would see what they are trying to say. Because of the nature of the new terrorism that we face, because the terrorists want to kill people without limit&mdash;in July they killed 50 people in London, but they would have killed 500 had they been able to do so&mdash;when the police are investigating whether or not a conspiracy is taking place, they are naturally inclined to charge these people, to take them and arrest them, earlier than they otherwise would. If they make a mistake about the particular gestation period of the conspiracy and they get it wrong&mdash;they might think that the conspiracy is in its early stages, but in fact it is well advanced&mdash;we could end up with mass casualties on our streets. For that reason, the police say that this is a completely different situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.1/2">We need to be able to lift these people earlier and accumulate evidence to charge them after arrest. The number of people, for example, who have been kept for over seven days since the new powers were introduced is just over 30, so we are not talking about large numbers of people, but they may be the crucial difference between saving this country from a terrorist attack and not doing so. The right hon. and learned Gentleman said that we will alienate minority communities, but it is sad that he should make that argument.&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> The Muslim community in this country is as determined as any other part of our community to defeat terrorism. Its members do not want to be told that they are against this because it alienates them&mdash;they want these people dealt with and arrested. In the end, if this is the best argument that the right hon. and learned Gentleman can make, I suggest that he and his colleagues ask themselves whether they really think that this is where the Conservative party should be.</p>

	<p pid="a.304.1/1">The purpose of the reforms is to do two things: first, to ensure that we continue pathways into work, which gives people on incapacity benefit support and help in leaving the benefit and getting back into the workplace&mdash;all the evidence is that that is best for them as well as for the country&mdash;and secondly, to ensure that people only get on to incapacity benefit if they are genuinely entitled to it. That is the reason for tightening up the gateway. We have put an awful lot of money into the new deal and other programmes designed to help people off benefit and into work. It has been very successful; indeed, it is the reason why we now spend about &pound;5 billion a year less on benefits than we did in 1997. That is the spirit in which we will take forward incapacity benefit reform. I think that most hon. Members who know about the issue know that reform is necessary.</p>

	<p pid="a.306.1/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/2" class="indent" pwmotiontext="yes">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to make provision for the mental health and special learning needs of convicted prisoners; and for connected purposes.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/3">The Bill is specific in trying to address the problems that affect a significant proportion of our prison population. I introduce it because I believe that the way in which our penal system cares for those with mental health needs at the start of the 21st century is a stain on our society.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/4">Daniel Meehan, a young constituent of mine, had always been a troubled young man. He had a history of mental illness and drifted in and out of prison throughout his adult life. Daniel had been diagnosed as suffering from a series of mental illnesses, including the antisocial personality disorder, Tourette's syndrome, from the age of 17. He had spent around half his life in prison but he never received the help and treatment that he needed to tackle his problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/5">Instead of rehabilitation, Daniel was left exposed and fell foul of the problems that, all too often, vulnerable people face in prison. He developed a heroin addiction while in jail and started to abuse alcohol. In September last year, on his discharge from prison, he was left homeless, without his medication or even any clothes. He was bailed by the courts to his father's address. When his father was not at home, he looked for somewhere else to stay and, as a result, he was rearrested for breaking his bail conditions and taken back into custody. His mother and sister desperately tried to arrange specialist care for Daniel and eventually arranged for a social worker to visit him in Lewes prison. However, on the same day the social worker was due to visit, he was moved to Her Majesty's prison Weare, a floating prison off Dorset.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/6">Neither the social worker nor Daniel's family had been made aware of the transfer, yet the prison system somehow expected a prisoner with a long history of mental illness to rearrange the appointment himself. Daniel's complex needs were never properly assessed. Alone and without the support he needed, Daniel died at his father's house in January this year, aged 29. The coroner returned an open verdict on the death, but to most of us who had seen his case develop, we have no doubt that suicide would have been the more appropriate verdict.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/7">Daniel's family freely admit that he was a difficult man, but time and again, over almost 10 years, the prison system consistently failed to address his problems. As Daniel's sister, Mrs Meehan-Bissett, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/8" class="indent">&quot;Prison was not the answer for someone like Daniel, he needed rehabilitation. He died due to neglect. The prison authorities cannot be bothered with someone like Daniel . . . There needs to be somewhere for people like Daniel to go. If you need to lock them up, lock them up, but not without anything to do all day.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/9">The Government response to the Home Affairs Committee report on the rehabilitation of offenders, which was published in January 2005, stated that there were firm commitments that, by 2004:</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/10" class="indent">&quot;All prisoners with severe mental illness would be in receipt of treatment and that no prisoner with a serious mental illness would leave prison without a care plan&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/11">In Daniel's case, it is all too clear that those rules were not followed. Many hon. Members are aware of similar cases from our constituencies, so it is important to understand the extent of the problem.</p>

There will, at any one time, be around 5,000 prisoners with a severe mental illness&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-02">2 December 2004</phrase>; Vol. 428, c. 247W.]</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/14">Similar findings were published in a report by the Prison Reform Trust, supported by the Nuffield Foundation, into the mental health of women prisoners. It found that two thirds of women in prison show symptoms of at least one neurotic disorder such as depression, anxiety and phobias. More than half suffer from a personality disorder. Yet, among the general population, less than one fifth of women suffer from those disorders.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/15">The report found that half the women in prison are on prescribed medication such as anti-depressants or anti-psychotic medicine and there is evidence that the use of medication increases while in custody. Of all women who are sent to prison, a terrifying 40 per cent. say that they have attempted suicide at some time in their life.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/16">Research by Oxford university into suicide rates for younger offenders is even more shocking. The analysis of suicide rates in England and Wales from 1978 to 2003 found that the difference was particularly striking in 15 to 17-year-olds. Offenders in that age group were 18 times more likely to kill themselves than those in the general prison population. Depressingly, the report concluded that</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/17" class="indent">&quot;half those who commit suicide in prison have a treatable mental illness.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/18">If those illnesses were indeed treatable, it means that those suicides could have been prevented.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/19">The problem goes far beyond mental health; there are also too many prisoners who have serious learning difficulties. According to Home Office statistics, the prevalence of poor educational attainment among prisoners is shocking. Fifty-five per cent. of prisoners had a reading ability of level 1 or below&mdash;the educational level for an 11-year-old. That proportion rises to 67 per cent. in young offenders&mdash;in other words, two thirds of young offenders have the reading ability of an 11-year-old or younger child. In spelling, 79 per cent of prisoners were at level 1 or below, with that figure rising to 87 per cent. in young offenders. In numeracy, those rated at level 1 or below represented 69 per cent. of the general prison population, and 78 per cent. of young offenders, so the frightening truth is that about three quarters of young offenders are illiterate and innumerate. Despite this, however, the average hours of education in prison were under six hours a week per prisoner in 2002, and only slightly higher in young offender institutions. As a result, most of them are almost as illiterate and innumerate when they leave prison as when they start their sentence.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/20">This Bill is not about making excuses for those who break the law. One essential pillar of prison is that it should act as a deterrent to those thinking of committing crime and punish those who have broken the law. But prison works only if it also rehabilitates. As one governor said to me:</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/21" class="indent">&quot;We are very good at incarceration, but not at rehabilitation.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/22">A prisoner without rehabilitation is a prisoner who will offend again. So, the mental health and learning needs of prisoners must be addressed if we are truly to have a prison system that meets those two core goals.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/23">The Bill that I am proposing is a simple one. Where it has been established that a criminal has mental health needs, there would be a legal requirement for those needs to be professionally and thoroughly assessed at the start of their sentence. For all prisoners, an assessment would be required of their educational needs. Those with mental health requirements would be detained only in an establishment with specialised facilities, and with staff trained to deal with them. A pathway programme of support would have to be developed to ensure that their mental needs were met. Those needing educational attention would receive a more focused programme of tuition, instead of the haphazard tuition that they currently receive, and it should focus on skills training as well, to give them some hope of employment when they leave. As prisoners with mental health problems are now treated by the NHS, the primary care trust budgets covering this treatment should be ring-fenced to ensure that the funds to finance prisoner care cannot leak away into other areas of health care.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/24">The objective of the Bill is not to create prison asylums surrounded by barbed wire&mdash;far from it. The Bill seeks to ensure that prisoners with mental health needs are kept in an establishment in which those needs are addressed first and foremost, and which works to support their rehabilitation. In no way does it undermine the principle that many people need to be kept away from society, for the good of society and for their own good, but it does mean that they will be given the care and medical support that they need.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/25">I have visited a number of young offender institutions. They are the most depressing places I have ever been to, and I certainly do not know how we can rehabilitate someone if we lock them up in a 9 ft by 5 ft cell for 18 hours a day or more. And when those prisoners have mental health problems or special learning needs, this becomes a hopeless task unless rehabilitation is at the forefront of the approach. Through specialised and focused rehabilitative methods, the prison system can make major inroads into reducing reoffending. But rehabilitation must be more responsive to the often complex problems of prisoners, which have all too often contributed to them being in prison in the first place, and will have them returning there time and again if they go unresolved.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/26">The case of Daniel Meehan is a tragic one. A young man with profound mental health needs died because he did not receive the help that he needed. At the start of the 21st century, that is something that should shame us all. We have the power to do something about this. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.310.2/1">I will not seek to divide the House on the programme motion, but I should point out to the Home Secretary that while we welcome the concession that has been made, the practical reality is that we still have far too short a time to consider the amendments tabled for this afternoon. Even at this late stage, I hope that he might consider taking advice on whether further time can be made available. Let me explain why.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.2/2">We will start with a debate on the period of detention, which is a subject of considerable controversy. Given the way in which the procedures of the House operate, and the fact that the Government have tabled amendment No. 55, which changes the period from three months to 90 days, anyone wishing to have the 28-day amendment considered must first vote on Government amendment No. 55. We will therefore have to have two votes, whereas one on the 28 days alone might have been necessary otherwise. I am not clear as to why that has come about, except to provide a delay mechanism in the time that the House has for consideration. As a consequence, the reality must be that new clause 8 on stop and search, which was tabled by a Government Back Bencher, and which, I believe, merits the consideration of the House, is most unlikely to receive any consideration whatever. In the context of trying to build consensus, that must be highly regrettable. There is no reason why that should have to happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.2/3">When we move on beyond the three-hour break, when we will probably have had a couple of votes, and the stop and search matters will not have been considered, we will have five groups of amendments to consider, all of which are of importance, and three hours in which to do it. We might well have time to deal with the offences under clauses 1 and 2, which remain controversial because the Government concessions do not appear to change radically the way in which indirect incitement to terrorism can still be committed negligently. If we have a full debate on that subject, however, which greatly exercised the Committee last week, there must be a danger that we will never get to the glorification clauses, which, as we know from last week, were the subject of enormous controversy. If the Home Secretary wishes to avoid the suspicion that the Government are trying procedurally to close down the debate on those clauses, it would be wise to give us more time. Without filibuster in any sense, we will have difficulty in reaching those clauses.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.2/4">I worry, and I shall judge the matter by what happens this afternoon, that we might see a procession of Government Back Benchers put up to prolong the debate on offences under clauses 1 and 2, so that debate is prevented on the question whether a glorification element in incitement to terrorism should remain in the Bill. That would be a scandalous state of affairs. I look to the Home Secretary to provide guidance, as the debate takes place, to ensure as far as is possible that that does not happen.</p>

	<p pid="a.312.5/2">We will not divide the House, because I want to get on, but even now I urge the Home Secretary to consider whether we cannot have more time. I also seek an assurance from him that we will do our level best to get through all the groups of amendments.</p>

	<p pid="a.313.0/1">I took exception to very little that was said by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1394" name="Dominic Grieve">the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve)</phrase>. Like him, we consider the timetable motion defective, but like him I see no reason for us to divide the House on it. I accept the Home Secretary's point that some small measure of protection for the business has been made available, and that small amount of extra time is indeed welcome. Nevertheless, without second-guessing the way in which today's business will proceed, I think it very likely that we shall not go beyond the first string of amendments before the first knife falls after three hours. As the hon. Member for Beaconsfield pointed out, that will leave the stop-and-search provisions proposed in new clause 8 entirely undiscussed. Surely that is too important a subject to leave this House without any proper discussion being placed on the record.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.0/2">I also think that a great deal of important business will remain undiscussed under the second group of amendments. The House will have to choose between holding its tongue and restricting its comments on clause 1 and the question of intention if we are to secure any meaningful discussion on the crucial question of glorification. As a result, questions as fundamental as the definition of terrorism itself will almost certainly be left undebated. And as a result of that, the only meaningful scrutiny will be carried out in the other place. If the Government are content to proceed in that way, they cannot then complain that the unelected House has interfered with or changed the Bill when it makes the amendments that are inevitable.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.0/3">The programme motion strikes me as an exceptionally inappropriate way for the Government to order our business. I hope that, even at this stage, they may see sense and allow further time tomorrow if necessary.</p>

	<p pid="a.313.1/1">I do not wish to be churlish, and I congratulate the Home Secretary on producing a programme motion that is an improvement on the previous position. I certainly will not vote against it, and I am happy to congratulate the right hon. Gentleman on having listened to the complaints that we made before the general election about the time allocated to a similar Bill. He has tried to respond according to the standards of today's practice, and the House is in his debt to that extent.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.1/2">It is, in fact, the standards of today's practice on which I wish, briefly, to comment. As well as trying to avoid being churlish in the House&mdash;I hope&mdash;I try to avoid overdoing the &quot;senior Member of the House&quot; bit, and lamenting the fact that things are not what they were. But things are dramatically different from what they were, and I cannot hold my tongue on this occasion.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.1/3">I believe that if such a controversial Bill involving such changes in individual liberty had been produced 10 years ago by a Conservative Government with such a timetable, there would have been a major row. Twenty years ago, such an allocation of time for a Bill of this kind would have been regarded as laughable, and it would not have been entertained by the usual channels during the Thatcher Government. Thirty years ago, if a Conservative Government had proposed a Bill of this kind, several days of debate would have been allowed before any guillotine curtailing debate would have even been contemplated. Had anyone tried to force through a guillotine of this severity, I should have expected the sitting to be suspended as Labour Members caused disorder and began to run away with the Mace, or something of the kind, to give visual expression to their constitutional outrage.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.1/4">There is a serious point behind all this. I think that the House is becoming accustomed to a shortness of debate and a lack of scrutiny of legislation that is on the verge of becoming ridiculous, given the complexity of this Bill. I see no reason whatever why the House should have to rise shortly after 7 pm today and at a similar time tomorrow. The suspension of the rule to allow us at least to sit on through the evening until such time as the Government's business managers decide to try to call a vote to end the debate would constitute a very elementary extension of debating time, which would cause merely minor inconvenience to a few Members and no real affront to the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.1/5">I also agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2006" name="Alistair Carmichael">the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael)</phrase> that the present situation underlines the case for not tampering with the powers of the House of Lords. I strongly believe that the House of Lords should be reformed; it lacks legitimacy and we need a much stronger Upper House. But if this House is to continue to deal with matters of this importance in such a cursory fashion, it becomes all the more important that the whole Bill be properly scrutinised, and that the Lords force us to look again at, and to discuss in more detail, some of the other very serious aspects of this Bill.</p>

But apart from that&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Ron Brown played a secondary role in Mace-wielding. I never wielded it at all, as I remember, but never mind.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.0/2">I support <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1394" name="Dominic Grieve">the comments of the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve)</phrase>, and I have a very specific reason for being concerned about this programme motion.&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> During last week's debate&mdash;at which I seem to remember <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2010" name="Jim Murphy">the hon. Member for East Renfrewshire (Mr. Murphy)</phrase> was not even present&mdash;the Home Secretary was forced to concede, by letter to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2006" name="Alistair Carmichael">the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael)</phrase>, that</p>
	<p pid="a.314.0/3" class="indent">&quot;I can confirm that the Lord Advocate has not been asked for, or expressed any view on the proposed extension of the maximum period of detention without charge.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.314.0/4">That admirably candid admission on the part of the Home Secretary is somewhat at variance with the briefings from the Scottish Executive, and was extracted after debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.0/5">Understandably, many Scottish colleagues who are interested in whether the senior Scottish law officer has been consulted on these matters wanted to pursue the same question today in respect of stop-and-search, glorification and the commission of offences abroad. If this timetable renders reaching these crucial matters impossible, the right of Scottish Members to find out whether the Lord Advocate has been consulted on them, and how this Bill interrelates with Scottish criminal law, will also be curtailed.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.0/6">Of course, the Home Secretary would be straying out of order if he gave us that information in discussing other amendments to, and clauses and passages in, the Bill. But I fear that this timetable will make it simply impossible to pursue the entirely legitimate questions of whether Scotland's senior law officer has been consulted on any of the Bill's crucial parts, and whether the Home Secretary was in blissful ignorance of the Lord Advocate's advice on glorification, the commission of offences abroad and stop-and-search, as he candidly admitted he was in respect of 90-day detention.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.0/7">In terms of the protection of the House, this programme motion deals with key matters. In terms of the protection and legitimate rights of Scottish Members, and our ability to question what bearing Scottish criminal law has on these proceedings, this motion is far too strict.</p>

	<p pid="a.315.0/1">I have yet to be able to take part in debates on this Bill because of other duties in the House, and I shall be very brief.I want to endorse most strongly everything said by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1794" name="Kenneth Clarke">my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)</phrase>. During Question Time today, the Prime Minister left the House in no doubt that he believes this to be the most important issue that the House currently faces. I agree. I want to treat the votes in this debate as free votes. I want to try to vote in what I consider to be the national interest, regardless of party, and I know that many Members&mdash;in all parts of the House&mdash;take a similar line, whatever view they may reach on the question of 90 days, 28 days and the other issues before us.&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i></p>
	<p pid="a.315.0/2">However, if the Prime Minister truly believes that this is the most important issue&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> The Home Secretary is busy talking at the moment and it would be quite a good idea if he listened. If the Home Secretary genuinely wishes to create a consensus&mdash;he has tried to listen on certain occasions, and this programme motion is a modest advance on what we had before&mdash;it is an insult not just to this House but to the people whom we represent to deny this House the opportunity adequately to discuss crucial aspects of this Bill that will affect, in one way or another, directly or indirectly, a vast number of our constituents. We are likely to take decisions today that could have a profound effect on the structure of our society, our criminal law and many other things. We should be able to debate these issues, as we could in former days, at not inordinate but adequate length. There is absolutely no opportunity afforded in this programme motion to debate issues such as glorification and stop-and-search at adequate length.</p>
	<p pid="a.315.0/3">Even at this very late stage, I appeal to the Home Secretary, through you, Mr. Speaker, the defender of the interests of this House, to stop sidelining Parliament and to allow this House&mdash;which has, or ought to have, primacy within Parliament&mdash;adequately and properly to scrutinise, so that the other place can then concentrate more properly on what it ought to deal with: the detail and minutiae. As it is, we are giving the House of Lords the duty and obligation to examine matters that we have addressed for not even half a minute. That is disgraceful.</p>
	<p pid="a.315.0/4">Over the past eight years, we have seen a progressive sidelining of Parliament and an over-mighty Executive seeking to use their muscle. Yes, I accept that the Prime Minister believes that he is acting in the country's interest. I am one of those who have never impugned his good faith on these issues, but I say through the Home Secretary to the Prime Minister, who is not here, that he is not behaving as a Prime Minister who honours parliamentary democracy ought to behave. He should recognise that in a parliamentary democracy, a fragile thing that our forefathers fought for&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Indeed; our foremothers also fought for it. The Prime Minister should recognise that in such a democracy, it is crucially important that we, who between us represent all the people of this country, should have adequate opportunity to debate the crucial issues of the day. This programme motion does not give us that opportunity.</p>
	<p pid="a.315.0/5">I fully accept why <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1394" name="Dominic Grieve">my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve)</phrase>, who has handled this matter with great sensitivity and skill from the Front Bench, is not going to seek to divide the House. I certainly will not seek to do so from the Back Benches, even though we should divide, because we need to move on to the issues of substance. But the fact that we cannot move on to all those issues is not only regrettable, but a blot on the Government's democratic integrity. I again appeal to the Home Secretary, even at this late stage, to let the House sit until at least 10 o'clock tonight, thereby giving us another three hours over and above what the Order Paper allows.</p>

	<p pid="a.316.0/1">I simply do not believe that there is enough time to understand the unexplained contradictions between the philosophy behind this legislation and that behind the Northern Ireland peace process. I have persistently sought to work constructively with the Government&mdash;and particularly the Northern Ireland Office&mdash;to ensure significant progress in Northern Ireland, and to that extent I agree that the Government can take some credit for what has happened there. But I find very frustrating the virtual absence in these debates&mdash;probably owing to time pressure&mdash;of any significant explanation as to why the Home Office takes such a different approach to this legislation from the one we are expected to support for Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.0/2">The Government need the time to explain why, for example, internment, which was universally regarded as having failed in the Province, is now proposed as a solution to international terrorism. There is a grain of explanation in the form of a comment yesterday by the Under-Secretary of State for Nor<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1800" name="Shaun Woodward">thern Ireland, the hon. Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Woodward)</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.316.0/3" class="indent">&quot;The Government are looking at a specific UK threat from a kind of terrorism different from that being discussed here.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee E,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-08">8 November 2005</phrase>; c. 15.]</p>
	<p pid="a.316.0/4">Well, it does not seem very different to the victims of terrorism in Northern Ireland. If the Government want our support and sympathy in these difficult times, they need to provide themselves with enough time to explain the apparent contradictions writ large&mdash;certainly in the eyes of Northern Ireland residents&mdash;as the Government increasingly try to suggest that there are two different kinds of terrorism. Furthermore, and perhaps ironically, only today Northern Ireland offences legislation is being published&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.317.1/1">Even more contradictions are thrown up by other legislation, but I shall not go into them now, Mr. Speaker.</p>
	<p pid="a.317.1/2">The Secretary of State should realise that his decision on the time for debate necessarily prevents a profound understanding of why the Government believe that they are being consistent and joined up in their thinking with regard to Northern Ireland terrorism and international terrorism. Of course the Government can force these things through in a short period, but I warn the Home Secretary that if he insists on doing so with inadequate explanation, not only will he create resentments in the Chamber, but the ramifications of the programme motion for today's Bill are likely to cause significant and practical obstructions that could well prevent the Government from passing other Bills that they desperately want passed in respect of Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.317.1/3">Let us have a fast debate if that is what the Home Secretary wants, but let us recognise that the Government will pay many times over in terms of the delay and obstruction that will take place, particularly in the other place, because our good will on Northern Ireland matters has been utterly exhausted.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-11-09a.317.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1370" speakername="Richard Shepherd" colnum="317"  time="13:11:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051109/debtext/51109-07.htm#51109-07_spnew3">
	<p pid="a.317.2/1">It was right for the Government to take the Committee stage on the Floor of the House, because the Bill affects every one of us and all those we represent. No one assembled here in the House doubts the importance of the issues before us. In fact, the Bill has many of the features that would, in the old days, have made it be viewed as a constitutional Bill. As a general rule, such constitutional Bills of major importance were never guillotined. Every one of us should have the opportunity to justify, query or give reason to our anxieties about the Bill. I am struck by the fact that we have not concluded any detailed scrutiny of the substance of the Bill before our consideration on Report and before Third Reading.</p>
	<p pid="a.317.2/2">My concern is that the debate is so staggered or staged that it seems almost impossible to reach some of the key concepts within the Bill. I therefore want to ask the Government whether this an act of cynicism. Is it a deliberate attempt to ensure that the House will not be able reach the provisions on stop and search, or perhaps on commission of offences abroad or glorification? I believe that denying the House of Commons the proper opportunity to examine the Bill does not serve the Government's own cause of arguing their case to the country.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-11-09a.318.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1463" speakername="John Bercow" colnum="318"  time="13:14:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051109/debtext/51109-07.htm#51109-07_spnew5">
	<p pid="a.318.1/1">I agree with those who have argued that the programme motion is unsound and unsatisfactory. It may represent an improvement&mdash;a modest one, at that&mdash;on previous procedure, but in view of previous procedure, that does not say much for it.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/2">I do not mind vouchsafing to the House, if you will permit me, Mr. Speaker, that at 7.29 yesterday morning, my wife gave birth to our second child&mdash;Frederick James, weighing in at 8lb 6oz and born in an excellent national health service hospital. You will appreciate, Mr. Speaker, and right hon. and hon. Members throughout the House will understand, that I am very keen indeed to take a decent period of paternity leave. Moreover, I have already informed my Whips&mdash;I emphasise, informed my Whips&mdash;that I intend to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/3">I happen to believe, however, that the issue&mdash;or, rather, the set of issues&mdash;before us today exceeds in importance any other issues before the House now or for the foreseeable future. To that extent, I agree with what the Prime Minister said at Question Time. Some of us had the privilege of contributing to the Queen's Speech debate earlier this year, and in that debate I made the gentle observation that if the Government were confident of their case on legislation to be put before the House, they should not be afraid of debate, but allow time for arguments and accept that other legitimate points of view can and should be put forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/4">In the context of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1370" name="Richard Shepherd">the programme motion, my hon. Friend the Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd)</phrase> raised the question of whether the Government were deliberately seeking to circumvent debate. The question has been implicit and sometimes explicitly asked as to whether Ministers are afraid of the arguments. My honest view is that the Prime Minister is not afraid of the arguments and I do not think that the Home Secretary is afraid of the arguments. I am not even going to accuse the Home Secretary, in the context of the programme motion, of engaging in some sort of deliberate Machiavellian parliamentary contrivance. If I were so to suggest, it would probably be unworthy.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/5">What I am going to suggest is something that I think is as least as serious. The charge is not that the Government are afraid of debate or that they are trying to shut people up. The charge is that the Government are, frankly, careless of and insensitive to the wishes of Back Benchers who want the opportunity to put their legitimate point of view and to receive responses to it. It seems to me that that was the kernel of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2015" name="Patrick Cormack">the argument developed by my hon. Friend the Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack)</phrase>, who is recognised throughout the House as a truly outstanding parliamentarian. He knows that there is a history in this place of considering these matters seriously and at length.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/6">I say in all sincerity to the Home Secretary, whose sincerity I respect and whose patriotism I acknowledge: what harm would be done either to the Government or to the national interest if we were to debate the Bill tonight until 10 o'clock? What would be the harm if the Government were to acknowledge that there was a welter of different opinions around the House and to let us have another day for debate? What damage would be inflicted; what disadvantage would be incurred?</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/7">If the Home Secretary is looking just a bit irritated, as I suspect he is, it might be because he thinks that he knows that he has got it right, that the Government know what they are doing and that hon. Members must be told to let the Government get their business through. What I would say to the Home Secretary is that he should accept that in this, the cockpit of parliamentary democracy, we should debate the issues fully and comprehensively. We should have that opportunity, but we are being denied it. If I am prepared to stay here until 10 o'clock at night or to have another day's debate on issues that are far more important than most matters that the House will consider, why are Ministers not prepared to allow that? Why cannot we have a proper representation on the Government Front Bench for these important debates?</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/8">Might I say that there was a time in the House&mdash;a time that my hon. Friend the Member for South Staffordshire will well recall&mdash;when on occasions of this sort, the Prime Minister was customarily in his place to hear the arguments and listen to alternative points of view? What is happening to our parliamentary democracy?</p>

	<p pid="a.328.3/1">I regret to say that the right hon. Gentleman has misunderstood the point that assistant commissioner Hayman made. His point was that the modern terrorism that we face is different in certain important respects from the terrorism that we had to face in the past in Northern Ireland. It is the case that the modern terrorism that we face is a challenge for police in Northern Ireland today in a very direct way, which is why the Chief Constable is entitled to make his comments, not as a point of general principle but in terms of dealing with the modern terrorism that he has to face.</p>

	<p pid="a.331.3/1">May I take the Home Secretary back to the issue of the Lord Advocate? From what he told the House a moment or two ago, it appears that the Lord Advocate's view is that the period should be the same both north and south of the border, and that the authorities in Scotland should co-operate with the authorities in England. But it does not appear that the Lord Advocate endorsed the principle of 90 days. Is that correct?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-11-09a.334.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1745" speakername="Charles Clarke" colnum="334"  time="14:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051109/debtext/51109-12.htm#51109-12_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.334.0/1">My hon. Friend makes two points, one of which I do not accept and the second of which I do accept. I simply do not accept her description of the Prime Minister's motivation in terms of party politics. I do not think that it is accurate; I do not think that it is his personal motivation; and I certainly do not believe that it is the Government's motivation. As I said on Second Reading, in Committee and at other times, the question that all Members must address is, how can we do our duty as Members of Parliament in dealing with the national interest and national security.</p>
	<p pid="a.334.0/2">I do not doubt for a second that these are difficult questions for all of us&mdash;for my hon. Friend, for myself and for every other hon. Member&mdash;but I do not believe that we have at any stage taken this issue from the point of view of party politics. Some have interpreted it that way. We only have to look at the media on any day of the week to see that they provide a prism through which they say that all this debate is about party politics in some respect or another. I have tried personally, when interviewed on the media, to rebut that suggestion because I do not think that it is true. I do mean that I think that it is right but not correctly done; I think that it is an inaccurate description of the state of affairs.</p>
	<p pid="a.334.0/3">I now turn to the point about consensus, about which my hon. Friend asks me. I believed and hoped as late as last Thursday that we could achieve a consensus with the main Opposition parties about the length of time that should be used. I also agree with her point that I was talking about consensus with Labour Members as well as with the Opposition parties on this question. That is what motivated me in the way that I operated. She may recall&mdash;I think that she will&mdash;that I asked every Member of the House to go back to their constituencies last weekend and take the view of their constituents, talk to them and ask their police and whoever else about these questions. I hope that she would agree that many Members have done precisely that: they have gone back and talked to people&mdash;I am sure that she is one of those who have done just that&mdash;and everyone will make their judgments on that basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.334.0/4">When I had the meetings with the leadership of the Opposition parties at 11 o'clock last Monday morning in my office&mdash;I do not think that the hon. Members for Hornsey and Wood Green (Lynne Featherstone) and for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve), who were present for the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives, would contest this&mdash;they said that for their part there was no circumstances under which they would consider extending beyond 28 days the amount of time for which detention might operate. That was their considered view. There was a discussion about the period between 14 and 28 days. I was of the view, which has been my view throughout, that 28 days is not long enough to deal with the police case that we have, but I was ready to entertain discussions of a shorter period that could arise. I said that publicly in a variety of circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="a.335.0/1">I shall give way when I have finished what I have to say on this.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.0/2">I then came to consider the best way to deal with this situation, and the view that I came to was that there ought to be three key areas in which I ought to try to respond to the House, the first of which is the whole area of scrutiny, which we have been talking about already: the role of the High Court judge, the PACE code and the various safeguards in place, which are changes from the position when I was speaking in the House last Thursday.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.0/3">The second group of issues are those that we will debate later this afternoon relating to intent, glorification and the definition of terrorism&mdash;the range of issues that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1827" name="John Denham">my right hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham)</phrase> particularly was pressing from our side of the argument and, in fairness, were expressed by a number of hon. Members on both sides of the House. I felt that I should try to respond to those points, and I believe that we have done so today, although they will be debated later in the process.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.0/4">Finally, against all my best instincts&mdash;I am not a great fan of sunset clauses in general&mdash;I thought that the way to deal with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1415" name="Clare Short">the uncertainty that my right hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Clare Short)</phrase> and many other Labour as well as Opposition Members have about the length of time was to say that there would be a period, 12 months, after which clause 23 would run out and the House would decide, on the evidence and on the basis of what had happened in those 90 days, whether or not it should be extended. I am ready to commit, and do commit, to a report to the House on the operation of the law on the 90-day period when the House has to decide it.</p>

	<p pid="a.337.1/1">It is striking that the right hon. and learned Gentleman makes his point in such a way. He is right in one essential respect: we tried to work with him and his colleague, the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden, over the summer to address these questions. He is right that we organised a briefing on Privy Council terms to consider such questions for him and his right hon. Friend. He says that he is not convinced by the case. He is entitled not to be convinced by the case&mdash;that is his right&mdash;but I believe that the case put by DAC Clarke to the Joint Committee on Human Rights was a powerful and effective argument for a 90-day provision.</p>

However, according to documents released to the Home Affairs Committee, when the Government agreed to support the 90-day proposal, they had received only two documents from the Association of Chief Police Officers&mdash;the ACPO press release of <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-21">21 July</phrase> and a two-page summary of two difficult cases, neither of which is analysed to provide a case for 90 days.

	<p pid="a.342.0/1">My right hon. Friend has been challenged strongly by the Leader of the Opposition and others for not tabling an amendment today proposing a detention period of less than 90 days but more than 28 days. Is not the real political point, however, the fact that the Opposition parties have already stated in principle that they would not support a detention period of more than 28 days, irrespective of the case made by the police?</p>

	<p pid="a.342.5/1">I shall make some progress, but before I conclude I shall give way to one or two of those who want to intervene.</p>
	<p pid="a.342.5/2">I emphasise, as I said on Second Reading, that we are dealing with a very different threat now from the one we faced in previous decades. Recent terrorist plots have been designed to cause mass casualties with no warnings&mdash;I emphasise, no warnings, sometimes using suicide and with the threat of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear weapons.</p>
	<p pid="a.342.5/3">Some hon. Members have commented that terrorist cases are no more difficult to prosecute than complex fraud cases, but I argue that there is a very substantive difference between the two. In complex normal cases, the police may build a case before arresting an individual. It may also be possible to catch criminals red-handed in the act of committing a crime such as fraud, as the repercussions are not so great if the crime is committed. The need to ensure public safety by preventing mass casualty attacks that could be catastrophic in their effect means that it is necessary to make arrests in terrorist cases far earlier in the process than in other cases. That often means that much less evidence has been gathered at the point of arrest, so more time will be needed to gather sufficient evidence to charge a suspect.</p>
	<p pid="a.342.5/4">Moreover, terrorist networks are often international, which means that highly complex inquiries have to be undertaken in many different jurisdictions. I remind the House again of the investigations into the events of 7 and <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-21">21 July</phrase>, which yielded 38,000 exhibits that filled two warehouses, and so on. Terrorist networks are also now highly capable of using technology. In recent cases a large number, sometimes in the hundreds, of computers and hard drives have been seized. Much of the data on such computers and hard drives have been encrypted and take time to decrypt. The data then need to be analysed to incorporate the outcome of that analysis into an interview strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.342.5/5">Following the debates in the House and the request from hon. Members in all parts of the House for more substance, over the past few days I have consulted advisers from the National Technical Assistance Centre, whose experts deal with the hardest and most important decryption jobs. Their advice has been unequivocal. A 14 or even 28-day period will not allow them the time they need adequately to investigate the most heavily encrypted data. They have made it clear to me that the use of advanced encryption technology by those who pose a threat to law and order or the security of the country is becoming more widespread and is growing rapidly. Encryption is more pervasive, more complex and easier to use than ever before.</p>
	<p pid="a.342.5/6">That poses a significant challenge to police and investigators on two fronts. First, it means that even sifting the evidence to identify which computers require specialist investigation and decryption usually&mdash;the experts' word&mdash;takes a number of weeks. Each computer must be examined to assess what data can be easily gleaned and where heavyweight code-breaking is required.</p>
	<p pid="a.342.5/7">Secondly, even after the protected data sources have been identified, significant additional time may be needed to decode potential evidence. NTAC has advised me that this is an extremely challenging and time-consuming task, running in the majority of the hardest cases into weeks at the very least, and often even into periods of months. Taking all this together, the technical judgement of the professionals is clear and simple. They need more time to be able to deal with such challenges. We must honour that.</p>
	<p pid="a.342.5/8">Forensic requirements, too, are more complex and more time-consuming. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1673" name="John Battle">My right hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle)</phrase> made a tremendous speech last week about the bomb factory in his constituency and the issues raised by that case. We should take seriously the professional advice of the investigators, the police and the prosecutors about the time needed to enable investigators to reach conclusions.</p>
	<p pid="a.342.5/9">I shall give way now for the last time, then I shall wind up.</p>

	<p pid="a.343.1/1">I have had such conversations, and that goes partly to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1674" name="Keith Vaz">the answer that I have to my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz)</phrase> in response to his intervention. I am glad that on 7 and <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-08">8 July</phrase> and the subsequent weekend, there was a substantial programme of discussions between the police and the various communities in west Yorkshire, which were particularly affected. That was extremely impressive. I spoke to many people at the time who were committed to discussing exactly <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1659" name="Ann Cryer">the question raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Keighley (Mrs. Cryer)</phrase> with the communities from which the individuals came and which were most affected, in the same way as the issues in other cases were raised in Gloucester and other parts of the country. There is only one answer: intensive discussions between the police and the local community, local community leaders and local faith leaders. I say with humility that I do not need to give advice on that to, for example, the west Yorkshire force, because I believe they are committed to doing it. But my hon. Friend is right to say that if we make the changes here, it intensifies the need for such discussions.</p>

	<p pid="a.344.0/1">On community involvement, does the Home Secretary accept that if the legislation is passed, it will harden support within communities surrounding terrorist cells, because it will turn people into martyrs? Undoubtedly, people will be detained on a week on week basis, released and found to be innocent. They will go back into those communities and say, &quot;Look, this is the sort of state we are talking about and working against.&quot; Surely it will be hugely counterproductive.</p>

	<p pid="a.344.1/1">That is a serious point, to which I want to give some time. What my hon. Friend says is utterly wrong. It is totally wrong. If one talks, as my hon. Friends and I have done, to Muslim communities throughout the country, one finds that they are absolutely clear without equivocation that they want no part of this terrorism, they want no identification of the terrorism with what they do, and they want to take that forward. If my hon. Friend takes the trouble to examine the responses of even the families, let alone the families and friends, of those directly involved in the events of <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-07">7 July</phrase>, he will see that many of those individuals were deeply shocked and felt betrayed.

There is no doubt that Muslim communities stand four-square against terrorism, but there is also no doubt that a large section of Muslim youth, who are against terrorism, is profoundly alienated from the system, as it sees it. The co-operation of that section of Muslim youth in intelligence gathering is vital, and the danger is that the Bill will alienate it.</p>

	<p pid="a.345.4/1">I start on a sad note, because the Home Secretary's comments about this not being a politically partisan exercise were undermined by his final remark. I am conscious that I am speaking on behalf of a party that has seen friends and colleagues murdered by terrorists. The names are familiar to all hon. Members: Airey Neave, Ian Gow and Anthony Berry. This party has first-hand experience of terror, so the House can draw its own conclusions when it faces silly and, frankly, contemptible accusations that any party, least of all mine, is soft on security.</p>
	<p pid="a.345.4/2">The war on terror is, after all, a battle of hearts and minds. The Government have passed five terrorism Acts since they came to power&mdash;the Criminal Justice (Terrorism and Conspiracy) Act 1998, The Terrorism Act 2000, the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001, the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and, finally, the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005. Those Acts contain many worthwhile provisions, but none of them prevented the atrocities of <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-07">7 July</phrase>, so let us not pretend that we can win the war on terror by passing every single law that the Government throw up. We will win the war by actually being tough, rather than just talking tough.</p>
	<p pid="a.345.4/3">There is a lot that the Government could do. They could secure our borders by introducing a new border control force, which is something that we have often proposed, but they will not do it. They could fund the security services properly by scrapping plans for identity cards and spending the money on intelligence, but they will not do it. They could help to convict terrorist suspects by allowing the authorities to submit phone-tap evidence in court, but they will not do it. They could appoint one, single Minister to take control of our fight against terrorism, which has happened in other countries, but they will not do it.</p>
	<p pid="a.345.4/4">We will take no lessons from the Government about being tough on terrorism, because they have failed to take on board many of our proposals, which, although our proposals were not especially innovative, would have brought us into line with the rest of the world. On the crucial matter before us today&mdash;the period for which a suspect can be held without trial&mdash;we want toughness that will work.</p>
	<p pid="a.345.4/5">Like all hon. Members, we have been searching for a workable proposal and we welcome the Government's changes, which we proposed in many cases, such as better judicial scrutiny, new police and criminal evidence codes, which we hope&mdash;the Home Secretary did not address this point&mdash;will facilitate the interview of suspects after they are charged, and a clause, which is not a sunset clause, that requires the annual review of the legislation. It is right to point out that all those provisions were obtained only through parliamentary pressure from both sides of the House. The Government should also listen to what the House of Commons is saying about the duration of detention. On their own, those improvements to the Bill do not remove our responsibility to ensure that the detention is as limited in time as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.345.4/6">It is worth grasping what is at stake right at the start&mdash;the imprisonment of men and women without trial in the country that invented habeas corpus. We all accept that, when national security is imperilled, our instinctive support for civil liberties must be qualified and that detention without charge must sometimes happen. That means getting a difficult balance right, because if the period of imprisonment is too brief, the civil liberties of suspects may be protected, but the lives of innocent people may be endangered. If the period of imprisonment is too long, locking up people without charge risks becoming the first resort of the authorities rather than the last. In those circumstances, innocent people are imprisoned. Remember that a 90-day detention is the equivalent of a six-month jail sentence, and the risks include not only an affront to justice, but a public backlash, in which case legislators' mistakes will become recruiting sergeants for terrorists. The House knows the serious consequences for our national security and our civil liberties if we get the balance wrong in any direction.</p>

	<p pid="a.347.5/1">The hon. Gentleman will start terrible rumours if he is not careful.</p>
	<p pid="a.347.5/2">The initiative will lie with the police. When the Cabinet Office gave me a Privy Council briefing on the matter, I expressed my concern that the provision will take the pressure off the police to resolve situations quickly. After all, even 14 days is a damaging experience for someone who is innocent, so 90 days is an enormously damaging experience that could wreck lives, ruin jobs and destroy relationships. We must understand that this is a fundamental British freedom that should not be thrown away lightly.</p>
	<p pid="a.347.5/3">We recognise the Government's difficulties on this. It is of course a matter of judgment. We acknowledge that the world has changed since the IRA halted its terror campaign. New technology brings new security challenges. As the Home Secretary said in relation to the national technical assistance centre, the police and security services need more time to scour CCTV footage and to crack encrypted messages. The international dimension of Islamist terrorism also brings new challenges. That is why my hon. Friends made it clear in Committee that we agree with the Government that the current 14-day limit is too brief and propose its extension to 28 days. I believe that that proposal will find widespread support among Members around the House, including on the Government Benches. But the proposal before the House is not ours but the Government's. The Government propose a full 90 days. The House must therefore ask itself this question: have Ministers made a robust, convincing and evidence-based case, not for an extension, as there is a case for that, but for 90 days? I do not believe that they have.</p>

	<p pid="a.351.2/2">Before <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-07">7 July</phrase>, I analysed most of the instances of terrorism in the western world since 9/11 and examined the behaviour of the Opposition in the countries where they happened. I concluded that it was possible in some cases for Oppositions to score political advantage. Indeed, there was a change of Government in Spain. However, I also concluded that, whenever Oppositions did that, there was at least a risk, and generally a probability, that the primary beneficiaries were the terrorists, not western civilisation. I therefore took a stance for which I have been criticised&mdash;I believe by hon. Members of all parties but certainly by Conservative Members&mdash;of supporting anything that the Government introduced that I believed would be effective against terrorism.</p>

	<p pid="a.354.5/1">I will give way shortly, otherwise this speech will consist entirely of responses to interventions.</p>
	<p pid="a.354.5/2">It will doubtless be argued that what the police want, the police should have. What the police want carries real weight on this side of the House, but it is not in itself conclusive. If the police want 90 days and are given it because we do not want to stand in their way, what would the House say if they were to come back and ask for 100 days, 180 days, 360 days or two years?</p>
	<p pid="a.354.5/3">While we are at it, another point raised by the Minister was about the security services. Let no one claim that the security services want 90 days. Whitehall officials have reported that the security services have made &quot;no recommendation&quot; on the detention period. To return to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1409" name="John Baron">the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Billericay (Mr. Baron)</phrase>, let no one claim, either, that we need to bring our periods of detention into line with those of other countries. In Australia, where a murderous terrorist plot has just, mercifully, been foiled because of vigilant police action, there is fierce debate about an extension from two days to 14 days. Most of the other countries with similar judicial systems to ours have smaller, not greater, rights to detain without trial. On the evidence that we have, 90 days is simply too long, and too long by an order of magnitude.</p>
	<p pid="a.354.5/4">The relative leisure of the three-month time scale, compared with the present 14 days or&mdash;for that matter, 28 days&mdash;risks the imprisonment and consequent release without charge of innocent people. Those innocent people will be drawn disproportionately from one section of the community and there is a real risk in that community of a backlash on an unprecedented scale, not to mention the affront to justice that would be felt by all.</p>
	<p pid="a.354.5/5">When this matter was raised with the Home Secretary, it was clearly a sore point, because he went into his high-decibel overdrive, as he sometimes does. He started talking about how the leaders of the community were entirely onside against terrorism. Of course they are. Of course the heads of the Muslim communities, in particular, are onside against terrorism. They fear this more than we do, I suspect. The problem that they face is the problem of radicalisation&mdash;indeed, unknown radicalisation&mdash;of very small but dangerous parts of their own community, involving young men in their community. We must not make those community leaders' job more difficult, or, indeed, almost impossible.</p>

	<p pid="a.355.1/1">My hon. Friend makes a good point.</p>
	<p pid="a.355.1/2">It was clear from the beginning of this process that the majority of the British people actually favour 90 days, and I think that we should recognise that. I have been accused of opportunism; it is an odd kind of opportunism that takes the unpopular side of the argument, but never mind. A large number of people favour 90 days&mdash;perhaps this is true in the Muslim community as well&mdash;but they will do so only until the day it goes wrong, and we find that someone has been held for three months, lost his job, broken his family, yet comes out innocent. If he did not hate Britain when he went in, I suspect that he would have a grudge when he came out. That is the situation that we have to look forward to. In the aftermath of <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-07">7 July</phrase>, I quite understand the imperative, but we must be absolutely balanced in the way we approach this issue, and think forward.</p>

	<p pid="a.358.3/1">Not at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.358.3/2">This debate is not about the Prime Minister's authority or the standing of the Government. If some of the media, the Opposition or Whips want to play it that way, it does not mean that they are right. I do not challenge the authority of the Prime Minister in any way. I want him to stay in office, and I want this Government to succeed. I spent 18 years in opposition, and I certainly do not want a change of Government. That might clarify the position for some of my hon. Friends who think that I am playing a different game.</p>
	<p pid="a.358.3/3">What this debate is actually about&mdash;it might seem odd or eccentric to mention this&mdash;is trying to reach the right balance between our traditional liberties, the rule of law, habeas corpus, and at <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1504" name="Shona McIsaac">the same time, in reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Cleethorpes (Shona McIsaac)</phrase>, trying to protect this country from acts of terror. As far as those who are in favour of 90 days are concerned, the balance has been reached. Clearly, however, I and my hon. Friends have tabled the amendment, on which I hope that there will be a Division, because we believe that the balance has not been reached with 90 days.</p>
	<p pid="a.358.3/4">It should be borne in mind that not a single life destroyed by the mass murderers on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-07">7 July</phrase> would have been saved if the clause had been in operation. In view of what I have just said, I am not putting that as an argument for not having detention for 14 days or 28 days, but we should bear the point in mind.</p>

	<p pid="a.360.3/1">I think I know the views of my two hon. Friends. May we just work on the assumption that I do not agree with them on this point?</p>
	<p pid="a.360.3/2">I do not accept for a moment that there is any question of a police state. I do not believe that my case for 28 days is so weak that I have to exaggerate. Nor do I believe that detention of this kind is like internment in Northern Ireland. Let me say this, however. For the entire 30 years, I was involved in the denouncing of IRA murderers and the atrocities that they committed. Who would deny&mdash;and I include Conservative Members&mdash;that internment served the interests of the IRA? Would anyone now deny the obvious?</p>
	<p pid="a.360.3/3">I know that we are not discussing internment, but is there not a danger that the Muslim community, the overwhelming majority of whom are as opposed to terrorism as we are, will nevertheless feel that they are being penalised and discriminated against? I again emphasise that their opposition to terrorism is no less than ours. Of course, among the victims of <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-07">7 July</phrase> were Muslims, Christians, Jews, Sikhs, Hindus&mdash;the terrorists make no distinction. Indeed, if we said to the mass murderers, &quot;There are Muslims who will be your victims,&quot; their response would be, &quot;If they're good Muslims, they will simply go to paradise earlier.&quot; So we know the sort of people whom we are dealing with.</p>

	<p pid="a.361.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1900" name="David Winnick">the hon. Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Winnick)</phrase>. In considering how they should discharge their duties in this House, Members&mdash;particularly new Members&mdash;would do well to remember the last few minutes of the hon. Gentleman's textbook contribution. He is right: we have to do what is right, even if it is unpopular. The Prime Minister said at Question Time earlier today that he would rather be right and lose than the reverse&mdash;a position with which Liberals and Liberal Democrats have become very familiar in the past 80-odd years.</p>
	<p pid="a.361.0/2">Given that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1608" name="David Davis">the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis)</phrase> referred to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1928" name="Mark Oaten">the absence of my hon. Friend the Member for Winchester (Mr. Oaten)</phrase>, I should first apologise to the House on his behalf. He has not been well this week, which is why he is absent. Such absence is, however, no indication whatsoever of a lack of commitment to this issue, about which he feels passionately.</p>
	<p pid="a.361.0/3">I do not feel any embarrassment in admitting candidly to the House that this is one of the most difficult issues with which I have had to struggle since being elected to this place in 2001. With the exception of the debates and votes in the run-up to the war in Iraq, this is by some considerable margin the most difficult decision that we have faced. Liberal Democrat Members realise and understand the nature of the threat posed by terrorism to our society and our democracy. We understand that the consequences will be severe in human terms if we get it wrong. However, we remain of the view that before going down the road that the Government have proposed for us, there must be solid evidence to justify it, and we remain of the view that, as of today, such evidence has not been provided.</p>

	<p pid="a.362.0/1">I understand that it is widely alleged that the <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-07">7 July</phrase> bombers were under some sort of surveillance and that there is enough evidence to suggest that they could have been charged with raising money for terrorism or other offences. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, if that is the case, we must have a thorough inquiry to learn the lessons? If it is true that we could have prevented what happened, looking further into what happened on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-07">7 July</phrase> might lead us to some answers regarding what we are debating today.</p>

	<p pid="a.364.6/1">No, I have to make some progress in the interests of allowing others to speak.</p>
	<p pid="a.364.6/2">We are charged as parliamentarians with listening to all contributions to debate and to striking a balance between conflicting and competing demands. That is what the Liberal Democrats have done. We have reached the conclusion that the Government have got the balance wrong and that 90 days will do more harm than good.</p>
	<p pid="a.364.6/3">I attended the Press Gallery lunch yesterday and heard the Metropolitan Police Commissioner address it. He talked about how it was necessary to question a suspect, often on forensic or other evidence, especially after a charge. His position was that the police would be barred from doing so. I accept that that is difficult under the laws of evidence as they stand, but on the basis of my understanding of the law of England and Wales, I must say that it is not already impossible. Even if it were, or if there were difficulties, those difficulties could be removed by the Home Secretary coming forward with revisions to the Police and Criminal Evidence Act code under which questioning is carried on.</p>
	<p pid="a.364.6/4">In Scotland, in my view, there would be no barrier to interview of suspects under caution. That is already done, and it might even be possible to give two procurators fiscal powers to raise a new petition with new charges on which they could conduct a judicial examination. That is not beyond the bounds of possibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.364.6/5">I must say this about the commissioner's comments yesterday: I question his reliance on the point about questioning suspects on new evidence. The notion that somebody who has been prepared to blow themselves up will, after 10 weeks in custody, somehow be ready to co-operate, having seen the error of their ways with the police, when confronted with a piece of forensic evidence, I find it difficult to accept. That sort of spin and overselling should give us pause for thought. In my view, and this was <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1973" name="Stewart Hosie">the point raised by the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie)</phrase>, it seems likely that the only basis on which that evidence might be forthcoming would be if the suspect had been ground down in the course of the 90 days, and that would constitute evidence that was unfairly obtained and which, as a result, would be inadmissible. That might leave us in a position in which the only time a suspect spends in custody is the 90 days prior to charge. How does that help the fight against terrorism? In our view, the bulk of cases are already adequately dealt with under the 14-day provision, and that will be sufficient.</p>
	<p pid="a.364.6/6">That brings us to what my hon. Friends and I will do tonight about the different votes available to us. We shall first oppose Government amendment No. 55, which seeks to replace three months with 90 days, for what that is worth. If we are successful, we shall support the hon. Member for Walsall, North on amendment No. 1. Hon. Members must be clear that we can get to a vote on amendment No. 1 only if we first defeat amendment No. 55.</p>

	<p pid="a.366.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is right to say that we must avoid circumstances in which people are detained with no good reason and that the length of time&mdash;14, 28 or 90 days&mdash;is not the issue. However, surely the review clause, which would bring the provisions back to Parliament with a report about how the powers had been used and give us the ability to change the law if necessary, provides protection and would mean that the police and the judges would ensure that people were detained only when absolutely necessary?</p>

We would not argue in the House for such leverage in relation to sex abuse. We would say that those involved must do the very best that they can because of the individual's potential to inflict huge damage on our society.</p>
	<p pid="a.368.3/3">I am bewildered by some of the arguments about terrorists that I have heard in the House. They may well be innocent individuals, but let us not forget that people are arrested in this country every day although they are innocent of the crimes that have been committed. We arrest them not for the joy of it, but because we believe that they may have committed a crime. We do great injustice to that individual, their family and their society, but we would not resist doing what we need to do to protect the greater good. So I will vote today for the 90-day period. Although I suspect that I know the weaknesses of the police and the criminal justice authorities better than most other hon. Members, I still will not deny them this opportunity.</p>

	<p pid="a.369.1/1">In my brief remarks last week, I said that we must think very carefully before rejecting the advice of professionals. I am also on record as saying that, so far as I am concerned, the case for an extension from 14 days is irrefutable, but I have yet to hear enough convincing argument that 90 days is a totally justifiable time, which will guarantee that the police and security services can do all that they need to do to turn intelligence into evidence that can support charges. It is simply their best professional estimate, and we must respect that. Indeed, the Home Secretary has said since last week that the 90-day figure is not crucial. So we are dealing with an estimate and it is up to us to make a judgment.</p>
	<p pid="a.369.1/2">One of the reasons why so much heat has been generated about this issue is that the Government have, only very late in the day, realised the necessity to explain and persuade. I accept that the Home Secretary has made genuine attempts in the past few days to explain more fully why this is the Government's position, but it has been too little, too late for many hon. Members. I am personally better informed than I was last week&mdash;I stress that I am speaking entirely for myself, because the Intelligence and Security Committee has not come to a view on this matter&mdash;but I believe that there is much more that can and should be put into the public domain in a more comprehensive effort to explain the complexities of the problems that face the police and the security services and why their professional advice is what it is.</p>
	<p pid="a.369.1/3">To be fair, the Home Secretary has gone further this afternoon than he went last week, but what we really need is a comprehensive description of the whole complexity of the problem, and what we are getting is bits and pieces&mdash;the Metropolitan Police Commissioner comes to the Press Gallery; the Home Secretary comes here; someone else gives an interview to a newspaper&mdash;but until someone produces the whole argument, I do not believe that any hon. Member can come to a complete and proper judgment. Whatever the result of the vote on the amendment may be, I urge the Home Secretary to do that before the Bill is considered further in another place and returns to the House. I shall be very happy to explain to and discuss with him some of the arguments that should be made public, but that would have to come from the Government, rather than from me.</p>
	<p pid="a.369.1/4">I am not going to vote against the proposal tonight because if it were defeated, we would simply vote on <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1900" name="David Winnick">the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Winnick)</phrase> and the House would inevitably have to make another choice that would not be factually based. The hon. Gentleman said when he spoke to the amendment that he had decided on a figure of 28 days only because it was double the last one, not because there was a compelling argument that it was the right answer.</p>
	<p pid="a.369.1/5">In Committee, many hon. Members agreed that the worst thing would be to simply arrive at a figure around which there was consensus, but which was not based on the needs and complexities of the situation that have led the professionals to tender the advice that they have. I am completely satisfied that an extension is fully justified. I am also satisfied, from what I have been told, that an extension to 28 days would be wrong and would not give the police and security services the tools that they need to cope with such a complex matter.</p>

	<p pid="a.371.6/1">I shall confine my remarks to amendment No. 63. I shall not accept interventions, except from Front-Bench spokespeople or from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1418" name="Lynne Jones">my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Lynne Jones)</phrase>, who tabled the amendment with me.</p>
	<p pid="a.371.6/2">I do not know whether its wording is right, but amendment No. 63 seeks to provide compensation for anyone who is released without charge after being incarcerated for more than 14 days but less than 90 days. They would receive compensation for financial losses. I apologise to Scottish Members, because I am a solicitor in England, so I am not using the terminology applicable in Scotland. However, people who are detained would not receive damages for injuries to feelings and so on&mdash;they would only be compensated for financial loss if, for example, they lost their house or job, and were thus deprived of their income.</p>
	<p pid="a.371.6/3">As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State acknowledged, the amendment would affect an extremely small number of people, as we are told that only a few people are likely to be held for more than 14 days and released without charge. Only a small proportion of that minority are likely to get into difficulties and be able to prove that they had suffered financial losses. The Bill is extraordinary legislation, and I do not intend that my amendment should be used as a precedent by people remanded in custody and acquitted, as their situation is not extraordinary.</p>
	<p pid="a.371.6/4">People who have been convicted and imprisoned wrongly, such as the surviving members of the Birmingham Six, received compensation. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1471" name="Chris McCafferty">My hon. Friend the Member for Calder Valley (Chris McCafferty)</phrase> helpfully mentioned the financial hardship faced in detention by people who are held without charge for more than 14 days. My amendment does not cover such individuals&mdash;it only deals with losses suffered after the event&mdash;but my hon. Friend made the case for such compensation. I am heartened that the Secretary of State agreed to look carefully at the amendment. It is a pity that he could not make a greater concession, but that is the nature of politics. I remind him and other Front Benchers that I am seeking genuine progress on the issue before the Bill leaves the other place.</p>

	<p pid="a.373.1/1">I will not give way at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.1/2">It is important that we do not forget those lessons. If we alienate people, they will not come forward. I am not saying that people in communities will ignore someone walking down the street with a bomb, but they will ignore the signs. They will ignore the individual in the mosque who is starting to stir up trouble. I know from my own experience that when we had heavy-handed regiments in parts of Belfast or in East Tyrone, the information dried up. People did not pick up the telephone to let us know that there were people down the road behaving suspiciously.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.1/3">The Government have argued that there is a difference between the terrorists in Northern Ireland and those whom we face now. Yes, of course, what the terrorists are trying to achieve by killing innocent people and how they are trying to achieve it is different, but the cause is not. The way to solve terrorism is no different. It is only when communities engage with the forces of law and order that we start to head such people off. Whatever has caused the current problems in France, how much will the Algerian community, the north African and Muslim communities help the forces of law and order in the next year or two? The answer is very little. We must be careful how we proceed if we take individuals out of communities, which will be predominantly Islamic communities, some in my constituency, and hold them without charge for 90 days.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.1/4">The Government have so far failed to give us a case that would be solved by detention for 90 days. I am not arguing from the human rights point of view. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1844" name="William Cash">My hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Mr. Cash)</phrase> would probably disagree with some of my suggestions, which go further than he would. Some of the Government's reasons are entirely bogus. Let us consider one&mdash;encryption. The Home Secretary will know that in some serious crime cases, investigators have failed for two years to crack the computer encryption. The Government cannot guarantee that every encrypted device will be unlocked in 90 days, so are we to expect that they will return in a year and ask for the power to lock people up for a further year because a new encryption technique has been invented? Is that what they are trying to say?</p>
	<p pid="a.373.1/5">Let us examine some of the other issues. I, like a number of my hon. Friends and probably Labour Members, received the letter from the chief constable or perhaps the template of such a letter, urging me to support the measures. I rang the person I was told to contact, who was one of the heads of special branch. I said to the police officer concerned, &quot;Let's look at some alternatives. Let's look at interviewing under charge.&quot; He said, &quot;That would really help to move matters along.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.373.1/6">I said, &quot;What about some of the restrictions on informers, because of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000?&quot; Some people might think that was a good thing. The Royal Ulster Constabulary and the Police Service of Northern Ireland did not think that those restrictions were good. It is interesting that the Home Secretary said in the House today that the police say we must, so we must, but when the police said we must not restrict special branch in Northern Ireland, the then Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland ignored those wishes.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.1/7">I asked the police officer, &quot;What about Iraq?&quot; He replied, &quot;Without the Iraq war, we probably wouldn't have had quite so many people queuing up to take part in some of the current problems&quot;. We must recognise that part of the problem we face today is due to previous legislation and current issues leading up to the debate today. The answer is not for the Government to come back to the House, take a short cut, lock people up for 90 days without trial and expect everything to be hunky-dory.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.1/8">If we take such a short cut, I am almost certain that we will have to return to the issue. We will still have bombs on the underground and terrorists preparing for attacks, because the causes still exist. What I learned in Northern Ireland is that as long as there is a cause, people will queue up to replace those who have been incarcerated, so we should not start with the principle that we learned so wrongly in 1972&mdash;that internment is the solution.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.1/9"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1415" name="Clare Short">The right hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Clare Short)</phrase> does not know this, but when I served in Northern Ireland, I knew her very well&mdash;she used to move around in a black Ford Escort. It was my job to know such things, and I also know that it took years to solve terrorism in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.1/10">If we act on the preventive principle, where will we stop? Why not go on to serious crime? Why do we not lift all the armed robbers? Why not go on to benefit fraud? Where do we draw the line on such issues?</p>

	<p pid="a.374.2/1">Is it not always true that there are two arguments for destroying human rights: one is, &quot;We have never had a situation like that before.&quot;; the other is, &quot;We have no intention of making it worse later on&quot;? Both those arguments are very dangerous, and this House should not accept them.</p>

	<p pid="a.374.4/1">My hon. Friend is making a superb speech. I put it to him that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1936" name="Patrick McFadden">the intervention by the hon Member for Wolverhampton, South-East (Mr. McFadden)</phrase>, who will see the point if he reflects on it, was extremely injudicious. Precisely the same argument could, and in due course will, be made in relation to members of paedophile rings who download and study computer files. At present, no request for detention for 90 days without charge has been made by the police, but if we start on the slippery slope, we will go further down it.</p>

	<p pid="a.388.2/1">I am only sorry that this debate is not as much of a draw as the main attraction earlier, but I will do my best to make it as interesting as possible. The amendments build on some of the concepts that were contained in the amendments tabled in Committee by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1608" name="David Davis">the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis)</phrase> and his hon. Friends.</p>
	<p pid="a.388.2/2">As the House will recall, we had quite a lengthy debate in Committee on the issue of intent and, more particularly, how we ensure that the offence of encouragement to terrorism in clause 1 of the Bill is workable&mdash;which is what I said I wanted it to be&mdash;but does not cast its net unduly wide. I undertook to examine that issue further because I wanted to ensure that we did not catch people who clearly were not in any way intending to encourage others to commit acts of terrorism. We have gone back to the drawing board and come up with a formulation that we hope meets those objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.388.2/3">The key amendment in this group is amendment No. 34, which replaces the existing clause 1(1). It provides that the offence in clause 1 can be committed in only two circumstances. Both of those circumstances were contained in amendments that we discussed last week, so the concepts have already been properly explored. The first set of circumstances is where a person makes or publishes a statement and intends it to be understood by its audience as an encouragement to carry out acts of terrorism. I do not think that anyone could object to that being a criminal offence, and we have put the word &quot;intends&quot; on the face of the Bill so there is complete clarity about the conduct that is meant.</p>
	<p pid="a.388.2/4">The second set of circumstances is where a person makes or publishes a statement and is reckless as to whether or not it is likely to be understood by his or her audience as an encouragement to carry out acts of terrorism. Again, for clarity, we have put the word &quot;reckless&quot; on the face of the Bill, and that was a word drawn from Opposition amendments in Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.388.2/5">We have also defined &quot;reckless&quot; for these purposes as being a case where the person could not reasonably have failed to have been aware of the consequences of his action. Again, I am sure that no one could object to this provision. If an individual makes a statement encouraging others to commit an act of terrorism and could not reasonably have failed to realise the likely consequences of his actions, that should clearly be an offence.</p>

	<p pid="a.392.1/1">I am glad that the hon. Gentleman appreciates that the formulation that we propose for the clause is fairly tightly drafted and does not cast the net too wide. Clearly, the individual circumstances are important. I have been asked on many occasions to speculate on what kind of phrases might make people fall foul of the provision. The only example that I have felt comfortable giving is where someone says, &quot;Wasn't it a fantastic thing that happened on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-07">7 July</phrase>?&quot; knowing that the likely effect is to encourage their audience to engage in acts of terrorism. We are genuinely trying to aim this legislation at that kind of formulation, not at all the wider examples. Sometimes, the offence has been stretched beyond the realms of possibility, and we have genuinely tried to narrow it down to the mischief that we are trying to target. The amendments narrow the provisions on the audience itself. The likely effect on the audience is the second limb of the offence, so there is a consideration of what is done and the likely effect of that on the audience.</p>

	<p pid="a.392.2/1">I hope that I can be constructive on this point. The Minister will be aware that I have tabled amendment No. 64. It would add to the recklessness test a determination of whether a person</p>
	<p pid="a.392.2/2" class="indent">&quot;is reckless as to whether the statement will have that effect&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.392.2/3">an encouragement or an inducement&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.392.2/4" class="indent">&quot;upon reasonable members of the public.&quot;</p>

The problem that we all have at present is that if I say something that I know that a very unreasonable member of the public might take to be an inducement, I would undoubtedly be caught.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-11-09a.401.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1824" speakername="David Heath" colnum="401"  time="18:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051109/debtext/51109-33.htm#51109-33_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.401.1/1">The Government are developing a prodigious talent for snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. They undertake a listening exercise, and agree that something is wrong with their Bill and try to find a way to resolve it. They go almost all the way towards securing the support of Members in all parts of the House, then they ruin it by quite extraordinary drafting. That is very regrettable. I would have hoped that last week's debate, which was perhaps in rather more high-flown terms than we are mustering this evening, might have persuaded the Government that they had to do the job properly. The result of last's week's vote might have indicated that were they not to do it properly, the Bill was highly unlikely to survive in this House or another place without further amendment. I regret that the Minister has come to the House with a rather unacceptable amendment.</p>
	<p pid="a.401.1/2">I want to return to the origins of what the Government are trying to do, with which I have a number of problems. First, I do not understand why the current incitement offences on the statute book are insufficient to deal with the issue, apart from the fact that they are not prosecuted. Many of us find ourselves increasingly impatient because the police and prosecuting authorities do not use the offences already there to deal with the problem. Undoubtedly, incitement offences could have been used on occasions against prominent individuals who would be caught by the prospective legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.401.1/3">Secondly, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1709" name="Robert Marshall-Andrews">the hon. and learned Member for Medway (Mr. Marshall-Andrews)</phrase> pointed out, incitement is the correct term in the context of such an offence, rather than encouragement. It worries me that such a mild term is used in a way that is open to all sorts of constructions, which we have yet to learn, as the matter has not been before a court. I also worry because we have still not secured&mdash;and I do not think that we will do so this evening&mdash;an adequate definition of terrorism and terrorist offences. Potentially, therefore, an offence can be drawn from a much wider field.</p>
	<p pid="a.401.1/4">I do not know whether the Minister intended&mdash;or whether she was simply wilfully reckless in the matter&mdash;to bring forward an amendment with a self-contradictory internal structure. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1394" name="Dominic Grieve">the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve)</phrase> ably set out, it applies two conflicting tests&mdash;the objective test of recklessness and the subjective test of recklessness&mdash;in relation to the same clause. It is recklessness of a high degree to consider what the court has expressly rejected and then to introduce that in new legislation, as though nothing had happened and it had never been considered. That might be part of the Prime Minister's declared policy, as expressed at Prime Minister's questions today&mdash;that he would prefer to listen to police officers than Law Lords. I am sure that that will endear him to those who will consider this Bill later. Perhaps he believes that Law Lords simply do not understand law in the same way as police officers do. I must, however, counsel Home Officer Ministers that that is not a sensible way of approaching the issue.</p>

	<p pid="a.402.1/1">There are a number of points to make. First, we are dealing with a constraint on freedom of speech, which does not apply to those other offences. In the sexual offences legislation, we are dealing with a specific issue of an interaction between two people in which the critical issue is consent, and in which one person's word will often be used against another's, and in that instance it is absolutely appropriate for the jury to come to a view on an objective test. I really do not understand how the Minister can come to the Dispatch Box, apparently briefed by her civil servants, to proclaim proudly that what she hopes to enact is that which is within the Caldwell case, which the hon. Member for Beaconsfield has described as something that leads to injustice. The Minister parades case law that has apparently been interpreted as leading to injustice as an argument for including it in the Bill. The House deserves rather better than that.</p>
	<p pid="a.402.1/2">The hon. Member for Beaconsfield made an interesting point about what a cleric newly arrived in the country might understand the clause to mean. As he said that, it occurred to me that the cleric might be quoting holy scripture.&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1417" name="Khalid Mahmood">The hon. Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr (Mr. Mahmood)</phrase> feigns incredulity, but I could quote a large amount of holy scripture that would fall within the constraints of the clause. That worries me. It also occurred to me to wonder&mdash;this too is an aside&mdash;what the position of an interpreter would be. Does an interpreter publish the words that he is asked to interpret? At what point does his understanding of what he has been asked to interpret become a potential offence under the clause?</p>

	<p pid="a.411.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the provision would apply not only to Guy Fawkes and Robin Hood but also, at least in theory, to Gerry Adams? There is a difficulty for the Prime Minister and the Government, as it is unclear that the Prime Minister would not fall foul of his own law, given the fact that he has often praised, and expressed admiration for, the contribution of a man who is unquestionably a former terrorist. The courts could have a field day with the Prime Minister, who could end up behind bars as a result of the provisions.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-11-09a.413.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1824" speakername="David Heath" colnum="413"  time="18:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051109/debtext/51109-36.htm#51109-36_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.413.0/1">I entirely concur with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1394" name="Dominic Grieve">the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve)</phrase>. There is no place for the offence on our statute book. I do not see the point of it, and that is not because I lack any vigour on fighting terrorism. I simply do not believe that it is a useful addition to the offences available to the police and prosecuting authorities to reduce the likelihood of terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="a.413.0/2">Let us make no bones about this. The provision is clearly a vestigial remnant of an idea that must have sounded good on the day on which it was put forward by the Prime Minister, but that has been expunged elsewhere. The fragment of the Prime Minister's idea remains in the Bill, but I hope that we will clear it up today, which is why we have put our names to amendment No. 3.</p>
	<p pid="a.413.0/3">The offence might have looked appropriate in 17th century legislation because it is the sort of thing that Parliament passed at that time. Parliament could afford a little imprecision in its terms in those days because it knew that it had a compliant judiciary that could be relied on to do the Executive's bidding. I can imagine some of my ancestors being prosecuted for glorification. They were transported as slaves after the rebellion in 1685. We had a wonderful judicial system in those days because defendants were advised not to plead their innocence before the court because that would waste the court's time. We have moved on a long way since then.</p>
	<p pid="a.413.0/4">The provision is drafted in such imprecise terms that it undermines the Government's rational case behind other measures in the Bill. Its chilling effect is that it has the capacity to worry a great many people who will never be prosecuted under the Bill. We have considered such an effect when we have dealt with other legislation. The fact that it might be possible to bring a perverse prosecution under the Bill could mean that people would think it better not to say what they had intended to say. However, that would lead to the serious curtailment of our free speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.413.0/5">The Government have provided for other offences in the Bill. We have just debated the encouragement of terrorism. I have already said that I would prefer that activity to be termed as incitement because encouragement is a loose term. However, the concept of encouragement is a million times better than the strange offence of glorification. Labour Back Benchers made many valid contributions when we last discussed the matter and pointed out the dangers of the imprecision that was inherent in the measure.</p>
	<p pid="a.413.0/6">I hope that the Government will be prepared to think again even at this late stage. I do not think that those in the other place who are well versed in law&mdash;certainly better versed than I am&mdash;will wear it for a moment. The provision will be struck out there, but as I have said on many occasions, it would be preferable for the elected House to do its job. Ministers claim to be looking for consensus on the Bill, but they know that there is a general consensus on the proper requirement to deal with people who incite terrorism in this country. They should listen to others and acknowledge that the provision will not achieve what they want.</p>
	<p pid="a.413.0/7">We have heard fanciful and hyperbolic examples of what could be caught by the offence. Although they are useful for illustrative purposes, I do not think that anyone seriously assumes that the Attorney-General would prosecute anyone for the flimsy reasons that have been adduced as behaviour that could be caught by the offence. Of course, such prosecutions would not be brought. When we are legislating in the House, particularly when we introduce new offences that curtail the power of free speech, which some of us hold dear, we must be extremely careful and precise. We should know what is intended in the measures, and if we use hyperbole to illustrate our case we should do so with the intention of bringing the House to its senses so that it can understand the consequences of ill-considered legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.413.0/8">My hon. Friends and I have tabled amendments Nos. 31 and 30, which deal with the use of the word &quot;glorification&quot; in clause 21. I urge the Government to reconsider its inclusion, because we have terms to proscribe organisations under the Terrorism Act 2000. Only a few weeks ago, the Minister submitted to the House a further list of organisations that should be proscribed under that Act. The House agreed with her, albeit with concerns about one organisations. Generally, however, it was happy to accede to her view that those organisation should be proscribed under that legislation. If she is going to extend the terms of proscription to include the vague concept of glorification, a vast number of organisations around the world could be caught. Some of those organisations may have had a presence in this country, but that will not be the case for many of them, as we learned from the order that was laid before the House only a few weeks ago.</p>
	<p pid="a.413.0/9">If we widen the scope of proscription, there will be intense diplomatic pressure on the Government to proscribe many organisations of which we know little. Another country's Government, for example, may say, &quot;We have a problem with a certain organisation, which spends all its time saying what a wonderful thing it was that the statue of our President was blown up last week. That is entirely unacceptable. If Her Majesty's Government are serious about terrorism, when will you take the necessary steps to proscribe that organisation?&quot; If we wish to maintain a good diplomatic relationship with that country, the pressure on the Home Secretary to accede to that request will be very strong indeed.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-11-09a.419.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1852" speakername="John Gummer" colnum="419"  time="19:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051109/debtext/51109-38.htm#51109-38_spnew3">
	<p pid="a.419.1/1">My hon. Friend has put his finger on the reason for my unhappiness with the word. He is right that, if ever there were a subject about which our language should be clinical and avoid overtones that might have the effect that he described, we are considering it. He is right to point out why it is so dangerous.</p>
	<p pid="a.419.1/2">However, it is also dangerous for another reason. If glorification were some residuum of a law that was passed in 1734 and somebody suggested that it would be a good idea to get rid of it because it was no longer useful or might be used badly, the answer would be the same as the one the Minister has given in previous debates: it is perfectly safe because nobody could use it and there is always the gate of the Director of Public Prosecutions and others. That works if it applies to a provision that has been in desuetude for a long time. However, we are proposing a new provision. It would be difficult in 2006 to say that we did not mean legislation of 2005 to apply to a case. We could not claim that it was a jeux d'esprit or a little twiddle in an otherwise dull Bill. It would be hard to argue that. The intention to include it in such a serious measure is therefore genuinely problematic for the Government. Let me define the three specific problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.419.1/3">First, the Government should not underestimate the extent to which the Director of Public Prosecutions can be perceived by those who do not understand the process as a political figure. We all have experience in our lifetimes of examples when, because the Director of Public Prosecutions has or has not allowed something, it has been suggested that Ministers have leaned on him. That is a mean, unpleasant and unfair suggestion but it should nevertheless be avoided rather than encouraged.</p>
	<p pid="a.419.1/4">Secondly, the provision becomes an even greater danger if extra-territoriality&mdash;I am delicate in my references because of your earlier, proper restrictions, Mr. Deputy Speaker&mdash;turns out to apply to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1394" name="Dominic Grieve">the extent that my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve)</phrase> suggests. Those who may wish to put pressure on the Government are even less likely to understand the independent position of the Director of Public Prosecutions if they are from countries where such an independent position does not exist. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1794" name="Kenneth Clarke">The example given by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)</phrase> of the Russians and the Chechen rebels, or my own example of the Rwandan authorities and the Belgian priest, would in those circumstances become even more germane. The Government would be likely to have pressure brought to bear on them by people who were not going to take seriously the fact that this great independent figure, the Director of Public Prosecutions&mdash;so unknown anywhere else&mdash;was the gate that had prevented a prosecution from taking place.</p>
	<p pid="a.419.1/5">Thirdly, I beg the Minister to recognise that this legislation as a whole has struck a very sharp note for many people among the ethnic minorities in this country. The Home Secretary was utterly right, in answering an earlier intervention, to point out the enormous support for law and order and the opposition to terrorism that we find among the Muslim community. Unfortunately, he was not answering the question that he had been asked. It was a very good answer to a question on that subject, but that was not <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1841" name="Mark Fisher">the question that the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mark Fisher)</phrase> had asked him. I am not going to stray from the subject of glorification, Mr. Deputy Speaker&mdash;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-11-09a.424.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1541" speakername="Geoffrey Cox" colnum="424"  time="19:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051109/debtext/51109-39.htm#51109-39_spnew10">
	<p pid="a.424.0/1">It is a privilege to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1852" name="John Gummer">my right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer)</phrase>. My objection to this clause is largely based on the fact that it is a pointless excrescence and a wholly unnecessary appendage. It resides in the Bill solely for the reason that the Government announced over the summer that they would criminalise glorification, and so had to leave some reference to glorification in the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.424.0/2">It is clear on examining the relevant part of the clause that, in any event, it is used only as an example of the kind of conduct that the clause proscribes in an earlier part. It is an inclusive statement that simply points the way to the all-embracing umbrella section, which makes it an offence indirectly to encourage a terrorist act. As my right hon. Friend said, it is a pernicious and pointless appendage that has no place in legislation made by this House.</p>
	<p pid="a.424.0/3">The common law has always been extremely careful to ensure that the proscription of speech is precise, carefully targeted and narrowly defined. That is why the common law has always proscribed the incitement of specific acts of violence. On examining the common law offence of incitement, one sees that the ingredients require that an accused person must&mdash;must&mdash;have incited a specific act identifiable and particularised by the Crown in the indictment. But the clause and this specific section of it simply enable the glorification of a type of conduct, with no need for a specific act to have been encouraged or incited.</p>
	<p pid="a.424.0/4">The dangers have been dwelt on by Members in all parts of the House, but my right hon. Friend put his finger on a particularly important point. Among the many examples that Members have used, we have heard some that are fanciful and others that are more realistic. The glorification of some heroes of the past has been dismissed by Ministers as the product of fevered fantasy, but the truth is that a more subtle and insidious danger arises from this clause remaining in the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.424.0/5">Let us suppose that a speech was made at Hyde Park corner by an English nationalist who wished to sing the praises of Hereward the Wake. That it should even be thought that the glorification of the conduct of Hereward the Wake&mdash;who led an uprising, as I recall, against the Normans&mdash;could in any respect be in danger of being criminalised or made illegal by this Bill might attract from us smiles and a degree of risibility, and we would doubtless be right. The Director of Public Prosecutions would greet with consternation and dismay any lunatic who even proposed the idea that a speaker on Hyde Park corner singing the praises of Hereward the Wake might invoke the penalty under this clause.</p>
	<p pid="a.424.0/6">Let us suppose that the speaker on Hyde Park corner was not white. Let us suppose that he was a Muslim, and that he was glorifying and praising not Hereward the Wake, but the actions of Saladin. Let us suppose that he was holding out for emulation the actions of Saladin in the wars that he fought against Christian civilisation for two or three decades or more. Let us consider the circumstances of the time and take into account the particular factors of the speaker's audience, which might include not only ordinary Londoners going about their business, but one or two Muslims, perhaps some of the Arab race and some who were susceptible to the message of waging a crusade against Christian civilisation. The speaker might notice them coming from the local mosque; he might see them gathering around his soapbox on the corner of Hyde park. I do not know whether there is, in fact, a mosque local to Hyde park, but let us suppose that there is one and that gathering around our speaker is a crowd of turbaned, Arab and Muslim people.</p>
	<p pid="a.424.0/7">Still, our Hyde Park speaker continues to sing the praises of Saladin and begins to discern the murmuring and sussuration&mdash;[Hon. Members: &quot;Ooh!&quot;]&mdash;yes, sussuration and I shall be providing a few more soon. He senses the restiveness of his audience and begins to see that, although he has perfectly innocent intentions, his praise of Saladin&mdash;a great hero of the Arab race&mdash;is beginning to excite an intemperate reaction among his audience. Perhaps, we might say, a wise speaker would button his lip. A wise man would cease to speak at that point, climb down from his soapbox and immediately go silent. However, it would be too late, for he would already have committed a crime because he would have glorified in circumstances where he could see&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I notice that the Minister is looking at me in consternation, but for 23 years I have practised law in the criminal courts of this country, and let me tell her and Government Members that more stupid prosecutions have been brought than that&mdash;far more.</p>

	<p pid="a.427.0/1">I am grateful to those who tabled the amendments for allowing us to revisit this area. I shall endeavour to respond to the contributions made, which have ranged from Wat Tyler to Hereward the Wake through all points in between. I am grateful to hon. Members who acknowledged that some of the examples given have been&mdash;I think this was the term used&mdash; fanciful. I am grateful, too, for acknowledgements that this is a serious matter, although I must tell <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1541" name="Geoffrey Cox">the hon.

	<p pid="a.427.0/2">I remind the House that we had a pledge in our election manifesto to outlaw the glorification of terrorism. We originally had a stand-alone offence but have come now to the formulation in clause 1. Lord Carlile, our independent reviewer of the legislation, says that</p>
	<p pid="a.427.0/3" class="indent">&quot;in my view, this proposal in its revised form is a proportionate response to the real and present danger of young radically minded people being persuaded towards terrorism by apparently authoritative tracts wrapped in a religious or quasi-religious context&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.429.4/1">I am interested in the Minister's endorsement of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1520" name="Gwyneth Dunwoody">the words of the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody)</phrase>, as she has just provided a let-out for every person who wants to incite terrorism. If all that is required to get around the clause is to preface one's remarks with that saving clause, why are we passing clause 1 into law? That is a classic illustration of the muddled thinking behind the Government's approach. The Government should remove glorification and stick to incitement, with proper terminology. They will then have an offence that works, that bites and, moreover, commands widespread respect.</p>

	<p pid="a.432.1/1">What should be criminal is the indirect incitement and the encouragement of people to commit acts of terrorism. Clearly, when we come to the other clauses&mdash;we may not have a chance to debate them&mdash;I want to deal with the points about extra-territorial jurisdiction made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1794" name="Kenneth Clarke">the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1852" name="John Gummer">the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer)</phrase>. Again, with some of the amendments that we have introduced, we have tried to narrow the scope of those offences to try to reassure hon. Members that they are targeted at the specific mischief. However, if <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1463" name="John Bercow">the hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow)</phrase> is asking whether I can pick and choose between regimes or perhaps between a good terrorist and a bad terrorist, I repeat that it is wrong for people to encourage others to undertake terrorist acts. As I have said, it is a slippery slope&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.440.2/1">After the excitements of today, my hon. Friend the Minister and I come along like sweepers-up after the Lord Mayor's procession. I am grateful to have the opportunity to discuss the closure of the Bruche police training centre and its effect not only on the people who work there but on those who live in the surrounding area.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.2/2">The training centre at Bruche has been a feature of Warrington life for a good many years. It provides the residential stage 2 of foundation training for probationary officers. It is a large site that caters for the needs of several police forces and employs, I believe, 60 people directly, with about 55 working for contractors. I say, &quot;I believe&quot;, because it has proved extremely difficult to get accurate information from Centrex on such matters. There are also 70 police officers stationed there, as well as about 10 security staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.2/3">Because of the position of the site in the midst of local housing, the prospect of its closing became a matter of concern to staff and to people in the area when it appeared that changes to police training meant that recruits would no longer be sent for residential training at regional centres. However, it has proved extremely difficult in the run-up to the announcement of closure to get accurate information about what Centrex plans to do. I had raised the matter on several occasions, but I reverted to it with a number of parliamentary questions, which I tabled in July last year because the staff from the centre had approached me, greatly concerned about their future.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.2/4">Unfortunately, answer came there none from the Home Office. I wrote again in August and, after much to-ing and fro-ing, I received a reply on <phrase class="date" code="">18 November</phrase>. It stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.440.2/5" class="indent">&quot;It has not proved possible to respond to my hon. Friend in the time available before Prorogation.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-18">18 November 2004</phrase>; Vol. 426, c. 2080W.]</p>
	<p pid="a.440.2/6">That is extraordinary. If the Home Office cannot answer a simple question in more than four months, I worry about the rest of its work. On <phrase class="date" code="">26 November</phrase> that year, I received a letter from my right hon. Friend the Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety, in which she apologised for the delay and said that the Home Office had lost sight of the questions over the summer months.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.2/7">The letter raised more questions than it answered, however. It said that the matter had been given detailed consideration over the summer. If that was true, I do not understand why I did not receive an answer to my question in November. The letter was unenlightening in other respects. It said that Centrex had been discussing what should happen to police training with the Association of Chief Police Officers, the Association of Police Authorities and other stakeholders. I am never sure what &quot;stakeholder&quot; means. It is one of those words that, like some of Lewis Carroll's verse, means whatever one wants it to mean. The letter mentioned neither the trade unions at the centre nor the staff. They were not mentioned in a parliamentary answer that I received later that month.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.2/8">I was approached again by the staff, who were concerned that they could not get information about what was happening. I tabled another question to ask who had been involved in the meetings and what options for the future of the centre had been discussed. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will be pleased to hear that the Home Office answered that. I suppose that that is a step in the right direction. However, I was not much further enlightened because, again, there was no mention of what was happening or of any negotiations with the staff. That is unacceptable. The staff have families to keep and bills to pay, just like the rest of us.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.2/9">I know that the Home Office will say that that was the responsibility of Centrex, but it cannot be shrugged off in that way because, after all, Centrex is a non-departmental public body which manages public assets and has strong links to the Home Office. If no one at the Home Office asked what steps were being taken to consult and inform staff, they should have done so. They should be reminded that we are in the 21st century with a Labour Government, and it is unacceptable to treat people in that way.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.2/10">The failure of Centrex to be open about what was happening caused a great deal of consternation in the local area. The centre is set in the middle of a lot of local housing. Rumours circulated about what would happen to it. That allowed some evil-minded people to spread the rumour that it would be turned into an asylum centre. I am glad that my right hon. Friend the Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety quashed that rumour in a letter to me on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-13">13 July</phrase> this year. However, the anxieties remain and they need to be tackled.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.2/11">Not only was Centrex less than open about its plans, it sometimes actively misled people. In November last year, it told the <i>Warrington Guardian</i>, my local newspaper, that the centre was &quot;absolutely not&quot; closing in 2006. In the same letter on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-13">13 July</phrase>, in which my right hon. Friend dealt with the rumour about the asylum centre, she wrote that</p>
	<p pid="a.440.2/12" class="indent">&quot;there are currently no immediate plans to close the Bruche training centre.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.440.2/13">A week later, on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-21">21 July</phrase>, Centrex sent out an e-mail at 6.4 pm&mdash;only four minutes after the House had risen for the summer recess&mdash;announcing the closure of three training centres, including Bruche.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.2/14">I find it astonishing that a public body should behave in that way. I can think of no explanation for that other than a desire to avoid parliamentary scrutiny. That is not surprising when Centrex and the Minister&mdash;presumably relying in good faith on what it had told her&mdash;previously said something entirely different. Centrex also wrote to me on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-21">21 July</phrase> announcing the closure. In that letter, it responded to a letter that I had sent to it on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-26">26 June</phrase>. However, it responded to it in a postscript, which I am afraid is typical of the kind of dismissive attitude that my constituents have had to put up with all the way along.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.2/15">I am sorry to say that that kind of attitude extended even into parts of the Home Office. When I rang the private office of the Minister of State the day after the announcement, I received what I can only describe as a curt dismissal. I asked to speak to the Minister and was told that she was in her constituency. When I suggested that her staff contact her&mdash;she was in Salford, after all, not Timbuktu&mdash;I was told that I should write in. To her credit, the Minister did telephone me, albeit a week later when I was no longer around. However, I have to say that I have never before encountered that sort of behaviour from the private office of a Minister. It is entirely unacceptable for Centrex and the Home Office to behave in this way when we are talking about people's livelihoods and the future of their communities. I hope that this can be prevented from happening again.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.2/16">I wrote again to the Minister on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-26">26 July</phrase>&mdash;there has been a lot of correspondence on this matter&mdash;to ask why I had been told that there was no immediate prospect of the centre closing, when in fact the announcement was made a week later. I also raised my concerns about what I saw as an attempt to avoid parliamentary scrutiny. The answer that I received was very revealing. It said:</p>
	<p pid="a.440.2/17" class="indent">&quot;Given the timing of my letter and of the announcement, it would have been more accurate to have said that no decision had yet been taken.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.440.2/18">It certainly would. However, I give Ministers credit by assuming that, if they sign a letter, they will have checked the facts and that that is what they have been told. We need to know what happened to change matters between 13 and <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-21">21 July</phrase>. Until that is cleared up, we are all left with the impression that Centrex has been, and is continuing to be, less than frank about its plans.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.2/19">I was also concerned about what was said in that letter about parliamentary scrutiny. It said that the decision to close the centre had been taken at the Centrex board meeting on the morning of <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-21">21 July</phrase>. It went on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.440.2/20" class="indent">&quot;The timing of the announcement relates only to the timing of that decision.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.440.2/21">But it does not. If the decision was taken in the morning, I can see no reason to wait until just after the House had risen for the recess to announce it. I have asked for the reason, and I was told by the Minister that she was</p>
	<p pid="a.440.2/22" class="indent">&quot;certainly clear that Centrex had not timed the announcement to avoid parliamentary scrutiny&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.2/23">If the Home Office is &quot;certainly clear&quot; about that, it needs to give me the information as to why, because I have not had it, and neither have the people I represent.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.2/24">I received a letter dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-05">5 September</phrase>, signed by the Under-Secretary of State for <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1678" name="Andy Burnham">the Home Department, my hon. Friend the Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham)</phrase>, in the absence of the Minister of State. The explanation that I was given was that</p>
	<p pid="a.440.2/25" class="indent">&quot;it would have been unacceptable either to make an announcement before the board had made a decision or to delay the announcement until after the parliamentary recess.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.440.2/26">Frankly, that is Home Office gobbledegook. A decision cannot be announced before it has been taken, and no one suggests that it can. However, there was an alternative&mdash;a third way, if you like. It could have been announced when the House was sitting.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.2/27">I am equally concerned that that letter shows an unacceptable attitude towards parliamentary scrutiny. It goes on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.440.2/28" class="indent">&quot;I do not believe that it is an announcement that needed to give consideration to parliamentary timetables&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.2/29">I beg to differ. When my constituents are losing their jobs, and when decisions are being taken that will affect a whole area, it is not only the right but the duty of their Member of Parliament to raise the matter in the House. My constituents would expect no less. I am very disappointed that any Minister should think differently. That was a most unfortunate turn of phrase to use.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.2/30">Because of all this, and because of the way in which Centrex has behaved since the announcement, it is difficult to have faith in what it is doing. I still have staff approaching me who are very demoralised about what is happening, and people who live in the area are deeply concerned. The chief executive of Centrex wrote to me in August to say that he had briefed the staff on what was happening, and that he had set up a programme board. He did not, however, answer any of the points that I put to him about what was happening to the staff or about the future plans for the site. He told me that I would get information about those matters at the appropriate time. I happen to think that the appropriate time to answer queries from a Member of the House is when they are asked, not when some unelected person decides to answer them. That is treating my constituents with a fair amount of contempt, which is unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.2/31">Since then, Centrex has not engaged with the local council's redundancy support service, the job centre or our economic development authority, until yesterday, when it sent an e-mail to the council in response to an e-mail that had been sent weeks earlier, saying that it looked forward to working with Warrington borough council. It is a miracle what getting an Adjournment debate can do, but I would prefer not to have to have one every week to ensure that that process continues.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.2/32">The sad thing is that we have a good record in Warrington of getting people into jobs following redundancy, but engagement between all the partners involved is needed. If I make a comparison with what happened when Marks and Spencer closed a call centre in my constituency, there was immediate engagement with all the partners in the area, and we had a lot of support from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1888" name="Stephen Byers">my right hon. Friend the Member for North Tyneside (Mr. Byers)</phrase>, who was then Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. I expect a public body to do no less than that.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.2/33">I want to turn to the future of the site. As I said, it is surrounded by housing, with only very limited access. When it was transferred to Centrex, I understand that the written-down value was &pound;3 million. It might now be worth much more, depending on the future use of the site. I wonder whether my hon. Friend can tell me what will happen to any windfall profits from that, whether local people will be able to benefit in any way, and whether any of that will be used to help to find jobs for the staff involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.2/34">There is a further problem, however. As well as the rumours that have circulated about this site, there is a real concern about over-development in the area, which I believe is well founded. The adjoining roads already have a lot of traffic problems. For any future development at the site, we need proper community engagement. My right hon. Friend the Minister of State said in one of the numerous letters that we exchanged, the date of which now escapes me, that she was</p>
	<p pid="a.440.2/35" class="indent">&quot;keen that there should be proper community engagement&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.440.2/36">in any future planning application. I would like to see that keenness translated into reality, however. Although I know from the parliamentary answer of <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-17">17 October</phrase> that Home Office officials and Centrex have had discussions about the future of the site, there has been no contact with the local planning department, let alone with people in the community.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.2/37">I therefore hope that my hon. Friend will accept that this matter has so far been very badly handled. It has not increased confidence, either in the staff or the community, about what Centrex will do in the future. We now need to put that right. I hope that he can assure me that he will ensure that Centrex now engages with all local partners in order to make sure that the proper procedures are in place to find jobs for people who are made redundant at that site. Far from dismissing concerns raised with it, I hope that it will now engage with the local community and have a proper discussion on what should happen there in future, so that whatever is done with the site, it can be for the benefit of the local community and not to their detriment. I look forward to hearing the Minister's reply.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-11-09a.444.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1950" speakername="Paul Goggins" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department"  colnum="444"  time="20:49:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051109/debtext/51109-44.htm#51109-44_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.444.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1907" name="Helen Jones">my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, North (Helen Jones)</phrase> on securing the debate. She has raised an issue that is of concern locally and to her, and I am glad that she has had an opportunity to raise it in a characteristically forthright way.</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/2">Let me give some of the background to the decision to close Bruche and the other training sites that my hon. Friend mentioned. Given the points that she raised and the copious correspondence between her and Home Office Ministers, I should say something about how the decision was made.</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/3">Until recently, police probationer training was split between an officer's home force and the Central Police Training and Development Authority, known as Centrex. Once officers are recruited, they undergo two weeks of induction and familiarisation in their own forces. They are then sent to Centrex for 12 weeks' residential training, which is followed by a couple of weeks in their own forces learning about local procedures before they go out on patrol with a tutor constable for 10 further weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/4">That system is now changing. In the summer of last year, five forces began piloting the initial police learning and development programme. That moves stage 2&mdash;the residential stage with Centrex&mdash;back into the force. Officers learn in their own force and their own community, often in conjunction with members of that community. That is a huge change in the system and the culture, but I believe that it will help to foster a meaningful connection with police officers in training and the communities that they will serve. It is important for the police service to develop a culture of training and qualification so that we have a fully professional service. I am pleased to say that the Adult Learning Inspectorate has evaluated the effectiveness of the pilots. It considers them to have been highly successful, and welcomes the enthusiasm and commitment of the staff involved in the programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/5">Working to identify and address the huge challenges involved in the change, the Government and the police service are rolling the programme out across all the forces in England and Wales. Thirteen forces have already gone live, and nine more will adopt the same approach over the next five months. From April next year, the remaining 21 forces will be ready to go live. We are changing pretty dramatically the way in which probationer police officers are trained. One of the main consequences of that approach is that officers will no longer be sent to Centrex for their initial training. The last probationer officers to go through the old system will leave Centrex on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-26">26 May</phrase> next year.</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/6">Centrex has a number of sites around the country. Three have been used almost exclusively to provide foundation training: Ashford in Kent, Cwmbran in south Wales and Bruche in my hon. Friend's constituency. There are two other sites, Ryton near Coventry and Bramshill, where Centrex's headquarters are sited. They will continue to be used for other purposes because they are multi-functional sites.</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/7">For all those reasons, the chief executive of Centrex and his senior management team have been considering the future needs of the Centrex estate for some time. They reached what I judge to be the entirely logical and sensible conclusion that there was no value-for-money argument for retaining the three sites at Ashford, Cwmbran and Bruche. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-21">21 July</phrase>, the Centrex board considered a paper from the chief executive that recommended the closure of the sites. I should explain that the board consists of a number of independent members, including the chair, and includes representatives from the Association of Chief Police Officers, the Association of Police Authorities and the Home Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/8">The Centrex board agreed with the recommendation from the chief executive that the sites should be closed. Home Office Ministers were made aware of the decision as soon as it was made, and the chief executive then informed the staff. He wrote to staff, spoke to them directly by means of a DVD, and later visited each site in person to discuss the implications with them.</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/9">Police staff at the three sites have been given notice that their posts are likely to become redundant by <phrase class="date" code="">26 May 2006</phrase>. On or before that date, up to 175 seconded police officers will return to their forces. Forty of those officers are employed at Bruche, and 40 further police staff at Bruche have been given notice that they are likely to be made redundant. In addition, between 30 and 40 subcontracted workers involved in security, catering and so on face redundancy.</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/10">Shortly after the chief executive informed the staff, he contacted Members of Parliament representing the areas affected to make them aware of the announcement. A public announcement was made once staff had been informed, and the head of Bruche training centre also wrote to local residents.</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/11">I want to make it clear to my hon. Friend that Home Office Ministers apologise for any difficulties or misunderstandings that occurred as a result of correspondence, particularly the letter sent on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-13">13 July</phrase> by the Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1802" name="Hazel Blears">my right hon. Friend the Member for Salford (Hazel Blears)</phrase>. That reply followed a conversation between the Minister and my hon. Friend, in which she raised some of the concerns that she has outlined this evening. It is true that in that letter, my right hon. Friend said that</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/12" class="indent">&quot;there are currently no immediate plans to close the Bruche training centre&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/13">Of course, when she wrote that letter on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-13">13 July</phrase>, that was true. Although discussions were taking place within Centrex, no decision had been taken, and none was taken until <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-21">21 September</phrase>. As my hon. Friend pointed out, such a decision is entirely a matter for Centrex, as a non-departmental public body; indeed, Home Office officials were informed of it only after the meeting on the morning of <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-21">21 July</phrase> concluded. I am pleased that my right hon. Friend the Minister has been able to write since and to set the record straight.</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/14">My hon. Friend also raised the concern that the timing of the announcement, which was made on the day that this House rose for the summer recess, was such as to avoid parliamentary scrutiny. My right hon. Friend the Minister explained in her letters, and in answer to parliamentary questions tabled by my hon. Friend, that the decision was taken by the Centrex board on the morning of <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-21">21 July</phrase>. Quite apart from the fact that, as my hon. Friend pointed out, it would have been impossible to make an announcement about a decision that had yet to be taken, it would of course have been wrong to make a public announcement until the staff themselves had been made aware of that decision. My hon. Friend will agree that it would also have been wholly unfair to hold back that decision or any announcement until October, when the House returned from its recess.</p>

	<p pid="a.448.1/1">Official Report, <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-08">8 November 2005</phrase>: In col. 257, before &quot;Question put, That the amendment be made&quot;, insert:</p>
	<p pid="a.448.1/2">Mr. Heath: I am grateful to all those who participated in this brief debate, but hearing the Minister say that it was outrageous to suggest that an electoral experiment&mdash;a pilot&mdash;should be extended to anything as large as a region when the Government had no compunction about forcing four regions through an electoral experiment only a little while ago against the express views of the Electoral Commission and every single party represented in the House other than the Government takes the biscuit.</p>
	<p pid="a.448.1/3">David Cairns: We did not move immediately to all-postal regional pilots. They were piloted at a local and voluntary level and lessons were learned before the regional voting pilots that the hon. Gentleman mentioned. It would help if he were to clarify that that was the point that I was making.</p>
	<p pid="a.448.1/4">Mr. Heath: The hon. Gentleman again attempts to clarify what he said, but the fact remains that, following that election, we had the biggest crisis of confidence in the electoral system of this country that we have ever seen. For the first time, we had people genuinely doubting whether the election in which they had just taken part was conducted freely and fairly. We should not tolerate that. What is the Government's response? Are they prepared to go into the next general election with the same postal voting precautions in place? Yes, they are. Their answer is, &quot;We'll do something, but manana&mdash;tomorrow, whatever.&quot; That is not a satisfactory position. We need to do something urgently. The Electoral Commission has given us a clear steer about how we should go forward and I wish to test the opinion of the Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.448.1/5"><i>Official Report,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-02">2 November 2005</phrase>: in column 884, in the Ayes, insert &quot;Prentice, Mr Gordon&quot;.</p>
