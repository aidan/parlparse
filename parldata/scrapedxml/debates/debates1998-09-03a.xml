<p>There is no business for the House to transact until the Lords amendments to the Criminal Justice (Terrorism and Conspiracy) Bill are received, or until it is possible for the Royal Assent to be notified. Because the length of proceedings on the Bill in the House of Lords is unpredictable, I propose that the time for the resumption of the sitting of this House should be displayed on the annunciator as soon as it is possible to

make a reasonable prediction of a convenient time. I shall also arrange for the bells to be rung five minutes before I intend to resume the Chair.</p>
