	<p pid=".1665.6/1">At a cost of &pound;3.6 billion, the new deal has helped 2 million men and women. It has moved 1.2 million into work, contributed to a fall in long-term unemployment of over three quarters, and helped the creation of 2 million jobs. Every week 125,000 men and women are finding new jobs. Compared with 1997, the Government now spend &pound;5 billion a year less on unemployment benefits.</p>

	<p pid=".1665.8/1">My hon. Friend represents the interests of the people of Telford with great distinction. Unemployment since 1997 has fallen by half, and is 2.5 per cent. Long-term unemployment has fallen by 77 per cent. and youth unemployment by 80 per cent. All that would be put at risk if the Tories' policy to abolish the new deal were implemented.</p>

	<p pid=".1665.9/1">The new deal in my constituency, Stockton, South, has helped over 2,500 people into work. In the northern region that figure is more than 150,000. Could the new deal be extended as an employment support programme to the disabled, supporting programmes such as Blind Routes to Work, an initiative of Stockton Blind People's Voice?</p>

	<p pid=".1665.10/1">I will certainly look into that with the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. As my hon. Friend knows, unemployment in Stockton, South has fallen dramatically since 1997. There has been a 70 per cent. cut in long-term unemployment and an 80 per cent. cut in youth unemployment. One of the reasons why that has happened is the existence of the new deal. It is therefore sad that both the Liberal party and the Conservative party want to abolish it.</p>

	<p pid=".1666.0/1">Can the Chancellor of the Exchequer produce a single piece of independent research evidence to support the inflated claims that the Government continue to make for the new deal? Is it not the case that the most recent research into the cost per job created by the new deal shows that the number of jobs actually created in addition to those that were created by a normally buoyant economy is at best 17,000 a year? Are not the figures cited by the Chancellor of the Exchequer a continuing example of inflated claims which he cannot substantiate with any independent research?</p>

	<p pid=".1666.1/1">The right hon. Gentleman speaks about a buoyant economy. Who is responsible for a buoyant economy? I am grateful for the gratitude he expresses to the Government. In his own constituency, would he not congratulate us also&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman should get more interested in his own constituency. Unemployment has fallen by 41 per cent. since 1997. He asks what the evidence is. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research estimated that the economy is &pound;500 million a year richer as a result of the new deal. The national institute conceded that without the new deal, the level of long-term unemployment would be twice as high. That is the evidence, and that is why the Opposition are making a mistake by abolishing the new deal.</p>

	<p pid=".1666.2/1">I appreciate that the Chancellor has a particular interest in methods of helping people to find new jobs, but even allowing for that, how can the Government explain the fact that despite the new deal the number of people under 25 not in employment, education or training has risen and stands at more than 1.1 million? Why is the new deal failing those young people so badly?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-03-10.1666.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/755" speakername="Gordon Brown" colnum="1666"  time="11:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050310/debtext/50310-01.htm#50310-01_spnew7">
	<p pid=".1666.3/1">The Opposition ask the same question as they asked last month and I dealt with it then. The shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions went to his local jobcentre last Friday in Daventry to claim credit for the opening of Jobcentre Plus. That is the Conservative party which, in the House of Commons, wants to abolish the new deal, privatise Jobcentre Plus and make thousands of civil servants unemployed. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/901" name="Mark Francois">The hon.

	<p pid=".1667.1/1">Frontloading aid and doubling it through the international finance facility would enable us to provide free primary education for all young children and help to meet the millennium development goals by 2015. Fifty countries have indicated support for the IFF and for the pilot IFF on immunisation in partnership with the Gates Foundation. It would frontload $4 billion of investment in vaccination and could save 5 million young lives between now and 2015.</p>

	<p pid=".1667.2/1">I thank my right hon. Friend for his commendable efforts in trying to secure the additional aid that the world needs to eradicate poverty. As he knows, a number of alternative forms of financing aid have recently been proposed, including a revised form of the Tobin tax and a tax on aviation fuel. Has he had an opportunity to assess those particular alternatives and whether the international community is likely to accept such proposals to try to achieve the goal of doubling aid?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-03-10.1667.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/755" speakername="Gordon Brown" colnum="1667"  time="11:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050310/debtext/50310-01.htm#50310-01_spnew9">
	<p pid=".1667.3/1">A few weeks ago, the G7 meeting of Finance Ministers agreed to examine all those specific proposals. The advantages of the international finance facility are that it would frontload aid, that it could be implemented immediately, and that it would provide the necessary money to give us a chance of meeting our millennium development goals.</p>
	<p pid=".1667.3/2">If present rates of progress were to continue in sub-Saharan Africa, we would not meet the goal of primary education for all by 2015&mdash;we would meet it in 2150, 135 years late&mdash;which is why additional finance is required and why the world community must examine the provision of resources. Scientists have highlighted malaria in a report published today, and the additional money provided by the IFF could enable the provision of malaria bed nets, which can save a life at the very small cost of less than $10.</p>
	<p pid=".1667.3/3">The IFF will also allow us to introduce an advance purchase scheme for the newly developed malaria vaccine, which is being tested in Mozambique, and the drugs companies and the Gates Foundation believe that it could be up and running as a preventive vaccine very soon. Advance purchasing, which the rich countries must support, will be required, which is another reason why we need the frontloading mechanism.</p>

	<p pid=".1667.4/1">It is excellent news that the German Government have swung behind the IFF, but the real concern is the US Government's position. Will my right hon. Friend give us his assessment of the US Government's position, and tell us what steps he has taken to persuade them?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-03-10.1667.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/755" speakername="Gordon Brown" colnum="1667"  time="11:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050310/debtext/50310-01.htm#50310-01_spnew11">
	<p pid=".1667.5/1">When President Bush spoke at the debt and development conference in Monterrey, he said that no country that is making the necessary reforms to achieve economic development should be denied resources for health and education. After that speech, the Americans set up the millennium challenge account and trebled their spending on HIV/AIDS. In our discussions over the next few months, we will examine how each continent can support the IFF and other innovative financing mechanisms. We hope to reach an agreement with all our G7 partners, and I believe that the developed world is looking to the G7 and to the UN special summit to achieve a settlement that will make it possible for us to achieve the millennium development goals.</p>

	<p pid=".1668.0/1">Does the latest International Monetary Fund report suggest to the Chancellor that his ministerial colleagues on the G8 may be losing confidence in his capacity to guide the international finance facility or, indeed, the British economy? The report warns of the likely necessity of a massive rise in British taxes by &pound;10 billion a year to fill the black hole in the Chancellor's calculations, following what the IMF describes as a sharp deterioration in Britain's public accounts over the past five years.</p>

	<p pid=".1668.2/1">I welcome the Chancellor's efforts to speed up aid flows through the IFF. At this week's meeting of ECOFIN Ministers, what success did he have in dealing with the European Commission and its statisticians, who say that IFF contributions cannot be treated as contingent liabilities and be taken off the balance sheet, but that they must be counted against Government borrowing debt, thereby imperilling the pledged contributions from France and Germany? How will that problem be dealt with in terms of Britain's public accounts?</p>

	<p pid=".1668.3/1">First, the hon. Gentleman is wrong&mdash;the matter was not discussed at the ECOFIN meeting. Secondly, EUROSTAT is independent of ECOFIN, and it makes independent judgments. Thirdly, EUROSTAT has said no such thing. The hon. Gentleman has been reading speculation in the newspapers, which is invariably inaccurate.</p>
	<p pid=".1668.3/2">Along with the Gates Foundation, we are considering a proposal for a pilot facility for vaccination, which many countries, including South Africa, Canada and Scandinavian countries, would support. That proposal has not yet gone before EUROSTAT, but it should be accepted, and I hope that it will be accepted.</p>

	<p pid=".1668.4/1">The Chancellor is to be congratulated on coming up with the initiative of the IFF and on the work that he has done to make progress so far, but what assessment has he made of the impact of the discussions to date on how far he will be able to go? Without reaching the &pound;100 billion target that he has set himself, most of the targets in the millennium development goals will not be met. Does he have any ideas about ways in which other countries will be able to buy into the idea of 0.7 per cent. through different finance facilities, if not through the IFF?</p>

	<p pid=".1669.0/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who is chairman of an all-party committee on these matters, which will continue to be discussed. Our first aim is get 100 per cent. debt relief for the multilateral debts owed by the poorest countries. That would itself provide substantial additional resources on an annual basis for those countries. Our second aim is to get the IFF pilot set up. I believe that there is now sufficient support for the vaccination pilot to move ahead very quickly; it is not necessary for the whole world to support it. Our third aim, which will be discussed at the G8 at Gleneagles, is the creation of the new facility itself.</p>
	<p pid=".1669.0/2">My hon. Friend may see tomorrow a report from the Commission for Africa which will recommend that we move fast to set up the facility. Those are the next three stages. I believe that we will see success in the first and second very soon, and the third is a matter for debate at Gleneagles.</p>

Tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and malaria are the diseases that are responsible for millions of people dying unnecessarily every year. The purpose of creating the global health fund was to ensure the capacity to treat them and the availability of immunisation and vaccinations. That is why it is especially appropriate today, when the scientists' report on malaria is published, that the British Government say that we are prepared not only to contribute towards vaccination for tuberculosis but to join other countries in purchasing and therefore financing an advance purchase mechanism for the new drug that may be a preventative vaccine for malaria. When similar work is done on HIV/AIDS, it will be necessary for the Governments of the richest countries to come together to support vaccination and the preventive work on that, too. That is the best contribution that we can make: not only helping in the short term with bed nets for malaria and vaccination for tuberculosis, but saying that, when those drugs are discovered, we will be behind the first advance purchase scheme in the world whereby the rich countries help the poor.</p>

China, India, South Africa and Brazil will be invited to a special meeting of the G8 summit at Gleneagles with the other G8 leaders. The level of engagement with China is therefore increasing every year. What I found in China was a willingness on the part of China to co-operate with the United Kingdom, a huge market for exports of British goods in the future, and a huge interest in working with this British Government to solve some of the global problems, including international debt and poverty in the poorest countries.</p>

Over the next few months, the pressure will grow on America and the European Union to enable an agreement to be possible in Hong Kong in December on world trade. Our proposal to end export subsidies is essential. It will also be necessary for us to offer to help countries in Africa, in particular, to have the capacity to enable them to trade. They will need investment in infrastructure, transport and communications so that they can trade fairly with the rest of the world.

Gentleman was a distinguished Chairman of the Health Committee, which constantly urged investment in the health service during the period of the Conservative Government. He well knows that this Government have embarked on a programme that involves moderate borrowing, but it is justified by the need to bridge the years of under-investment in public services that occurred under the Conservative Government, which he drew attention to himself. The reality is that our borrowing is sustainable because we took the hard, tough decisions at the outset of the Labour Government, which the Conservative Government singularly failed to take throughout their 18 years of misrule.</p>

In fact, the report said that many directors viewed the British authorities' projections to be &quot;somewhat more optimistic&quot; than warranted. Does not the build-up to a &pound;10 billion black hole mean that the Chancellor is going to leave a pretty poor legacy to his successor, whether it be my right hon.

	<p pid=".1676.0/1">Nothing could be further from the truth. Each and every one of the hon. Gentleman's assertions was wrong. I would draw his attention to what the IMF really said. For example, it said:</p>
	<p pid=".1676.0/2" class="indent">&quot;Economic performance in the United Kingdom remains impressive . . .

	<p pid=".1679.6/1">I really do welcome the recent announcements and the increase in the national minimum wage. Through the new deal, a large number of people in my constituency have found work, but there is till one thing that I am concerned about, which is allowing people to become more prosperous when most people at the lower-wage end need more help from the Government. What can my hon. Friend say to me that would give reassurance to my constituents?</p>

	<p pid=".1679.7/1">My hon. Friend is right, of course, that the national minimum wage is just part of the set of measures that we need and have put in place to support the wages and take-home pay of poorer families. The national minimum wage should be seen alongside, and works with, tax credits. It is there as an essential guarantee of fair minimum pay for workers, but it cannot reflect family circumstances, so the tax credit, set alongside it, means that we can target help better on tackling poverty for those families. With the two put together, in October, families with one full-time worker and one child will be looking at take-home pay of &pound;7 an hour.</p>

	<p pid=".1679.8/1">Naturally, the logic of the existence of the minimum wage is that it should be periodically and affordably increased, and the reasonable increases recently announced are therefore heartily welcomed by sensible people. However, given that the poorest fifth of households in this country pay a higher proportion of their income in taxation than any other group, does the hon. Gentleman agree that the prime candidates for tax reduction, those for whom we should do most, are those who have least&mdash;the poorest people in our country?</p>

	<p pid=".1680.0/1">That is precisely the role of the tax credits.</p>
	<p pid=".1680.0/2">On the national minimum wage, I served on the Standing Committee, as the hon. Gentleman did, when we passed the historic National Minimum Wage Act 1998. I remember that he and his colleagues were arguing that it would cost 2 million jobs. They had argued that before 1997, but now there are 2 million more jobs in the British economy, under Labour, with the national minimum wage.</p>
	<p pid=".1680.0/3">I refer the hon. Gentleman to the Low Pay Commission. It has looked very carefully at concerns such as those that he has, and it has been able to prove that around 1 million workers each year benefit from the national minimum wage, that the economy has continued to generate new jobs since it was implemented, including in those sectors with a tradition of low pay. This policy is successful. I hope that the shadow Chancellor will give it his full backing.</p>

The campaigning on the issue has been extremely important in bringing about the progress that we are seeing. We need to double total aid flows from $50 billion to $100 billion a year to deliver the millennium goals. That is what the IFF will allow. Alongside that, we have also announced our timetable to meet the UN target of 0.7 per cent. of gross domestic product going to aid by 2013. As my right hon.

It includes new incentive schemes for first-time buyers and key workers, as well as the use of surplus public sector land&mdash;one of the particular topics that arose in that discussion.</p>

	<p pid=".1685.3/1">I thank the Leader of the House for giving us the business. He will be aware of the public concern over the Deputy Prime Minister's latest guidance on unauthorised Traveller sites, which makes it even more difficult for councils to uphold planning law. There is the prospect of even more unrestricted development. Can we have an early statement or a debate so that the Deputy Prime Minister can be challenged on this new initiative?</p>
	<p pid=".1685.3/2">Two weeks ago, I asked the Leader of the House about the St. David's day debate. He replied that</p>
	<p pid=".1685.3/3" class="indent">&quot;it will have to come later . . . But there will certainly be a Welsh affairs debate.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-24">24 February 2005</phrase>; Vol. 431, c. 477.]</p>
	<p pid=".1685.3/4">Members in all parts of the House want to raise issues such as the unfair treatment of the Welsh regiments and the rising hospital waiting lists in Wales, where it has been reported that the Leader of the House, in his other job, has told the Welsh Assembly to pull its socks up. We know that Wales was recently missed off the European Union map; now it seems to have been missed off the Order Paper. When will the debate take place?</p>
	<p pid=".1685.3/5">In the light of the Chief Secretary's comments earlier today, which suggested that Labour is considering capital gains tax on people's homes, will the Leader of the House give an assurance that there will be an opportunity to discuss this further during the Budget debate? I would like an assurance that there will be a real opportunity to do so.</p>
	<p pid=".1685.3/6">What is the last moment at which motion 13 on page 1099 of the Order Paper needs to be passed to be effective in continuing the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001?</p>

	<p pid=".1686.0/1">Dream on. I do not intend to table a motion to that effect.</p>
	<p pid=".1686.0/2">On the question of Gypsy sites, the truth is that the ability to deal with the situation lapsed in 1984 when the Tory Government abolished the 1968 duty to provide sites. The Deputy Prime Minister is trying to ensure that there are proper controls on where such sites are put so that local residents are protected and the rights of Travellers are respected. The absence of the measures that the Conservatives repealed in 1984 has caused the current situation.</p>
	<p pid=".1686.0/3">There will be a Welsh affairs debate on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-04">4 April</phrase>&mdash;as soon as we get back from the Easter recess. I can give the hon. Gentleman that absolute assurance, as I indicated would be the case. He asked what might be discussed in that debate and mentioned national health service waiting times in Wales. There is no way in which the Secretary of State for Wales can order the National Assembly for Wales to do anything within its responsibilities, and the health service and waiting times are included in that. It is true that waiting times have not come down in Wales as quickly as in England, and the First Minister intends to make a statement about that matter in the coming weeks. However, it is also true that the real choice on health services in Wales is between a Labour Government, who are investing more and recruiting more nurses and doctors, and a Conservative Government, who would slash health service provision in Wales, which would lead to rocketing waiting times again.</p>
	<p pid=".1686.0/4">I did not hear the comments about capital gains tax to which the hon. Gentleman referred, but I think that there must have been some misinterpretation of what was said. I have announced four days of debate on the Budget, so there will be plenty of time for him and his colleagues to raise any matters that they like.</p>
	<p pid=".1686.0/5">On the terrorism legislation, a clear choice now faces the House of Commons and Parliament. Tomorrow is the anniversary of the Madrid bombing, which was an attack on the people of Spain by terrorists who could mount exactly the same kind of attack on London or anywhere else in Britain. That is why, on the clear advice of the security services and the police, we need new legislation. We have gone the extra mile to find consensus within the House on extra judicial protection, but the Government will not allow the fact that the Conservatives are playing politics with people's security to put us in a position of neglecting the safety and security of our citizens. The House of Lords is inviting the House of Commons to put its and the Conservative party's interests ahead of those of our constituents, but we will not do that. [Hon. Members: &quot;Answer the question.&quot; That is answering the question directly. We will pursue the legislation because we believe that it is absolutely essential. We have made concessions to build consent in the House. The Bill will provide proper safety and security for our citizens and voters, but it is quite clear that the Conservatives are playing politics.</p>

	<p pid=".1687.0/1">Will the Leader of the House give urgent consideration&mdash;perhaps he will make a statement on the matter next week&mdash;to the way in which his ministerial colleagues make statements that are directly relevant to the constituency work of hon. Members on both sides of the House without informing those Members? Let me give him an example. A written statement is being made today by the Ministry of Defence. Although the subject that it covers is not immediately apparent, I understand from my local media that they are to be briefed in just a few minutes about its implications for RAF St. Mawgan, which is in my constituency. I had to be briefed by the media to ring the office of the Minister of State, Ministry of Defence, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/990" name="Adam Ingram">the right hon. Member for East Kilbride (Mr. Ingram)</phrase>, to find out what was going on. In the past he has been meticulous in telling me what was happening, but surely it should be the responsibility of Ministers to inform constituency Members of such a matter before informing the local media.</p>
	<p pid=".1687.0/2">I understand that the statement will demonstrate that RAF St. Mawgan will be eligible for the stationing of the joint combat aircraft from 2012&mdash;that is fine. However, apparently the statement shows that the airfield will effectively be mothballed from 2007 to 2012. That would have a huge impact on my constituency, and the statement may also affect other hon. Members. Why should the local media be informed before constituency Members? Is that not a discourtesy to the House and to Members, and what will the Leader of the House do about it?</p>
	<p pid=".1687.0/3">When does the Leader of the House expect the Identity Cards Bill to complete its passage through Parliament? Apparently, it will not come before the House before the Easter recess? Does he expect it to receive Royal Assent before <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-11">Monday 11 April</phrase>? Does he accept that it is not urgent, and that there are much more pressing matters that need to be dealt with? Has he had an opportunity to read the extremely important report by the Home Affairs Committee, chaired by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/851" name="John Denham">his right hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham)</phrase>, a former Home Office Minister? In particular, has he seen the recommendation about the present practice of including paperwork in police frontline activities? The report says:</p>
	<p pid=".1687.0/4" class="indent">&quot;These tasks may be essential, but they are not what most people would consider street policing. Their inclusion skews the statistics and gives an exaggerated impression of the Government's success in returning police officers to street duties&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1687.0/5">Is that not a more pressing, urgent and important issue in the fight against crime than the Identity Cards Bill?</p>

	<p pid=".1688.0/1">May I first deal with the important point about Members of Parliament receiving adequate notice of statements? We always endeavour to inform local Members of Parliament of ministerial statements and decisions affecting their constituencies. If that has not happened in this case I am sorry because, as the hon. Gentleman was good enough to point out, the Ministry of Defence is usually punctilious about such matters. It is an issue that the Secretary of State for Defence will obviously want to take into account.</p>
	<p pid=".1688.0/2">On the Identity Cards Bill, we would like it to receive Royal Assent as early as possible. If that is possible before <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-11">11 April</phrase>, that would be very desirable indeed.</p>

	<p pid=".1688.2/1">The hon. Gentleman asked me a question. Of course, we would like the Bill to receive Royal Assent by then, but if he wants the legislation to complete its passage on such an early date, it will depend on the co-operation of both the Conservative and the Liberal Democrat Opposition. The country needs no reminding that the Labour party believes in the sensible, phased introduction of identity cards. We are moving in that direction anyway with passports and driving licences, and virtually everyone has to carry photographic ID to board an internal flight. I therefore hope that the hon. Gentleman will back the measure.</p>
	<p pid=".1688.2/2">On police activity on the street, there is widespread concern that there should be more street-level policing and people want to see bobbies on the beat. That is why we have recruited 12,500 extra police officers&mdash;the last Conservative Government cut the number of police officers&mdash;why we have recruited an extra 4,000 community support officers and why we intend to drive the number of CSOs up to 20,000. All of that would be put at risk by the massive cuts planned by the Conservatives in the Home Office budget.</p>

	<p pid=".1688.3/1">Has my right hon. Friend had time to look at early-day motion 802, which has been signed by 44 right hon. and hon. Members ?</p>
	<p pid=".1688.3/2" class="italic">[That this House is concerned that small UK science and technology businesses are at present significantly disadvantaged compared with their US competitors because of the absence of an effective UK programme to the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) programme in the US and that the commercial exploitation of the UK science base for the benefit of the UK economy is being jeopardised as a result; further notes that the introduction of such a scheme would be to the benefit both of the UK Government departments commissioning research and development projects and of the companies undertaking them; and urges the Government to introduce legislation similar in effect to the SBIR Program in the US, under which US Federal Government agencies are required by law to spend a minimum proportion of their research and development budgets with small businesses.]</p>
	<p pid=".1688.3/3">The early-day motion asks the Government to introduce a scheme similar to the small business innovation research programme in the United States, which requires Government Departments to spend 2.5 per cent. of their research and development budgets on contracts for small businesses and has proved extremely helpful in providing stable and secure funding for early-stage small businesses.</p>

	<p pid=".1689.0/1">It is an interesting early-day motion, and I am sure that the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry will want to look at it carefully. My hon. Friend has worked carefully and tirelessly in her own constituency to support the many small local businesses that are the backbone of the Cambridge economy and, indeed, the whole British economy. The buoyancy of small businesses and the growth of start-ups across Britain have developed on the back of a strong economy and are crucial to future job creation, the success of our economy and the prosperity that that brings.</p>

However, the debate on the Prevention of Terrorism Bill will continue today and may continue for a long time if the Conservative-controlled House of Lords&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Yes it is. What the House of Lords is doing down the Corridor is responding to the diktats of the Leader of the Opposition. It is playing politics with our constituents' safety and security.

Gentleman's first point, because he is an experienced parliamentarian and I have a great deal of respect for him. The truth is, however, that in the vote on the sunset clause, which would water down the ability of the Bill to control security and safety, the Government had a majority of more than 100 in this House. I do not think that the House of Lords has the constitutional right continually to overturn decisions of this House, especially when the elected Members here are representing their constituents, whose safety and security must come first. That is the issue that is at stake&mdash;whether the Lords overturn us again on the matter or whether we pass into law a Bill that reflects the needs of the police and the security services and the safety and security of all of our citizens.</p>

Friend and other Labour Members, and by Members on the other side of the House, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary made a series of concessions to try to find common ground. He sought to bring judicial supervision and authorisation up front, not only on the derogating orders but on the non-derogating orders; to ensure that Parliament has to renew the legislation every year, otherwise it lapses; that an independent review of how the Bill operates is carried out; and that the judges and the courts are put in pole position. That is why we have listened to the points that have been made. The entirely separate issue that is at stake is whether the House of Lords insists on the sunset clause, which would mean that the whole legislation would disappear in a matter of months. That is the issue&mdash;the Conservatives are busy nodding their heads&mdash;and it is a different issue from the points that Labour Members and others of independent mind made in the House of Lords and in this Chamber. The Conservatives are inviting Parliament to send a signal to any likely suicide terrorist that this House is wobbly on terrorism and suicide attacks. We cannot possibly do that.</p>

	<p pid=".1692.0/2">Early-day motion 855 refers to the part 4 powers that were ruled to be illegal by the Law Lords. That is why we have had to introduce emergency legislation that will provide judicial control, a regular report back to the House of Commons, an opportunity for review, independent scrutiny and the need for renewal after one year. All the necessary safeguards will be put in place. The most serious provisions on home detention will require a vote of the House of Commons and the House of Lords before they can be proceeded with. All of the legitimate concerns about civil liberties have been addressed, but the paramount necessity is to ensure the security and safety of our citizens, and eliminate or at least closely control the risk of suicide and other terrorist attacks. That is what we are trying to do, and I regret that an unholy coalition of the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats seeks to impede the progress of that important legislation, which would be in the interests of all of us, as the police and the security services have said.</p>

The issue is whether, in the absence of the necessary controls because of the failures of the last Conservative Government, sites should be allowed to develop in a haphazard and uncontrolled way, or proper controls and plans should be put in place. Otherwise, Travellers will move around, creating difficulty and nuisance for local residents. The issue is whether we have proper sites that are properly regulated, controlled and located in order to protect local residents' interests.

That happens because the Conservatives, the hereditaries&mdash;and, indeed, some Cross Benchers who are conservatives with a small &quot;C&quot;&mdash;can mobilise a majority to defeat the will of the elected House of Commons. There is a huge Labour majority in the House of Commons, and there is, in effect, a conservative&mdash;with both a small and a big &quot;C&quot;&mdash;majority in the House of Lords.

The guidelines issued by the Deputy Prime Minister on the requirement for councils to provide sites are not the whole answer to the problem.

There is paralysis between the planning system and the courts, with the result that the Travellers just stay there and no one stops them. Whatever the legal provision of other sites, Travellers are not prevented from developing their own unauthorised sites wherever they can get hold of a piece of land. That is the issue that must be addressed, and the Government have not yet addressed it.</p>

	<p pid=".1695.3/1">During last week's debate on renewal of the BBC charter, I raised the issue of substantially higher rates of licence fee evasion in certain parts of Northern Ireland. I have tabled early-day motion 810 on the matter:</p>
	<p pid=".1695.3/2" class="italic">[That this House notes that the Department for Culture, Media and Sport has indicated in several replies to Parliamentary Questions from the honourable Member for East Londonderry that the information regarding a regional geographic breakdown of those people not in possession of a valid television licence fee is not available; further notes that the limited information which is available indicates that in certain undefined parts of the United Kingdom there is a considerably higher rate of evasion; and calls for a more open strategy to be deployed in order that people across the United Kingdom will know where the highest evasion rates are and will be able to see that the Department is acting accordingly to ensure licence fee payments are made and the law upheld.]</p>
	<p pid=".1695.3/3">When can we expect to have a debate on transparency regarding the identification of areas in which evasion is rife, so that we can establish that the Department has not attempted a cover-up and ensure that the law is upheld?</p>

The latter will support the Muslim community, which has felt besieged in recent times. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I hope that the measure will be passed. If Labour is re-elected, the Bill will certainly get Royal Assent as soon as possible&mdash;<i>[Interruption]&mdash;</i> although I can tell from the unseemly heckling from Conservative Members that if we are not re-elected, they will not see the legislation through.</p>

	<p pid=".1697.0/1">Millions of parents and students in Britain, including conservatives with a small and a big &quot;C&quot;, will appreciate the record investment that the Government have made in Britain's schools and colleges, especially in the past three years. However, my right hon. Friend will be aware that in 16-to-19 provision a funding gap remains between schools and colleges. He might know that next Wednesday, the day of the Budget, the Association of Colleges is launching a parliamentary lobby. If in his Budget the Chancellor makes no reference to closing further the funding gap between schools and colleges, will the Leader of the House find time for a debate on the subject in the near future?</p>

	<p pid=".1697.1/1">First, I do think that there are some decent conservatives&mdash;and Conservatives&mdash;but there are none on the Opposition Benches at present. The better ones have crossed the Floor and joined the Labour party over the past few years. On the important point that my hon. Friend makes, there is indeed a gap between further education funding and school sixth form funding, and it has been too wide. That is why we saw the largest ever investment in further education funding under this Government. It is set to rise by over &pound;1 billion by the coming year, compared with three years ago&mdash;a real-terms increase of 60 per cent. compared with 2002&ndash;03. I should like to see the further education sector emerge from having been the Cinderella of the education world to being right at the top of the education sector, because it is so crucial for those who get their education under its roof.</p>

The Leader of the House will be aware that in November 2004, in response to a question from me regarding the need to reconvene the Standing Committee on Regional Affairs following the failure of the referendum in the north-east, the Deputy Leader of the House said:</p>

	<p pid=".1698.4/1">Prime Minister's porkies. Yesterday, in PMPs, my right hon. and learned Friend the Leader of the Opposition said that the Prime Minister had said that the provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism Bill could be used against protesters. The Prime Minister then said that he confessed that he had absolutely no recollection of saying that. He went on later to say that he&mdash;the Prime Minister&mdash;</p>

This is yet another case in which the Prime Minister has conveniently forgotten something, dodged the question and denied what he said. Can we please get to the bottom of this?

	<p pid=".1698.5/1">On the substance of the right hon. Gentleman's remarks, the Prime Minister was simply making the point that we all, especially when we are in government, read from time to time in the media reports that bear no resemblance to reality, and he suggested that that was one of them. He was also making the important point that legitimate protest, which I have undertaken regularly in my time, and which I will continue to respect and defend the right of people to do, is in quite a different box from the threat of suicide terrorism, the like of which we saw in Madrid a year ago and which we could see in London or elsewhere in Britain at any time. That is why we are determined to introduce the legislation. That is in an entirely different category from legitimate democratic protest, which has always been an important part of our democracy. By the way, I do not recall the right hon. Gentleman ever going round the streets of Britain to protest about anything.</p>

	<p pid=".1699.2/1">Will the Leader of the House please make it clear to the Deputy Prime Minister, on behalf of many Members, that the temporary stop notices brought in by the Government to deal with Travellers who break the law are utterly useless and a shambles? All they do is postpone the problem for 28 days. Thereafter our normal ineffective planning laws kick in. Councils need much stronger powers, as outlined in my Greenbelt Protection Bill, to evict those who break the law and to put right any damage. Otherwise, residents who live close to illegal traveller encampments, such as Hovefields, Crays Hill and Sadlers Farm in my constituency, and in many other constituencies where this is happening, will continue to be discriminated against while uneven and unfair handling of the situation is allowed to continue.</p>

	<p pid=".1699.3/1">I understand the concerns that the hon. Gentleman and others have expressed. There is a shortage of authorised sites for Gypsies and Travellers, alongside a growth in unauthorised development which is causing problems for neighbouring communities and Gypsies and Travellers alike. Local councils need more powers for swift enforcement against development in problem areas, but they also need to do more to identify land for authorised sites. The two go hand in hand. Temporary stop notices provide local planning authorities with an additional enforcement tool to deal with a wide range of planning breaches. I should have thought that in the circumstances and in his own community, the hon. Gentleman would support these tougher measures.</p>

The competent persons scheme will do that&mdash;but the measures taken thus far will not address the bulk of the problem that still exists.

We should remind the House of the measures that the Conservative Government introduced in the 1970s in conjunction with Stormont, which resulted in 3,500 British citizens being detained without the intervention of a judge, and on the orders of a politician.

If the hon. Gentleman were being fair minded, he would concede that those are isolated cases compared with the millions of extra people who had the opportunity to vote last year. Millions of people took advantage of the postal vote with no impropriety or accusations of fraud, and although fraud cases are unacceptable, they are isolated examples against the general trend.</p>

Will he confirm that the safeguard will entail a statutory instrument, which cannot be amended, can be debated for only an hour and a half, and will be taken in Committee, where relatively few hon.

The problem is that the existing legislation, which the Law Lords have deemed unlawful, expires on Monday. What should we put in its place? The security services and the police have told us that they believe that the legislation that has been ruled unlawful acted as a powerful deterrent. They have told the Government, the Prime Minister, the Home Secretary and me, in my capacity as Leader of the House of Commons, that that legislation effectively put up a notice to would-be suicide terrorists that Britain is not a soft touch. We cannot continue to use that legislation so we must replace it, and that is what we are seeking to do. All Conservatives, wherever they are in Parliament, should respect the safety and security of our citizens and support the Government, which we would have done in opposition, and they have shown rank hypocrisy in failing to do so.</p>

	<p pid=".1705.0/1">Let me remind the House that until 1997 there was no bar on Members who had not taken the Oath entering the precincts and having access to facilities and services. I can see no logic in the Conservatives' suggestion that we should bar Sinn Fein Members from the Palace of Westminster now, given that not once during their 18 years in government did they attempt to withdraw the right of access from Sinn Fein. Long before the IRA ceasefire and the Good Friday agreement, Gerry Adams, as an elected Member, was allowed the right to enter the precincts and to use the services of the House. We are now in a different situation, since the Good Friday agreement, whereby Sinn Fein has been signed up, in name at least, to a peaceful and democratic path. That is the difference.</p>

	<p pid=".1705.1/1">Surely the Leader of the House will acknowledge that up until 1997 Sinn Fein Members stood on a clear platform of abstention and said that they would not come here.

	<p pid=".1705.3/1">I appreciate that careful distinctions have to be drawn here, and it is sometimes difficult to do so, but I think that the Leader of the House was mistaken when he said that all that needed to be done was to remove the money to which the persons returned to serve in the House who had not taken the Oath had access. That is not entirely accurate. Yes, they could have come into the House, although they did not have offices assigned to them. However, they have access on those terms to offices and, indeed, to facilities that a member of the public would not have. The position for people who had not taken the Oath was that they could enter in the same way as a member of the public, but the resolution that has been mentioned gave them additional access and offices. The Leader of the House may not have appreciated those distinctions and may now want to revisit them.</p>

	<p pid=".1705.4/1">I shall explain why the Government are adopting this position instead of seeking to bar access entirely. This a very serious motion.

At a British-Irish parliamentary body meeting earlier this week, there was very strong condemnation of the IRA, not least from Irish Deputies, one after another of whom bitterly criticised the criminality in the organisation and its betrayal of the Good Friday agreement. In supporting the motion, is it not important to recognise that Sinn Fein was elected with the electorate voting for it in the knowledge that Sinn Fein MPs would not take their seats in the House of Commons? We must be very careful, now and in future, not to give Sinn Fein Members any idea of being martyrs and playing to their electorate along those lines.</p>

Members will recall that the Independent Monitoring Commission made clear in its report that, had it been reporting when the Assembly was sitting, it would have recommended the exclusion of Sinn Fein Ministers from the Northern Ireland Executive. In the absence of an Assembly, the commission's power to make recommendations is more limited and it therefore recommended that the Secretary of State should consider taking financial measures against Sinn Fein in the context of the suspended Assembly. My right hon. Friend has made clear his intention to do just that.</p>
	<p pid=".1707.0/4">The House will, in due course, have the opportunity to debate that issue further in the context of a direction made by my right hon. Friend to suspend the payment of Northern Ireland party grants for a further 12 months. The commission also mentioned in its report other public money paid to Sinn Fein. Although it was outside the commission's scope to make recommendations about that, its comments have nevertheless led the Government to conclude that it was right that the House should have the opportunity to consider imposing a similar restriction on allowances paid to Sinn Fein Members of this House.</p>
	<p pid=".1707.0/5">The motion before us today is an expression of the House's profound disapproval of the activities of the Provisional IRA and the responsibility that Sinn Fein shares for those activities in the estimation&mdash;that is the important point&mdash;of the Independent Monitoring Commission. However, the motion also takes account of the fundamental right of citizens in constituencies that have returned Sinn Fein Members to be represented.</p>

	<p pid=".1707.1/1">The Leader of the House mentioned the sanctions to be taken against Sinn Fein as a party. He knows that, when the House passed the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, we made an exception for Northern Ireland political parties on accountability and foreign funding on the ground that some were all-Ireland parties. We had Sinn Fein in mind at the time. The regulations in the Republic have now changed and parties there are accountable. Will the Government therefore consider repealing the relevant provisions of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act?</p>

	<p pid=".1708.0/1">The House has just renewed the measure, but the Government are in discussion with the Republic of Ireland Government and we will continue to monitor the position.</p>
	<p pid=".1708.0/2">The balance involved is difficult to strike and it gives me no pleasure to bring forward the motion because I believe that every Member elected to this House should take his or her seat in the Chamber. Not to do so is a denial of the representation that their constituents have a right to expect, whether those constituents voted for the elected Member or not&mdash;indeed, whether they voted at all. That is important. Those in the constituencies of the four affected Members, even those who did not vote Sinn Fein, have a right to normal parliamentary representation. That is why are taking away the &pound;430,000-odd but leaving in place those Members' right to help their constituents through the facilities of the House.</p>
	<p pid=".1708.0/3">Although we all acknowledge the political position of Irish republicanism, the Government believe that Sinn Fein Members should take their seats and participate fully in the democratic process, partly because we want them to be committed to exclusively democratic means and partly because their constituents have a simple right to that representation.</p>
	<p pid=".1708.0/4">When the House voted in 2001 to grant allowances to Members who chose not to take their seats, it did that in recognition of the importance of those Members' fulfilling their duty to constituents. It is important and fair to say that the House was also mindful of the progress along the path to democracy made by Sinn Fein at that time. We all want continuously to encourage that progress and the motion is designed to do that.</p>
	<p pid=".1708.0/5">It is the view of the British and Irish Governments and of international opinion that the progress has faltered and slipped backwards because of the activities of the Provisional IRA. That is what has changed since the House made its decision in 2001. However, neither the duty of Sinn Fein Members to their constituents nor those constituents' rights have changed, which is why I believe that the motion achieves the right balance.</p>

It gives the Democratic Unionist party 28 per cent. and Sinn Fein and the Social Democratic and Labour party 20 per cent., with the Ulster Unionist party down on 16 per cent.

	<p pid=".1708.3/1">I did not see the opinion poll, but I should think that the hon.

That is in the interests of us all.</p>

	<p pid=".1709.1/1">I understand the hon. Gentleman's point, but several factors must be carefully balanced. First, the four Members are elected just as he is and just as I am. Their constituents have a right to representation just as his do. He represents them well and I try to do that for my constituents. We are imposing an important sanction&mdash;withdrawing nearly &pound;440,000-worth of expenses, which help those Members to represent their constituents. However, access to the House's facilities remains to enable them to perform their duties.</p>

	<p pid=".1709.2/1">Is not one of the problems that Gerry Adams and his colleagues have never made sufficient use of the opportunity to visit the House and enable the rest of us, who disagree with many of their positions, to contact them, nobble them and press differing views? They took the money and ran. There is therefore a case for removing the money, although the argument about the facilities for serving constituents&mdash;that does not always have to be done by them but could be done by people whom they appoint&mdash;is pertinent.</p>

	<p pid=".1709.3/1">I understand that point, but my hon. Friend will understand the republican view on whether Members should take their seats in a United Kingdom Parliament, although we disagree with it. In the past few years, as a result of Government decisions and the leadership that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has shown, there has been, until recently, increasing political mainstreaming of Sinn Fein in the democratic process. It is important not to lose sight of the opportunity to re-engage with that.</p>
	<p pid=".1709.3/2">I know that some will argue that we should go further than today's motion and deny Sinn Fein the use of facilities in the Palace of Westminster&mdash;indeed, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/820" name="Patrick Cormack">the hon. Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack)</phrase> and others have done that. However much we may disapprove of the activities of Sinn Fein, and however much we disapprove of the recent criminality of especially the Provisional IRA, the Government's view is that we should not give the appearance of denying the rights of the electorate. Whether we like it or not, that is how a decision to deny them access to their offices would be perceived.</p>
	<p pid=".1709.3/3">I also believe that a decision to deny Sinn Fein access to facilities here would put the House out of step with the devolved institutions that many Members have tried so hard to construct and sustain in Northern Ireland. The Government have signalled their intention to renew the financial penalties imposed on Sinn Fein in the suspended Northern Ireland Assembly, but all Members of the Legislative Assembly continue to have access to the building and its facilities, and neither Unionist nor nationalist parties have suggested that that should be withdrawn.</p>
	<p pid=".1709.3/4">For those reasons, I urge hon. Members to reject amendment (b). I also urge the House to reject amendment (a). I can understand the argument for simply withdrawing the allowances and considering at a later date whether they should be reinstated, but the Government believe that imposing a suspension of one year sends a better message and a clear time frame, thus encouraging the republican movement to put its house in order rather than rejecting its Members from Westminster.</p>

	<p pid=".1710.2/1">I tried to intervene earlier when the Leader of the House was drawing a distinction between Sinn Fein and the IRA in relation to his reference to the activities of Sinn Fein and, subsequently, to the criminality of the IRA. Will he take into account what the Independent Monitoring Commission said, in that it made clear that the criminal activities of republicans were known and approved by leading members of Sinn Fein? The distinction that he draws is therefore not upheld by the IMC, which is quite clear that leading Sinn Fein members knew and approved of the Northern bank raid. He is therefore wrong to draw the distinction, and that is highly important in relation to his point about Sinn Fein Members as persons who are elected as if they were normal politicians. That point has been lost.</p>

Last year, four people were killed as a result of terrorist activity. In the bad old days, 497 people were killed. Unemployment in Northern Ireland is now lower than it has been for 30 years. More tourists are going to Northern Ireland than there are residents there. The situation has been transformed. What we need to do, in part by keeping Sinn Fein in the democratic process and the whole republican movement committed to it, and in part by continuously seeking to work to achieve that, is to create a new future for Northern Ireland in which peace, stability and economic prosperity will be locked in for good.</p>

	<p pid=".1711.0/1">Is there not a danger of losing the wider picture? While the IRA can claim that it was never defeated militarily, politically, it and Sinn Fein were defeated. Northern Ireland is as much part of the United Kingdom&mdash;of course, that is the wish of the majority&mdash;as it was before the IRA started its war of terror. Would not it be wise to recognise that, if anything, the position of Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom has been strengthened by the Good Friday agreement and the right of consent that is recognised as such?</p>

	<p pid=".1711.1/1">I would prefer to put it in a different way: the Good Friday agreement has locked in bitter opponents of the Union with those most fervent supporters of the Union in a common democratic endeavour in Northern Ireland. That is the prize as a result of the leadership that has been given by the Prime Minister, and we must continuously seek to regain that prize and make sure that it is fully implemented and cemented in.</p>
	<p pid=".1711.1/2">In a place that cherishes the fundamental principles of democracy, it is deeply dispiriting to have to impose penalties on Members who have not lived up to those principles, but I believe that this motion is a just and proportionate response. By withdrawing public subsidy for Sinn Fein Members, it underscores the disapproval of all true democrats for what has happened. I commend it to the House.</p>

	<p pid=".1712.0/1">The Leader of the House misunderstood the intervention that I made earlier. I was supporting the Government's position, which is quite unusual for me at the moment. My argument is that not only do Sinn Fein Members not do many of the things that the hon. Gentleman has mentioned, but they do not attend the Building so that the rest of us can have access to and discussions with them. I have talked to all leaders of Northern Ireland political parties, but only once in a great number of years of being interested in Northern Ireland have I had an opportunity to have a private conversation with Gerry Adams.

	<p pid=".1712.1/2">The original motion put forward by the Government was always unacceptable to my party and to many others in the House. We have two objections: the first is on the issue of principle; the second is on whether the tactical concession was ever really right. The official Opposition have always believed that it is simply wrong to allow Members who refuse to take their seats to enjoy the same rights as Members who do.

The Sinn Fein Members always made it clear that they would not take their seats here, as they do not believe that the British Parliament should ultimately have jurisdiction, I suppose. They seek to represent their constituents at a local level, however, through letters and so on. By taking away the funding, we are punishing their constituents.

	<p pid=".1713.1/1">It was suggested a moment ago that this was some form of punishment, and the word &quot;sanction&quot; has been used. Privileges and benefits above and beyond the rights of Members who do not take their seats were granted to these Members. Surely it is wrong to call this a punishment; we are simply withdrawing a benefit.</p>

	<p pid=".1713.2/1">I thank my hon. Friend for expressing that view. I am rather worried about the idea of using the way in which the House arranges its allowances and office facilities as a Government sanction that can be used either to punish Members or to reward them in some way. That should really be a matter for the House. I am glad that the Leader of the House is in charge of today's debate, but&mdash;I do not know whether other Members agree with this&mdash;I feel that, in respect of our facilities and the terms on which we are Members of Parliament, we should all be equal in this place. The essential fact is that these benefits and facilities are available to those who are elected and then take their seats.</p>

	<p pid=".1713.3/1">Is not the essential fact that these alleged Members do not regard themselves as Members of Parliament? They are fantasists. They consider themselves to be the legitimate Government of the whole of Ireland. That is the problem.</p>

	<p pid=".1713.5/1">Is not the real issue that if people who happen to espouse&mdash;quite mistakenly, in my view&mdash;the concept that the structure that we have is entirely unacceptable manage to attract the majority of the votes in a democratic election, we must accept that that election has taken place? The question with which we must deal is how we can represent that fact, while not providing large sums of money for all sorts of other activities. I was against giving these people the money in the first place, but it seems to me that there must be some kind of recognition that the electors&mdash;mistakenly, foolishly, stupidly and sometimes criminally&mdash;elected them. There is a median line to be found, and the House must try to find it.</p>

	<p pid=".1714.0/1">My right hon. Friend makes an important point. We should also bear in mind that at the time when the elections took place in 2001&mdash;the House's decision was made shortly after that&mdash;the atmosphere seemed to be one of encouragement. Since then&mdash;I am sure that this applies to electors in Northern Ireland as well as those of us who are present today&mdash;we have observed something that is, as the Leader of the House said, rather dispiriting. Over the past three years, at the same time as claiming taxpayers' money here, Sinn Fein has remained linked to an armed and active terrorist organisation, the Provisional IRA. Those are not just my words. The Republic's Defence Minister, Mr. Willie O'Dea, went much further. The British Government often use the words &quot;inextricably linked&quot;; he said:</p>
	<p pid=".1714.0/2" class="indent">&quot;We are no longer prepared to accept the farce that Sinn Fein and the IRA are separate. They are indivisible&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1714.0/3">We have no reason to disagree with that.</p>
	<p pid=".1714.0/4">The Justice Minister in the Republic, Mr. McDowell, has named three senior members of Sinn Fein&mdash;including two Members of the House of Commons&mdash;as also being senior figures on the IRA's so-called army council. I am not in a position to dispute that either. We have ample evidence of the extent to which the IRA controls a vast criminal empire to finance its operations. We now know that at the same time as members of Sinn Fein were involved in negotiations that could have led to their being Ministers in the Government in Northern Ireland, the IRA was planning the biggest bank raid in British history.</p>

	<p pid=".1714.1/1">The hon. Gentleman should bear in mind that yesterday's newspapers quoted the head of the police in Northern Ireland as saying that he agreed that the two Members of the House of Commons were members of the IRA's army council.</p>

	<p pid=".1714.3/1">Is not the nub of the issue the fact that these people are associated with, and have probably been involved in, criminal and terrorist activities?

	<p pid=".1714.4/1">My hon. Friend makes his point extremely well. Moreover, whereas in the context of those orders we are asking for a sunset clause and being told how unreasonable that is and how such a clause would weaken the legislation, in this instance the Minister is introducing one.</p>

	<p pid=".1714.6/1">It is a sunset clause&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> The Minister is saying something sotto voce, but it is exactly that.</p>
	<p pid=".1714.6/2">According to the Irish Prime Minister, the bank raid would have been known about at the highest level of Sinn Fein. As one former senior member of the IRA said yesterday, if that were not the case it would be like Britain going to war with Iraq without the Prime Minister knowing.</p>
	<p pid=".1714.6/3">The Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, Hugh Orde, is in no doubt about where the responsibility for the bank robbery lies; nor is his counterpart in the Republic, the Garda commissioner Mr. Conroy. In blaming the IRA for the Northern bank robbery and a number of other recent robberies in Northern Ireland, the Independent Monitoring Commission was emphatic:</p>
	<p pid=".1714.6/4" class="indent">&quot;In our view Sinn Fein must bear its share of responsibility for all the incidents. Some of its senior members, who are also . . . members of PIRA, were involved in sanctioning the series of robberies.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1714.6/5">Since then, we have seen evidence of money laundering, in addition to the intimidation, beatings, shootings and murders that continue in nationalist areas. That was illustrated recently by the brutal murder of Robert McCartney by members of the IRA following a row in a Belfast bar.</p>
	<p pid=".1714.6/6">I, for one, pay tribute to the family and friends of Mr. McCartney for their courage in standing up to the IRA in their efforts to secure justice, and I join those who have expressed their utter disgust at the IRA's offer to shoot those whom they deem responsible. How that contrasts with the dignity of the family who want to see the guilty men brought to court and subjected to due process!</p>
	<p pid=".1714.6/7">As the McCartney family have said, they want justice, not revenge. They want people to go to the police, not engage in the law of the wild west. Yet even today, despite the warm words of Sinn Fein, we learn that the family still believe that witnesses are being intimidated. Last week, Sinn Fein announced that it was expelling seven members in connection with that incident. What normal political party has to expel a group of its members for involvement in murder?</p>

	<p pid=".1715.0/1">Obviously, the killing was atrocious and appalling, but does the hon. Gentleman acknowledge that at last week's Sinn Fein conference the Sinn Fein leadership made it very clear that people should come forward and go to the police so that the due process of law could take place?</p>

	<p pid=".1715.1/1">I know from past debates with the hon. Gentleman that he reads <i>The Guardian</i>. He should read its front page today.</p>
	<p pid=".1715.1/2">In the light of all that, we welcome the Government's decision to take action against Sinn Fein Members. We opposed the original decision to grant these concessions in December 2001, and we argued for its reversal following the suspension of the Assembly and Executive in October 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".1715.1/3">In our view, however, the motion does not go far enough. We do not believe that the suspension should be time limited for only 12 months. What is the justification for that? We take the view that Sinn Fein Members should lose access to all, not just some, of the facilities at Westminster that the Government granted to them in December 2001. Amendment (a) would remove the sunset clause and make the removal of facilities and allowances permanent; amendment (b) includes reference to the office and other facilities as well as the allowances.</p>
	<p pid=".1715.1/4">In justifying the decision of December 2001, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/817" name="Robin Cook">the right hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook)</phrase>, then the Leader of the House, was adamant that the concessions were justified by progress made in the peace process. Today we can see that, because of Sinn Fein-IRA, there has been no devolution for two and a half years and there has been a succession of breaches of the agreement and the cease fire. On the Government's own logic, we should be reversing the changes that were brought about in December 2001.</p>

	<p pid=".1716.0/1">I would be opposed to Sinn Fein, even if the organisation were not so closely linked with the IRA. I consider it a totalitarian organisation, and heaven forbid if it were ever to rule in Ireland. However, does the hon. Gentleman accept that there is a danger, particularly when Sinn Fein is rightly on the defensive over the brutal murder of Robert McCartney, of giving the organisation a sort of martyr status? It makes it easier for Sinn Fein Members to portray themselves to the electors of Northern Ireland as having been penalised by British parliamentarians and all the rest of it. In that light, is not the Leader of the House achieving the right balance in the motion?</p>

	<p pid=".1716.1/1">It is certainly important to strike the right balance, but I believe that amendments (a) and (b) are required in order to send out the right message. Since the general election of 2001 and the time when the changes were made, we have not seen the full commitment that we expected to see from Sinn Fein-IRA, but experienced the problems that I have already outlined. In those circumstances, simply saying that some of the allowances will be removed for a short period is not the firm response that we would expect from the House. If we were to accept the amendments to the motion, it would highlight for the benefit of Northern Ireland voters what the House thinks about the response to the concessions that were made in the 2001 resolution.</p>

	<p pid=".1716.2/1">Is not one of the main problems the fact that the Government have not named the organisation that we are talking about? Is not <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1151" name="Ian Paisley">the hon. Member for North Antrim (Rev. Ian Paisley)</phrase> right that it would be much better if we said that are making these changes in response to the actions of Sinn Fein-IRA? I believe that it would be much easier if we did that. Because we are not saying that, we have to deal with a very difficult lacuna. What do we do about people who do not want to come to the House for reasons that might, at some future time, be acceptable? I cannot think of an occasion at the moment, but some people have taken that view in the past. Should we not have pressed for the motion to be viewed as a specific response to what Sinn Fein-IRA has done?</p>

	<p pid=".1716.3/1">I am grateful to my right hon. Friend. There are two points here. First, all Members should be treated equally, and they are&mdash;or they were&mdash;in the sense that elected Members who take their seats receive the benefits and those who do not take their seats do not get the benefits. That is why we opposed the original resolution in 2001, which we felt was creating two classes of Members. My right hon. Friend's suggestion would interfere with the principle that we want to maintain&mdash;that all Members are to be treated in the same way. Secondly, however, there is a strong case for a clear condemnation of the way in which Sinn Fein-IRA has behaved. I certainly agree with all the Members who have made that point. We have been very clear about that at all stages of the proceedings.</p>

	<p pid=".1717.0/1">If I understand the hon. Gentleman correctly, it is a matter of principle for him that those who are either unable or choose not to take their seats in the House should not have office access. I presume that if it really is a matter of principle for him, those who are suspended from the House should also be denied access to their offices. [Hon.

	<p pid=".1717.1/1">The hon. Gentleman may not realise it, but that is already the case. It is right that Members who take up their seats in this place should have all the facilities available to them, but it is a different matter if a Member is disciplined by the House.</p>
	<p pid=".1717.1/2">I urge all right hon. and hon. Members who care about the traditions of the House and who are committed to peaceful and democratic politics in these islands to support the amendments.</p>

	<p pid=".1717.2/1">I want to make my position on this matter as clear as I did at the last Northern Ireland questions&mdash;I am not in favour of the motion. I have never been in favour of it for a number of reasons that I hope to explain. I am not going to vote in favour of it today. I come from a long tradition in relation to where I live and also to my family, which recognised the refusal to take or affirm an oath of allegiance as part of the nationalist or republican tradition. That is something that goes way back into Irish history and it runs very deeply in people that come from that tradition.</p>
	<p pid=".1717.2/2">I immediately recognise two sets of principles, which have already been enunciated. It is an absolutely legitimate principle to say that anyone in this House or any democratic forum should have equality and that there should be only one set of rules by which people abide. I recognise that principle and I respect it as absolutely legitimate.</p>
	<p pid=".1717.2/3">I am also aware of the other principle, as I have already mentioned. There is a curious pristine legitimacy about it. However, I see no pristine legitimacy in justifying a set of actions on the basis of principle, while saying, &quot;Those are my principles; I am not breaking them; but, by the way, can I have the money on the side?&quot; In many ways, that is what is happening here. The nationalist-republican tradition is the principle on which some Members justify not attending Parliament, yet that principle does not seem to get in the way of the allowances or advantages&mdash;financial and otherwise&mdash;that stem from Parliament.</p>
	<p pid=".1717.2/4">It is difficult to have respect for a principled position&mdash;the shadow Leader of the House touched on it&mdash;when that principled position, in terms of its own definition, contaminates itself by having a hand out sideways for the money, while the principle is maintained in public. That is one of the reasons why I look upon the matter with a jaundiced eye.</p>
	<p pid=".1717.2/5">There will be a lot of righteous indignation about the motion before the House. I recognise and respect that, but there will probably be little recognition of what lies at the heart of the issue&mdash;a disrespect for the institutions of Parliament shown by those who will take the money, but not come to put their case on the Floor of the House. People may have different political persuasions, but they must not disrespect our political institutions. In the Northern Ireland arrangement, that disrespect means that there can be little respect between political adversaries.</p>
	<p pid=".1717.2/6">I want to make several minor points. We all know the value of publicity in the run-up to a general election. How much publicity could the Labour, Conservative, Democratic Unionist, Ulster Unionist or Social Democratic and Labour parties buy for &pound;400,000? Could they buy as much as has been secured today, in this debate, by the party at which the motion is aimed? In my view, they most certainly could not. That party will milk today's debate, making it another grievance to add the list. It seems to thrive on the grievance culture, in which this motion will become another element. Every statement and interview by that party is permeated by a sense of victimhood, and many people will consider the unprincipled decision in this matter to have been taken by this House. For that reason, I regard the motion with a jaundiced eye.</p>
	<p pid=".1717.2/7">Secondly, I want to look beyond today's debate. I do not want to talk about bank raids or recent murders or developments in Northern Ireland. The motion is part of the process by which negotiations are progressed through deals on the side. I do not accept that a shaft of light struck the Government, individually or collectively&mdash;but including the Leader of the House and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland&mdash;and that as a result they decided to propose this motion. That decision was made in negotiations with a political party, as a side deal to the other negotiations in hand at the time.</p>
	<p pid=".1717.2/8">When was the issue discussed with the Ulster Unionist, Democratic Unionist or Social Democratic and Labour parties? It was never discussed, as it belongs in the category of side deals. It is part of the goodies and sweeteners used to get and keep people on board. What effect does such a deal have on the real negotiations about very serious issues, or on the future? What will be its effect on those parties that negotiate in good faith? The harsh reality is that negotiations on Northern Ireland over the past seven years could provide a template, usable by any country in the world, for resolving conflicts by removing all the middle ground. Until the fault line in the negotiating process is recognised, the difficulties will continue and increase.</p>
	<p pid=".1717.2/9">I was interested to hear various hon. Members say that the political process and mandate required that the party at which the motion is aimed has some presence at Westminster. I am one of those who have fought elections in which men with guns have stood at the polling station door, telling people that they could not, and should not, vote. I have had the same guns thrust in my face and put to my head, and been told that it was disloyal of me to seek a mandate in an election, regardless of whether that election was for Westminster or the Northern Ireland Assembly. Some people may consider such a mandate sacrosanct; my approach is different.</p>
	<p pid=".1717.2/10">As I said, two sets of principles are at work. One is demeaned by the very people who pretend and maintain that they uphold it, but do today's debate and the crucible that is the recent past show that there is a need to re-examine the process of negotiation? There is a huge difference between the process of negotiation and its subject. The Good Friday agreement is the basis for the future, but the process of negotiation has served only to diminish its chances of success.</p>
	<p pid=".1717.2/11">I have one final question, which I cannot answer. Like many other hon. Members, I will not be in the House when it is answered. The motion will be reconsidered in a year: what will happen then, if the money is still required by those who claim to uphold the principle on which the motion is based? What line will the Government of the day take? What will be the criteria governing the reintroduction of the provisions? Will they remain unchanged? Will they be reintroduced in a different form? Will Parliament say that a principle is involved and that it will stick to it?</p>
	<p pid=".1717.2/12">In many ways, the debate will retain an element of schizophrenia. Beyond a certain point, the Government's position lacks logic. The same is true of my position, or of the position espoused by many of the people involved, and that is because the motion is based on an inherent illogicality. The feelings aroused are deep and legitimate&mdash;</p>

	<p pid=".1719.1/1">Given that there will be a free vote on the motion, my guidance to my party colleagues is that they should support the motion and resist amendments (a) and (b).</p>
	<p pid=".1719.1/2">In the aftermath of the Northern bank robbery in Belfast, I have been frustrated to the point of anger on a number of occasions by the fact that so little of the proof, evidence or intelligence that the Government claim to possess has been made available to Opposition politicians. The Government say that that information has led them to believe that the IRA was responsible for the crime, but they have been determined to keep everyone else in the dark, even though other parties have expressed a genuine and ongoing commitment to the peace process.</p>
	<p pid=".1719.1/3">Neither I nor any other member of my party has ever said that the IRA is innocent, but we have said that the Government must reciprocate our good faith by showing us the evidence for their claims. I am glad to say that the Government responded recently to my request for more information. It is available only on Privy Council terms, through the office of my party leader, but I am grateful nevertheless. I hope that complaints or objections lodged here or in the press will not be necessary for Ministers to include us in the information loop in the future. But let us not be churlish. People from both sides have learned something from that and I am grateful for the dialogues that we have had since then.</p>

	<p pid=".1720.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is now creating two classes of Members: those who will be privileged to have the information and those of us who will not. There are other grounds for believing what the Prime Minister and the Taoiseach have said. After 10 years of very hard work&mdash;showing a devotion to something that no two leaders in these islands have ever done in history&mdash;they would not have put it all at risk by making that statement if they did not believe it entirely and wholeheartedly. While I accept the point on weapons of mass destruction, and while I voted with the hon. Gentleman yesterday because I do not believe that people should be incarcerated without being given the evidence upon which they are being incarcerated and an opportunity to contradict it, on this occasion I am prepared to believe, and do believe, both leaders of both countries.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-03-10.1720.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1143" speakername="Lembit pik" colnum="1720"  time="14:27:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050310/debtext/50310-17.htm#50310-17_spnew2">
	<p pid=".1720.1/1">On the first point, the hon. Gentleman is right that my comments imply two classes of politician. Indeed, they exist: we have Privy Councillors and the rest of us. Let me make it clear to him that I have not been privy to the information that I have discussed&mdash;the dialogue has been directly between my leader, who is of course a Privy Councillor, and others&mdash;but I do register my belief that those of us who have now been actively involved, as the hon. Gentleman has, for many years do reasonably expect to be involved, on the basis of good faith, in the sharing of information.</p>
	<p pid=".1720.1/2">On the second point&mdash;let me be very clear about this&mdash;the Government have in many ways enjoyed a great deal of good will since their election success in 1997, the year in which they formed the Government, but to be honest, much of it has now been squandered. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the weapons of mass destruction debacle, which was used to justify a war, when we now see that no such evidence existed. Any member of the Government or the Opposition is entitled to be a lot more cautious these days and in future, and to require a higher level of evidence before important decisions are made with our support.</p>
	<p pid=".1720.1/3">Having said that, I think that the Government have made progress, which is welcome. Furthermore, events have moved on and, notwithstanding the Government's resistance to sharing important information with other Members of the House, the Independent Monitoring Commission has made some very important statements and I would be inclined to believe them. Lord Alderdice, whom I know well and respect greatly, is one of the influential thought leaders on these matters, and if he and the IMC believe that the IRA were involved in the robbery from the Northern bank, I would say that that in itself is important, albeit secondary, evidence to suggest that that is the case.</p>
	<p pid=".1720.1/4">Secondly, and even more importantly, I think that the killing of Robert McCartney dwarfs even the appalling nature of the Northern bank robbery. That is because of the sheer violence of the occurrence, the tragedy that flowed from it and, most significantly of all, the apparent involvement of the IRA in dissuading witnesses from coming forth. That offence, perhaps more even than the Northern bank robbery, causes me to believe that we have little option other than to introduce the financial sanctions that have been proposed by the Government.</p>

	<p pid=".1721.0/1">Would the hon. Gentleman like to consider that, in addition to the offences that he has outlined, the fact that we have significant information from the Chief Constable and others that three of the four Members are in fact members of the IRA army council would add to the weight of evidence that he has outlined and should motivate Liberal Democrat Members to vote in the Aye Lobby tonight?</p>

	<p pid=".1721.1/1">The information that the hon. Gentleman highlights is, either through fact or assumption, pretty much known to us and has been for a long time. I know his position. I think that he has never felt comfortable with the granting of office facilities to those individuals, in large part for the very reason that he outlines. I have taken a different view. My feeling is that providing office access to these individuals has been, on balance, helpful to the peace process and to increasing pressure on Sinn Fein to try to bring its own house into order. That is a legitimate difference of view, but today's debate and the question of sanctions against Sinn Fein on the direct evidence indicating the seriousness of recent crimes is actually a slightly different matter, and probably not influenced directly by that information.</p>

	<p pid=".1721.2/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way because I am following his argument closely and I want to question his logic. He said that giving the Sinn Fein MPs office space has moved towards encouraging them down the road of good and proper parliamentary democracy, yet actually we have had the Executive suspended in Northern Ireland for over a year because of Sinn Fein activity. Not just that, but we have had the extraordinary behaviour of Sinn Fein-IRA, which are inextricably linked, and he has just admitted that he accepts that three of those MPs are on the army council. They are the IRA itself.</p>

	<p pid=".1721.3/1">The hon. Gentleman has slightly misunderstood what I said because he believes that I have implied that the office space granted to the Sinn Fein Members has necessarily contributed to&mdash;I will try to quote him now&mdash;its adherence to parliamentary democracy. That is not what I said. I said that the fact that they can operate within the walls of Parliament has actively helped us&mdash;certainly those of us who have been involved from Opposition parties&mdash;to commence dialogue with Sinn Fein, which I genuinely believe has altered that organisation's comments in the public domain and pressured Sinn Fein to put pressure on the IRA to come into line. The reason we are here today is because Sinn Fein has evidently failed in what I believe to be its duty to bring the criminal activities of the IRA into order.</p>
	<p pid=".1721.3/2">The hon. Gentleman will also know that paragraph 13 of the joint declaration made it absolutely clear that it was not acceptable to have an underlying level of either violence or criminal activity, and that those could be considered to constitute a violation of the ceasefire. This is why we are here, because I think we have to recognise that Sinn Fein must be brought to account for what has been going on with the IRA, but here is the irony: had we not given those facilities in the first place, we would not have the sanction to impose now. And the double irony&mdash;<i>[Laughter.]</i> I am delighted that Conservatives finally recognise the importance of the influence we can now wield. Conservative Front-Benchers disappoint me by failing to understand the seminal importance of what we are doing. We are seeking to normalise Sinn Fein's operation when it comes to being a political party. I, for one, believe that we have gone some way down that track but, crucially, the fact that Sinn Fein has itself in a mealy-mouthed and vague way begun to condemn some of the activities of the IRA of late, can only be as a direct result of the pain it feels as a result of these sanctions. Others in this Chamber may disagree with that point of view, and I am happy to allow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1049" name="David Lidington">the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington)</phrase> to intervene, but they must surely recognise that the entire political process in Northern Ireland has been characterised by such difficult decisions, by the Labour Government and previously by the Conservatives.</p>

	<p pid=".1722.0/1">Much as I would like to believe that conversations that the hon. Gentleman or I or any other Opposition politician have had with Sinn Fein have led to the sort of differences that he thinks he has seen, does not he really believe that what has persuaded Sinn Fein to come up with some of the mealy-mouthed expressions of regret and condemnation of recent weeks has been nothing to do with that, but rather with the drive by the criminal enforcement agencies in the Irish Republic against its operations, and the unmitigated anger of Irish nationalists and republicans at the brutality of the murder of Robert McCartney?</p>

	<p pid=".1722.1/1">In part, I agree, but I have also had conversations with Sinn Fein and I personally judged that it is hurt&mdash;in a financial sense and a very real sense&mdash;by the sanctions that we are discussing today. If the hon. Gentleman has a different view, he has obviously had different conversations from mine with Sinn Fein and drawn different conclusions. One of the great things about democracy is that we are allowed to hold different views and I look forward to hearing his further views later in the debate, but what I find particularly confusing is the apparently contradictory position taken by the Conservatives when in opposition in comparison with the kind of things that they did when in government.</p>
	<p pid=".1722.1/2">Has the hon. Gentleman forgotten, for example, that John Major was in communication with the IRA when it had not even instituted a ceasefire? Was he an apologist for the IRA? Is that what the hon. Gentleman is suggesting? I do not think so. I think that, despite my many criticisms of the Conservative Government at the time, one thing that they can be proud of is the risk that they took to initiate what went on to become the peace process. Taking the hon. Gentleman's absolutist view, one can only condemn John Major as having taken an unreasonable step in giving Sinn Fein and the IRA succour by talking to them while they were still killing people.</p>

	<p pid=".1723.1/1">Which would be more naive, I ask the hon. Gentleman: what I have been saying, which is founded on the basis of judgment, or allowing an amnesty for weapons, as was done&mdash;once again, under Prime Minister John Major&mdash;so that terrorists could give in their guns without any fear of legal cost? Once again, that was a courageous move by John Major and the then Government. Once again, there are those who now seem to criticise the resistance of some of us to removing the offices. That could be regarded by them as further kowtowing and playing into the hands of Sinn Fein and the IRA. Had it not been for the fact that John Major and other Conservatives were willing to take such risks at the time, it is possible that we would not have gone as far as we have.</p>

	<p pid=".1723.2/1">The hon. Gentleman said that he recognised, in his terms, that Sinn Fein had made progress, but is he aware of the comments made by Mitchel McLoughlin&mdash;a leading member of Sinn Fein&mdash;on RTE television after the Northern bank raid, when he said that the murder of Jean McConville, the mother of 10 children, was not a crime?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-03-10.1723.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1143" speakername="Lembit pik" colnum="1723"  time="14:27:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050310/debtext/50310-18.htm#50310-18_spnew4">
	<p pid=".1723.3/1">Yes, I am. My judgment is that Sinn Fein has a terribly long way to go. Apropos of what the hon. Gentleman has just said, it is little short of breathtaking to me that those in the IRA can conduct themselves as they have regarding the killing of Robert McCartney, go on to suggest that the murder of the murderers is in some way a just response to that and then expect that there will be no sanction against Sinn Fein as a result. If the hon. Gentleman is suggesting that Sinn Fein and the IRA are still making astonishing and appalling mistakes and that they have managed in just a few months to harm significantly the public relations progress that they had made over many years, I agree with him, but the decision that we must make today is how best to maintain the pressure on Sinn Fein to try to do right in a very wrong situation.</p>
	<p pid=".1723.3/2">It is my judgment that to take away the financial resource is an appropriate and measured response to what we have seen&mdash;&pound;400,000, even to Sinn Fein, is a significant sum&mdash;and it illustrates that we are not satisfied with the performance of Sinn Fein and the IRA of late. Furthermore, I am encouraged that, at long last, it seems that the Government have done what the Liberal Democrats have been requesting for a long time by imposing the conditions of paragraph 13. Many times, Ministers have sought to avoid the inescapable fact that serious and organised crime in many ways constitutes a breach of the ceasefire. I hope therefore that today's debate is an indication that the Government will take more seriously the complaints that many of us have made that the troubles are not simply confined to bombing and shooting, but include organised crime.</p>

	<p pid=".1724.1/1">I think that paragraph 13 makes it pretty clear that organised crime is included. I did not realise that the hon. Gentleman held that view. I would have assumed that he agreed that it is quite a simple matter for Ministers to interpret serious and organised crime as part of the terms of that paragraph. I look forward to hearing what other hon. Members have to say about that point.</p>
	<p pid=".1724.1/2">In conclusion, it is my judgment that we are right to impose the financial sanctions. Despite the Conservatives' apparent scepticism, about which I am surprised, the financial sanction will cause pain to Sinn Fein. In fact, I am surprised more than anything that the Conservatives feel that we are so ineffectual in the House that such measures are not taken seriously by others. However, it is appropriate to allow Sinn Fein to retain the office space for the reasons that I have given before. Furthermore, that allows us a further opportunity to return to increased sanctions if that is required.</p>
	<p pid=".1724.1/3">I find the whole issue of sanctions against Sinn Fein manifestly vexing and emotive, as we have heard in our recent exchanges, but one must maintain a level head when dealing with Sinn Fein. One must ask what is objectively the most effective means to control the excesses of the IRA and what limited impact we can have through Sinn Fein. As a result, I will encourage my colleagues in the Liberal Democrats to vote for the motion and against amendments (a) and (b). I ask other hon. Members, including those who sit on the Conservative Front Bench, to subjugate their feelings to their values and to do what they think is right, rather than what they think is expedient.</p>

	<p pid=".1724.2/1">It is always a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1143" name="Lembit pik">the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &Ouml;pik)</phrase>. Usually, we are in agreement, but I am not in agreement with his views today, although I understand his reasons for saying what he said. I noticed that he said that the Liberal Democrats would have a free vote. I do not think that the Labour party will have a free vote. [Hon. Members: &quot;We will.&quot;] We will have a free vote&mdash;good&mdash;because I put my name to amendments (a) and (b) anyway. Clearly, this is a parliamentary matter, and it should be decided on a free vote for all hon. Members. That allows myself and perhaps a couple of my colleagues whom I have sometimes supported and been involved with over the past couple of days to be on different sides on this issue.</p>
	<p pid=".1724.2/2">I listened with great respect to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1091" name="Seamus Mallon">the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh (Mr. Mallon)</phrase>, and what he talked about and the way that he said it were well worth listening to, even though we may come to a different view about how we vote. However, the clear issue is the huge hypocrisy of Sinn Fein-IRA. They do not respect Parliament. They do not respect you, Madam Deputy Speaker. They do not respect anything about this British institution, yet they are prepared to take British taxpayers' money from my constituents to fund their political activity. That is rank hypocrisy. Of course, it is one of the reasons why, initially, I and many of my colleagues, even those on the Labour Benches, opposed the original decision&mdash;this precedent&mdash;to change the way that Members who do not take their seats are treated in the House. I said at the time that that would come back to haunt us. It is coming back to haunt us, and we are now having to go back and the Government are having to move to abolish the &pound;400,000-odd that those Members get, but I do not think that that goes far enough.</p>
	<p pid=".1724.2/3">The money, the offices and the facilities of the House are linked. When we go down the road of taking away the extra privileges&mdash;not a sanction&mdash;let us consider that those changes were made specifically as part of a genuine attempt by some Members to help the peace process. That attempt has clearly failed, so we should go back to square one. Square one means that those who are not prepared to take their seats should accept, as many nationalist Members have done over the years, that if they are elected to Parliament while Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom, they have to take the good with the bad. The good means that they receive payment and facilities. The bad means that they have to take their seats, as some Members who feel very passionate about the future of Northern Ireland have done over the years.</p>
	<p pid=".1724.2/4">I know that those people will plead martyrdom. Some Members have used that as a reason why we should not rescind what was agreed, but the reality is that those people will plead martyrdom whatever we do today. It seems rather strange that they will not plead martyrdom if we take away their money, but they will if we take away their offices.</p>
	<p pid=".1724.2/5">Those Members do not come here very often and in any case they do not try to engage in dialogue, but I find it distasteful to have to sit at a table in Portcullis House, as I did last week, next to someone who, as I and everyone in the House know, is a terrorist and a member of the army council. I do not know quite what he was eating as I did not look that closely, but he was eating subsidised food. That is outrageous at a time when, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/820" name="Patrick Cormack">the hon. Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack)</phrase> pointed out, we are passing a measure that will take away the liberties of many, many people merely on suspicion&mdash;although I shall continue to oppose it if the House of Lords continues to maintain its position. We have more than a suspicion about the Sinn Fein Members of the House, certainly two of them.</p>
	<p pid=".1724.2/6">I find it amazing that, once again, the Government are prepared to do nothing but hold out this carrot, when time after time their hand is bitten off and we still allow these things to continue. Today, there was an opportunity for the Government, backed by all the parties, to move forward and say once and for all that until Sinn Fein-IRA decides that it is a proper political party that will use democratic means and give up criminal activity and organised criminality, its members cannot be treated as normal politicians.</p>
	<p pid=".1724.2/7">I shall obviously vote for the Government's motion, but I hope that in this free vote Members will realise that the motion does not go far enough. It will not be the martyrdom of Sinn Fein; it will just make them feel that once again they have got away with whatever they want. We must not allow that to happen any longer.</p>

Because they are elected Members, there is nothing now or even when we have passed the motion to bar them from coming to this place. They can do as they did in Stormont; they can take the Oath in whispers so that nobody can hear them. They can sign the book and walk out and our motion will be finished. Finished. There is only one crime&mdash;that they do not take their seats.</p>
	<p pid=".1726.0/3">I fear that the motion is but a preparation to open the door again to the IRA in a year's time, or perhaps before. I am amazed that the Leader of the House said that we want to keep them in the democratic process. They have left the democratic process. Some of us came to the House and sat on these Benches, and as proper democrats made known our views on policy. For two and a half years, the Prime Minister of this country would not speak to me. Although I attended the House, he would not speak to me. Nobody in the House said, &quot;That's a shame&quot;. When they want Government policy to go ahead, they do not worry about who is hurt.</p>

	<p pid=".1726.2/1">Indeed. If the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh had stayed in the House long enough, he might even have been a right hon. Member.</p>
	<p pid=".1726.2/2">However, I disagree with the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh's interpretation of history. As I understand Irish history, the nationalists were keen to come to the House in the old days. They were keen to take the Oath and to declare which side of the House they supported. It seems to me that it is the republican element that brought in boycotting and the refusal to take the Oath. But that is a question for another day.</p>
	<p pid=".1726.2/3">I am greatly concerned about what will happen when we pass the motion. We are to wait a whole year, but in a year's time, nothing will change and eventually the door will open again to IRA-Sinn Fein.</p>
	<p pid=".1726.2/4">I have worked all my pastoral life in the Short Strand area. I have been there for about 57 years and I know the area better than anybody in the House. I know the people of the area. Because of the terrible murder that took place, those people were prepared to come out into the open. I salute their heroism and determination and I hope that they achieve what they are after. If the IRA had shot the people who were named after that murder had taken place, would the House still be doing what it is doing today? Of course it would. The same arguments that we have heard today would be put&mdash;that we do not want to make martyrs of them and so on and so forth.</p>
	<p pid=".1726.2/5">I do not know when all of this will end. I have before me a paper that was given to the Prime Minister and the chief of police. It gives information about what were known as the killing fields of Northern Ireland&mdash;south Armagh&mdash;and describes many incidents that took place. It is a plea from people whose friends were murdered that the police will do something about it.</p>
	<p pid=".1726.2/6">The document lists the activities of Thomas Slab Murphy who is well-known to people in Northern Ireland. It names Michael Carragher, who was an infamous IRA sniper, James McArdle, a leading IRA member, and Eddie Magill of Pointzpass and lists the accusations made against them. It also mentions John Gerard Hughes and his influence in the smuggling racket. It describes the system operated by Collins and Collins the estate agents. People in the area believe that it set up false companies to obtain VAT numbers for the criminal use of others.</p>
	<p pid=".1726.2/7">Those matters have been placed in the hands of the Prime Minister and the police, yet no real action has been taken. Are those people beyond the bounds or does the writ of the law of the House run in that area? The law-abiding citizens of Northern Ireland look at what goes on in the House. Over the past week, they have heard our debates and have heard the Government emphasise that there could be more terrorist activity, yet terrorist activity is going on and nothing is done about it. That is why the people of Northern Ireland feel that we must tell the Government that it is not peace at any price; it must be peace on the basis of democracy, fairness and justice. After all, those are the words coming from Short Strand: &quot;Give us justice. We do not want indicative anger, and we refuse to take the IRA's guns and say, 'Use them to shoot people,' because who knows who is guilty until the right word is passed?&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1726.2/8">One thing is certain: those who have already been dealt with by the IRA in order to get certain information out of them suffered in their bodies, and they cannot be produced so as to see what sufferings they endured, so do not think that it was easy for the IRA to get the information it has put out; it came the same way as violence comes, and the persons involved suffered.</p>
	<p pid=".1726.2/9">This is the situation we face. What worries me is not only the money taken from the Northern bank, but the fact that there have been other terrible robberies, involving &pound;10 million worth of tobacco and cigarettes. The Independent Monitoring Commission has noted that the IRA is responsible for those robberies. So, another &pound;10 million is involved, as well as all the other pounds it lifts in levies throughout the country. The knock at the door comes and so much is levied. The IRA knows what people earn and where they work, and that is it.</p>
	<p pid=".1726.2/10">When I was a Member of the European Parliament, I talked to a constituent who told me that at one election she had three visits from five men, who came to remind her that there was an election on and that she must vote. That woman would not have been voting for them anyway, but she told me, &quot;I saw them coming, I stood at the door with them, they gave me the message and they left.&quot; Ten days afterwards they were back again, as they were the day before the election.</p>
	<p pid=".1726.2/11">Are we going to allow the people of Northern Ireland to suffer in that way? The House must take a strong stand. We have heard some strong words from the Government and from Labour Members, who say that we must deal with terrorism. They need to deal with terrorism now, in the backyard of our country. They must deal with it thoroughly and with all the strength they can muster.</p>
	<p pid=".1726.2/12">I make a plea to the House, no matter how we vote on this weak motion, which should have mentioned the IRA. We are not putting these people out because they did not take their seats. Nobody believes that. They are being put out because of the happenings, their cruelty and their terrorism. Why not tell the people the truth?</p>
	<p pid=".1726.2/13">I do not often agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/929" name="John Gummer">the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer)</phrase>, but even he admitted that the point I was making is valid. It is valid. Why do we not mention the sins of these people, for which they are to be punished, instead of clothing the issue with this motion? I regret that we are not going to have the two good amendments, to which some of us, along with others, put their name.</p>
	<p pid=".1726.2/14">Also, we need to remind ourselves that these same people are Members of the Legislative Assembly; they will still get their money. These same people are councillors; they will still get their money. These same people have an MEP; she will get her full money from this House and the privilege given with it.</p>
	<p pid=".1726.2/15">The Government are not dealing radically with this issue. Let us face up to all the elected representatives who are in this movement and deal with them. Only in that way will they see sense and see that the game is up: no longer will violence or murder and mayhem pay. We are going to take the democratic road to peace for the future for all the people of Ulster.</p>

	<p pid=".1728.0/1">This is a difficult motion. It is difficult for some of the reasons put forward by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1151" name="Ian Paisley">the hon. Member for North Antrim (Rev. Ian Paisley)</phrase>, because it conceals a lot of issues and events that we are talking about. It is difficult also because I am not certain of its value. I do not believe, in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1143" name="Lembit pik">the way that the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &Ouml;pik)</phrase> believes, that it will do a great deal of financial harm to Sinn Fein.</p>
	<p pid=".1728.0/2">The motion is difficult for me for another reason: this is the first time on record that I can think of that I will differ from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1091" name="Seamus Mallon">my hon. Friend the Member for Newry and Armagh (Mr. Mallon)</phrase>, as I shall vote for the Government and against both amendments.</p>
	<p pid=".1728.0/3">On the question of the Oath, I believe that people who do not accept that we should have a monarchy and people who perhaps challenge the right of this island to govern that part of the island of Ireland in which they live should not be expected to take an oath of loyalty to a Head of State who disagrees with their philosophical and national ideas. I believe that they should have the opportunity of coming here and affirming or affirming an oath, saying they will carry out their duty to the best of their ability in the interests of their constituents. That should suffice.</p>
	<p pid=".1728.0/4">For those of us who wish to take an oath of allegiance, that should still be an option, but I believe that nobody should be debarred from the House on the basis of an oath that they are expected to take. We did that in respect of Catholics, Jews, Quakers and others. I do not see why we should do it in respect of people who have a philosophical objection as republicans.</p>

	<p pid=".1729.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the whole point of the Oath is to make a formal statement of acceptance of the current legal and constitutional structure, which the House embodies and within which Members have to work? Does he also accept that refusal to accept it and failure to take an oath&mdash;the only way it can be accepted is through the Oath of Allegiance, because, apart from the House and the monarchy, we do not have many institutions that cover the whole country and we do not have a written constitution that embodies that structure&mdash;are not just a mere technicality involving the monarchy, but a repudiation of that structure? As such, they ought to be an affront to the hon. Gentleman, just as they are to everybody else.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-03-10.1729.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1081" speakername="Kevin McNamara" colnum="1729"  time="15:04:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050310/debtext/50310-20.htm#50310-20_spnew1">
	<p pid=".1729.1/1">No, I do not accept that at all. I believe that people can be elected to this place who can accept the state as it exists, but who seek to change that state fundamentally in respect of how the Head of State is chosen. They can do that by taking another form of oath, which does not mean that they are being asked to betray their principles.</p>
	<p pid=".1729.1/2">I do not believe for one moment that if we had changed the Oath that would necessarily have brought people from Sinn Fein here, but we should not insist on things and say that there are not obstacles to their being here that we can remove.</p>
	<p pid=".1729.1/3">My next point is that the House should bear it in mind that there has been considerable movement on the part of Sinn Fein and its leadership, despite all the things&mdash;I admit&mdash;we have seen and know about. They are trying to lead their movement towards a peaceful acceptance. Indeed, we are told by the Government and the Democratic Unionist party that, but for want of a photograph, we would have had that in December. So, there has been movement, although hon. Members, the Government and the Taoiseach are right to point out that, probably at the same time, they were planning the robbery of the Northern bank. However, that robbery would not have affected the basic support of Sinn Fein one iota in the north of Ireland, although it might well have had an effect in the Republic. As the hon. Member for North Antrim pointed out, &pound;10 million has been robbed from bank and post offices and that has not affected Sinn Fein's position.</p>
	<p pid=".1729.1/4">Sinn Fein's position has been affected by the savage murder of Robert McCartney. That has been the real blow to Sinn Fein and IRA because it has undermined their position in their community. The event has done far more damage than any that we can do by passing the motion. The effect of the incident has been shown by their reaction to it, which was slow at first, but quickly became greater as they realised the affront that had happened in their community. The fact that they have now deplored the murder, urged people to come forward and placed names before the police ombudsman shows the pressure that the community has put on the leadership of IRA. That, more than anything, will hasten division in the republican movement. People at the head of Sinn Fein will eventually have to make a real and positive decision about that.</p>
	<p pid=".1729.1/5">Although it was reported little over here, the speech made by Gerry Kelly at the Ard Fheis in Dublin was interesting. He spoke about a need for acceptance of the development of police boards and the need for the disappearance of the IRA as an organisation. He used words and phrases that had not been heard before. It was also interesting that Gerry Adams accepted clearly and without qualification the legitimacy of the Government of the Republic because that represented a breakdown of the old mythology.</p>

	<p pid=".1730.0/1">My hon. Friend raises an interesting point. I read the speech, but I think that Mr. Adams recognised the institutions, rather than the state.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-03-10.1730.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1081" speakername="Kevin McNamara" colnum="1730"  time="15:04:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050310/debtext/50310-20.htm#50310-20_spnew3">
	<p pid=".1730.1/1">If one recognises the institutions of the state as legitimate, given that their legitimacy comes from the state and their acceptance by the people of the Republic, it is fair to say, despite the words that Mr. Adams used, that his comments represent an enormous step forward from the old mythology of denying the legitimacy of the Republic. My hon. Friend and I can argue about the words and reach different conclusions, but I thought that the speech was a helpful sign, rather than something negative.</p>
	<p pid=".1730.1/2">Despite what has happened at the Ard Fheis, we have had a savage murder and the Northern bank robbery. We are in a position in which some Members of the House either knew about those events, or were negligent in not knowing about them, given their positions in the organisations. I have served on the Standards and Privileges Committee, which is both a privilege and an awesome task. The Committee has investigated complaints against normal Members. The Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards examines such cases and the Committee makes a recommendation regarding Members' conduct. In recent times, we have criticised Members for negligence and the House has upheld such findings. They have been suspended and sanctions and penalties have been put on them, but we are unable to do that in the present circumstances.</p>
	<p pid=".1730.1/3">We have one sanction that we can use to show our displeasure in a positive way. The motion will not affect the Members' pockets because they do not draw salaries, although sadly it might affect the pockets of their staff. However, it will be as powerful a sanction as that made when we have suspended people from the House without their wages or the right to use their offices in the House, although Sinn Fein Members will still have that right.</p>
	<p pid=".1730.1/4">I regret reaching this situation because I have spent a long time in the House trying to explain how I think the IRA behaves. I have tried to explain its philosophy and why it is treating the present situation as a ceasefire and waiting for the culmination of matters before final decommissioning. However, there is no way in which any sort of mythology of a guerrilla army can justify the savage murder of Robert McCartney, so I support the motion.</p>

	<p pid=".1731.1/1">Order. May I offer the House some guidance? The Modernisation Committee urges Mr. Speaker to put time limits on debates whenever possible, but it is not helpful if as many as eight hon. Members indicate that they wish to participate in a debate too late after such a decision has been made. The 12-minute limit on the debate is thus clearly inappropriate, given the number of hon.

	<p pid=".1731.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-18">18 December 2001</phrase>, my colleagues and I voted against the motion that gave a privileged position to Sinn Fein Members, so naturally we will vote for the amendments because they would reverse that motion, which is what should happen at the very least. I suppose that we give lukewarm support to the weak and feeble Government motion, so we will reflect that as well.</p>
	<p pid=".1731.2/2">It is a pity that the Leader of the House has not remained in the Chamber to hear the debate, because it would have been useful for him to do so. If he did not intend to stay in the Chamber, perhaps he should have given the Secretary of State or someone else the responsibility of leading for the Government. I wish to comment on several things that the Leader of the House said. His behaviour was rather similar to that of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/817" name="Robin Cook">the right hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook)</phrase>, the then Leader of the House, in 2001. We know from the right hon. Gentleman's memoirs that he had reservations about the 2001 motion, so I wonder whether the current Leader of the House has similar reservations about the motion's failure to be appropriately effective.</p>
	<p pid=".1731.2/3">The first point about the Leader of the House's speech might seem small, but it is important. He said that Sinn Fein is signed up to the agreement, but strictly speaking that is not true. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland will know&mdash;because he was there&mdash;that no one signed an agreement. Votes were cast around the table to determine whether there was sufficient consensus. When the roll call for the vote was called, Sinn Fein abstained, so it cannot be colloquially said that it signed up to the agreement. There was subsequently a Sinn Fein Ard Fheis at which a motion was passed to approve the actions of the leadership, but the party did not sign up to the agreement. That fact is crucial to the way in which one approaches the matter.</p>
	<p pid=".1731.2/4">My view at the time&mdash;it remains my view&mdash;was that the republicans were locked into an agreement that they did not like. They did not like it then and they do not like it now. They are locked into the agreement because they are participating in the democratic process. When they were simply engaged in a terrorist campaign, they were not subject to any such constraints. However, once they entered negotiations, they found themselves locked into them.</p>
	<p pid=".1731.2/5">I was slow to take this view, but it was not until after 1998 that I decided that even though Sinn Fein did not like the fundamentals of the agreement&mdash;at that stage I did not think that its members had completely changed and become normal politicians&mdash;it was possible to bring pressure to bear on it and drag it towards normal, peaceful and democratic political activity.</p>
	<p pid=".1731.2/6">I disagree fundamentally with Members on the other side of the House who said that Sinn Fein rejoiced in its victimisation. I accept that its members try to exploit their victimisation, but it is wrong to argue that therefore we should not put pressure on them or subject them to sanctions. They have only moved under pressure, and the events of recent weeks and the activities of the McCartney relatives clearly demonstrate that that is the case. If it were not for the action of those families and the public support for them, republicans would not have done anything. It is only pressure that moves them, and it is only the pressure that my colleagues and I brought to bear that led to decommissioning, and to republicans moving towards a transition. That has been undermined, however, by the fact that the Government have not policed the process correctly.</p>
	<p pid=".1731.2/7">The agreement sets out some fundamental principles. On <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-18">18 December 2001</phrase>, I said in the House that the motion that we were considering had undermined the agreement by sending republicans the message that they could disregard the obligations imposed on them by the agreement. I said that the Government would bend the rules and reward them&mdash;that is partly <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1091" name="Seamus Mallon">the fair point made by the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh (Mr. Mallon)</phrase>, who spoke about the way in which people were conducting negotiations outside the structures and principles of the agreement.</p>

	<p pid=".1732.0/1">Is the right hon. Gentleman aware, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1091" name="Seamus Mallon">the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh (Mr. Mallon)</phrase> said, that paragraph 13 of the declaration does not include organised crime? However, it has been frustrating that at every step the paramilitaries have done the minimum necessary to satisfy the Government. Hopefully, today's debate will create a clearer picture for the IRA and the other paramilitaries so that they understand that conditions concerning bombing and shooting are not the only ones that have to be met for the normalisation of the Province.</p>

	<p pid=".1732.1/1">It is not necessary for the hon. Gentleman to hang his hat on paragraph 13. If one looks at speeches made by the Prime Minister in 1998 one can see that his language is clearly broad enough to include criminality. Individuals who have recently made much of those comments should bear in mind the fact that he said at the time that the criteria and their application would necessarily become more stringent over time. In a transition, it is perfectly natural to expect criteria to be applied more stringently, and six or seven years into that period there is no basis whatever for failing to do so. In 2001, I considered that the motion was a mistake that would undermine the process: it would send republicans the signal that they could get away with it. Likewise, the activities of previous Secretaries of State, with their rather unpleasant references to internal housekeeping when there was brutality of a not dissimilar nature to the McCartney murder, undermined the process.</p>
	<p pid=".1732.1/2">The Government's failure to insist rigorously on the basic principles of the agreement is not helping at all, and is likely to reinforce among republicans the view that if they hunker down and wait, after a short and not even decent interval the Government, the Irish Government and others will return to negotiations with them. It will just be a matter of rehashing the usual steps. I suspect that even today, officials are trying to cobble together yet another deal on policing to entice republicans back to the process. To do so, against the background of the republican statements this week, is simply nauseating.</p>
	<p pid=".1732.1/3">Having made clear my view of the motion, I shall go a little further. Reference has been made to the individuals who were returned to represent certain constituencies and their activities. I am not sure of the exact composition of the IRA army council today&mdash;changes are made to it from time to time for the convenience of the organisation&mdash;but three Members who were returned to serve in the House are or have in the recent past been members of that body. There is no serious doubt about that. The more significant question is what they have been doing, both now and in the recent past.</p>
	<p pid=".1732.1/4">I have referred to the report by the Independent Monitoring Commission. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1049" name="David Lidington">The hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington)</phrase> read out the text, which clearly says that senior members of Sinn Fein who were also senior members of the IRA&mdash;there are very few senior Sinn Fein members who are not senior members of the IRA&mdash;approved the robberies that were taking place. There is no doubt that some of the individuals involved in the execution of the robbery were very close indeed to the leadership of the republican movement. We do not know, but it is probable that the leadership knew exactly what was happening and thought that they could and would get away with it.</p>
	<p pid=".1732.1/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1081" name="Kevin McNamara">The hon. Member for Hull, North (Mr. McNamara)</phrase> referred to the Standards and Privileges Committee, and actions that have been taken from time to time to suspend Members, reprimand them and so on. Occasionally, the House has gone further and expelled Members. That has been the case in comparatively recent times. A Member was expelled for telling a lie in Committee. He attributed dishonest motives to other Members when he himself was acting dishonestly. Another Member was expelled when he was convicted of the crime of forgery. He would have been disqualified because of the length of his prison sentence, but the House was not content to wait for that provision to take effect and expelled him. If the persons returned to serve in the House have not taken their seats and if they have been accessories to this crime, as the IMC report hinted, surely we should go further and follow those precedents. It would be proper to expel those persons from the House.</p>
	<p pid=".1732.1/6">That is the reasoning behind my amendment, and I am glad that it has received the support of other hon. Members. It is entirely reasonable in present circumstances to see what further information can be obtained about the activities of Members, for that information to be presented to the House and for the House to take the appropriate action.</p>
	<p pid=".1732.1/7">Earlier, I said that at the time of the agreement republicans were locked into an arrangement that they did not like. I said that we could move them under pressure, and we did so to a significant extent. As a result, the situation in Northern Ireland is now quite different, so I make no apology for the decisions that we made in 1998, 1999 and 2000. It has become clear, however, that persons who were prepared to engage in politics are prepared to do so only up to a certain point. They are not willing to complete the transition and do what the Prime Minister has called for since October 2002. Their recent behaviour and statements do not give any indication that they are likely to change at all in future. We must therefore reassess the matter more fundamentally, and those who are now buying into the process must be careful not to become too eager.</p>

	<p pid=".1734.0/1">I was one of those miscreants, Mr. Deputy Speaker, who informed your Office during the debate that I would like to speak. I apologise for that, and will speak as briefly as I can. I did so because I was loth to speak in the debate until I had heard what other hon. Members had said. I know that it is unusual to listen to other hon. Members&mdash;<i>[Interruption]&mdash;</i>indeed, it is unprecedented, but I thought that that would be best.</p>
	<p pid=".1734.0/2">I want to raise three issues. First, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/948" name="Oliver Heald">the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald)</phrase> raised a matter of principle and I respect him for that. It was the straightforward view that if someone is elected to this House and expects to receive the full privileges and income, they should be a full participant. That is a principled position, but there is a contrary argument that some people stand for election on a specific platform with a specific manifesto and tell their electorate that they will stand for election but not take office in the Chamber or swear the oath. That mandate, whether we like it or not, has been given to a number of Sinn Fein Members by a majority vote, and we must respect the mandate of that electorate. That overrides the issue of whether they are full Members. We must respect the view of the people who elected them by a majority.</p>
	<p pid=".1734.0/3">I should tell <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/966" name="Kate Hoey">my hon. Friend the Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey)</phrase> that a side issue is taxpayers' money. I accept that, but those who voted for Sinn Fein also pay taxes and may want some of it spent on their Members of Parliament&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I do not want to start a separate discussion on income tax and collection in Northern Ireland. A valid issue of principle has been raised, but there is a valid argument to the contrary.</p>
	<p pid=".1734.0/4">The second, more important issue is whether sanctions should be applied when events affect the standing of individual Members. We heard from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1289" name="David Trimble">the right hon. Member for Upper Bann (Mr. Trimble)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1081" name="Kevin McNamara">my hon. Friend the Member for Hull, North (Mr. McNamara)</phrase> about the normal processes by which we apply sanctions against Members. I refer now to the bank robbery, and I shall refer later to the tragedy of Robert McCartney. Under the rule of law, the normal process is that innocence is presumed until someone is found guilty beyond all doubt. In the bank robbery case, if individuals had been brought to trial, found guilty and had a direct involvement with Members of this House, or if Members had been involved, the normal sanctions would apply and the appropriate Committees of the House would have applied those sanctions. That has not happened.</p>
	<p pid=".1734.0/5">Too many allegations in the past&mdash;for example, spy rings in Stormont and so on&mdash;were founded on intelligence which did not prove satisfactory in ensuring a prosecution. There is an argument, whether hon. Members like it or not&mdash;</p>

	<p pid=".1735.2/1">Is the hon. Gentleman aware that in Northern Ireland there has been no investigation into the illegal fund raising or criminal activities of any member of the IRA's army council? Does he realise that in the history of the IRA's campaign no one has ever had the courage to stand up in a court of law and give evidence against those criminals?</p>

	<p pid=".1735.3/1">Let me respond by referring specifically to the bank raid. On numerous occasions in the House I have heard hon. Members say that evidence exists that leads conclusively to the fact that certain individuals were involved in the bank robbery, but since the Iraq war I no longer take such information on trust. If there is evidence, it should be brought forward in a court of law. Hon. Members have been arguing about that principle, and terrorism generally, for almost a week. I maintain that a matter of principle is involved in how we adhere to the traditions of this House and British justice.</p>
	<p pid=".1735.3/2">The Robert McCartney tragedy moves us beyond any specific case that we have debated before. We would expect anyone with information about the murder to come forward and provide that information to the relevant authorities. We would expect any Member of the House to exercise responsibility in urging any witnesses to come forward. We are discussing the application of sanctions against Sinn Fein Members in connection with the Robert McCartney case, but during the past week or so they have been prominent in urging witnesses to come forward and give any information to the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid=".1735.3/3">There is an argument that witnesses should go directly to the police, but we have third-party reporting in my constituency because there has been a lack of confidence in the Metropolitan police among the black and ethnic minority community, and we have made arrangements, with the agreement of the police, for third-party reporting to other agencies. That has worked successfully. We are discussing sanctions in the Robert McCartney case, but Sinn Fein Members who were elected to the House have acted as we would have expected in terms of urgent co-operation with the relevant authorities in bringing information forward.</p>
	<p pid=".1735.3/4">The third issue is even more important. The motion today is not significant in its financial consequences; it concerns the way in which the peace process can be moved forward and where we go from here. Will the motion assist in moving the peace process forward to the ultimate conclusion that we want, of peace and justice, or will it impede that aim? I do not believe that it will have a dramatic effect. It might impede the process slightly for a number of reasons that have been given, in that there will be feelings of victimisation and some people may feel that it does not help to increase the dialogue that takes place informally here.</p>
	<p pid=".1735.3/5">I am concerned that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/714" name="Harry Barnes">my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Derbyshire (Mr. Barnes)</phrase> has not had the opportunity to meet Sinn Fein Members here. Some of us have had that opportunity at open meetings. I am also concerned that the hon. Member for Upper Bann&mdash;I am sorry, I mean <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1151" name="Ian Paisley">the hon. Member for North Antrim (Rev. Ian Paisley)</phrase>&mdash;has not had the opportunity to meet the Prime Minister regularly. The Prime Minister does not talk to me much either, but I urge him to talk to the hon. Gentleman, because he may be the future First Minister in Northern Ireland.</p>

	<p pid=".1736.1/1">I am so glad that the Prime Minister has made up for past misdemeanours, and that he is not in sackcloth and ashes.</p>
	<p pid=".1736.1/2">By far the most significant issue is how to move the peace process forward. We should do nothing that will undermine in any way the opportunity for dialogue. During the past 18 months I have been working with a group called the ministry for peace, and we have been considering peace processes throughout the world, including Palestine and Ireland. We have even considered how peace can be secured in Chechnya and elsewhere. One of the most important factors is to maintain dialogue, and to ensure that we use a language that does not impede the peace process.</p>
	<p pid=".1736.1/3">I pay tribute to the Government for all that they have done in the peace process overall, but before Christmas we had a real opportunity to bring to a conclusion the issue of arms. We could have made a dramatic move forward to secure peace. The talk of sackcloth and ashes and the demands for photographs from one side, and the inability on the other to confront more directly some of the activities of the republican movement, meant that we could not move forward. We now need to discuss how we can move forward.</p>
	<p pid=".1736.1/4">The McCartney case has made the republican movement address some issues that are overdue. The statement this week about shootings will enable the movement to address those issues, which are from a bygone era and now need to be put aside if we are to make progress towards peace. Therefore, rather than squabble over a motion that will not have much effect, I urge the Government to re-establish the dialogue. I also agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1091" name="Seamus Mallon">the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh (Mr. Mallon)</phrase> about ending the side deals. We need to get people back round the table so that we can look at the full implementation of the Good Friday agreement and secure the peace that all of us in this House want.</p>

	<p pid=".1737.0/1">This is essentially a House of Commons matter, and I very much hope that it will be decided by a truly free vote. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/966" name="Kate Hoey">The hon. Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey)</phrase>, in her brave speech, asserted that it would be a free vote. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1143" name="Lembit pik">The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &Ouml;pik)</phrase> said the same and I know that it will be a free vote for the official Opposition. I would like confirmation from the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, when he winds up, that it will be a free vote on the Government side&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Well, I treat every vote as a free vote, but that is not the point that I am making. I hope that every Member is able to vote as a Member of this House, because we are voting about Members of this House.</p>
	<p pid=".1737.0/2">I am sorry that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is not in his place. In a short debate such as this, at least one of the Cabinet Ministers taking part should be present throughout. It is an insult to the House that neither of them is in his place at the moment.</p>
	<p pid=".1737.0/3">My position on this issue is simple. We are considering four Members who have been elected to this House&mdash;nobody disputes that&mdash;whose conduct has been wholly unbecoming to this House. I voted against the resolution in December 2001, but I saw the Government's logic in proposing it. At that stage, there were high hopes for the peace process&mdash;some would say misplaced&mdash;on the Government's part. There were high hopes that the Sinn Fein Members would play a constructive part in that peace process, but those hopes have been thoroughly confounded since. Far from playing a constructive part, those four Members have been proved time and again to have not only a tainted past, but a tainted present. They have been involved with acts of criminality and acts of terrorism. Although we talk at present of the difference between the suicide terrorist and the IRA terrorist&mdash;and there is a difference&mdash;we should not forget that those who died in Omagh are just as dead as those who died in the twin towers. Those Members have been complicit in acts of terrorism. They are not worthy to sit in this House.</p>
	<p pid=".1737.0/4">I wished to be constructive in my opposition to the motion, so I tabled an amendment. It was not selected, and I make no complaint about that, but it would have limited the withdrawal of facilities, with a similar sunset clause to the one in the motion. I prefer the amendment that has been selected and I shall give it my support.</p>
	<p pid=".1737.0/5">I am glad that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is now in his place. I have great respect for him and nobody could even begin to deny his good faith. However, it is bizarre that in a little over an hour's time we will once again debate the Prevention of Terrorism Bill and, as I pointed out to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/948" name="Oliver Heald">my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald)</phrase> in an intervention earlier, the Government will urge us to allow them to introduce control orders that will be imposed on many people who are probably not terrorists. I do not dispute the Government's good faith or their overriding and paramount concern for public safety, but if they are prepared to do that, is it not paradoxical that, an hour before, they will vote against an amendment that would exclude people who are almost certainly terrorists and Members of this House? That is ludicrous and it makes the Government's stand against terrorism hollow.</p>
	<p pid=".1737.0/6">I regret that. I have many criticisms, which I have voiced in the Chamber, of the manner in which the Government have handled the Prevention of Terrorism Bill, but at no stage have I impugned their good faith in seeking to do what they believe to be right. None the less, I say to the Government that if that is their response to terrorism in general, here they have terrorism in particular&mdash;four Members, three of whom are or have been members of the IRA council, who have been involved in acts of terrorism and who have not washed their hands and divorced themselves from those who continue to be involved in acts of terrorism. That is the point. Here we have people who as recently as yesterday announced their willingness to take the law into their own hands, in the form of that extraordinary statement from the IRA&mdash;of which Mr. Gerry Adams is still a member and to which Sinn Fein remains indissolubly linked&mdash;that gun law can prevail in the United Kingdom. If nothing else can persuade the Government of the logic of my argument, yesterday's statement should surely do so.</p>
	<p pid=".1737.0/7">I hope, first, that the Secretary of State will assure us that this is to be a truly free vote for every Member of the House of Commons; and, secondly, that Members of the House of Commons will decide whether they truly want to allow access to all our privileges and facilities to people who refuse properly and adequately to represent their constituents in this place, by making speeches, asking questions and so on.</p>

	<p pid=".1739.0/1">I shall ensure that I finish in time for the winding-up speeches, Mr. Deputy Speaker.</p>
	<p pid=".1739.0/2">I assure <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/820" name="Patrick Cormack">the hon. Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack)</phrase> that I do not consider myself part of the payroll vote and that, as far as I am concerned, this is to be an absolutely free vote. If a Minister wishes to make an intervention to confirm the position on the payroll, I shall be happy to accept it.</p>
	<p pid=".1739.0/3">The hon. Gentleman's final point is important. We are moving from the bizarre to the ridiculous by, in a single afternoon, looking in opposite directions on two extremely important issues. This is described as a House of Commons matter; I prefer to describe it as a democratic matter. The House of Commons is behaving like a golf club in the way it treats its Members.</p>
	<p pid=".1739.0/4">Where do we get our authority from? Is it from being in the House and from some higher authority above us, or is it from the people who elected us? We must recognise that the Members whose allowances we propose to take away were elected, just like all the rest of us. They have a duty to represent their constituents and during all their election campaigns they made their position clear. In <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/688" name="Gerry Adams">the case of the hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Adams)</phrase>, he has made it clear since 1983 that on election he would not take his seat because he did not believe that the British Parliament should have jurisdiction over that part of Ireland.</p>

	<p pid=".1739.2/1">The hon. Gentleman is heading off again on the lack-of-evidence trail. If Members have been involved in criminal activities, they should be prosecuted. If they are not prosecuted, they are innocent until proven guilty, like anybody else when a charge is made against them.</p>
	<p pid=".1739.2/2">We are being asked to take away the staff and support services that Members need to represent their constituents, and we should think carefully about that because the implications go far wider. In future, if we do not like the political statements made by any Member of the House on any matter at any time&mdash;all of us have been unpopular on certain issues at certain times, as I know extremely well&mdash;is it right to deny my constituents, the constituents of the hon. Member for South Staffordshire or anybody else's that important right to representation?</p>
	<p pid=".1739.2/3">When a constituent comes to see me about a problem, I do not ask how they voted or how they intend to vote. I ask them what their problem is and I discuss it, as I imagine every other Member does. If that support is taken away from me or any other Member, that representation is reduced. We should be careful. We are not a golf club and we should not behave like one. We should behave like a Parliament that owes its authority to those who elected us.</p>
	<p pid=".1739.2/4">The hon. Members for Newry and Armagh (Mr. Mallon) and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1081" name="Kevin McNamara">my hon. Friends the Members for Hull, North (Mr. McNamara)</phrase> and for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) explained the wider implications extremely well. We have been through some awful times in Northern Ireland. An awful lot of people have died in the most horrific circumstances, the latest being Robert McCartney. Every loss of life and every act of violence is a tragedy. All the sanctions and illiberal Acts that were applied in the 1970s&mdash;the prevention of terrorism Acts, the emergency powers Act, all the orders, internment, the broadcasting ban, the travel ban and all the other measures did not take matters forward very much. What started to take matters forward was the courage&mdash;it was courage&mdash;of the hon. Members for Foyle (Mr. Hume) and for Belfast, West (Mr. Adams), who were prepared to sit down privately together and hammer out some kind of agreement, which eventually led to the 1994 ceasefire and later ceasefires.</p>
	<p pid=".1739.2/5">I hope that dialogue prevails. That is what the Good Friday agreement, power sharing and the acceptance of the traditions of all communities were about. Those were important steps forward. The decision that we are asked to take today is not the end of life or the end of the whole process, but it is an important signal that the House is closing down that element of participation. As my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Hull, North pointed out, by contesting elections, getting elected and becoming involved in the political process, Sinn Fein has been able to help bring about the ceasefire, exert pressure and provide a great deal of hope for the future.</p>
	<p pid=".1739.2/6">If those who voted Sinn Fein are told that their votes are not worth as much as the votes in my constituency or any other Member's constituency because we intend to take away their facilities, what message to them is that? Is the message that they should vote for someone else, or is it more likely to drive them away from a political process into a process that none of us wants to see developing?</p>
	<p pid=".1739.2/7">The House will obviously listen carefully to the Secretary of State and others, but hon. Members should remember that we get our authority from the people, not from above.</p>

	<p pid=".1740.1/1">Any actions such as the hon. Gentleman has described are meritorious of legal action, if there is evidence against an individual. Surely we all believe that someone is innocent until proven guilty. If there is a case against people, it should be taken to court and dealt with there.</p>
	<p pid=".1740.1/2">In this case, the security services have briefed Ministers, who have in turn briefed various hon. Members, and on that basis, we are being asked to make an important decision about hon. Members who have chosen not to take their seats. The security services have hardly covered themselves in glory in the past few years, and we are sceptical because of that performance. People must be accepted as innocent until a case is made against them.</p>
	<p pid=".1740.1/3">Returning to my earlier democratic argument, our job is not to deny individuals their representation in this House, but to try to bring about a peace process by political inclusion and political involvement. That is what the peace process and the Good Friday agreement achieved, and I urge all Northern Ireland Members in particular to support the idea of continuing the Good Friday agreement and the institutions that stem from it. Therein lies the road to peace and a prosperous and hopeful future for Northern Ireland. Today's motion is a step in the opposite direction, and I cannot support it.</p>

	<p pid=".1741.2/1">I shall be loud, too, if my hon. Friend wishes.</p>
	<p pid=".1741.2/2">My view is that the motion is too little, too late. For the past seven years, the Belfast agreement was a cause for optimism, but I always thought that it was built on sand. The Government's policy now lies in tatters around it, and the Government are starting to backtrack.</p>
	<p pid=".1741.2/3">It is now painfully clear that Sinn Fein never intended to go along with the Belfast agreement. According to the newspapers, all members of Sinn Fein and of the IRA refer to the Prime Minister as &quot;a prize idiot&quot;.</p>

	<p pid=".1741.4/1">That is an even better term. The prisoners are out, the Royal Ulster Constabulary has been scrapped and those people have been allowed into the House of Commons, but for what? The Government have been the IRA's dupe and the IRA's patsy all along.</p>
	<p pid=".1741.4/2">When the Prime Minister gives Adams and McGuinness tea at Chequers, does he ask them about their crimes? Does he ask them about Jean McConville, Robert Nairac, who was a friend of mine, and the thousands of decent soldiers, policemen, prison officers and civilians who have been murdered during the troubles? I think not.</p>
	<p pid=".1741.4/3">The Government accept that the IRA and Sinn Fein are inextricably linked. It is a sad fact that these four MPs were elected by people in Northern Ireland. Other crooks have been elected to this House: murderers have been elected; Mosley was elected; Mugabe was elected in Zimbabwe; and, once upon a time, Hitler was elected in Germany. Those four MPs should be held responsible for their actions.</p>
	<p pid=".1741.4/4">Does the Secretary of State believe that Adams and McGuinness are on the army council? Everybody else does. If they are on the army council, they are not inextricably linked to the IRA; they are the IRA.</p>
	<p pid=".1741.4/5">Will the Secretary of State instruct the PSNI to investigate the claim that McGuinness made to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1050" name="Peter Lilley">my right hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley)</phrase>, that in the early '70s he was responsible for the deaths of more than 10 Catholics, whom he judged to be informers? McGuinness should be held to account for those murders.</p>
	<p pid=".1741.4/6">Does the Secretary of State believe anything that Adams and McGuinness tell him? Sinn Fein lies and lies and lies again&mdash;of course it was not involved in the Northern bank raid. Sinn Fein is the IRA. It contains thugs and murderers, and it is responsible for robbery, protection rackets, drugs, thieving, mutilation and exiles.</p>
	<p pid=".1741.4/7">I know that the Secretary of State is a decent man, not only because we were at the same Oxford college at the same time, but because he knows that what I am saying is true. The Government have been paying Danegeld for seven years. Danegeld has its benefits to those who pay it, as those who paid it to the Danes found as well, but eventually it comes back to haunt them. There have been fewer murders, but now is the time to address what the IRA has been up to. These people do not recognise this Parliament and should not have access to it.</p>
	<p pid=".1741.4/8">I note from the list of allowances that Mr. McGuinness and Mr. Adams both claimed more than &pound;18,000 in additional costs allowance, which we all use for a second house. In other words, they are claiming &pound;18,000-odd for staying away from home, which they do not do as they are hardly ever here. I suggest that the House authorities investigate where their second properties are. The press, who are so interested in our allowances, might do the same.</p>
	<p pid=".1741.4/9">The Government say that they are going to be tough on terrorists. I ask them to be so by barring them from this House until they accept the responsibilities of democratic MPs and live up to the many promises that they made when they took on their roles under the Belfast agreement.</p>

	<p pid=".1742.0/1">We have been dealing with two related questions: first, the parliamentary question of whether there should in effect be two classes of Member; and secondly, whether, if the conduct of Sinn Fein-IRA merits sanctions, the motion tabled by the Government is adequate and proportionate in addressing that.</p>
	<p pid=".1742.0/2">However we vote this afternoon, the impact on Sinn Fein will not be much beyond the symbolic; we should be under no illusions about that. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1143" name="Lembit pik">The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &Ouml;pik)</phrase> said that the withdrawal of the financial allowances would hurt Sinn Fein, but I question whether an organisation that thrives on criminal enterprise will have to tighten its belt very much whichever way we vote.</p>

	<p pid=".1742.1/1">I agree that anything we may do is marginal, but it will have some limited effect. I believe that the primary impact will be to add to the public relations difficulties that the Sinn Fein organisation has generated for itself largely by its inability to rein in the excesses of the IRA.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-03-10.1742.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1049" speakername="David Lidington" colnum="1742"  time="16:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050310/debtext/50310-24.htm#50310-24_spnew2">
	<p pid=".1742.2/1">I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman is being incredibly naive in believing in this distinction between Sinn Fein and the IRA. Neither the British Government, nor the Irish Government, nor the police on either side of the border are prepared to share that belief with him.</p>
	<p pid=".1742.2/2">I shall briefly spell out the effect of our amendments. Amendment (a) would make the 12-month suspension of allowances indefinite, while amendment (b) would extend the scope of the motion to cover other parliamentary privileges. Taken together, they would restore the position to that established by Speaker Boothroyd's ruling after the 1997 general election.</p>
	<p pid=".1742.2/3">Let me come first to the parliamentary argument, which was dealt with particularly by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/820" name="Patrick Cormack">my hon. Friend the Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/966" name="Kate Hoey">the hon. Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey)</phrase>. There should not be two classes of Member. We are sent here to represent our constituents&mdash;those who voted for us and those who did not alike. As the hon. Member for Vauxhall said, the allowances, offices and staff passes are there to enable us to do our job of representing those constituents&mdash;they do not come to us as of right&mdash;and the same set of rules should apply to every Member of Parliament.</p>
	<p pid=".1742.2/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1081" name="Kevin McNamara">The hon. Member for Hull, North (Mr. McNamara)</phrase> acknowledged that Sinn Fein's policy of abstention goes beyond <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1289" name="David Trimble">the Oath alone. As the right hon. Member for Upper Bann (Mr. Trimble)</phrase> observed, that policy amounts to a deliberate and calculated rejection of the existing constitutional and legal order in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid=".1742.2/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1264" name="Desmond Swayne">My hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne)</phrase> commented that the Provisional IRA considers itself the legitimate Government of the whole island of Ireland. That is a theological and ideological belief that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1355" name="Jeffrey M Donaldson">the hon. Member for Lagan Valley (Mr. Donaldson)</phrase> illustrated well when he reminded us that Mr. Mitchell McLoughlin recently denied that the abduction and subsequent murder of Mrs. McConville was a crime because, in Sinn Fein-IRA's view, it is for the IRA army council to decide what constitutes legality and illegality anywhere in the island of Ireland.</p>
	<p pid=".1742.2/6">The Government justified the change that they introduced in 2001 on the ground that it would help the political process. Despite the fact that it represented a break from the way in which the House of Commons had traditionally treated all Members alike, in the Government's judgment it was a necessary move to engage republicans more fully in the democratic process and to recognise the transition that the republican movement was making from terrorism to exclusively democratic politics. However, the motion is not an adequate or proportionate response to recent events.</p>
	<p pid=".1742.2/7">The Police Service of Northern Ireland, the Garda Siochana and the Independent Monitoring Commission all declare that Sinn Fein both knew and approved of not only the Northern bank robbery but a sequence of recent serious crimes. Those comments were made before the savage murder of Mr. Robert McCartney. As the hon. Members for North Antrim (Rev. Ian Paisley) and for Newry and Armagh (Mr. Mallon) pointed out, crime, violence and intimidation is still rife, especially in areas such as south Armagh and parts of Belfast, where paramilitary gangs prey on the people whom they claim to protect.</p>
	<p pid=".1742.2/8">The action that the Government should take is not what the motion proposes; it is to stop giving Sinn Fein an effective veto over any political progress in Northern Ireland. We cannot wait indefinitely for the republican movement to make the transition. It is time for the Government to move forward with the democratic nationalist and Unionist parties. That is a subject for exploration and debate on another occasion.</p>
	<p pid=".1742.2/9">The main argument against the Opposition amendments that Members on the Government side of the House, especially the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh, present is that accepting them would allow republicans to pose as martyrs. Given that the hon. Gentleman has made the argument, I respect it and I reflected on it before reaching a judgment on the motion and amendments. Nevertheless, I believe it to be mistaken. Of course republicans will pose as martyrs and victims&mdash;it is part of their stock in trade. However, if we tie our hands by refusing to take action for fear that they will pose as martyrs, we end by granting them virtual immunity, however grave their actions or failure to deliver on democratic promises. As the right hon. Member for Upper Bann said, the history of recent years suggests that republicans move only when they are put under pressure&mdash;and then, I would add, only at the last practical moment.</p>
	<p pid=".1742.2/10">Today, despite many years since the agreement during which the Government have bent over backwards to help republicans make the transition to democracy, we remain in a position whereby the Provisional IRA retains its active military structures, with the capacity for terrorism, uses crime to raise money and intimidate nationalist communities and retains stocks of illegally held guns and explosives. The onus now should be on the republicans to end their involvement in crime, to stand down the IRA as an effective military force, to turn it into an old comrades association, and to decommission the weapons that they ought not to hold and which, given their repeated promises to be committed to exclusively democratic and peaceful politics, they have no reason to keep. It is just not enough to say, as the Government motion does, that we will suspend the allowances for 12 months, and then Parliament will consider the matter again and see whether the republicans' behaviour has improved.</p>

	<p pid=".1744.0/1">Is there not a parallel in the Government motion leaving the door open for Sinn Fein in the forlorn hope that it might reform itself? While the Government say that Sinn Fein and the IRA are doing wrong, they are still not prepared to say that democracy in Northern Ireland should proceed without them.</p>

	<p pid=".1744.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is right. Many different models of democratic progress could be explored, which the different democratic parties have put forward to the Government. While, in my view, the idea of a fully inclusive devolved Executive remains desirable, it is clear that that is not practical politics in anything but the longer term, given what has happened over recent months. We must declare in how we vote this evening our belief that it is now up to republicans to demonstrate that they have finally delivered on their oft-promised commitment to democracy. When they have done that, perhaps Parliament will revisit the issue. That is why I prefer an amendment that insists that the suspension of parliamentary privileges and allowances should be indefinite.</p>

	<p pid=".1745.0/3">Does that mean that, automatically, from <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April</phrase> next year, without any debate or discussion, the current arrangements will come back?</p>

	<p pid=".1745.1/1">My interpretation of the Government's motion is that the resolution of 2001, which gave Sinn Fein Members privileges and allowances, remains in force, but by virtue of the Government motion would be suspended for 12 months, and that those allowances and privileges would therefore automatically be resumed in 12 months unless a new motion were brought forward deliberately to extend the period of suspension.</p>
	<p pid=".1745.1/2">The Opposition's amendments clearly place the responsibility to act on the republican movement, and that is where the responsibility belongs. I hope that those amendments, which have the support of Members from many parties represented in the House, will command a majority of votes when we divide at the end of the debate.</p>

It is seven years since the signing of the Good Friday agreement, and Northern Ireland Members will recall that only a few months ago we were again very close to an agreement. That would have meant a period between the agreement and the restoration of the Assembly and the Executive during which the IMC would have verified whether criminality had been carried on during those months by the Provisional IRA.

The debate is, of course, about sanctions, about penalties and about effectively imposing a fine on Sinn Fein&mdash;but what it is really about is what has happened over the past few weeks in relation to the criminality associated with the Provisional IRA, and the way in which events described by Member after Member this afternoon have to all intents and purposes torpedoed the political process that we have seen in recent months.The hon.

	<p pid=".1747.0/1">I shall come to that shortly, but the IMC said that whatever we did here in the House of Commons, and whatever I had to do about allowances for the Northern Ireland Assembly, it would all be deeply inadequate to address the issue with which we are dealing today. There are differences between Members, but they all agree that we must address the criminality that lies behind the events of the past few weeks and that is poisoning the political process. We can take away the allowances of the Members whom we are discussing&mdash;fine them, in other words. It has been said today that if we take half a million pounds from Sinn Fein it will not matter, but I think it will demonstrate the profound disagreement in the House of Commons with what has happened.</p>
	<p pid=".1747.0/2">If we extend that to other aspects such as access to the House of Commons, there is a disagreement among us about whether we should do that as well as that. The disagreement is not about a question of principle&mdash;whether there should be sanctions&mdash;but about the balance that we need to strike. On the one hand we penalise the party, but on the other hand we do not want to penalise the people who voted for certain people in certain constituencies. There are genuine disagreements about that matter, but in both cases the argument is inadequate to address the issue of criminality, which has brought down the political processes and talks over the last number of weeks.</p>

	<p pid=".1747.2/1">The issue is not about control orders or sanctions. It is about how we deal effectively with the process in Northern Ireland that has resulted in the criminal activity that we have seen over the last number of weeks. It is about how we ensure that Sinn Fein goes back into the talks, having rid itself of all that the IRA has done over the last number of weeks. There must be a split between criminality on the one hand and the proper political process on the other.</p>

	<p pid=".1747.3/1">I thank the Secretary of State for his customary courtesy, which is what I would expect from an old Orielensis. He has spoken about the criminality of the last few weeks, but is it not a fact that the IRA has been deep in criminality throughout its existence and throughout the time of the Belfast agreement? Does he remember that, under the terms of the document on decommissioning published in April 1998, all weapons were meant to be decommissioned within two years of the referendums? They are now about five years late.</p>

	<p pid=".1747.4/1">I must say to the hon. Gentleman that no one thought for one second that criminality had ended. The joint declaration document that the two Governments published some time ago made reference to criminal activity. What everyone thought in 1998 was that there would be a period of transition during which such criminality would wither away, eventually leading to a period of normal politics in Northern Ireland. The problem over the last number of years, and particularly over the last number of months when the events that we are discussing took place, is that that has not happened. It has not happened quickly enough and it has not happened in respect of quantity, either. The type of criminality that we have seen in Northern Ireland&mdash;it has been associated with the Provisional IRA and the equivalent loyalist paramilitary groups&mdash;has not gone away. That is the issue that the House has to consider today. Whether we vote for the amendments or for the Government motion, we are expressing the deep and profound disapproval of the House of Commons for what has happened to the political and peace process in Northern Ireland.</p>

	<p pid=".1748.0/1">Does the Secretary of State agree that Sinn Fein should take note of the fact that those who have sought and sustained a constructive dialogue nevertheless find themselves with no alternative but to support the sanctions? That is a consequence of the strains that the IRA's actions have now placed on the process. Sinn Fein really must reflect&mdash;I am sure that it will&mdash;on our debate and start visibly to put its house in order before relationships based on good will are strained even further.</p>

	<p pid=".1748.1/1">That is absolutely right. The hon. Member for Aylesbury was also absolutely right when he said that the onus in this process is now entirely on Sinn Fein to prove to the people and the political leaders of Northern Ireland, to the House of Commons and to both Governments that it is truly going down the non-violent, democratic political road that lay at the heart of the Good Friday agreement. The criminal activities that we have seen over the last number of months clearly violate the principles of that agreement and everything that anyone involved in the talks leading up to it expected. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1091" name="Seamus Mallon">My hon. Friend the Member for Newry and Armagh (Mr. Mallon)</phrase> and the right hon. Member for Upper Bann will remember, as they were so involved in the talks leading up to the agreement, that everything was based on the principle of non-violence and the democratic process. Robbing banks, murdering people, so-called punishment beatings and racketeering are all completely unacceptable when more than 2 million people in Ireland, north and south, voted for a peaceful future in 1998. Regardless of whether they agree with the Good Friday agreement, all Members of the House believe that that is the right thing to do.</p>

	<p pid=".1748.2/1">Does my right hon. Friend also acknowledge that the willingness to accept Sinn Fein according to the terms that it uses to present itself has undermined and undercut genuinely democratic political organisations in Northern Ireland? Sinn Fein&mdash;or Sinn Fein-IRA, whatever it calls itself&mdash;has been involved in serious criminality in the past. Should not the Government be more transparent about what they know, so as to protect and support the genuinely political parties in the north of Ireland?</p>

	<p pid=".1749.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that. Those who know about Irish history know that the genuinely republican people who set up the Irish Republic, and those who consider themselves to be of a republican persuasion, would be genuinely and sincerely alarmed at the present level of criminality in the IRA. That has nothing to do with persuading people to vote for either the republican or nationalist cause. Regardless of whether they have a Unionist or nationalist background, people in Northern Ireland must accept the principles underlying the new policing arrangements and criminal justice system there. Those arrangements were voted for by the people of Ireland, north and south.</p>

	<p pid=".1749.1/1">I thank the Secretary of State for giving way, and I apologise to the House that other business meant that I could not be present for the whole debate. I agree with what the archbishop said, but will the right hon. Gentleman acknowledge that it was De Valera who clamped down harshly on Sinn Fein in the republic, and that some of us will have to do the same in the UK? When he considers the views of those who voted for the party, will he bear it in mind that Sinn Fein-IRA executed four Members of this House? What sort of politicians are Sinn Fein Members? There is a great difference between the British way of life and what they want to impose on Northern Ireland.</p>

	<p pid=".1749.2/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for making those points, and many hon. Members in this debate have said that the consequences of the murder of Robert McCartney, and the subsequent campaign by his sisters, have been more profound than anything that has happened in recent weeks. People in republican communities&mdash;in that case, in the Short Strand area&mdash;have risen up to disagree with and disown the terrorist intimidation that they have had to put up with over so many years. That is more significant than any other development. Obviously, the McCartney family's very courageous stance is to be applauded, but it shows that genuinely republican people in Northern Ireland who voted for Sinn Fein over the past seven years have become completely fed up with the sort of intimidation recently evident in the Short Strand area. That response is more telling than anything that the Government might propose.</p>
	<p pid=".1749.2/2">The events of recent weeks are hugely disappointing in the context of what has happened over the past few years. They have clearly got in the way of progress in the political process. I do not agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1188" name="Andrew Robathan">the hon. Member for Blaby (Mr. Robathan)</phrase>, but I do agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Hull, North, who said that, despite the recent difficulties, everyone in Belfast or any other community in Northern Ireland understands that it is a different world now, compared with seven years ago.</p>
	<p pid=".1749.2/3">Progress has been made, and peace achieved, because politicians from all parties have worked together to make Northern Ireland a much better place in which to live and work. We do not have the killings or bombings that we used to have, and we should be grateful for that. However, that does not mean for one second that the criminality issue must not be addressed, because it has to be. Until that criminality issue is addressed, I fear that the peace process in Northern Ireland will be jeopardised in the days and the weeks ahead.</p>
	<p pid=".1749.2/4">I urge my hon. Friends&mdash;indeed, all Members of the House&mdash;to support the Government's motion today.</p>

	<p pid=".1758.0/1">On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. You are well aware of the importance of RAF Kinloss and RAF Lossiemouth to my constituency and my previous difficulties in being properly informed about statements by the Ministry of Defence. Today, journalists have raised with me the impending announcement of the future stationing of Nimrod MRA4 aircraft at Kinloss. I have been told what the scope and time scale of the decision are supposed to have been, but, despite six calls to the Ministry of Defence, I have not received written confirmation about the details of the announcement, although I was promised it within seconds at 1.14 this afternoon. At 4.10 pm, I received a faxed letter with no details about the Nimrods but a hand-written addendum from the Minister of State saying that there would be an announcement tomorrow.</p>
	<p pid=".1758.0/2">On the related matter of job losses, the Ministry today issued a written statement on how many posts are set to go as part of the end-to-end logistics review. Part of the statement was provided to the House, but not the tables with the numbers, which were forwarded by the MOD three hours late. The details had to be faxed to me by a newspaper that had received them before me. That information confirms that almost 1,000 posts are to be relocated or lost from bases in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid=".1758.0/3">How many points of order will it take for the Ministry of Defence properly to inform Parliament and parliamentarians about key issues relating to thousands of jobs? It is a scandalous abuse of Parliament that the service community and the media have been so cynically manipulated. What can you do, Mr. Deputy Speaker, to protect Parliament and parliamentarians so that announcements are made properly in this House?</p>

	<p pid=".1758.1/1">Further to that point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. The table to which the hon. Gentleman referred reveals that 160 jobs will go at RAF Leuchars, which is in my constituency. Has any member of the Ministry of Defence team suggested making an oral statement to the House? Is it not right that, for the proper protection of those we represent, such announcements should be made in the House so that Ministers can be made to answer for them to those Members of Parliament whose constituents' interests are directly affected?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-03-10.1758.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/948" speakername="Oliver Heald" colnum="1758"  time="16:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050310/debtext/50310-28.htm#50310-28_spnew2">
	<p pid=".1758.2/1">Further to that point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. It seems likely that we are about to suspend our proceedings while we await further messages from the other place about the Prevention of Terrorism Bill. Instead of suspending, what better opportunity is there for a Minister to come to the Chamber to make a proper statement so that we all know exactly what is happening about these important issues? That point was raised with the Leader of the House at business questions today. He said that he would take it up, so perhaps he can tell us exactly what he has done and exactly what is happening.</p>

	<p pid=".1759.0/1">Further to that point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Should it not be your judgment that the House continue, could Ministers request an early resumption, ahead of the Lords messages, so that these matters can be properly dealt with? We have the ideal parliamentary opportunity to do so and it would be a pity if a petty procedural point got in the way of Ministers accounting to us for their actions.</p>

	<p pid=".1759.1/1">Further to that point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, you will recall&mdash;I think you were in the Chair at the time&mdash;that I raised this matter with the Leader of the House. He promised to take urgent action to ensure that the Secretary of State for Defence was told of the concerns of hon. Members on both sides of the House about constituency matters of great importance to us and our constituents being announced in a written statement with no details when a briefing was given to the local media, but not to Members of Parliament. As the Leader of the House is in his place and as the House is sitting, may we have a statement from a Defence Minister?</p>

	<p pid=".1759.2/1">I am grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1189" name="Angus Robertson">the hon. Member for Moray (Angus Robertson)</phrase> for giving me notice that he intended to raise this point of order. Mr. Speaker has said on several occasions how concerned he is by cases in which the media are informed of official decisions relating to a Member's constituency before the House and Members are notified. It is also important, in Mr. Speaker's view, that such information should be provided in a timely, accurate and complete manner. I will of course draw the hon. Member's remarks to Mr. Speaker's attention.</p>
	<p pid=".1759.2/2">In response to the further points of order that have been made, the House will know that the Chair cannot command the presence of a Minister. Whatever opportunities may exist have to be determined in another way. I hope that it has been noted that there is widespread concern that such incidents are unfortunately becoming less rare and that Members are rightly concerned, as is Mr. Speaker on their behalf. Members come first as far as important and sensitive information about their constituencies is concerned, and such information should be dealt with in a proper manner.</p>

	<p pid=".1759.3/1">Further to that point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I am well aware of the concerns of the House, which were expressed at business questions and have been vigorously reiterated this evening. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence has been made aware of those concerns and will be made even more aware by the points that have been raised.</p>

	<p pid=".1760.0/1">Further to that point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I am glad that the Leader of the House intervened at this point. Several references have been made to the possibility of a statement being made tomorrow, but the House is not sitting tomorrow, although it may continue to sit today for some time. Therefore, there will be no opportunity for a statement to be made and for Mr. Speaker's advice to be obeyed. That surely adds to the pressure for a Defence Minister to come to the House at some point this evening to meet the reasonable requests of Members.</p>

	<p pid=".1760.2/1">I can, with joy, confirm that to the hon. Gentleman. That is a parliamentary fact. The Leader of the House has heard what right hon. and hon. Members have had to say on this matter and the Chair cannot go further than that.</p>

	<p pid=".1761.5/1">As you indicated, Mr. Deputy Speaker, we are debating all the amendments together, and I intend very briefly to go through the Government's position on each of the issues that has been addressed.</p>
	<p pid=".1761.5/2">I turn first to Lords reasons 38A, 39A, 40A, etc. The effect of the Lords motion is that the Lords have insisted on their amendment to the schedule that provides for the Lord Chief Justice to make the rules and to require rules of court to be compatible with article 6 of the European convention on human rights and have proposed a different procedure for the making of first rules. We do not accept that that set of proposals is sensible. First, the Lord Chief Justice does not make rules of court. Secondly, the rules must be compatible with article 6 in any event. Thirdly, we have changed the procedure to allow affirmative resolutions to approve the rules. I therefore ask the House to insist on its disagreement to Lords amendments Nos. 38, 39 and 40, insist on its amendments Nos. 42A and 42B, agree to its amendment No. 42C, agree to Lords amendment No. 42D and disagree with Lords amendment No. 42E proposed in lieu.</p>
	<p pid=".1761.5/3">Secondly, I address Lords reason 1D, which refers to the Secretary of State making non-derogating orders and to the standard of proof. The effect of the Lords motion is that they have rejected our amendments in relation to the making and judicial supervision of non-derogating control orders and to standards of proof. They are insisting on their own amendments in relation to those matters. We had a very long debate on those issues last night. The will of the House was expressed very clearly indeed. I do not propose to accept the amendments proposed, since I believe that a reduction in the standard of proof would lead to the likelihood that certain dangerous individuals who otherwise would be brought under control through control orders would not be so controlled. That is the advice that I have had from the police and the security services. I therefore conclude that the Lords amendments are not an improvement.</p>
	<p pid=".1761.5/4">My amendments indicated very considerable movement by the Government to address the concerns expressed in both Houses. For that reason, I ask the House to insist on its amendments Nos. 1A and 1B to Lords amendment No. 1, insist on its disagreement to Lords amendments Nos. 8, 9, 12, 13, 15, 17, 22, 28 and 37, and insist on its amendments Nos. 37A to 37O, to disagree to Lords amendments 37Q to 37T proposed in lieu of Lords amendment No. 8, and propose the additional amendments listed in my name on the marshalled list.</p>
	<p pid=".1761.5/5">I believe that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/924" name="Dominic Grieve">the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve)</phrase>, in responding to this discussion, should answer a key question when considering these amendments. Will he confirm that his policy neglects the advice of the police and security services and would mean that control orders would not be placed on certain individuals whom the police and security services consider a threat?</p>

	<p pid=".1762.0/1">Will the Home Secretary acknowledge that it would be difficult for Opposition parties to answer that question unless we can be shown the evidence on which the assumption is based? Will he make available the evidence that is being given to him by intelligence sources?</p>

Indeed, I did that only last week in a general case to explain why we were concerned about the issues. I will not confirm that I will make available in particular terms the particular situation relating to particular individuals, because it is precisely in those particular circumstances that national security issues are at risk. However, I can say to the hon. Gentleman that I am ready to acknowledge, as he asks, that, on the procedures for which he has been pressing and that my noble Friend the Attorney-General has set out in relation to Committees of the House, it is important to be clear that they allow the special advocate to understand the case in the round.

	<p pid=".1763.0/1">Both the Home Secretary and the Prime Minister have repeatedly said that the security services require the control orders. Without going into individual cases, it ought to be perfectly possible for the Government to place before the House, as they have done in the past, the views of the security services&mdash;both security services&mdash;so that the House can know whether that is correct. As the Home Secretary will appreciate, ever since the events surrounding the Iraq war it has been difficult to take anything that the Government say on trust.</p>

	<p pid=".1763.7/1">Let us bring the discussion to this particular topic. The Home Secretary knows that, last week, the Prime Minister claimed that there were hundreds of potential terrorists abroad in this country. Within 24 hours, there had been a leak from the security services saying that that was nonsense and that the figure was between 10 and 20. Clearly, we cannot verify whether that leak was accurate, but the Home Secretary might reflect that it casts some doubt on whether we should accept either his word or that of the Prime Minister on anything.</p>

	<p pid=".1764.1/1">The main reason for that is an important one, which relates to a discussion that we held earlier. The events of 9/11 and those that followed were particularly significant.

The House should consider equally the remarks of Sir John Stevens, Lord Stevens, on that question. He was commissioner at that time and had to deal with those issues.

	<p pid=".1765.1/1">I shall not give way.</p>
	<p pid=".1765.1/2">The Government's motion states that the House insists on its disagreement with Lords amendments Nos. 27, 31 and 32 and proposes amendments in lieu in relation to the scope of the independent annual review. The effect of the two amendments tabled in my name is to extend the scope of the independent annual review of the Act so that the review covers the whole Act, rather than just sections 1 to 6 on operation of control orders, as now.</p>
	<p pid=".1765.1/3">Under these amendments, the appeal provisions will come within the scope of the review, as will the arrangements for reviewing the Act once passed. I think this proposal goes towards dealing with some concerns that have been expressed on both sides of the House and also by my noble Friend Baroness Hayman in the other place, about the way in which these issues are to be considered when the legislation is taken forward.</p>
	<p pid=".1765.1/4">As I said yesterday, the Bill already provides a number of provisions for substantial and considered review of this system of legislation. They are, first, the quarterly reports that I, as Secretary of State, make to Parliament on the use of the powers to make control orders and, secondly, an independent reviewer&mdash;now, I suggest, of the whole operation of the Act&mdash;making an annual report, which is laid before Parliament. I confirm what I have said before: I will ask the independent reviewer to look specifically at the continuing need for the provisions in this Bill in the light of any new counter-terrorist legislation.</p>
	<p pid=".1765.1/5">I propose&mdash;I emphasise this new proposition now&mdash;to widen the remit to the whole Act, not simply the control order powers and the offence provisions.</p>
	<p pid=".1765.1/6">My proposal of last night was for the annual renewal of the Act with a vote in both Houses of Parliament to look at that situation. The proposal in the Bill enables the House to vote annually on the need to continue the capacity to make derogating control orders, if at some future stage we decide to derogate. I gave a commitment to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1240" name="Clive Soley">my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush (Mr. Soley)</phrase> yesterday to have discussion across all parties after the election about the best way of taking this legislation forward. Of course, the opportunity for new legislation in the next Session gives us another opportunity to review these provisions.</p>
	<p pid=".1765.1/7">I can confirm&mdash;again responding to Baroness Hayman&mdash;that we will both ensure that the proposed legislation has proper pre-legislative scrutiny and will be introduced as early as possible in the next Session.</p>
	<p pid=".1765.1/8">I believe it is important, coming back to the attitude of the Conservative party, that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield state whether in any post-election discussion of the type that we have discussed in the House the Conservatives will accept control orders as a means of giving the security services the powers they need to deal with these threats. I also think that it is incumbent on him, on behalf of the official Opposition, to confirm that his election manifesto will include the pledge to repeal control orders, if that is indeed his position. The House deserves an answer to that question.</p>
	<p pid=".1765.1/9">On the basis of these proposals, we do not feel that we need a further Privy Council review or an additional review committee, and it is a total nonsense to remove the annual review of the Act. To be quite frank, the amendment passed in the other place is an offence against the excellent current reviewer, Lord Carlile of Berriew, and the work he is doing in carrying that through. To suggest he is not doing good work in this matter was a serious mistake by the Lords, in my opinion. I am determined that we insist on our disagreement with the amendments so as to maintain the existence of the independent reviewer. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I suggest that colleagues look at what he said in the debate in the House of Lords. He did not agree with himself being abolished in the way suggested by this particular proposal&mdash;not surprisingly, because he has done a pretty good independent, non-politically partisan job, which we should all pay respect and tribute to. That is why I am determined that we insist on our disagreement with the Lords amendments and thus maintain the existence of the independent reviewer.</p>
	<p pid=".1765.1/10">I hope that the House will insist on its disagreement to Lords amendments Nos. 27, 31 and 32 and that it will accept the Government amendments in lieu. I also hope that the House will disagree with Lords amendment No. 33D and agree to amendments Nos. 33A to 33C.</p>
	<p pid=".1765.1/11">When the hon. Member for Beaconsfield responds, I hope that he will set out what leads him to believe that a magic solution will be found by the end of March next year that will allow agreement to be reached on all these things. Even more, I hope that we will hear whether he accepts that his proposal to end control orders in November&mdash;or even at the end of March 2006&mdash;would encourage terrorists to locate in Britain because I believe that that would be the effect of his actions.

	<p pid=".1766.0/1">I am sorry to hear the Home Secretary's tone this evening. It was characterised by his assertion a few moments ago that due to some activity of the House or the Opposition, individuals would be released from Belmarsh next week. Nothing could be further from the truth. The release will happen whether the Government get the Bill or not. It would not need to happen if the Government renewed their part 4 powers, but as it was said in court today, their response to the bail applications made under part 4 of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 has been shambolic, so they have got themselves into their present difficulties.</p>

	<p pid=".1767.0/1">Indeed, and those people will not even be subject to home detention. The statement made by the Home Secretary started with a complete inaccuracy.</p>
	<p pid=".1767.0/2">The first thing that shines through from the Lords amendments is that Members of the other place have tried to achieve a consensus in a conciliatory fashion. How else can one interpret the amendment tabled by Baroness Hayman proposing a sunset clause extending to 12 months? We were happy to accept that amendment as a gesture to the Government, even though, I might add, it is unnecessary if they are being sincere and wish to get on with further legislation.</p>

	<p pid=".1767.3/2" class="indent">&quot;Our strategy should therefore be to insist that the bill does not diminish the liberty of the subject but amplifies it; that the true liberty of the subject consists in the freedom to walk the streets unmolested . . . and that far from circumscribing the liberty of the subject this will enlarge it . . .

	<p pid=".1767.4/2">The situation regarding the sunset clause is quite clear. The Government know from the comments of many of their Back Benchers, including those whom they persuaded to support them yesterday, that the Bill is without doubt a major infringement of civil liberties and is poorly drafted. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/709" name="Vera Baird">The hon. and learned Member for Redcar (Vera Baird)</phrase> made that comment, even though, in her loyalty, she came back to support the Government. The Home Secretary should therefore accept that the legislation should have a finite limit. Without such a limit, I have no confidence that the Government will ever review the measure properly. We will simply be asked to rubber-stamp its renewal, and there will not be any creative thinking about how we resolve our present dilemma and maintain civil liberties while fighting terrorism adequately.</p>

	<p pid=".1768.5/1">The hon. Gentleman is not listening to the debate. However much I dislike the prospect, it is within the Government's power to obtain control orders within a few hours.

	<p pid=".1768.6/1">Does the hon. Gentleman accept that there is a huge divide in the House on a number of issues, but that the crucial issue is the sunset clause? There may be only one Government Member who believes that the measures fall short of the threat but, having listened to the Home Secretary, I accept completely that the threat is of a nature that we have not faced before. I am therefore worried about whether the measures proposed by the hon. Gentleman are adequate to deal with the threat. Without a sunset clause, we can never go back to the drawing board to consider measures that are adequate to the challenge. I am worried that a review in 12 months' time will merely provide approval, not a basic analysis of what is required, given the challenge that the Home Secretary said we face.</p>

	<p pid=".1769.2/1">The Government should go further and I shall explain why. I simply do not understand why they chose to make an issue of the distinction between derogating and non-derogating orders. During the debate last week, the hon. and learned Member for Redcar made an exceptionally good speech in which she explained why the distinction between derogating and non-derogating orders should be removed. She also highlighted why judicial review proceedings are inadequate for non-derogating orders. Her comments then were absolutely correct and I accept that she accepted less than that yesterday out of loyalty. I have yet to understand the rationale behind the Home Secretary's insistence that the distinction must be maintained.</p>

	<p pid=".1769.3/1">The hon. Gentleman knows very well that when I referred to judicial review I was addressing the question of an appeal on an unsatisfactory basis. I have been substantially reassured because the judge will now come first in non-derogating control orders. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not misrepresent what I said a week ago.</p>
	<p pid=".1769.3/2">The hon. Gentleman seems to be suggesting that a sunset clause is a precondition for conversations between parties about future legislation. That is utter rubbish and the public should understand that. Conversations have been offered here and now by the Home Secretary, irrespective of the sunset clause, and he has promised new legislation next year. The Opposition have every opportunity to contribute to better future legislation on this matter. The sunset clause is a silly, political tactic.</p>

	<p pid=".1770.5/2">There can be no logical reason for that distinction. The Government's refusal to have a full Privy Council review is extraordinary. If the Government want the Bill, they can have it. It can be on the statute book later tonight, but a little reasonableness would be helpful. We have been subjected over the past week to vitriol, bullying and, now, petulance. The petulance extends so far that No. 10 appears to be briefing that there will be a general election on this issue unless the Opposition give way.</p>
	<p pid=".1770.5/3">This is an issue of conscience, and should be so for every Member of this House. Nothing will induce me to allow the Bill to pass in its present form and every hon. Member should consider carefully the duty they owe to their constituents in respect of ensuring that liberty is maintained in this country. In particular, the Government's refusal to accept the sunset clause highlights the fact that they are untrustworthy on this legislation, and the Home Secretary has done nothing to dispel that distrust this evening. I ask the House to support the Lords amendments and to enable this matter to come to a rapid conclusion.</p>

	<p pid=".1771.2/1">We have another half an hour, and I will not speak for very long, because other Members may wish to speak, including <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1202" name="Chris Ruane">the hon. Member for Vale of Clwyd (Chris Ruane)</phrase>&mdash;I am sure that he has a serious and interesting contribution to make.</p>
	<p pid=".1771.2/2">My point concerns review by the judiciary of derogating and non-derogating clauses. I take the view that the House was seriously misled yesterday and when we debated the matter before. This is a central issue. The Government make a distinction between derogating and non-derogating issues; I do not accept that distinction, but the Government make it. In respect of derogating issues&mdash;house arrest&mdash;the Government provide that the court will have full powers to look at the facts and to come to its own conclusions. So far, so good. I would reluctantly accept that, if it were the case for all the orders.</p>
	<p pid=".1771.2/3">Non-derogating orders are not mere chaff in the system. They will involve people's right to work, to associate and to move, and their being tagged and electronically monitored. They are as close to the pass laws in South Africa as it is possible to get, and they are a serious matter. The question that the House must ask is whether there will be proper judicial review of those proceedings. The House has been told on several occasions that there will be, because the court will be allowed to consider the orders, but it may do so only on the basis of judicial review. The basis of judicial review does not allow a court to reopen the case and look at the facts on which the order was made. It is worth repeating that point time and again. Assurances to the House, whether from Front or Back Benchers, and from people who should know better, are simply wrong. The House must take that on board.</p>

	<p pid=".1772.5/2">The hon. and learned Gentleman knows well that if a judge is asked at the outset to consider whether there are reasonable grounds on which one can, as Home Secretary, suspect that a person is engaged in terrorism, the only possible way to reach a judgment is for the judge to look at the evidence and form a view.

	<p pid=".1772.6/1">That intervention would be valid were that the test, but it is not. As my hon. and learned Friend well knows, the test is whether the judge feels, not that the decision was wrong based on the facts, but that it was obviously flawed&mdash;not that the decision is wrong, or that the judge disagrees with it, but that it was obviously flawed. That is the test of judicial review.</p>
	<p pid=".1772.6/2">I am not entirely sure what &quot;obviously&quot; means in the present circumstances. Can a judge say, &quot;Well, I thought the decision wasn't obviously flawed. Having looked at the background, I think it was flawed, but initially it was not obviously flawed&quot;? What is a judge to make of the provision? I have not the remotest idea. It is bad to pass a statute that affects the liberties of our citizens based on such an amount of doubt. I simply ask hon. Members to take that on board when making their decision on this particular issue.</p>

Having done so, a judge may think that he would not have acted in the same way, or that what the Secretary of State did was wrong, or that his decision was wrong. Nevertheless, what he must conclude is that the decision was obviously flawed, and he must do so applying the principles of judicial review. Judicial review comes from the prerogative writs&mdash;ancient writs in this country&mdash;which were always and deliberately set out on the basis that judges should not question decisions taken by the Executive&mdash;quite right, too. Hear, hear; I agree&mdash;they should not. That is the basis of judicial review. That is its whole life and mainspring in the legal system.</p>

That is why judicial review exists, and why it is so heavily circumscribed.

	<p pid=".1774.0/1">So my hon. and learned Friend has said. Of course we are talking about law. The Bill makes law. It is impossible to avoid that.

Members, at least, will take on board what I say in the spirit in which I am saying it.</p>
	<p pid=".1774.0/2">I come to the sunset clause; the time has now been extended to a year. What we are giving birth to here, if we give birth to it at all, is a very malformed animal indeed. In saying that, I enjoy the support not only of people who have fought the Bill throughout, but of people like <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/709" name="Vera Baird">my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Redcar (Vera Baird)</phrase> and many commentators who believe that the Bill is seriously malformed. The Bill cannot be resuscitated and cured, by definition. What we need is a rebirth. We need a new Bill and we need it quickly. The period of a year, which has been proposed in another place by a noble Lord of my party, is worthy of support. One year is enough. We need to bring back in a year not this old malformed Bill, resurfaced and rehatched, but a new Bill to deal with the problems of terrorism, which are undoubtedly real.</p>

	<p pid=".1774.1/1">It is a great misfortune that again we have such an abbreviated debate on this important Bill.</p>
	<p pid=".1774.1/2">I should like to think that the Home Secretary and others in the Chamber recognise the high level of agreement between parties, between Benches and between Houses. We all agree that there is a serious threat of terrorism. We all agree that there is a need to take appropriate measures to combat it. Most of us agree that, regrettably, control orders are probably part of the apparatus that is required. We have been prepared to accept that there needs to be an emergency process that enables the Secretary of State to apply for those control orders, even on the grounds of reasonable suspicion. Those in another place who have considered the Bill have done an extremely good job of tabling amendments that work and make the Bill better.</p>
	<p pid=".1774.1/3">The Home Secretary should not have any doubts about whether he will have his Bill, because he has it already. The Bill is workable, and it is for him to take it. It is not good enough to suggest that either a recalcitrant upper House or an obstructive Opposition in this Chamber is stopping him having what he needs in order to combat terrorism effectively.</p>
	<p pid=".1774.1/4">Which extraordinary suggestions from the other place does the Home Secretary propose to remove this evening? He proposes to remove the power of the Lord Chief Justice, rather than the Lord Chancellor, to make rules of court. A few weeks ago, we considered the abolition of the post of Lord Chancellor, and it is absurd to suggest that as a matter of principle the Lord Chancellor must make rules of court rather than the Lord Chief Justice.</p>
	<p pid=".1774.1/5">The Home Secretary has asked us to reject the contention that article 6 of the European convention on human rights should be addressed on the face of the Bill. That is ridiculous, but he insists that he will not budge. He could help the House this evening by making it explicit that the process will not accept evidence gained by torture under other jurisdictions, but he has not made that expressly plain.</p>

	<p pid=".1775.5/3">On the standard of proof, we have a significant disagreement, and the Home Secretary has not yet established to my satisfaction why the balance of probabilities is an inappropriate test to decide whether someone should lose their liberty. I believe that that test is appropriate, but he has told me that the security services require that the test should be based on reasonable suspicion rather than the balance of probabilities. That simple assertion is not enough, and I invite him to provide us with evidence that will allow us to understand why he believes that the balance of probabilities is not the appropriate standard of proof.</p>
	<p pid=".1775.5/4">The Home Secretary has asked us to remove the reference to the Director of Public Prosecutions&mdash;which, incidentally, is in the wrong part of the Bill&mdash;and argues that the matter should be put before a chief of police. However, we have argued for years that the prosecuting authorities rather than the police should decide whether to prosecute. Why is he taking that retrograde step, and why on earth should that be a sticking point?</p>
	<p pid=".1775.5/5">The Home Secretary has asked us to remove the provisions for a Privy Council annual review. Notwithstanding the concerns about the future employment of my noble Friend Lord Carlile&mdash;I hope that Lord Carlile or someone else will have the opportunity to continue as an independent reviewer&mdash;the Privy Council is a useful mechanism for examining the performance of the legislation in action.</p>
	<p pid=".1775.5/6">The position on the sunset clause is the biggest absurdity of all. We have a Labour peer&mdash;Baroness Hayman, previously a Member of this House&mdash;putting forward the eminently sensible suggestion of a sunset clause, to come into effect after a year, for this legislation, which is acknowledged on all sides to be temporary, emergency and not entirely well considered.</p>

	<p pid=".1776.1/1">The hon. Gentleman says from a sedentary position&mdash;I am happy to read him into the record, as he is so desperate to get into it&mdash;that that is not acceptable. So what is not acceptable? We are told that it is unacceptable for the legislation to cease to have effect after a year, but acceptable for the House to reject it after a year as a renewal. We are told that it is not acceptable for the House to improve the Bill, but acceptable for it to reject the Bill. In any case, we are told by Baroness Scotland that by that time we will have new and better legislation, because, as she virtually admitted to the other House, this legislation is defective and we can do better&mdash;in other words, there is no need to worry about the renewal because something else would already be on the statute book. Yet if there is no need to worry about renewal, why is there any need to worry about a sunset clause? There is no logic in that position. It is unacceptable for the Government to hide behind it as a pretext that that is a bar to their having their legislation.</p>
	<p pid=".1776.1/2">To say that to accept a sunset clause is to send a signal to the terrorist is the worst argument that I have ever heard. That is to say that al-Qaeda operatives all over the world are waiting to hear whether we are going to have a sunset clause or a renewal facility on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March</phrase> next year, and if we make the right decision they will be satisfied and put their bombs away.</p>
	<p pid=".1776.1/3">This is an absurdity. The Government have it within their power to have their legislation tonight&mdash;they will have it within an hour or two if they take the necessary steps. They have moved a very long way in several areas; we are grateful for that. They have a couple more steps to go, and then they will have their legislation. But if they do not take those steps&mdash;if they believe that the sunset clause is the sticking point that prevents them from having their legislation&mdash;not only will they look absurd, but we can only conclude that they did not actually want this Bill in the first place.</p>

	<p pid=".1776.2/1">So that nobody is misled by anybody on either side of this House, let me clearly set out my understanding of the position. The test in the Bill is very plain&mdash;are there reasonable grounds to suspect that the person is engaged in terrorism? The only way of assessing that is to look at the evidence and evaluate it. The judge must act as the gatekeeper for the Home Secretary in evaluating the evidence and concluding whether his proposal is within a range of reasonable responses to that evidence. If he finds that it is outside the range of reasonable responses, he will quash it and it will never get off the ground.</p>
	<p pid=".1776.2/2">There is an additional element that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1100" name="Robert Marshall-Andrews">my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Medway (Mr. Marshall-Andrews)</phrase>&mdash;and he is my friend&mdash;missed out. Since the prerogative writs of the 17th century, the element of proportionality has come in as another important test that is, again, based on the evidence. That came in with the Human Rights Act 1998. What changed my mind was the putting of the judge first and requiring him to be responsible for these decisions&mdash;to gate-keep.

	<p pid=".1777.9/1">I have only three minutes and my hon. and learned Friend has already taken up a good deal of time.</p>
	<p pid=".1777.9/2">It is my clear view that hon. Members are misguided in concentrating on the burden of proof. The distinction between reasonable cause to suspect that someone is involved in terrorism and it's being more probable than not is not worth dying in a ditch for. Hon. Members should concentrate on firming up the admirable concessions that the Home Secretary made yesterday on giving defendants a better deal by reorganising the special advocacy system so that they are likely to get to know more about their case.</p>
	<p pid=".1777.9/3">Differences in the burden of proof pale into insignificance next to the concessions that my right hon. Friend has made. If hon. Members are interested in justice for defendants, they should concentrate on those concessions so that they can be reduced to paper to ensure that the special advocate system will be examined and that defendants get a better deal. That is truly the right way forward. It was clear in yesterday's debate that, if Conservative Members take a realistic approach to justice for defendants, they will find my right hon. Friend helpful. He plainly suggested that yesterday. I therefore conclude that that is the obvious route to take. If Conservative Members do not take it, they must simply be playing politics because there is a clear way in which to improve the Bill now.</p>

	<p pid=".1778.0/1">I spoke about judicial review yesterday and I agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1100" name="Robert Marshall-Andrews">the speech that the hon. and learned Member for Medway (Mr. Marshall-Andrews)</phrase> made earlier and with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/709" name="Vera Baird">the speech that the hon. and learned Member for Redcar (Vera Baird)</phrase> made on the same subject previously. Anyone who believes that a case has been made in which the merits of the issue are put in the hands of the judge has been misled.</p>
	<p pid=".1778.0/2">With respect, I do not agree with the hon. and learned Member for Redcar that the difference between reasonable suspicion and the balance of probabilities is purely academic. No other part of the law is treated in that way. There will be cases in which there are plenty of grounds of suspicion but one feels that the man is probably innocent. If the Bill is allowed to proceed, someone in that position will be subject to all its rigours.</p>
	<p pid=".1778.0/3">Let me consider briefly the advice of the Security Service&mdash;the new point on which the Home Secretary placed particular stress. Surely he could share a little more of the Security Service advice on the burden of proof and on the sunset clause. The only argument that I have heard advanced about the burden of proof is that the Security Service insists on it. I find that unlikely. If that is Security Service advice, it must have peculiar lawyers. I am sure that we shall revert to the point later and I should like the Home Secretary to let us know whether the Security Service says that we should have a balance of probabilities, not reasonable suspicion.</p>

	<p pid=".1778.2/3">The Downing street spokesman on behalf of the Prime Minister gave the genuine reason this afternoon. He totally prejudged this evening's proceedings. Downing street has instructed the Home Office to come along with all those reasons. The spokesman said that to amend the Bill further would send the wrong message to the terrorists and the police and security services, and that that applied not just to the sunset clause but to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/950" name="David Heath">the burden of proof.

	<p pid=".1796.4/1">The first amendment relates to the making and judicial supervision of control orders, including the standard of proof. The effect of my amendment is to require an inter partes directions hearing to be held within seven days of the court granting the Secretary of State permission to issue&mdash;or, as the case may be, confirming&mdash;his non-derogating control order. The purpose of my amendment is to provide yet another safeguard in the procedure to ensure that the individual concerned will be involved fully in the proceedings at the earliest possible stage. So, there would now be three stages: an application for permission from the Secretary of State; a prima facie ex parte hearing followed by an inter partes directions hearing to see how the matter might be disposed of; and then a further inter partes full hearing. My amendment would therefore provide for an additional safeguard of further intervention into that process. That would give all parties an early opportunity to consider how best to deal with questions of evidence, disclosure and the appointment of a special advocate if required.</p>
	<p pid=".1796.4/2">As well as that amendment, we want to insist on our previous position with regard to the standard of proof. There are a couple of additional points that I want to make to the House concerning standard of proof, because it is a very important matter. I want to make it clear that these are preventive orders, not punishment, which is important to the standard of proof issue; that we are talking about an assessment of intelligence rather than necessary evidence of proof of fact; and that we are talking about a risk assessment process. I want to draw to the House's attention the statement of Lord Justice Laws when he was considering the A case in the Special Immigration Appeals Commission. I do not think that this quote has been used before. He said:</p>
	<p pid=".1796.4/3" class="indent">&quot;the nature of the subject matter is such that it will, as I have indicated very often, usually be impossible to prove past facts which make the case that X is a terrorist. Accordingly, a requirement of proof will frustrate the policy and objects of the powers . . . the target of the policy includes those who belong to loose, amorphous organised groups.&quot;</p>

	<p pid=".1797.2/1">I have to say to the hon. Lady that far from not having heard that quote before, it has been bandied around almost ad nauseam. If that is her objection, she could argue that the derogating orders that she is making, which will be made on the balance of probabilities, should not in fact be made on the balance of probabilities at all.

	<p pid=".1797.3/1">Even at this early hour of the morning, I am attempting to be moderate and measured, and I hope that the debate will be conducted in that fashion. As we have made clear on several previous occasions, we have accepted the balance of probabilities for derogating orders because deprivation of liberty is a severe sanction. However, we do not accept it for non-derogating orders because there is a distinction between restrictions on liberty and deprivation of liberty. That is a clear position.</p>
	<p pid=".1797.3/2">The orders, as well as being preventive, not punitive, are about anticipating and disrupting terrorism. They are an assessment of risk, and I genuinely believe that hon. Members are trying to constrain a preventive framework in a traditional criminal justice system, which is about proof of events after the fact, evidence and an adversarial mechanism. I believe that hon. Members have not taken seriously the fact that we are trying to anticipate and prevent rather than simply prove things after the event, which happens in the traditional criminal legal justice system.</p>

	<p pid=".1799.0/1">No, I think that I have said on several occasions that these orders are not punishments, they are about prevention. I have also explained that there is a proper reason for the distinction between the two orders set out in article 5.</p>
	<p pid=".1799.0/2">I now wish to move to the second area of concern of the Lords and my amendments in relation to having an independent reviewer rather than a committee of Privy Councillors. My further amendment shortens the period in which the first report of the independent reviewer must be submitted to nine months, and provides explicitly in the Bill for his report to include the implications for the operation of the Act of any proposal made by the Secretary of State for changing the law relating to terrorism. That has two effects. First, it would ensure that the renewal debates that we will hold in the House will be informed by the report on the operation of the whole Act by the independent reviewer. On that basis, our debates will be more informed. Secondly, it would include in the Bill the Home Secretary's commitment that the independent reviewer should consider specifically in his report the implications for the operation of this Act, once passed, of any new proposals or legislation on counter-terrorism.</p>
	<p pid=".1799.0/3">We have already said that we will bring forward proposals and have pre-legislative scrutiny. We now want to make sure that the independent reviewer can consider that as part of his review by including that explicitly in the Bill. We want to ensure that his report is done within nine months, so that when we come to the annual renewal after 12 months we have a proper, informed debate in full knowledge of his review.</p>

	<p pid=".1803.2/1">Once again, Mr. Deputy Speaker, we have an example of how the Government lack any frankness in their dealings with the House. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1042" name="Oliver Letwin">The question that my right hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin)</phrase> asked about what the Prime Minister said classically illustrates how the Government gloss the truth to suit their convenience. Instead of coming to the House, asking frankly for measures deemed necessary and engaging in proper debate, the Government spend their entire time fast-tracking the process, putting out spin, deceiving the public and then asking us to rubber-stamp their activities.</p>
	<p pid=".1803.2/2">Let us examine the three issues of contention that now appear to remain. First, the Minister for Crime Reduction, Policing and Community Safety has told the House that she cannot accept that the distinction between derogating and non-derogating measures should disappear and she proposes instead a most deliciously complicated further tier of bureaucracy in an attempt to avoid the issue. Let me tell the Minister that as a recipe for further legal challenges, it would take some beating. I ask myself why the Government are going to such absurd lengths to avoid doing the sensible thing that the other place has asked for&mdash;treating derogating and non-derogating orders identically.</p>
	<p pid=".1803.2/3">If what the Minister says is right, the derogating orders that the Secretary of State is keeping as an &quot;important reserve power&quot; that he may have to use in extremis, are, on her own analysis, completely valueless. I simply do not understand why the Minister keeps on refusing to do the simple and straightforward thing&mdash;indeed, the very thing that the Government originally gave the impression to the other place that they were going to do, which is to treat derogating and non-derogating orders identically. There is no explanation for that other than the Government's absolute determination not to be seen to be amenable to reason. If that is an example of the Government's common sense that they want to convey to the public, it takes some beating. There is no justification for the distinction.</p>
	<p pid=".1803.2/4">Let me remind <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/709" name="Vera Baird">the Minister what the hon. and learned Member for Redcar (Vera Baird)</phrase> said about non-derogating orders:</p>
	<p pid=".1803.2/5" class="indent">&quot;I do not wish to labour the point, but the penalties that can befall someone under clause 1 are extraordinarily intrusive and can transform a person's life. They include obvious interferences with freedom of movement, family life and freedom of association. Someone may be ordered not to speak to any member of his family and he may be told to move house, stop doing his business or job or to change his job. He has to agree in certain circumstances to tell people in advance what his movements will be&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1803.2/6">She went on to say:</p>
	<p pid=".1803.2/7" class="indent">&quot;That is a very serious interference with liberty.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-28">28 February 2005</phrase>; Vol. 431, c. 744.]</p>
	<p pid=".1803.2/8">She was correct and the Minister is wrong. I am sorry that the Minister has suborned the hon. and learned Lady. We stand on the basis&mdash;</p>

	<p pid=".1804.0/1">Do I look suborned, Mr. Deputy Speaker? The hon. Gentleman has to remember that if these powers, which can be intrusive exactly as I said, cross over into an intrusion on article 5, they will never be granted because the judge is now at the front. It would be an unlawful order and the judge would not grant it. Checkmate on that one, I think.</p>

	<p pid=".1804.1/1">That is a fascinating comment, but it is not what the hon. and learned Lady said last week. She cannot escape her own analysis, which was absolutely correct and which the Government would have done well to heed. If the Government would see sense and treat derogating and non-derogating orders identically, they would be doing justice to the people subject to the orders. They would also solve their current problem and go a long way to resolving all the issues before the House tonight.</p>
	<p pid=".1804.1/2">I turn now to whether a review should be prepared by an independent reviewer or a group of Privy Councillors. It is obvious that a proper and full review by Privy Councillors would be better than one by a single, independent reviewer. The latter would merely be a document handed to the Government, while the former would be a major document handed to Parliament for consideration. Furthermore, under the regime proposed by the other place, the reviews would take place at regular intervals and enable the House to monitor events.</p>

	<p pid=".1804.4/1">I should be happy to. The hon. Gentleman has completely failed to note that the independent reviewer will report to Parliament, not the Government, and that Parliament would debate his review. The amendment before the House means that when the renewal order is considered every year, it will be based on the independent review given to Parliament. That review will not be some Government thing on the side, as Parliament will examine it. As always, he simply does not understand what he is talking about.</p>

	<p pid=".1804.5/1">I understand that the last Privy Council report, chaired by Lord Newton, was ignored by the Government. I suspect that the Government do not want a Privy Councillors' report because they know that they will not be able to ignore it a second time. That is why I think that the House should demand it. There is no reason for not having such a report. The Government's insistence on their position is another example of them dancing on the head of a pin for no good reason. The House should reject that stand.</p>
	<p pid=".1804.5/2">Finally, we come to the sunset clause, about which there is a fundamental difference between Opposition and Government. This Bill must be tolerated, but it is very badly drafted&mdash;and I might add that the hon. and learned Member for Redcar thinks that as well, as do many other Labour Members.</p>
	<p pid=".1804.5/3">The Bill was passed in haste, without consultation or normal Committee and Report stages. This morning, we have had about nine minutes to consider important Government amendments. The Bill should die soon, and be replaced with something new that is passed in ordinary form. That is totally different from what the Minister proposes. The mechanisms that she proposes will mean that the legislation can be renewed again and again. It is not good enough to suggest that the two approaches are equivalent.</p>
	<p pid=".1804.5/4">If the Government were honest, they would say, like the Prime Minister, that the Bill is for the medium term and that the country will have to bear it for the next 10 or 20 years, if this Government remain in office. Alternatively, the Government should accept the sunset clause. The sunset clause is a thoroughly sensible measure that would ensure that the House does its duty before 12 months are out. The Government should look at the alternatives to a measure that the Minister knows undermines civil liberties.</p>

There are alternatives and they need to be considered, but the Government have not given the slightest indication of even engaging in that process. There is the question of prosecuting. There is the question of using intercept evidence. There is a question, if nothing else, if I may say to the Home Secretary, about putting in the things that at the moment he refuses to have in this legislation.

	<p pid=".1805.8/1">As I have said before to the Home Secretary, we are prepared to accept that control orders may in the short term be necessary, but at the moment we do not have the input from the security services that the Minister has, which is why we have spent the last week trying to improve the orders to remove those aspects that we consider intolerable.

	<p pid=".1806.0/1">On control orders specifically, the very fact that the security services and the police forces are asking for this measure seems to suggest that, however imperfect, we are trying to deliver a vehicle that is fit for purpose. What the hon. Gentleman is suggesting is that in nine months we scrap the vehicle entirely, as opposed to looking at it, revising it and renewing it. I suggest to him that the Government have at this stage of the morning bent over backwards to try and comply with some moderate way forward on this and he is now setting his face against it, and on Monday morning we may well have terrorists walking the streets of this country.</p>

	<p pid=".1806.1/1">The alleged terrorists are going to be walking the streets tomorrow morning, irrespective of whether this legislation is passed or not and that is a measure of the Government's failure to address this issue over the last 12 months.</p>
	<p pid=".1806.1/2">It is a straightforward issue. If the Government believed that civil liberties were important in this country they would consent to a sunset clause, if only to come back in 12 months' time and explain why, reluctantly, they had to continue with these measures. The fact that they will not taints the entire way in which the Government have approached this matter. I am left with the unpleasant sensation that the Government&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> It is unpleasant, because I would much rather have had the Government persuade me of the necessity of these measures. I am left with the unpleasant sensation that the Government have been playing the cheapest form of politics with this matter, and we on this side of the House will vote to uphold the Lords amendments.</p>

	<p pid=".1806.2/1">In my experience it is very rare that we have a rational debate at this time in the morning, and I think that the experience of the last few minutes has proved that point. It is unfortunate that yet again we are having to face an abbreviated debate on a matter of huge importance, and that we seem to be making so little progress in what ought to be a substantial debate on how we can improve the Bill.</p>
	<p pid=".1806.2/2">The Minister says that no one has come up with any other proposal to meet her requirements. May I invite her to read Lords amendments Nos. 1, 8 and 12&mdash;Lords amendments ad nauseam that do the job that she has asked Parliament to do, which is to provide an adequate response to the agreed threat of terrorism and an adequate response to the needs that the security services and the police have identified? They provide her with the control orders that she has asked for, and they provide a court procedure that is adequate to meet the needs and the balance that the Home Secretary has suggested is the essential part of balancing the threat with the commensurate judicial procedures. All those things are in place, and she and her right hon. Friend have rejected them, so we are left debating the same topics, time and again.</p>
	<p pid=".1806.2/3">We have made some movement&mdash;I accept that, and the Minister knows that I have welcomed it&mdash;but we are left with these clear distinctions between our positions. Let us be absolutely clear what they are. First, we have the arbitrary distinction between derogating and non-derogating orders, which the Government perversely insist on, despite the advice of not only those in another place who have looked at this and who have a very clear view that there is no such arbitrary distinction, but Labour Members sitting behind her now who have indicated their complete dissatisfaction with that arbitrary distinction. So there is no distinction, yet we have a different judicial process.</p>

	<p pid=".1807.7/1">The hon. Gentleman should be very careful with this. He is quoting in aid a Labour Member of the other House who made a perfectly sensible proposition that was agreed by 250 peers and disagreed to by but 100 peers. That view has been reinforced by the most recent vote of the House of Lords, and she abstained. I believe she was right.</p>
	<p pid=".1807.7/2">I say again to Ministers that I welcome the small amount of movement this evening. Let us get back to the serious content of the amendments. I welcome what the Minister said about the independent reviewer, who will have a crucial role to play in the process. As she knows, we would like a Privy Council Committee in addition to the independent reviewer, because we believe that that could do a better job of deriving the legislation we need to fight terrorism effectively. It has been admitted from the Dispatch Box in another place that this measure is not adequate, that we need new laws to fight terrorism properly, and that that will be the first responsibility of an incoming Government, of whatever persuasion, after the general election. It is an essential and urgent task. That makes it even more bizarre that the Government are prepared to accept this inadequate legislation&mdash;described clearly as inadequate from the Dispatch Box in another place and implied by Ministers in this place, as well&mdash;and that there is no proposal to make that legislation come to the end of its natural life next year so that it can be replaced by better legislation.</p>
	<p pid=".1807.7/3">Let us look at amendment (a), which the Minister did not greatly amplify&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> All those Members who jeer and say that they will always reject a sunset clause should note that 33A begins:</p>
	<p pid=".1807.7/4" class="indent">&quot;Except so far as otherwise provided under this section, sections 1 to 6 expire at the end of the period of 12 months beginning with the day on which this Act is passed.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1807.7/5">The House has gone quiet. That is a Government amendment saying that the Act will expire. The proposed new clause goes on to qualify that provision in ways that I find unacceptable, because they do not actually do the job. But let us not pretend that there is a great divide of principle between the Government and the Opposition on what happens to terrorism legislation. The Government have given the game away.</p>
	<p pid=".1807.7/6">I close with t<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/724" name="A J Beith">his point. Earlier, my right hon. Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith)</phrase> referred to the frank, and hardly surprising, comment made by the Lord Chancellor in another place. He was asked directly whether the security services had recommended that the Bill should have no sunset clause, and he said &quot;No&quot;&mdash;in frank contradistinction to what the Prime Minister said on Wednesday at the Dispatch Box in Prime Minister's questions. It was nonsense when the Prime Minister said it then. The Lord Chancellor has let the cat out of the bag. There is no argument that we should not have the clause. We should. That is why it is right that the amendments should go back to another place&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> The Minister is shaking her head. Perhaps we should have an answer. Will she tell us? Have the security services recommended that or not?</p>

	<p pid=".1810.1/2">The hon. Member for Beaconsfield spoke about a serious interference in liberty. This is a serious matter. As I said, I went through to hear the Lord Chancellor, and I want to make just one point. The Lord Chancellor pointed out to the other place that it had asked the Government to make five changes in the Bill. The Government had accepted four of those five changes&mdash;80 per cent. of what the House of Lords asked us for. The Lord Chancellor went on to say, &quot;Accept the primacy of the House of Commons.&quot; For a third time, the House of Lords rejected the primacy of the House of Commons.

	<p pid=".1810.2/1">Earlier in our debates, the Home Secretary made a perfectly reasonable plea, which was that in these serious matters of counter-terrorism, the Government have a right to ask for the trust of the House of Commons in trying to come to their conclusions. That is why I say to the Home Secretary that it is with the heart of that trust that we are concerned tonight. The sunset clause is so important because we cannot trust the people who are asking for our trust.</p>
	<p pid=".1810.2/2">I merely say to the Home Secretary that for him to pray in aid the security services, and for it then to be proved that the security services have not asked for one of the key things that he implied they had asked for, and that the Prime Minister said they had asked for, is to remove the trust of this House.</p>

	<p pid=".1810.3/1">I have in front of me the <i>Hansard</i> report of the references that are being discussed. The Prime Minister said:</p>

	<p pid=".1810.3/5">That is what he said. The security services and the police have advised us categorically and clearly, as they should do, on measures. They have advised us quite explicitly that we should not change the burden of proof for non-derogating control orders. The reason why they have given that advice is very simply because they know, as do we, that there are certain people who are dangerous to the country, but could not be controlled if such a situation existed.</p>

It is essential for the future confidence in this House, and the political system as a whole, that these debates take place on the basis of the truth.</p>
	<p pid=".1810.4/2">On Wednesday, in answer to a question from me, the Prime Minister said that it would not be wise to accept either the amendment on the sunset clause, or the other amendment to which the Home Secretary referred, because that would be</p>

	<p pid=".1810.4/4">It is now crystal clear that that is not the case. Is it not essential, in the interests of the body politic of this country, that the Prime Minister now come to the House to withdraw a statement that the Minister for Crime Reduction, Policing and Community Safety this morning, and the Lord Chancellor earlier, said was not an accurate statement of the position?</p>

Everybody in the House is trying to do a very difficult thing and protect the nation against terrorism while at the same time upholding human rights so that terrorism does not grow among individuals who have legitimate grounds for believing that their human rights may have been invaded.</p>
	<p pid=".1812.3/2">It is legitimate for us to disagree about how to deal with these things, and it is therefore proper for the Government to make sure that if their judgments turn out to be wrong, we have a ready opportunity to put that right. That is why the sunset clause is so important. It gives the House an honourable opportunity: if what is done for all sorts of reasons in haste and with many misunderstandings&mdash;I am not making any allegations&mdash;turns out to be less than the best, we will assuredly and without peradventure have a chance to get it right. People who accuse Conservative Members of being anything other than staunchly opposed to terrorism are wrong. We are so strongly opposed to terrorism that we want the best legislation that we can get, we want to make it work and we want a Prime Minister who can be trusted not to be misunderstood by his own Home Secretary.</p>

	<p pid=".1827.1/1">It is perhaps appropriate that we hope to complete the passage of the Bill today, on the first anniversary of the tragic Madrid bombing. That is a sad reminder of the reality with which all Members of this House and the other place must deal when considering these matters.</p>
	<p pid=".1827.1/2">I am proposing three amendments to the Bill. The question of the making of non-derogating control orders, the burden of proof and the judicial supervision of non-derogating control orders relates to Lords reason 1F. My amendment provides that when the Secretary of State applies to the court for permission to make a non-derogating control order, he or she must supply the court with a copy of the order that he or she proposes to make.</p>
	<p pid=".1827.1/3">We have been having a debate on the question of the Privy Council review versus an independent reviewer, which relates to Lords reasons 27F, 31D and 32D. My amendment provides that the independent annual reviewer must comment on the extent of the Secretary of State's use of the urgency procedure in relation to the making of non-derogating control orders in his report. That is an effort to meet the concerns expressed on my side of the House about the use of the urgency procedure and to ensure that that matter is properly in the public domain.</p>
	<p pid=".1827.1/4">The third amendment that I propose deals with the question of annual renewal versus a sunset clause, which is covered by Lords reason 33H. My amendment would require the Secretary of State to consult the director general of the Security Service before making the annual renewal order.</p>

	<p pid=".1827.7/1">I am afraid that I am eerily familiar with the point that the hon. Gentleman wishes to make. Indeed, he made it to me in the Lobby only a few minutes ago. I think that I would like the debate to proceed on the issues before the House rather than his specific questions.</p>
	<p pid=".1827.7/2">The story of the night both here and in the other House is that of a series of constructive moves made by this House. I shall list only the issues raised overnight&mdash;not the ones raised previously. We have proposed using the affirmative procedure in respect of the rules of court. We have proposed providing a wider role for the independent reviewer so that he or she can look at the whole Act. We have taken steps to ensure that the independent reviewer's report will be available so that the annual renewal debate on the Act can be proper and informed. We wish to include in the Bill the requirement for the Secretary of State to ask the independent reviewer to comment specifically on the implications for the Act of any future legislation on terrorism.</p>
	<p pid=".1827.7/3">We have proposed putting a specific requirement on the Secretary of State to consult the independent reviewer before laying an order to renew the control order powers each year. We have proposed measures to include additional protection for the subjects of non-derogating control orders in the Bill and specifically to enshrine existing procedures to ensure that exculpatory material will be disclosed to the court and the special advocate in all cases, and also to the subject of the order, unless that is contrary to the public interest. We have moved amendments to allow the disclosure of unused material unless that is contrary to the public interest.</p>
	<p pid=".1827.7/4">I have read that long list of the constructive moves made by the Government and the House to try to meet concerns expressed throughout the whole House and in the other place because it shows that we want to find constructive solutions. I contrast the approach of the Government and the Commons to the zero movement&mdash;that is literally the case&mdash;of the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats who control the other place. In 12 hours, there have been two rounds of consideration, but there has not been any movement at all. There have been two separate sessions in the Lords with zero response. Theirs is a stick-in-the mud response in which they have dug their heels into the sand and prevented the elected House from carrying out its proposals.</p>
	<p pid=".1827.7/5">The country needs a Bill that prevents terrorism and protects our people. Our constituents, who elect us to the House, need that protection, and that is why we are addressing the issue in this way. I believe that it is time for the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats in the other place to respect the considered views of the elected Chamber. I urge the House to support the amendments and I urge Conservative and Liberal Democrat Members in the other place to give us their support.</p>

	<p pid=".1828.0/1">I am sorry that the night has not brought the Home Secretary good counsel. I rather hoped that when we reassembled this morning a greater degree of clarity and common sense would prevail. Instead, we have had a repetition of the same old mantras. The Home Secretary said that he is making a major concession, but it appears that that means giving a copy of the order to the person concerned. He knows that the distinction that he continues to try to make between derogating and non-derogating orders is wrong and absurd. The logical conclusion of his argument is that derogating orders are valueless, as was explained by the Minister for Crime Reduction, Policing and Community Safety last night. There is no reason why non-derogating orders should not be subject to the same protection as derogating orders. Having had his moment of clarity, it is extraordinary that the Home Secretary is still unable and unwilling to give a logical explanation of why he will not concede that point, which we believe is of great importance.</p>
	<p pid=".1828.0/2">The liberty of the individual must be protected, miscarriages of justice must be prevented, and if this anti-terrorism legislation is to work and command public approval in all communities in this country it must be seen to be transparently fair. It is extraordinary that the Home Secretary is prepared to tolerate a system in which there is inherent and manifest unfairness. The explanations that he has offered to justify it are frankly gobbledygook. We are told that there is a major concession on Privy Council review&mdash;there is not. The extent of the urgent procedure may be looked at by the independent reviewer, but there has not been any attempt by the Home Secretary to engage with the value and merits of a full Privy Council review.</p>
	<p pid=".1828.0/3">Finally, there is the issue of the sunset clause. The Home Secretary does not seem to have grasped the significance of the sunset clause to Parliament as a whole. This legislation is unusual and draconian, and it would be wrong to put something on the statute book that has the capacity to become permanent. There is no reason why the sunset clause should not be included in the Bill, and the mechanisms that the Home Secretary is giving himself to renew the legislation by order are fundamentally flawed and wrong. If the Home Secretary thinks that there will be movement in the other place on that point, he is profoundly mistaken, because it is of such importance.</p>

	<p pid=".1829.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman remember that when the Government last came to us, in 2001, with emergency powers to deal with terrorism, there was tension between the two Houses and a deadline to meet? However, a resolution was achieved because two principles were accepted by the Government&mdash;first, that there should be due process throughout, and secondly, that there should be a sunset clause. When the Government accepted those proposals, there was movement and both Houses came to an agreement.</p>

	<p pid=".1829.1/1">I could not agree more. I am a great believer in sunset clauses generally, because there is much stale legislation on the statute book. This legislation requires a sunset clause. It is ridiculous that we should consider allowing legislation passed in such haste to remain on the statute book for an indeterminate period.</p>

	<p pid=".1829.3/1">The Home Secretary is suffering from severe cognitive dysfunction. I explained our position to him last night, and I am sorry if he cannot now remember it. I can only assume that his general anger and frustration got the better of him and he was not listening to a word I said. That is why I appear to be repeating myself, and I shall try to avoid doing that.</p>
	<p pid=".1829.3/2">The Home Secretary said that no concessions had been made in the other place. That was not my impression. When the debate started, we wanted a sunset clause of eight months&mdash;and there were strong reasons for that. A concession was made and on a very sensible Labour amendment, we accepted a sunset clause of 12 months. So it is wrong for the Home Secretary to say that no attempt has been made to reach agreement. I am here, if the Home Secretary wants to talk to me&mdash;any time he likes&mdash;as are all my hon. Friends.</p>

Gentleman tell me why no sunset clauses were included in the rail and coal privatisations? Why did the Single European Act and the Maastricht treaty not include sunset clauses? I could go on for another 20 minutes. The truth is that the Tory Opposition are using unelected Members in the other place to overturn the will of hon.

That is the extent of the problem that the Government face, and until they start to listen, they will continue to have a problem. All that I can say to the Home Secretary is that I hope that during the passage of the morning he may come to have a little more sense, because he can have this Bill and the protections that it offers, and at the same time, civil liberties can be protected; at the moment, they are not.

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-03-10.1832.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1095" speakername="Rob Marris" colnum="1832"  time="08:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050310/debtext/50310-47.htm#50310-47_spnew19">
	<p pid=".1832.1/1">At first, one could characterise this Bill as a nasty little Bill because we live in a nasty little world. I abstained on Second and Third Reading because I wanted the Home Secretary to make concessions. To my mind, he has done so, and I have been happy to vote with the Government when the Bill has recently been before the House.</p>
	<p pid=".1832.1/2">There are currently three sticking points. The first sticking point is <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/924" name="Dominic Grieve">the sunset clause. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve)</phrase> tells us that a sunset clause is necessary because otherwise the Bill, when enacted, could go on and on. He seems to forget the fundamental constitutional principle that one Parliament cannot bind another, that we will have a general election within the next 18 months, because constitutionally we must, and that any subsequent Parliament can look at this legislation again.</p>
	<p pid=".1832.1/3">The second sticking point is the question of Privy Councillors conducting the review. I remind hon. Members that myriad independent reviews in the past were not carried out by Privy Councillors, and they were in no way the lapdogs of Government. If we think back to the previous Government, we had the Scarman inquiry, and the Scott inquiry into Matrix Churchill. Just because a review is carried out by an independent person does not mean that the inquiry is a stitch-up from the beginning.</p>
	<p pid=".1832.1/4">The third sticking point involves non-derogating control orders and the burden of proof. I can see why the Conservatives argue for that principle, but it has not been a principle in the past and is not a principle in many parts of our criminal law. If someone is remanded in custody, that is because there is a reasonable suspicion that they have committed an offence. They can be remanded in custody for weeks. Under the previous Government, as some Members may recall, there was the case of Mr. Osman, who fought extradition from this country because there was a reasonable suspicion that he had carried out criminal activities abroad. He was incarcerated in this country for years under the previous Government&mdash;it did not seem to be a principle to the Conservatives then.</p>
	<p pid=".1832.1/5">Most hon. Members have been with a constituent, as I have, and discussed an issue that appears to be have been resolved in the conversation, when the constituent says, &quot;And another thing,&quot; so one has a discussion about that&mdash;but then the constituent says, &quot;And another thing.&quot; That characterises the Opposition's position. The Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives have made no concessions, yet the Government have made them as part of the debate in the Chamber and in the other place, and I respect my Government for that. I shall continue voting with them because I do not wish to be in a position whereby the House of Lords dictates to us and does not engage in proper concessions. Such engagement is the way in which a mature society should resolve those issues.</p>

	<p pid=".1833.0/2">We must remember the context of the debate. The Home Secretary was right to remind us at the beginning of his remarks that today is the anniversary of an appalling terrorist atrocity in Madrid. We are all trying to ensure that such an atrocity cannot happen in the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p pid=".1833.6/1">I am most grateful, Mr. Deputy Speaker, because, as I said at the outset, it is important that we remember exactly what we are about. We are trying to find&mdash;I hope through consensus&mdash;the best way of protecting the citizens of this country and ensuring that they are subject to fair laws. I respect many of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1095" name="Rob Marris">the comments that the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris)</phrase> made, but it is wrong to say that no attempt has been made to find that consensus.</p>
	<p pid=".1833.6/2">We have understood the Home Secretary's arguments and accepted that, although control orders are deeply unpleasant, they will be part of the architecture of fighting terrorism in this country. We have accepted, because it was appropriate, that the emergency arrangements were a necessary part of the construction of those control orders. We have sought to find any number of ways of constructing an appropriate legal framework in which those control orders could be made. The other place has played a significant part in that dialogue and we have made progress. The House should accept that.</p>
	<p pid=".1833.6/3">Volume is no substitute for content, and we should examine what the House of Lords says. It does not state that it wishes to oppose the Government's proposals. Far from it&mdash;it wants to work with the Government. It insists on its amendment, which we propose to delete today, on a matter that is deeply significant not only to people from abroad whom we might not like the look of, but to British citizens and the way in which they will be treated in our courts. It is important to read the Lords reasons. Reason 1F states:</p>
	<p pid=".1833.6/4" class="indent">&quot;Because the Lords remain of the view that reasonable suspicion is too low a test; that the authority to conduct a prosecution should be the Director of Public Prosecutions and not the chief of the relevant police force; and that all control orders should be subject to the same procedure before the courts.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1833.6/5">There are many right hon. and hon. Members on the Labour Benches who agree with all those propositions. I see some of them nodding now.</p>

	<p pid=".1834.0/1">What is the opinion of the hon. Gentleman, as a Liberal Democrat&mdash;I emphasise the word &quot;democrat&quot;&mdash;as to whose view should prevail if there is ultimately an honest disagreement between this House and the unelected House?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-03-10.1834.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/950" speakername="David Heath" colnum="1834"  time="08:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050310/debtext/50310-48.htm#50310-48_spnew7">
	<p pid=".1834.1/1">We are engaging&mdash;[Hon. Members: &quot;Answer.&quot;] I am answering the question. We are engaged in a process of dialogue that I hope will result in justice for the people of this country. The honest answer is that, ultimately, the House of Commons must of course be the prime House. I have no quarrel about that, and nor would any of my noble Friends at the other end of the Corridor. I return to what they are saying: it is not that the House must not have the anti-terrorism proposals that the Home Secretary has put forward&mdash;but there is a perfectly proper argument that reasonable suspicion is too low a test. We heard <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/802" name="Kenneth Clarke">the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)</phrase>, in an earlier speech, saying that we do not even accept that for a parking ticket for British citizens, and yet we are prepared to accept it for a deprivation of liberty. I take that seriously, and I hope that Members on the other side of the Chamber take it seriously. They would have done so in previous years and previous debates, so I hope that they still do.</p>
	<p pid=".1834.1/2">The second component is that the prosecution should be conducted by the Director of Public Prosecutions. The Home Secretary has acknowledged that principle. He has chosen, for reasons that are not entirely clear, to say that he wishes to consult the chief of police rather than the person who is charged with making a prosecution&mdash;the Director of Public Prosecutions. I do not understand that. I do not understand where the matter of principle is involved in that. I would have thought that it is all a matter of proper dialogue and negotiation.</p>
	<p pid=".1834.1/3">The third point relates to the common procedure for these orders. Again, we have heard cogent speeches from well-respected Government Members saying that there should be exactly that, so let us not pretend that there is a matter of principle between the two sides of the House on that point.</p>

	<p pid=".1835.0/1">The hon. Gentleman, in his usual way, is putting cogent arguments to the House. He is setting out concessions, to which I have adverted, made by the Government and the Home Secretary. I may have misunderstood him, but I have not understood him to be putting forward any concessions made by his party during the debating process of the last two weeks. He is setting out principles of his party, and I respect that. What concessions has his party made during this debating process?</p>

	<p pid=".1835.1/1">Because the hon. Gentleman asks the question in a sensible way, I will do my best to answer. A whole series of amendments have come forward from the Home Secretary that have not returned to this House. He may have noticed that we are now down to three propositions as the areas of differentiation. Initially, we were very concerned, as I said, about the whole concept of control orders. We have accepted that. We were concerned about reasonable suspicion for an emergency control, as a matter of principle. We have accepted that there are conditions in which that will be the appropriate test. Clearly, therefore, we are making progress in those areas.</p>

	<p pid=".1835.4/1">I am very grateful to the hon. Gentleman. He has been making the point that all control orders should be treated precisely the same, which is a point to which their lordships are still holding. Does not he accept that many in the House believe that it is wholly different to impose a control order that deprives someone of their liberty by putting them under house arrest and to impose one that merely says that somebody is not allowed to work in a nuclear establishment or that they will have their passport removed?</p>

	<p pid=".1835.5/1">Let me take the hon. Gentleman's point at face value. What is proposed in these control orders is a whole spectrum of controls, ranging from minimal matters to serious restrictions on the liberties of the individual. There is no sharp dividing line. At one end there is what has been described as home arrest; at the other there is merely reporting to a police station, or something of that sort. Between the two, there are what can only be construed as serious deprivations of liberty, which could fall short of a derogation. I think it entirely reasonable to have a common judicial process.</p>

	<p pid=".1836.0/1">The right hon. and learned Gentleman is right. They can be. The problem is that there is such a range of potential&mdash;I was going to say penalties, but we cannot really call them penalties, because they are not penalties for a crime committed; they are penalties imposed in the anticipation of a crime.</p>

	<p pid=".1836.2/2">I must tell the hon. Member for Rhondda this: it cannot be described as a minor deprivation when someone cannot work, cannot leave a particular area, cannot consort with friends, cannot telephone anyone and cannot use the internet. All those orders are on the palette available to the Home Secretary. It cannot be said that all of them are inconsequential matters for the individual, and that the orders should continue for as long as the Home Secretary may determine. I am sorry, but I do not believe that those are inconsequential matters.</p>

	<p pid=".1836.5/1">I am grateful, because this is one of the first times that we have explored the issue since yesterday. Surely the point is that any control order that contravened article 5 would automatically be a derogating power, and consequently would be struck down by the judges.</p>

	<p pid=".1836.6/1">I understand that point, but the fact that we have a spectrum enabling a series of non-derogating controls to become derogating controls, and therefore be subject to annulment, emphasises my argument for a common judicial process.

	<p pid=".1836.8/1">Not now. Others want to speak.</p>
	<p pid=".1836.8/2">Two matters of process are before the House, and one matter of principle. The matter of principle is what I have just been talking about, and on that I still believe that we can reach an accommodation. The two matters of process are the Privy Council review of the legislation&mdash;which I think is a sensible outcome and one to be desired, particularly given the Government's new amendment to provide the independent reviewer&mdash;and the sunset clause.</p>
	<p pid=".1836.8/3">The sunset clause is a matter of practicality: it is a protection against the continuation of what is, in anyone's book, a hastily constructed and dangerously draconian measure. It is an emergency measure, which has not been properly considered by the House of Commons or anyone outside it. I believe that it is sensible to provide a sunset clause enabling the new Parliament, however it may be formed, to discuss the legislation, with an appropriate amount of time.</p>
	<p pid=".1836.8/4">If the Secretary of State wants to return to us with a different date for the sunset clause, we shall listen to what he has to say. As I pointed out yesterday, he has already provided for a proto-sunset clause in his amendments. There is a pretence that there is a huge difference between the two Houses&mdash;an impasse&mdash;but it is an impasse in the mind of the Prime Minister. It is the Prime Minister who cannot countenance the fact that we could reach an accommodation.</p>
	<p pid=".1836.8/5">I return to the point with which I started. These matters are too serious for us to engage in knockabout across the Chamber, which I think does nothing for the reputation of the House. It is time we sat round the table and arrived at a consensus so that we can get these measures on the statute book. Why? Because it is the anniversary of a major atrocity in a European city and because we have been told that there are dangerous terrorists who need to be locked up for the protection of our citizens, but are now walking freely the streets of Britain. Those are the reasons why we need the legislation to go through in a form acceptable to this and the other House. It is time we sat down and ensured that that happens.</p>

	<p pid=".1837.0/1">When I became a Minister in 1997, a wise older politician said to me, &quot;John, before you take a major decision, just remember how it will look at the public inquiry into the subsequent disaster.&quot; Some of us fear that, in the years to come, there may be a public inquiry into how al-Qaeda were able to mount the attack that they succeeded in getting away with, despite the best efforts of our security services. I have to say that if a video were shown of the proceedings of this and the other House, it would not reflect well on the efforts being made to protect this country from terrorism.</p>
	<p pid=".1837.0/2">I say that because a Bill about terrorism has now been elevated into what has the signs of being a serious constitutional crisis, which should not have been allowed to happen. Mistakes have been made on all sides and people have become very heated, but we now need to take stock of where we are today.</p>
	<p pid=".1837.0/3">During my time in Parliament, disagreements between this House and the other place have occurred over many pieces of legislation. It has often taken place against the pressure of time at the end of a Session. I have never known a situation, however, in which a way through could not be found. In each of those cases, there were real differences&mdash;differences in the sense that two reasonable people could hold a different point of view&mdash;but a way through was found. In every single case, the way through was found in support of the position of the democratically elected Chamber of Parliament.</p>
	<p pid=".1837.0/4">If we reflect on where we are with the Bill, it is clear that there are real differences in the sense that two reasonable people could take a different point of view, but those real differences are not sufficient to justify the constitutional crisis into which we are now falling.</p>
	<p pid=".1837.0/5">There are two major points. The first is the argument about the level of proof. It is a simple fact that Opposition Members who were in their places to do so, voted regularly for the prevention of terrorism Acts, which gave the Secretary of State the power to determine where British citizens should live. He had that power not after going to a judge, not on reasonable suspicion, not on any legal test or procedure, but simply because the man who is now the Leader of the Opposition said, &quot;You are not living there, sunshine, and that is an end to it&mdash;no argument.&quot; The party that voted for that cannot sensibly now say that the argument about the level of proof is sufficient to provoke a constitutional crisis. It makes no sense.</p>

Friend the Member for Hull, North (Mr. McNamara)</phrase> reminded the House about internment. This Bill proposes a form of internment, albeit with different gradations. People will be detained not for what they do but for what they might do. That, fundamentally, is what internment is, and everyone agrees that it led to massive recruitment to the IRA. Given that the definition of terrorism has such a low threshold, it is my serious view that by proceeding in this way we will incite more people to anger and make it more likely that they will support terrorist organisations. Therefore, I think that the revising House needs to restrain this House from making such a major error, especially as our procedures have been found so wanting.</p>

The House has considered the Bill and has reached the view&mdash;it is the same as mine&mdash;that the current legal test is satisfactory and adequate, as it must be scrutinised by a judge, who must agree that the evidence justifies the nature of the restriction order.</p>

He presents himself as a voice of reason; I hope that he accepts that there is, at least, a difference.</p>

However, I am glad that he got to his feet, as he has just justified the fact that the previous Conservative Government introduced an order that restricted the freedom of British citizens but which had no legal process or test, and no examination of evidence.</p>
	<p pid=".1838.5/2">I quite accept that some control orders would be less intrusive than the exclusion orders. Some would be more intrusive, but this Bill contains a test. It provides for judicial process and a test of evidence. The Opposition never wanted that.</p>
	<p pid=".1838.5/3">We have established that the principle in respect of evidence has never concerned the Opposition.

	<p pid=".1839.1/1">No. Two reasonable people can disagree about introducing a sunset clause into the Bill or providing for annual renewal, but the fundamental issue is whether we in this House, and the other place, should have the democratic ability, every year, to get rid of this legislation if we do not like it. That has been established as a result of the changes made to the Bill, and it is not the basis for a constitutional crisis between this House and the other place.</p>

	<p pid=".1839.2/1">I would like to take the right hon. Gentleman's mind back to the debates on the annual renewal of the prevention of terrorism Act, which are essentially the mechanism that the Government have so far agreed for a reconsideration of that Act year by year. The dilemma that faced the Labour party year after year was whether to oppose the renewal, in the face of the argument that Labour would prove soft on terrorism if it did, because it was a take-it-or-leave it situation. Does he realise that that will be the situation under this Bill unless we have a mechanism whereby the Bill lapses and must be replaced by new and better legislation?</p>

	<p pid=".1839.3/1">Of course the process of annual renewal can be limited; it was under the prevention of terrorism Act. It is a genuine and reasonable difference of opinion that one can have about a sunset clause as opposed to annual renewal. Is that a basis, however, for saying that the differences are so great that this House and its democratic majority should be overruled by an unelected Chamber? I do not think that it is.</p>
	<p pid=".1839.3/2">My point is this: this Chamber has improved this legislation considerably since its introduction by my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary. As very often in the House, decisions in another place have had an impact and have been taken into account. Equally, the legislation has been changed by the actions of Members here&mdash;let us be honest, partly by those Members who did not vote for it on this side who might have been expected to, and partly by a number of Members who did vote for the Government but perhaps have made it clear that we wanted to see changes made. This Chamber has improved the Bill. We have now reached a situation where there are differences of opinion between the House and another place, but none that justify the House now conceding to the other place.</p>
	<p pid=".1839.3/3">We may well be fighting an election in a few weeks' time. [Hon. Members: &quot;Really?&quot;] So I am given to understand from the newspapers. The truth is that if the House is forced to give in by the other place, the election of every single Member of the House will be diminished as a result. The process will be diminished. Those on the other side who are organising in the House of Lords to achieve that should be mindful of the consequences.</p>

	<p pid=".1840.4/1">The plain fact is that the Bill is fundamentally flawed on all the principles on which it is being proposed. It does not secure the nation. It is liable to create further trouble and dissention among those whom we are seeking to control&mdash;the terrorists. It denies the liberty of the subject&mdash;habeas corpus&mdash;but the Home Secretary refuses to accept that, although he originally said that it would contain habeas corpus, and he would not give way to me&mdash;as you noticed, Mr. Deputy Speaker&mdash;because he knew that I would raise that point. All that he could do was come up with a cheap jibe.</p>
	<p pid=".1840.4/2">The plain fact is that the Home Secretary knows that the Bill must be subjected to a sunset clause, but I ask the House to consider the central problem with the Bill: it is dependent on the application of the European convention on human rights. [Hon. Members: &quot;Hurray!&quot;] Hon. Members opposite may have their moment, but the reason why the Bill cannot work is that there is an internal tension, which the Home Secretary knows, between complying with the European convention on human rights on the one hand and trying to ensure the security of the nation on the other.</p>

	<p pid=".1841.1/1">I entirely agree with right hon. and learned Friend. He is absolutely right. Indeed, I introduced a Bill two days ago to provide precisely this: if it were enacted, we would provide that a writ of habeas corpus and a fair trial in accordance with due process and the rule of law should be available to every person. The Bill achieves neither the security of the nation nor the liberty of the subject. It should be subjected to a sunset clause.

	<p pid=".1841.4/2">With the scope that the Bill gives for this place and the other House to vote down all the legislation on the orders, there is sufficient safeguard, with the other amendments tabled by my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary, for the Bill to be accepted. No one on the Opposition Benches has mentioned tonight&mdash;or rather this morning&mdash;that my right hon.

As we meet here, I understand that it has been trailed on television that the Prime Minister is making a major statement about these proceedings outside Downing street&mdash;as we meet here. You are rightly jealous of the rights of this House. Last night, it emerged that the Prime Minister's statement that the security services had advised against a sunset clause was wrong, but he refused to come here to explain. Is it not time&mdash;</p>

In the past you have expressed grave displeasure when Ministers have come to the House second, after having made on a radio or television programme an announcement that was due to be made in the House. Is there not therefore precedent for you to call the Prime Minister to account for making a statement outside the House, instead of in the House? It is a contempt of Parliament. His Parliamentary Private Secretary is present. You could dispatch him to No. 10 and get the Prime Minister to come and answer the questions.</p>

	<p pid=".1857.1/2">At the same time, it is absolutely clear that the position of this elected House of Commons has remained strong, and that it has done so while support in the unelected House of Lords for those who oppose the Government's approach is in steady decline. The reason for that is that the Government's arguments against raising the standard of proof for non-derogating orders, and against the proposed sunset clause, are clear and strong. I will repeat them.</p>
	<p pid=".1857.1/3">I shall deal first with the standard of proof, which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/924" name="Dominic Grieve">the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve)</phrase> has spent a lot of time discussing on the Floor of this House. With respect, he is missing a point that is of absolutely central importance. The decision to reduce the standard of proof would inevitably lead to the likelihood that certain dangerous individuals would not be brought under control&mdash;that is the core of the argument. There are other legal arguments that also have weight, but I will not refer to them now.</p>

	<p pid=".1857.4/1">If the burden of proof were changed, fewer people would of course be affected by the orders, but those who would not be affected would presumably be those who, on the balance of probability, were not guilty of the allegations made against them.

The threshold of evidence was very high when the police raided the house in question and looked for a conviction, which they got, but my right hon. Friend and the rest of this House should be aware that a shoe, a detonator and explosives were in that house for two years prior to the raid, so it is desperately important that the threshold be low enough for the police to do something about such a situation within such a period.</p>

	<p pid=".1858.0/2">On the sunset clause, I have told the House on a number of occasions, and I set it out again here today, that if we put one in the Bill we will be saying that powers that this House considers necessary to deal with the threat that we face may, in the very near future, be thought not to be necessary. That will send a clear message to terrorist organisations that this is a place where they can thrive, and I reject that approach.</p>

There are the quarterly reports that I, as Secretary of State, make to Parliament on the use of the powers to make control orders and on surrounding issues. There is the independent reviewer, who looks at the whole operation of the Act, as a result of some of the changes that I have made, and makes a report to be laid before Parliament. There is the process of annual review that allows both Houses of Parliament to decide, by vote, whether to continue the Act. There is the fact that on the derogation orders there is also an annual renewal that operates in that way. There is the fact that, as I announced on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-22">22 February</phrase>, my clear intention is to introduce further counter-terrorist legislation as soon as parliamentary time allows. As the House knows, our intention has always been that that would be in the next Session of Parliament.</p>

	<p pid=".1859.0/1">My hon. Friend is entirely right, because there is a choice with the legislation. One can take the approach, suggested by the Opposition parties, that there is a defined moment at which anti-terrorist legislation simply disappears. The other approach, which I think is better, is to say that we need to have a system that improves the operation of our counter-terrorism legislation, learns from experience and decides how, if necessary, we make amendments. That is the superior legislative approach.</p>

	<p pid=".1859.6/1">I shall not give way.</p>
	<p pid=".1859.6/2">I want to propose the positive course of action suggested by my hon. Friend because we know, following this ping-pong, that many colleagues in the other place understand that, in a democracy, the will of the elected House should prevail. I announced in my statement on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-22">22 February</phrase> my clear intention to introduce further counter-terrorist legislation as soon as parliamentary time allows. I can tell the House that the Government will ensure that the new legislation that I announced some weeks ago is timetabled in such a way that hon. Members will have had the opportunity to consider the first report of the independent reviewer before they seek to table amendments. The effect of that, of course, is that the operation of the Bill before us now and the reviewer's independent review will be available to Members of both Houses in considering amendments to that legislation.</p>
	<p pid=".1859.6/3">To achieve that, I suggest a timetable along the following lines for the House to consider. I suggest that, in March 2005, we get Royal Assent for this Bill; that, immediately thereafter, we appoint the independent reviewer; and that, in the late autumn of 2005, we publish the draft counter-terrorism Bill and begin its pre-legislative scrutiny, which I promised to the House.</p>
	<p pid=".1859.6/4">In early 2006, the first report of the independent reviewer would be presented to the Home Secretary, who would lay the report before Parliament, as previously pledged. The report would include both the reviewer's report on the operation of the current Bill and the implications of the new offences for this Bill. In spring 2006, the new counter-terrorism Bill would be introduced in the Commons, informed by the analysis that I have just described. In March 2006, a year from today, there would be the first renewal of the prevention of terrorism Act order. Until July 2006, the counter-terrorism Bill would proceed through Parliament and, we hope, receive Royal Assent in July 2006.</p>
	<p pid=".1859.6/5">I say in all seriousness that the course of action that I suggest is a constructive attempt to find a way forward and out of the area we are in. It will allow both Houses to consider the situation in detail and, instead of allowing the legislation to disappear, allow it to be improved. I therefore now invite Conservatives and Liberal Democrats in this House and in the other place to recognise the value of my constructive proposal, to recognise the need for the views of this House&mdash;the elected Chamber&mdash;to prevail, to withdraw their amendments in the other place on the sunset clause and on standards of proof and to drop their remaining opposition to the Bill.</p>

	<p pid=".1860.0/1">The Home Secretary will recognise from my previous comments that the Liberal Democrats are anxious to find a way of getting round this apparently insoluble problem. Our prime requirement is that we have a mechanism by which new legislation may be introduced with a proper timetable and a proper opportunity to amend it. That was not on offer as part of the right hon. Gentleman's previous proposals. May I ask about what is now being proposed, which I certainly will consider carefully? First, will it be on the face of the Bill and therefore part of statute; and, secondly, does the right hon. Gentleman envisage that the process will be complete by November 2006?</p>

	<p pid=".1860.1/1">First, as I have said before, the hon. Gentleman and his party have sought on various occasions to make constructive proposals. As late as this afternoon, a different set of constructive proposals were made with which I could not agree. Nevertheless, I acknowledge that, unlike the main Opposition party, the Liberal Democrats have sought to take a positive approach on these matters.</p>
	<p pid=".1860.1/2">On the hon. Gentleman's second question, yes, it would be our intention that by November 2006 the new Bill would have Royal Assent; and, on his first question, it would not be our intention to place the timetable issues on the face of the Bill, but the statement before this House is serious testimony that the hon. Gentleman should accept.</p>

	<p pid=".1860.2/1">My right hon. Friend's proposed timetable must surely be the complete answer to anyone who says that there will not be adequate opportunity to test a new measure in this House.

It is inevitable that that will happen; indeed, if he decides to do it on a whim, he can lower the standard still further. However, if he is going to deprive a person of their liberty for a prolonged period, which is what his administrative action will result in, the question he must answer is whether it is proper to do that on reasonable suspicion rather than according to a normal standard of civil proof.</p>

	<p pid=".1866.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is quite right. The Home Secretary's timetable is an important contribution to the debate. If the Government honour their commitments, there might turn out to be, or might probably turn out to be, a sunset clause. The trouble is that there is no requirement on the Government to turn the proposal into a sunset clause if, when the time comes, the Government decide to have two pieces of legislation on the statute book in parallel.</p>
	<p pid=".1866.0/2">The argument that if the Home Secretary is prepared to offer such a programme, there is absolutely no reason why a sunset clause should not be put in the legislation must equally well apply. We really cannot get away from that. I urge every Member of the House who wishes to see this matter resolved to look sensibly at the creation of a sunset clause that guarantees that this legislation cannot stay on the statute book for a day longer than is necessary.That is the issue; the problem has been that the Government have refused consistently to respond. I ask the Home Secretary to urge the Prime Minister to do so instead of posturing around in Downing street with his own media bids. Then we might be able to make progress. Until then, I regret to have to tell the Home Secretary that we stand by the Lords amendments.</p>

	<p pid=".1866.1/1">First, may I acknowledge a fact that has not been acknowledged in this debate? There has been movement between the other place and here in the process of these amendments. Two concessions have been made by another place in recognition of the Home Secretary's position: one on the part of the Conservatives in dropping the amendment on the Privy Council committee that they had been pressing; the other on our part in dropping our insistence on the reference to the Director of Public Prosecutions, not because we believe that that was not the right way of doing it, but because we had acknowledged that the right hon.

	<p pid=".1866.4/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman&mdash;or perhaps the House&mdash;for giving way.</p>
	<p pid=".1866.4/2">The hon. Gentleman said that the Liberals in the other place gave way on the issue of the Director of Public Prosecutions, but does he not realise&mdash;he should, because his party in Scotland is in government with the Labour party&mdash;that this creates a special Scottish problem? The effect is that a senior police officer will be the one to determine whether there is a possibility of prosecution. That is a novel concept in Scots law and takes away the traditional procurator fiscal service.</p>

	<p pid=".1867.0/1">The hon. Gentleman has made his point.</p>
	<p pid=".1867.0/2">Two issues remain in play as far as we are concerned before we complete our consideration of the Bill. One is a matter of principle. The Home Secretary understands that we have a principled objection to the standard of proof that he believes is necessary and that we believe is too low. We will not agree on that issue. We have debated it time and time again; we will not agree. Nor will we stand down from our conviction that the balance of probabilities is the least standard of proof that is appropriate for the deprivation of liberties of British subjects. We shall persist with that, but we acknowledge the fact that the right hon. Gentleman is not going to move.</p>
	<p pid=".1867.0/3">The other is a matter of process&mdash;how this House deals with this deeply inadequate, deeply flawed and deeply hurried legislation in future, so that we get better and stronger legislation to deal with the threat of terrorism. That is what we all want, and that is what the right hon. Gentleman, by a serial process, has given us to understand is his intention in bringing forward extra legislation in future.</p>
	<p pid=".1867.0/4">Those hon. Members who heard the debate in the other place earlier this afternoon will have recognised the fact that men and women of good will on both sides in that House were very anxious to find a way of getting round the obstacle of what has been called a sunset clause.</p>

	<p pid=".1867.1/1">That is clearly an obstacle because of the barriers that have been put around it by the Prime Minister and others as a matter for dispute between the political parties.</p>
	<p pid=".1867.1/2">The Home Secretary has put forward various proposals that enable the House to reconsider the Bill. We acknowledge that, but there is one last problem, which was quite unavoidable. That problem is the fact that Parliament would not be in a position to amend the legislation on renewal. Renewal orders are not amendable. As we have said repeatedly, the problem with that is that this House and another would be given the options of accepting renewal or rejecting it, and nothing else. It is not difficult to understand that. in the circumstances of a terrorist threat, only acceptance of renewal would be a proper course of action for responsible parliamentarians; therefore, the House would not have the option of making good what we believe to be inadequate legislation.</p>
	<p pid=".1867.1/3">Those of good will in another place, in whose number we include Lord Morris of Aberavon, who spoke extremely well, Lord King of Bridgwater, who made an outstanding speech, and my noble Friend Lord Steel of Aikwood&mdash;</p>

However, on the point of process, if we can arrive at a solution that is satisfactory to this House and to the other place, so be it&mdash;we will have achieved substantial progress.</p>
	<p pid=".1868.3/2">My final point is simply that, had we had a timetable for such legislation three years ago, we might not be in the lamentable position that we are in today. We might not have to consider legislation of such importance against the backdrop of an apparent emergency&mdash;an emergency that is, in fact, of the Government's own making. It is the Government's failure to take seriously the process of review, the Newton committee's proposals and the views of all those outside the House who said that we needed better, more appropriate anti-terrorism legislation that has brought us to where we are today. Given that we are here, let us see whether we can make progress.</p>

	<p pid=".1869.3/1">The nature of the threat puts us in unprecedented times. These are not matters of parking fines, as one former Home Secretary meant to say. These are times when young men are prepared to blow themselves up along with several hundred people who are on the plane with them. Therefore, this country has to have the appropriate means to defend our citizens.</p>
	<p pid=".1869.3/2">Perhaps we have at last reached a divide in our debate and we can separate, as I believe the hon.

	<p pid=".1869.3/3">As far as the standard of proof is concerned, clearly we have the difference between the balance of probabilities and reasonable suspicion. I have already mentioned the Gloucester bomber and the nature of threat. If I were sitting on such a case, I confess that, faced with reasonable suspicion or the balance of probabilities, I would bear in mind the awful nature of what would happen if I took the wrong view, and the effect on our citizens if afterwards I realised that I had applied too high a standard of proof and people were allowed to walk the streets and wilfully blow up our own people.</p>
	<p pid=".1869.3/4">I turn finally to the second area of concern and difference: the sunset clause. What I dislike about the sunset clause&mdash;I understand the motive behind it; it is a very honourable one&mdash;is that it is absolute.

	<p pid=".1869.5/1">I am making a very short speech.</p>
	<p pid=".1869.5/2">Surely the key question on the sunset clause is this: what is the objective of a sunset clause and can that objective be met in any other way? After all, a sunset clause is only a device to reach a particular end. So I pose the question whether that end can be reached in a more acceptable way&mdash;indeed, in a way that gives not only this House but the other place ample time in which to discuss and to amend. It is absolutely clear that the alternative put forward by my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary achieves that objective in a far more acceptable way. I therefore hope that reasonable colleagues on the Opposition Benches will consider that offer. Does it have to be written down? It will be in <i>Hansard,</i> and I am sure that my right hon. Friend would sign his notes if necessary.</p>

	<p pid=".1870.0/1">The right hon. Gentleman is making some very important points. If the Government's offer is indeed a fair one, there can be no reason for not having a sunset clause in the legislation that would expire at exactly the same moment as the legislative programme that the Government are envisaging comes to fruition, providing reassurance that bad law, which I am afraid we are seeking to pass at the moment, will not stay long on the statute book.</p>

	<p pid=".1870.1/1">Both the sunset clause and the device proposed by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State could achieve the same end. I concede that, but the disadvantage of a sunset clause is that it is absolute; it will fall at a certain time. The Opposition wanted, as a first foot forward, a six-month period until November. That was absolutely absurd in terms of our parliamentary timetable, even with the amount of days on which the House will be sitting before November. Even on March, it would impose an arbitrary timetable.</p>
	<p pid=".1870.1/2">In my judgment, the step-by-step approach that my right hon. Friend has reasonably proposed achieves the same end in a far more acceptable way. This will separate the sheep from the goats. It will certainly separate those whose motives are to embarrass the Government from those&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i></p>

	<p pid=".1870.3/1">This matter will certainly separate those who, like the Liberal Democrats, hold a certain view on points of principle that they have properly put forward from those who may have another agenda.</p>
	<p pid=".1870.3/2">Looking at the proposal dispassionately and objectively, it is clear that it achieves the object that the Opposition have put forward, and it does so in a way that gives far more opportunity for Parliament without the risks attendant on the sunset clause.</p>
	<p pid=".1870.3/3">Finally, we have heard much about constitutional points. I have been in the House a very long time, and I know of no example in which the ping-pong has been so prolonged. In my judgment, in the past, those in the other place have recognised that, ultimately, it is the will of this House that will prevail. For whatever reason, they seem persistent; there is even a rumour around the House that they wish to adjourn until Monday. If they were to do so, they would clearly keep the headlines, but they would spoil the programme of the Government and their motives would be very much in question.</p>
	<p pid=".1870.3/4">It is the will of this House that should prevail. There has been ample debate, and a real concession and a real way through has been put forward by my right hon. Friend. Surely, any reasonable person should now accept it.</p>

	<p pid=".1871.2/1">I understand that the Bill was provoked by the situation of those in Belmarsh and the inability to retain them in detention, and the decision of the Law Lords that that was contrary to the European convention on human rights. If that was so, I find that difficult to understand, because it was said that they were held because they were foreigners and that it was not the same for British citizens. Of course, the detainees were detained as foreigners who were being rejected asylum and whom we wished to deport. It would be very difficult to put British citizens in the same position.

	<p pid=".1880.3/3" class="indent">Bicester accommodation centre for asylum seekers</p>
	<p pid=".1880.3/4" class="indent">To the House of Commons</p>
	<p pid=".1880.3/5" class="indent">That the Deputy Prime Minister calls a full independent Planning enquiry after the decision by Cherwell District Council to refuse detailed planning permission for an accommodation centre for asylum seekers at Bicester;</p>
	<p pid=".1880.3/6" class="indent">That Home Office Ministers have stated at the Dispatch Box of the House of Commons during the passage of the Immigration, Nationality and Asylum Act 2002 that &quot;the government have made it clear that we will abide by the planning process, and by the outcome of any public enquiry . . . that is both fair and democratic&quot;;</p>

	<p pid=".1882.2/1">It has been a long wait. As we have just heard, this has been the third longest sitting since records began and although to the rest of the world it is Friday evening, to us it is still Thursday. However, for me the 30-hour wait has been worth it, because the subject of the debate is important to my constituency.</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/2">The debate is about the sad death of my constituent, Heather Bell, a rider who was thrown from her horse after it had bolted from a low-flying RAF Chinook. That resulted in a number of recommendations to help reduce the chances of such accidents occurring in future: first came the recommendations of the coroner, and then the petition from my constituents.</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/3">I recognise that the Minister has taken a step in the right direction&mdash;I give him credit where credit is due&mdash;in response to the coroner's call for</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/4" class="indent">&quot;better communication with the public&quot;,</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/5">and has set up a hotline. However, the information provided by the low-flying hotline is valid only at the time of calling. The caller must either</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/6" class="indent">&quot;keeping calling back&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/7">for</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/8" class="indent">&quot;updates or . . . take a chance&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/9">That means taking a chance on death or serious injury to horse and rider. In the wake of the several deaths already caused by the problem&mdash;I should emphasise that the matter does not just concern my constituency and the tragedy that occurred there; there have been serious injuries elsewhere&mdash;that is scarcely reassuring.</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/10">The hotline adviser told someone from my office who called to inquire about the service that</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/11" class="indent">&quot;if you were out for a couple of hours, we could say 'No, there's nothing'&mdash;and then near the end of the ride</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/12">a low-flying aircraft</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/13" class="indent">comes along&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/14">Given that the information is therefore limited not only to one specific day but to one very brief time slot and subject to change within a half hour or less, it appears that the value of the hotline is not much above the cosmetic.</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/15">The same adviser took pains to stress that all times were &quot;just advisory&quot;, and that the best time to ring was &quot;just before&quot; going out. When asked what flights would be taking place between 4 pm and 5.30 pm in the central Market Rasen area in Lincolnshire, the adviser stated that there would be &quot;one large rotary&quot; during that period. The area covered stretches across Boston, Scarborough and Wakefield&mdash;some hundreds of square miles. The information is therefore completely useless to anybody who wants an idea of whether a Chinook is to thunder down on them as they are riding a horse, perhaps causing it to bolt. Low-flying area 11 covers Humberside, North Lincolnshire, north-east Nottinghamshire and north-east Yorkshire&mdash;4,618 square miles.</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/16">The adviser could give no information whatever about the following day, and, as the MOD's press release announcing its launch last month pointed out, it is a &quot;helicopter hotline&quot; only. It tells people nothing about fast jets as they thunder across the countryside. If someone is planning to ride anywhere near a base or a helicopter training school,</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/17" class="indent">&quot;it will not be able to provide information on . . . activity around&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/18">such locations</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/19" class="indent">&quot;due to the consistently high level of activity in these areas.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/20">Furthermore, the hotline operates only between 8 am and 5 pm. When I rang the hotline, I was told that it was too late and to &quot;ring back tomorrow&quot;. Could the availability of the hotline be extended, particularly as at times a busy person might not be able to get through?</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/21">As the Minister is aware, I have called for the Ministry of Defence to notify the public on a website of a strip of perhaps 10 square miles either way where training is proposed and when, but that has not been done. Yet, as I have said before, there is no convincing reason&mdash;in security or technology terms&mdash;why it should not be done. The coroner accepted, as of course I do, that</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/22" class="indent">&quot;on occasions security issues may prevent publication of proposed sorties.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/23">However, he went on to say that he suspected that that</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/24" class="indent">&quot;would not apply to the majority of training flights.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/25">I am sure that the Minister accepts that that is entirely reasonable.</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/26">I do not question in any way the need for the RAF to conduct low-flying training; it is protecting national security. Nobody in Lincolnshire is a fanatic about the matter; we all recognise that Chinooks have to go out. We just want warning of where they will be on the training flights, which I would have thought are planned in advance. Co-ordinates must be laid out and the pilot must be given them. It is surely possible for the public to be told.</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/27">It is true that the current MOD website gives a skeleton timetable and calendar for low flying in the three most intensive low-flying areas of the country&mdash;central Wales, north Scotland and the Scottish borders&mdash;but that is no good either to my constituents or, for the first few days of this month, to people living in those three areas, as on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-04">4 March</phrase> the website was still showing the calendar for February, despite the claim that it had been updated on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-01">1 March</phrase>. If the information was merely about leisure activities or various public services, that would be regrettable, but it is about saving people's lives and there have already been deaths. Regrettably, there seems to be no great sense of urgency about that at the Ministry of Defence. Neither does it give one great confidence that any online service giving information about low flying in my constituency would be as helpful as one would hope.</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/28">The MOD website is not easy to navigate, and people need to know that the information is available before they can find it. When it is at last discovered, buried in a paragraph, it is pretty vague; time slots of up to eight hours are given for several days in a row in northern Scotland and central Wales. Even washing machine repair men can usually say whether they will be coming in the morning or the afternoon, and that drives us all crazy. I urge the Minister in the strongest terms to ensure not only that the current website is made much more user-friendly, but that the current state of affairs will not be the model for any other online information.</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/29">None the less, the question must be asked: why could not the MOD apply even the same skeleton plan, with all its deficiencies, to the area concerning my constituents? Currently, all that they can find out about their broad area from the MOD's website is the total number of hours flown in &quot;North Lincolnshire&quot;. That covers hundreds of square miles, and it included bordering areas the previous year. That might be useful to statisticians or students, but I do not see how it will save any lives.</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/30">Gainsborough might not be in the top three areas for military low flying, but that did not prevent 23 complaints from being logged in Market Rasen before Heather Bell's death. In fact, according to figures released to the <i>Lincolnshire Echo</i> last month under the Freedom of Information Act 2000, the MOD received 332 complaints about low-flying aircraft across Lincolnshire in the three years between 2002 and 2004. As the <i>Echo</i> commented,</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/31" class="indent">&quot;That's the equivalent of one complaint every three days.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/32">The same report of <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-08">8 February</phrase> recorded the fact that there had been another 45 complaints from residents in the Market Rasen area, including those in the villages of Glentham and Walesby, since the accident on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-10">10 June 2003</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/33">Let me quote a few lines from the report:</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/34" class="indent">&quot;In Middle Rasen itself, two complaints about low-flying helicopters were logged on June 13th, three days later. Two days after the accident, on June 12th, 2003, a low-flying jet was reported over Middle Rasen. A low-flying jet was seen over the village four days later. One complainant contacted military officials to report a low-flying helicopter over Market Rasen on July 21st 2003&mdash;just a month after the accident.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/35">Even worse, the report continues:</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/36" class="indent">&quot;A complaint about a low-flying helicopter over Middle Rasen was made in November 2004, even though the MOD has enforced a no-flying policy within a one-and-a-half mile radius of the village.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/37">The number of complaints is increasing. In 2002, there were 95 complaints; in 2003, there were 114; and in 2004 there were 123. Of the total 332 complaints, 262 were about low-flying fixed or non-rotary aircraft, mainly jets, while 56 concerned helicopters&mdash;and the MOD was &quot;unavailable for comment&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/38">Let us see what the Ministry does, apart from log events, when a person complains. According to the editor of the <i>Market Rasen Mail&mdash;</i>I presented a petition in response to his newspaper's campaign, which is why I have secured this debate&mdash;the complainant receives a visit from the RAF police, and the burden of proof is on the complainant, who has to answer technical questions about exact height and speed. Clearly, that does not encourage justified complaints any more than the current quality of the MOD website and hotline encourages use of those services.</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/39">So what is to be done? In the three high-intensity areas, there are regional community relations officers, who, according to the website,</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/40" class="indent">&quot;act as the focal point for military low flying issues in their respective areas.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/41">Can we not extend the community relations officers? Can we not have them in other parts of the country?</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/42">On the coroner's recommendations, I reiterate all <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/730" name="John Bercow">the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow)</phrase>, who raised this matter in an Adjournment debate last week, about reducing the area for low flying. I do not insist or ask that we should go back to the pre-1979 situation. I know the arguments about that and I have received a letter from the Minister dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March</phrase>, but surely there must be a way of avoiding smaller towns and villages. There are arguments about increased use of simulators, which I would have thought was possible, and about improved technology vis-&agrave;-vis tracking devices, which I know Air Commodore Garwood called a &quot;very, very good idea&quot; at the inquest. I echo my hon. Friend's support for the coroner's recommendations on avoidance notices, specifically in the Market Rasen area. I would have thought that it was perfectly possible for the RAF to avoid flying over stables, which are fixed buildings, so those involved know where they are.</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/43">The coroner said that his task at the inquest</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/44" class="indent">&quot;would have been made very much easier if the cockpit voice recorder had been operational&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/45">He therefore recommended that in future such recorders should remain operational. He commented that as health and usage monitoring systems&mdash;HUMS&mdash;which constantly monitor the condition of aircraft, like a constantly updated MOT, can record data for up to eight hours, they should be left on. That must be possible, as is the norm with civilian aircraft. The coroner suggested that more information should be coming out of the cockpit, and that is what we want. It could be useful in assisting the RAF police with investigations and to relieve complainants of the burden of attempting to supply the answers to technical questions about height and speed, which they cannot simply answer.</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/46">The coroner's sixth recommendation was that, following the practice applied to fast jets, helicopters involved in low-flying training could be fitted with video equipment so that the whole sortie was recorded on videotape. I agree with his comment that</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/47" class="indent">&quot;if helicopter crews were aware that their flight was being videotaped then it would encourage strict compliance with Flying Regulations.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/48">It would also provide more useful and, importantly,</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/49" class="indent">&quot;immediately available&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/50">evidence. There would then be no need for</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/51" class="indent">&quot;flight reconstruction&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/52">Does the Minister believe that that would be a worthwhile investment?</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/53">The coroner's seventh recommendation in the event of future similar fatalities&mdash;or, one might add, accidents&mdash;was that</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/54" class="indent">&quot;clear procedures need to be established to immediately secure available evidence.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/55">He specified that</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/56" class="indent">&quot;all flight crew should immediately be the subject of alcohol and drug testing&quot;,</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/57">that the impounding of the helicopter should be considered</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/58" class="indent">&quot;at a high level&quot;,</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/59">that no further sorties should be undertaken following such an incident, that the downloading of information should be given the highest priority, should be done by</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/60" class="indent">&quot;a member of the RAF who has considerable experience in such matters&quot;,</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/61">and should take place in the presence of a RAF police officer. The downloaded data should be stored in</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/62" class="indent">&quot;a tamper-proof bag which should be properly labelled&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/63">and</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/64" class="indent">&quot;immediately be placed in a secure place and kept under lock and key with limited access.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/65">I ask the Minister to note the coroner's comment that Sergeant Newton of the RAF police, who investigated the case,</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/66" class="indent">&quot;was not aware that Chinook helicopters had HUMS equipment fitted&quot;,</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/67">and that</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/68" class="indent">&quot;he had received no training about which aircraft had such equipment and relied upon picking up such information by word of mouth&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/69">Another suggestion from the coroner was that inquiries should be made to ascertain whether it would be technically possible for the loadmaster, who sits at the left rear of the aircraft, to</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/70" class="indent">&quot;receive the same audible information as the remainder of the crew&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/71">Finally, I draw the Minister's attention to the coroner's statement that these recommendations</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/72" class="indent">&quot;need to be considered in their totality.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/73">The Minister is aware of the petition launched by the <i>Market Rasen Mail</i>, which I fully support. It endorses the coroner's call for a return to a restricted zone for low-flying training and greater use of simulators. It calls for the lower limit to be raised above 50 ft and for devices to alert people to aircraft in the area, and recommends a recorded message briefing of daily flight plans.</p>
	<p pid=".1882.2/74">With the navigation system used in helicopters and sophisticated altometers, it should be possible to know where a helicopter is and at what height at a particular time, so that complaints can be monitored. I hope the Minister will accept that there is no more time left for words of comfort. He must translate those words into action, so that my constituents may feel that some good has come from the tragic death of Heather Bell. He must take action. The MOD has a reputation for being slow-moving in this and other matters&mdash;witness the debate over the veterans of the Arctic convoy this week. This is an opportunity for the Minister, in his final weeks in the MOD, to make a name for himself and once and for all resolve the issue of low-flying aircraft and helicopters.</p>

	<p pid=".1886.0/1">I join <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1039" name="Edward Leigh">the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh)</phrase> in welcoming the fact that we eventually got to the Adjournment debate after 32 hours. It is a particular pleasure on a Friday evening to be speaking on Thursday evening. That is certainly a first.</p>
	<p pid=".1886.0/2">I thank the hon. Gentleman for his constructive approach to the debate and for the points that he raised in relation to a particularly tragic accident. One cannot begin to imagine the sense of grief and loss suffered over the past 16 months since that tragic accident, and our condolences are extended to Mr. Bell and his family.</p>
	<p pid=".1886.0/3">We must not forget that Alexandra Nixon and Melanie Dodds also lost their lives in similar tragic circumstances, and I extend our condolences to their families, as I did last Friday. I readily understand the strength of feeling shown by the hon. Gentleman's constituents, which has been expressed through him as the constituency Member, and in the petition organised by the <i>Market Rasen Mail.</i> The letter to which he referred summarised, I hope, the action that we have taken so far.</p>
	<p pid=".1886.0/4">The circumstances surrounding Mrs. Bell's death have been sufficiently aired, and I agree that we must learn lessons from this terrible accident. The Louth and Spilsby district coroner conducted an extremely comprehensive inquest into the death, and the Ministry of Defence provided our fullest co-operation, but before I turn to the coroner's recommendations in detail&mdash;as I said I would last Friday&mdash;let me address the individual points that the hon. Gentleman raised.</p>
	<p pid=".1886.0/5">I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman welcomes the provision of a telephone advisory service as a first step to improving communication. However, he made a number of criticisms, which deserve some comment. He pointed out that the information is valid only at the time of the call and does not provide a forecast of forthcoming activity. That is simply because low-level bookings by military aircrew can be made only on the day when they need to undertake such training&mdash;they cannot pre-book training in the UK low-flying system. This approach is born out of the experience that weather, equipment availability and other factors can make earlier booking meaningless, and lead to the public's being given misleading information. The only exception is when we anticipate low-flying activity connected with a specific exercise that needs to be pre-planned&mdash;but even that has to be booked on the day when such activity takes place. Moreover, given the short-notice changes that can be made to planned low-flying training as a result of a number of factors&mdash;that can include additions as well as cancellations&mdash;it would be irresponsible for the system's operators to say anything other than that the information is valid only at the time of the call.</p>
	<p pid=".1886.0/6">The hon. Gentleman expressed disappointment at the fact that the telephone service does not include information on low-flying fast jets or on activity close to our main helicopter-operating bases and training schools. As I said last Friday, we intend to keep all these issues under review, and I hope that the House will regard that as reasonable, given that the phone line has been in operation for just 11 days.</p>
	<p pid=".1886.0/7">It is a fact that a high level of helicopter activity is expected near our main helicopter bases and training schools, which are known as dedicated user areas. We are, of course, extremely grateful to the public for their tolerance in these areas, but it is not practical to provide information about the number of helicopter movements there. However, the bases in question all have points of contact for the public, should they have any particular issues to discuss.</p>
	<p pid=".1886.0/8">We have never sought to mislead anyone about the service offered. We have made it clear that at present we are unable to provide anything other than a broad indication of planned low-flying helicopter activity. The information that we are providing has not previously been available to the public, and it does indicate the expected level of low-flying helicopter activity.</p>
	<p pid=".1886.0/9">I now want briefly to respond to some of the hon. Gentleman's other points. The information available on our website on low-flying activity is not buried, as he suggested. Indeed, a simple search for &quot;low flying&quot; on the internet provides a prompt and direct link to the MOD website; in fact, it is the first search result. Nor do I accept his view that navigating the website is an issue. For example, details on the new telephone service feature on our home page, with a link leading straight to the relevant low-flying information pages. I was also a little puzzled by his saying that information on the tactical training areas was out of date. As he said, that information was updated on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-01">1 March</phrase>, but it should be noted that it related to both February and March. Indeed, it has always been our practice to make available information on both the preceding month and the month ahead.</p>
	<p pid=".1886.0/10">The hon. Gentleman is right to say that 23 complaints were logged in the Middle Rasen area in the 18 months before Mrs Bell's death, but that should be seen against the background of the near presence of four major RAF flying stations. He is correct in saying that the number of complaints across the county has risen, but of course that might reflect an increased awareness of such activity.</p>
	<p pid=".1886.0/11">It is, regrettably, true that, on occasion, avoidance areas are intruded into by military aircraft. The hon. Gentleman made reference to a number of specific complaints. All such incidents are subject to full investigation by the defence flying complaints investigation team. However, I am surprised that his constituents find those investigations intimidating. The feedback that we receive is generally favourable. Complainants are pleased that their reports are being taken seriously. The investigators merely seek to clarify the reported facts as far as possible and only ask for estimates of height and speed.</p>
	<p pid=".1886.0/12">The hon. Gentleman referred to three &quot;high-intensity areas&quot; as having regional community relations officers. Those posts were established because of the amount of activity seen in areas where there is no RAF presence to give a natural point of contact. Given that there are two major flying establishments, each with their own community relations staff, within 15 miles of Market Rasen, that scarcely applies to Lincolnshire.</p>
	<p pid=".1886.0/13">I want now to deal with the nine recommendations made by the coroner. The first sought a reduction of the area in which low-flying helicopter training takes place in the United Kingdom. That is a complex issue that requires careful consideration, so we have established an MOD working group, composed of representatives of our rotary wing users, to consider very carefully the requirement for helicopter low-flying training. The low-flying system that we have in place today is not too far removed from that in operation before 1979, but to minimise disturbance we have moved away from fixed transit corridors to spread such training flights as equitably as possible across the remaining areas.</p>
	<p pid=".1886.0/14">The second recommendation was that we should increase the use of simulators&mdash;another point made by the hon. Gentleman and by his constituents in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/730" name="John Bercow">their petition. The hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow)</phrase> also made the point last Friday&mdash;he would be deeply disappointed if I did not mention it. I can assure the House that we use simulation as much as we can, and we are finding that the fidelity of the simulation offered to support our more recent equipment purchases is allowing us to make greater use of simulated flight.</p>
	<p pid=".1886.0/15">During the coroner's inquest, comparisons were made between the amount of time spent using simulation in training by civilian pilots and by military aircrew. I understand that one witness stated that over 90 per cent. of training in the civilian context takes place in simulation. Let me make this simple point: current operations such as those in Iraq and Afghanistan, as I said last week, have highlighted the requirement for military helicopters to fly at very low levels in hostile environments, sometimes operating in poor weather conditions, flying under pylon wires, and operating in the face of enemy fire. That, I think the House will accept, is a rather different requirement than that for a commercial pilot.</p>
	<p pid=".1886.0/16">Another point raised in the petition was the height of low-level helicopter training. By the nature of their operations, military helicopters need to fly as low to the ground as possible. In some cases they are authorised to fly as low as 50 ft or even down to ground level if required for specific training events. However, only the minimum amount of flights at these very low levels take place, for very obvious reasons. Raising the height of those training sorties quickly reduces the training value for the aircrew.</p>
	<p pid=".1886.0/17">The third recommendation was for us to improve our communication about our low-flying activities. We accept that that is a valid point, and we are looking at a range of measures to improve the flow of information to the public. I dealt with that in some detail earlier. The hon. Gentleman made a point about the opening hours of the phone line, and I can confirm that we intend to extend them to 8 pm during the summer months.</p>
	<p pid=".1886.0/18">The fourth recommendation asked us to consider the utility of improved technology to assist aircrew in locating horse riders. The working group is considering those aspects very carefully and will take into account the technical, cost and practical implications of the use of such devices.</p>
	<p pid=".1886.0/19">The fifth recommendation was to increase the duration of voice recording tape in our helicopters. Around a third of the helicopters in Joint Helicopter Command have the facility to record voice data. Those meet Civil Aviation Authority mandated standards for voice recording in line with civilian helicopter accident recorders. The aim of the standard is to provide a voice recording of any events leading up to an aircraft accident, rather than being a permanent record of the entire flight. The voice recorders serve to assist post-aircraft accident investigations as opposed to post-incident investigations.</p>
	<p pid=".1886.0/20">The sixth recommendation was to introduce video cameras into the cockpits. Given that helicopters can have sortie lengths of many hours' duration, the length of the video recording tape would become an issue, as would the endurance of the battery unit. To overcome that, there would be a requirement to &quot;hard wire&quot; the camera into the on-board system. That would present other technical issues, requiring Design Authority approval, which is both complex and expensive.</p>
	<p pid=".1886.0/21">During the inquest, criticisms were made about the way in which evidence was secured by the RAF police immediately after the tragic accident involving Mrs. Bell. As the hon. Gentleman pointed out, the coroner's seventh recommendation suggested a number of measures to tighten up our procedures and training of investigators. We accept that there were shortcomings and have since undertaken a complete review of evidence collection procedures, and enhanced training has been put in place. In addition, standardised processes have now been introduced in order to clarify precisely what action should be taken in the event of any serious incidents.</p>
	<p pid=".1886.0/22">In his eighth recommendation, the coroner suggested that the rear left loadmaster of the Chinook crew should receive the radar altitude warning. Currently, the handling pilot, non-handling pilot and rear right hand side crew member of a Chinook receive an audible warning if the aircraft is at risk of descending below its authorised height. We see no operational value in making that warning available to the rear left loadmaster of the Chinook crew. It is the responsibility of the flying crew to ensure that the aircraft maintains appropriate heights throughout a sortie, and we are satisfied that the addition of the warning for the right hand loadmaster is sufficient for those purposes.</p>
	<p pid=".1886.0/23">Finally, the coroner's ninth recommendation asked if we would give consideration to granting an avoidance for low-flying activity for the Market Rasen area&mdash;a point that the hon. Gentleman repeated&mdash;given that a considerable amount of equestrian activity takes place in the area. The House will wish to know that, as a mark of respect to the Bell family, we introduced an avoidance for military helicopters over Middle Rasen, and that that will remain in force for five years, after which it will be reviewed. That reflects, I know, the strength of feeling in the town, and I hope shows how seriously we take these matters.</p>
	<p pid=".1886.0/24">We have been quite open about the action we are taking in relation to the coroner's nine recommendations. We accept that there are lessons to be learned and we are serious about learning them. On completion of the consideration of the recommendations by the Ministry of Defence, which I expect to be concluded by the end of June, I intend to make a further announcement to the House, and I certainly expect that to be before the summer recess commences.</p>
	<p pid=".1886.0/25" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid=".1886.0/26" class="indent">Adjourned accordingly at eight minutes to Eight o'clock.</p>
