<p>Yes, Sir. I deeply regret to state that, according to reports telegraphed by the Governor-General of the Sudan, two Italian aircraft attacked the Sudan Interior Mission Station at Doro in the Upper Nile Province, 55 miles south-west of Kurmuk, at 10.30 a.m. on 23rd August. At least 30 bombs were dropped, and machine-guns were also used. Of the mission staff of five, Dr. and Mrs. Robert Grieve were killed and the Reverend and Mrs. Kenneth Oglesby wounded. All four victims were United States citizens, Miss Walsh, an Australian, escaping unhurt. In addition, a native girl and two boys were wounded. Dr. and Mrs. Grieve are reported to have fallen waving an American flag. The mission station at Doro is isolated far from any kind of military objective, but its location and nature were well known to the Italians, whose attack was clearly deliberate. This is shown by the fact that the Italian Commander at Kurmuk had sent a message earlier in August to the missionaries at Doro and Chali, another

station 35 miles south-south-west of Kurmuk, to report to him with passports. The reply to this message was under consideration by the missionaries when they were shot down in cold blood.</p>

<p>Compensation to Diplomatic and Consular Officers within certain limits can be paid whenever it can be definitely established that their effects have been stolen, destroyed or rendered useless by deterioration.

<p>The Royal Warrant which was issued so recently as June last was the result of a detailed examination of the existing Warrant carried out by the Minister of Pensions in consultation with his statutory Advisory Committee. The Committee was reconstituted for the purpose and was composed of representatives of the British Legion and War Pensions


Committees, together with seven members of this House nominated by the Whips of the three political parties. The Committee's proposals were substantially accepted by the Government, and are embodied in the new Warrant. In the circumstances I see no grounds for appointing a Select Committee.</p>

<p>No stocks of wholemeal flour, beyond ordinary trade stocks, are being carried, for the reason that wholemeal flour deteriorates rapidly in store. Exact figures of the quantity consumed are not available, but the proportion lies between 5 per cent. and 10 per cent. of total output. Wholemeal flour is available at the same price as white flour, and the high consumption of the latter appears to afford sufficient evidence of the public's preference.</p>

<p>Sugar supplies for this country are drawn mainly from Empire sources, and purchases of Cuban sugar have been relatively small. The recent increase in the retail price is due to increases in costs of the raw sugar and of freights, insurance, refining, storage, transport and distribution.</p>

<p>asked the Home Secretary whether he will consider the advisability of authorising commandants of internment camps to give permission on their own responsibility for internees to keep visa appointments at the American and other consulates in London, to pay visits to relatives who are seriously ill, or to receive visits from business associates?</p>

<p>As regards visits to consulates by intending emigrants, a careful scheme has been worked out which will, I hope, avoid delays, and the operation of this scheme would be hindered rather than helped by leaving to each commandant a discretion to make his own arrangements. As regards visits to relatives who are ill, it is occasionally possible to allow a visit under escort if only a short journey is involved, but often these cases are met by releases under Category 18 of the White Paper. Visits to internees must be governed by a general policy, and for this purpose the system of requiring applications to be made to the Home Office must be maintained.</p>

<p>I regret to say that there was some delay and confusion in this matter in the early stages of general internment.

<p>Certainly not. The women who are interned are all in either Category A or B.
