<p>asked the President of the Board of Trade how many new jobs have been created in the Blaydon Employment Exchange area as a direct result of the operation of the Local Employment Act; and to what extent redundancies have been notified to Her Majesty's Government since June, 1958.</p>

<p>Some 400 new jobs are expected to be provided by projects in the Blaydon Employment Exchange area for which assistance has been offered under the Local Employment Acts. I cannot say how many of these have already arisen. In addition, the Board of Trade has decided to build an advance factory in the area which should provide another 100 jobs.<br/>
The Ministry of Labour has been notified of some 800 redundancies in the area since mid-1959. Records for the earlier period have not been retained.</p>

<p>Does not the Minister recognise that we are faced with a serious problem of depopulation as a result of redundancies and that the situation to be faced by school leavers is much worse than at any time since the end of the

war? Cannot the right hon. Gentleman use his powers to see that the provisions of the Local Employment Act are brought fully into effect in order to assist more industries into the area especially when in that area so many jobs have disappeared completely?</p>

<p>No, Sir. I am glad to say that the rate of unemployment in the Barnard Castle group of employment exchange areas was only 2&#x00B7;2 per cent. at the June count.

<p>Will the right hon. Gentleman reconsider this? Is he aware that at the height of the winter 25 per cent. of the males in Middleton-in-Teesdale were unemployed?

<p>I am sure the hon. Gentleman will notice that during the Question Time period I shall be pressed by a number of hon.

<p>Is the Minister aware that there is a remaining part of the site undeveloped and that both the town council and others interested, including his own Scottish controller, have done their very utmost to induce firms to erect a factory or factories on this part of the site?

Gentleman agree that, in this day, the fact that we have failed to build a factory proves conclusively that there is need for direct Government action to provide that factory in order to relieve the high unemployment rate in the district?</p>

<p>Is the Minister aware that a Sunday newspaper has already written a full story about a site selected by the Board of Trade for new industries which it is estimated will employ 12,000 people? Is is not unfair to Members

of Parliament that this information should be available to the newspapers and not to hon. Members concerned? Will the right hon.

<p>asked the President of the Board of Trade, why he will not accept a given rate of migration from any one area of the country as an indication of unemployment in that area, with a view to directing Government assistance towards it.</p>

<p>Is my right hon. Friend aware that migration is an indication of unemployment? Would it be possible for my right hon. Friend to establish how many areas would need to be included if a given rate of migration became a criterion for assistance under the Local Employment Act?</p>

<p>asked the President of the Board of Trade how many jobs have been provided in the areas covered by the Wish wand Carluke Employment Exchanges since the passing of the Local Employment Act, 1960; and what proposals he has for the siting of an industrial estate in this area to provide work.</p>
</speech>

<p>No jobs have yet been provided. I have no proposals for any new industrial estate in this area: our Larkhall estate is only a few miles away and developments there and at Shotts should provide a substantial increase in employment.</p>

<p>Surely the President of the Board of Trade must be perfectly well aware that in the Wishaw and Carluke areas there is a very high rate of unemployment? Surely he must also be aware that the jobs provided at the two small factories at Shotts and Larkhall will do no more than take up a small proportion of the unemployment in the areas? Does not he realise that his Answer proved how clear it is that the new industrial estate for Lanarkshire ought to go to this area or to the area about which my hon.

<p>I recognise the seriousness of the position outlined by the hon. Lady, but we must look at North Lanarkshire as a whole. We have done a great deal.

<p>The right hon. Gentleman must be aware that the number of jobs provided merely replaces the number of jobs lost in the area.

A week ago, during discussion of the business of the House, the hon. Member for Fulham (Mr. M. Stewart) asked me how it was proposed that the debate on the London Government Bill should be handled and when he received the answer which, I think, he expected, he expressed

shock and surprise. I do not believe, however, that anyone feels that there is an alternative course other than to follow paragraph 13 of the original Order.<br/>
We need not argue the party attitudes towards the Bill; they are well known and I dealt with them in January, when the original Motion was moved. One quotation from later in that debate is from the hon. Member for Bermondsey (Mr. Mellish), who with this quotation will have taken his place among the "literature" of Guillotine debates which we quote to each other. The hon. Member said:
<q>I feel strongly about the Bill. I admit that to stop the Bill I would do almost anything short of pulling out a revolver and shooting the Minister of Housing and Local Government."&#x2014;[Official Report, 29th January, 1963; Vol. 670, c. 820.]</q>
On Third Reading, the hon. Member for Bermondsey, speaking from the Front Bench in, perhaps, rather more classical language, reiterated his eternal and undying opposition to the Bill. That is fair enough. It often happens that one side of the House brings in a Measure which the other side opposes.<br/>
The position which now confronts the House is that we have 280 Lords Amendments before us. The alternative to the Measure, on which I propose briefly to speak, would be to try to do what we attempted in 1953 on the Transport Bill, which was the only occasion when a Guillotine has been applied to Lords Amendments. On that occasion, the debate on the Lords Amendments on 21stApril, 1953, went on for 15 hours 55 minutes, which I calculate to have meant an even later rising than the hour of 6.15 in the morning at which the House, or some of us, rose earlier today. Following that 16 hours' debate, the next day there were 9 hours 20 minutes and on the following day 10 hours 20 minutes, make a total of 35&#x00BD; hours. After that the supplementary Guillotine had to be introduced and the real business started. That was for a Bill with 70 Amendments, roughly a quarter of the number before us today.<br/>
If we tried to operate such a system&#x2014;and the hon. Member for Bermondsey and his colleagues made it clear, and I emphasise again perfectly properly, that they would do anything they could to oppose this Bill&#x2014;we would be inviting


the House of Commons to indulge in an exercise which was doomed to end in the tumbrils which the right hon. Member for South Shields (Mr. Ede) said the Bill would do from the first time that he saw it; and he was quite right.<br/>
I have a link with the right hon. Member because we are both members of the Surrey Cricket Club. I think that we should be inviting the House to indulge in a procedure similar to the cricket matches which Yorkshire and Surrey have been playing against each other, when the object has been not to achieve a result but to infuriate players and spectators alike. Therefore, I am sure that the right course was to bring this supplementary Motion before the House, and I am sure that hon. Members understood this when we put forward the original Motion.<br/>
The essential argument on an allocation of time Motion is whether the allocation of time is sufficient and whether the justification for it is made out. No one has to argue any more the general case for a Guillotine, which has been an established part of our custom for fifty years or more. The particular case for a Guillotine always needs arguing. But it is worth pointing out that 20 per cent. of the lime which we have taken in legislation on the Floor of this House has been spent on this Bill, and that is not to mention the 21 Committee sittings upstairs.<br/>
Debate has been very long in another place, and on two occasions their Lordships broke the record for the length of sitting in their House. The House of Lords has no Guillotine and no procedure for the selection of Amendments. They have practically no rules of order. I sometimes wonder what the noble Lord, Lord Morrison of Lambeth, would make of it if he were sitting, not where he is at the moment, but on the other side of the House and had a more direct interest in securing the passage of this Bill. I am sure that he would put forward exactly the same Motion that I am putting forward today.<br/>
It is an old trick, in discussing guillotine Motions, to read a quotation and then, when one is jeered, to point out that it was made by someone on the other side of the House in some previous incarnation. Therefore&#x2014;because I feel in an amiable mood today&#x2014;I warn the House

that this quotation is from Mr. Morrison, as he then was, when he moved an allocation of time Motion before the Committee stage of the Iron and Steel Bill had even started. He was addressing his remarks to Mr. Eden, as he then was, who was leading for the Conservatives, and said, after giving his justification for the Motion:
<q>I should have thought that after a few observations from&#x2026;Mr. Eden, and, no doubt, perfectly proper criticism and protests, the House would unanimously agree to the Motion."&#x2014;[Official Report, 25th November, 1948; Vol. 458, c. 1438.]</q>
I think that he was a little optimistic and probably I am, too, in recalling that precedent of some time ago.<br/>
I feel that, as they study the work which is before us, the attitude of the two parties to the Bill, the length of time which has been spent on it in this House and in another place, and the sad record of what happened in 1953 when, with a much smaller number of Amendments, an attempt was made to talk them through to an end, this Motion is right, and I hope that the House will agree to it.</p>

<p>I shall say only a few words on this Motion because, presumably, since the Government are determined to have their own way, any time that we spend on it will come out of the time that we have to discuss the Amendments. I hope that my hon. Friends will agree that we should not prolong the argument on this Motion, but it would be wrong not to voice our entire disapproval of it and our disagreement with the arguments advanced by the Leader of the House.<br/>
As usual, the right hon. Gentleman produced precedents of previous Guillotines, and said that because we were speedy in passing the Iron and Steel Bill we should be speedy in passing this Bill and the Lords Amendments to it. I commend his attention to the remark made by Matthew Arnold about Carlyle. When somebody said to Matthew Arnold, "Sir, you criticise Carlyle for being dogmatic, but are you not equally dogmatic yourself?", Matthew Arnold replied, "You overlook an important difference. I am dogmatic and right; Carlyle is dogmatic and wrong". That is the difference between


the two sides of the House when guillotine Motions are proposed.<br/>
I could not feel that the Leader of the Houses's membership of the Surrey Cricket Club had any persuasive power, because, if he lets the Bill go through, he will find himself a member of the South-West Greater London Cricket Club. For every three potential cricketers in Surrey at the moment, there will be only one when this Bill has been passed. That should have made the right hon. Gentleman pause.</p>

<p>If the hon. Member looks up Wisden, he will find that his argument is wrong and that county cricket does not take any notice of any alterations which Parliament may make in these matters&#x2014;and very wisely, too.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman says that it is very wise of county cricket not to pay attention. I wish that it were in the power of other people not to pay attention.<br/>
I could not follow the right hon. Gentleman's argument that, because 35 hours were not sufficient to deal with 70 Amendments to the Transport Bill, we should, therefore, allocate only about seven hours to deal with 280 Amendments to this Bill. That seems to me arithmetic of a peculiarly inverted order.<br/>
Let me remind the House of the Government's procedure of haste and brutality over this Bill. The Committee stage here was hastily and unnecessarily guillotined from the start. The result was that we never had the opportunity to discuss properly a great many important subjects, and that cannot be disputed. I mention only one, the question as to whether the new London boroughs should have the right, which any provincial authority of comparable size has, to decide their own method of audit. After bundling the Bill through this House, the Government took it to another place where, in the absence of the guillotine procedure, they</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1963-07-25a.1792.0" colnum="1792" time="">
<p>had to proceed by the brutal method of trying to wear out their Lordships through sheer exhaustion.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1963-07-25a.1792.1" colnum="1792" time="">
<p>I cannot let this occasion pass without paying tribute to the valour and skill of the members of the Opposition in another place. Testimony is given to that when one looks at these Amendments. Over and over again the Government had to accept Amendments pushed on them by the Opposition in another place, some of them Amendments which they had happily demonstrated to their own satisfaction in this House were totally unworkable, unwise and intolerable. The air in another place seemed to produce a change of heart on the Government's part. An Amendment affecting the County of Surrey, about which we shall, no doubt, hear more later in the day, came in that category.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1963-07-25a.1792.2" colnum="1792" time="">
<p>That is why the Government need not have been so suspicious of any attempt by the Opposition to waste time over these Amendments. These Amendments do things to the Bill which we told the Government, when the Bill was here, they would have to do with it sooner or later. On a good many of the Amendments, the only thing we say can is something which memories of childhood upbringing would forbid us to say, the four words, "I told you so".</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1963-07-25a.1792.3" colnum="1792" time="">
<p>There is no ground whatever for apprehension that we would improperly waste time in discussing these Amendments. The guillotine Motion is infected by the general impropriety and un-desirability attaching to the Bill as a whole. It has been propped up bysingularly unimpressive arguments from the Leader of the House and merely completes the record of sordid brutality which has characterised the Government's handling of the whole Bill. I invite the House to reject it.</p>

<p>I beg to move, as an Amendment to the Lords Amendment, in line 3, to leave out "in that behalf".<br/>
There is another Amendment in my name to the Lords Amendment, in the same line, to leave out "by the Minister".<br/>
My Amendment deals with the subsection which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham (Mr. M. Stewart) has said, has been inserted by another place arising out of discussions that we had and points which the Opposition raised, supported, I think, by hon. Members opposite, when the Bill was going through its earlier stages.<br/>
I maintained at that time that if the Minister was telling us, as he was, that the new Greater London boroughs were county boroughs&#x2014;he kept referring to the county borough as the nearest analogy to their nature that he could give&#x2014;they should, wherever possible, have exactly the same rights as county boroughs in the rest of the country&#x2014;that they should not be given rights more akin to metropolitan boroughs, but should, wherever

possible, have rights akin to county boroughs.<br/>
As the Bill was originally drafted, these Greater London boroughs had not the right to obtain a Royal Charter. We now have in this Lords Amendment a provision whereby, if the Minister decided to make application to the Privy Council on behalf of one of the local authorities, such a charter within the provisions of the Act itself, it shall be deemed, as suggested at the time, rather as an extension of, than remaining under, the Royal prerogative. If the Minister makes an application, a local authority may be granted a charter. I am criticising this very different procedure from that which operates for any other borough in the county. The Minister must justify, if he can, why a different procedure should operate.<br/>
To go back to what I was saying earlier, we were suddenly told in the early stages of the Bill that the new London boroughs were akin to county boroughs. Any county borough or, indeed, any borough or urban district council can itself, with the support of the inhabitants, petition the Privy


Council for a Royal charter. I understand that at that stage the Minister makes his submissions and views on the application known to the Privy Council. It would be a rather stupid urban district council, non-county borough or county borough which applied for such a petition without first sounding out the Minister on the matter. Nevertheless, in the rest of the country the smallest urban district council, if it feels it should have county borough status, can take the initiative for an application for a charter.<br/>
But here these boroughs with populations of from 250,000 to 300,000, or more, will not be allowed to do this. They have first of all to try to persuade the Minister, and then the Minister will make application to the Privy Council. This is a comparatively small point, but why are we going out of our way with these large authorities to put them in an inferior position to any urban district council, non-county borough or borough in the country?<br/>
There is a matter of status in this. If these London boroughs are to have the status of county boroughs, they should not be vexed with pettifogging little differences of status like this compared with smaller authorities in other parts of the country. If the Minister is prepared to admit, as apparently he is, because we have this Lords Amendment, that charters can be obtained in appropriate cases, there is no reason why the London boroughs should not be allowed to make application for them in the normal way instead of our instituting a special method of application in their case which is completely different from that of other boroughs in the country.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Islington, North (Mr. Reynolds) has been an ardent campaigner throughout the Bill for equal rights and equal dignity for the new bodies being created from what are now the outer and inner London boroughs.<br/>
The origin of the difference, so far as incorporation of the new boroughs being built out of the inner and outer London boroughs is concerned, really reflects the background of their original

incorporation. The outer London boroughs happen to be so grouped in Schedule I that each group contains a borough which originally had a charter, and, consequently, it is possible that the new boroughs to be created out of those outer London boroughs can each expect to have a charter. The inner London boroughs, on the other hand, all have their origin by way of Statute, and as a charter is really appropriate only to incorporating a body which has never been incorporated before, the fact that they have been incorporated by Statute precluded them, as it seemed to the House at the time, from hoping to receive a charter. That is the origin of the difference from which the Amendment stems.<br/>
It is true that in another place an Amendment was moved to meet this criticism. I hope that the House will welcome its terms. The terms of the Amendment&#x2014;I shall come to the hon. Gentleman's speech in a moment&#x2014;are that if the Minister&#x2014;that is, for the moment, me&#x2014;represents accordingly to the Privy Council, the Privy Council may, if it thinks fit, advise Her Majesty to grant a charter to incorporate all the inhabitants of that borough. If the Privy Council does so advise and if Her Majesty accepts that advice, then the rest of the Amendment lays out what may be included.<br/>
It only remains for me now to assure the House that I intend to make such representations to the Privy Council for the House to be satisfied, I hope, that the Amendment, if accepted, will achieve what I think the House intended&#x2014;that all the boroughs, whether built from the inner London or the outer London components, will qualify for consideration for the same treatment; namely, for charter treatment. It is, of course, not for me or the House to say what the Privy Council may see fit to advise or Her Majesty sees fit to do, but I undertake that, so far as I am concerned, the process shall be initiated by my representation, and equal representation for all the boroughs.<br/>
To come to the point in the hon. Gentleman's speech, it is true that this is a different procedure from that available all over the country to other unincorporated, unchartered bodies. It is true that all


over the country it is open to an authority to petition on behalf of its people that a charter be granted. In such a case the Privy Council normally requires an investigation to occur, and an investigation is carried out normally by the Department closely concerned, which is my Department. Upon the result of that investigation, the Privy Council decides its advice and Her Majesty considers that advice.<br/>
That procedure is inappropriate here for two reasons. First, there is no existing authority to represent the London boroughs. They do not yet exist. They will exist, and at the moment that they exist the job of incorporation will be done, and that having been done will preclude a charter being given later.</p>

<p>This is not a matter of commonsense committee procedure. We are dealing with something which must be considered quite pedantically. There are different procedures in the rest of the country from those in London. The procedure all over the rest of the country provides for a petition being considered by the Privy Council which would then have an investigation to see whether that petition should be granted. That stage is quite unnecessary in this case. There is no need to consider whether a petition should or should not be successful.<br/>
Incorporation has been decided by this House. That is not the same question as whether or not there should be a charter. If there is no charter, then another form of incorporation by Ministerial order is provided as a stop-gap by this Amendment. I hope that the House will agree with the Lords Amendment, because it meets the point desired by the House at an earlier stage. There should be this difference in this case from normal practice in the country.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman has not seriously attempted to answer my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North (Mr. Reynolds). He admitted that what he was doing was pedantic. Indeed, I have never heard such a pedantic argument. We are arguing that the London boroughs should be put into precisely

the same position with regard to getting a charter as any other borough in the country. When we discussed this matter in committee, he raised all kinds of difficulties and objections as to why it could not be done. He said that it would be impossible and incongruous for any London borough to hope to get a charter and that it would not be realistic for it to do so.<br/>
We argued that it was absurd that metropolitan boroughs should not be entitled to get a charter. The gist of our case was that it would produce and perpetuate an absurd difference between the inner London boroughs and the outer London boroughs if the outer boroughs were able to obtain charters while the inner boroughs were deprived of the right. The right hon. Gentleman replied that it could not be done and he resisted our Amendment to that effect.<br/>
In the event, the right hon. Gentleman has been proved entirely wrong. His arguments have been shown to be completely fallacious. If he rereads the speech he made on that occasion, he will see that it is riddled with complete nonsense. Now another place has conceded the basis of our argument, namely, that the metropolitan boroughs should be placed on precisely the same status and equality as regards charters as any of the outer London boroughs.<br/>
We thought that this move was essential because otherwise there would be an invidious difference between the two. The right hon. Gentleman says today that in the case of outer boroughs the Bill has been so drafted that it happens that all of them will have charters already within their boroughs and, therefore, that no question arises. But, in view of that, it is all the more important that the metropolitan boroughs should be on precisely the same footing. There should be no question of any invidious distinctions between the two.</p>

<p>There is, and there will be unless the right hon. Gentleman accepts my hon. Friend's Amendment. The difficulty is that the right hon. Gentleman has not understood the position. He admitted that his arguments for resisting my hon. Friend's Amendment were purely pedantic. They were not only pedantic, but absurd to the point of being nonsensical.</p>

<p>Perhaps, by leave of the House, I may intervene at some length. I think that somehow we have got on to ground which is not soundly based. I will try to get us on to the right ground. The hon. Member for Islington, North (Mr. Reynolds) has achieved the substance of what he wants by my undertaking to make the representations that initiative procedure which will lead to all boroughs, both inner and outer, getting charters if the Privy Council and Her Majesty so decide.<br/>
The hon. Member then asked why his Amendment should not be accepted, for it would bring the London boroughs into line with procedure in the rest of the country. He was not making the point which is being put by the hon. Member for Islington, East (Mr. Fletcher)&#x2014;that there is still a difference between the outer and inner London boroughs. The point that the hon. Member for Islington, North was on was that, where an urban or rural district seeks incorporation as a borough, the procedure is that the local authority may petition. If it does petition, the Privy Council conducts an investigation&#x2014;normally by my Department&#x2014;and as a result the Privy Council and, ultimately, Her Majesty, make a decision.<br/>
I have explained that that procedure would be inappropriate to the inner and outer London boroughs because very few were urban or rural districts and because, where a borough has been an urban or rural district, it is not a new authority which will not exist until a charter is granted. It is commonly agreed that these boroughs are to be incorporated. The ground is, therefore, not a difference of treatment between inner and outer boroughs, but whether there is justification for a difference between all the London boroughs and urban and rural districts throughout the country.</p>

<p>I do not know whether, in that long intervention, the right hon. Gentleman has tried to explain his pedantic argument to the satisfaction of other hon. Members, but he has not explained it satisfactorily to me, so I shall have to pursue the subject. The right hon. Gentleman seems to confuse incorporation with the granting of a charter. The two things are quite different. What my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North (Mr. Reynolds) is saying&#x2014;and I

agree&#x2014;was that any metropolitan borough should be allowed to move of its own volition towards a charter. It is only by giving it that statutory right that we will give it equality with any other borough. That is the point of our argumnt, which we put on Second Reading and in Committee.<br/>
We want the metropolitan boroughs to be in the same position to have, as of right, power to apply to the Privy Council for a charter. The right hon. Gentleman has told us the procedure, how one may or may not get a charter. It may depend on the good will of the Minister of the day. Every metropolitan borough should have the right to decide whether it is to be incorporated under this Measure or any other.<br/>
Is the right hon. Gentleman giving an assurance that, when the Bill becomes law, he will make an application, on behalf of all the metropolitan boroughs which will become incorporated under this Bill, for a royal charter? Is that what he is saying?</p>

<p>It is all very well having an assurance in this House, and by a noble Lord in another place, but we have had so much experience in the last few years of Ministerial assurances being completely disregarded over and over again. That is one of the great complaints about the Government.<br/>
There have been so many assurances by Ministers subsequently repudiated that it is time Parliament and the country learnt that it is not the duty of hon. Members to rely on the assurances of Conservative Ministers, but that they must seek to ensure, when dealing with


matters affecting their constituents&#x2014;both in the metropolitan boroughs and elsewhere&#x2014;that the rights they are entitled to are included in Acts of Parliament and do not rely on the unsatisfactory basis of Conservative Ministers' statements.<br/>
My hon. Friends the Member for Fulham (Mr. M. Stewart) and Bermondsey (Mr. Mellish), who have had great experience in this matter, know that over and over again they have had to rely upon Ministerial assurances of various kinds which have later been repudiated. It would be out of order for me to call such instances to mind. It has happened in connection with a number of Measures. The Attorney-General is familiar with an assurance which was given, but later disregarded.<br/>
4.30 p.m.<br/>
I assert as a matter of principle that it is the duty of the House, when something is conceded as a matter of substance, to ensure that it is written into the Act. Amendments should not be resisted on the ground that the House need not bother about putting words into an Act of Parliament because the Minister says that he will do this or a noble Lard in another place says that he will do that. That is not a ground for resisting the Amendment. If there is any sincerity in what the Minister has said, he should accept the Amendment, because then the matter would be crystal clear. We should then know where we were. Then these metropolitan boroughs would have their rights written into an Act of Parliament.</p>

<p>The Minister said that he will make an application for such charters for all the Greater London boroughs. My Amendment would leave it to the boroughs to make the application themselves for such a charter. The Ministers action will mean that he will be asking for charters when it is possible that some members of the boroughs will not wish to have such a charter. In the past a charter has been granted only at the request of the inhabitants of the area. Some of these new boroughs may not wish to have such a charter. As I understand the Minister's assurance, he will apply for charters for all of them. I would rather take that than nothing at all, but it will create the anomaly of a charter perhaps being imposed on people

who have never asked for it and may not want it.</p>

<p>This is contrary to the basis on which applications are made for a Royal charter. We want Parliament to legislate. We must assert as often as we can that Parliament must lay down the law. We must stop this continued invasion and these continued inroads by the Executive into the proper functions of Parliament. We have had instances over and ever again of the Executive trying to arrogate to itself by means of Ministerial assurances and promises matter which should be properly expressed in an Act of Parliament.<br/>
I am getting tired of this, because it is our duty, when legislating on important matters of this kind, to ensure that we legislate properly. When it is conceded that something should be done, and when there is no possible objection to what we are asking for, except a purely pedantic objection, it is not good enough for a Minister to say, "We will do exactly what you want, but we do not want to put it in proper form in an Act of Parliament. We want you to accept my personal assurance as a Minister of the Crown, or an assurance given by a noble Lord in another place, that we will do something".<br/>
This is not good enough. It carries no weight. There is no sanction open to the House if the Minister repudiates his promise. During the tenure of the Conservative Government we have had many illustrations of repudiated promises. It is time that we dug in our heels. Now that the substance of our case has been accepted, after a great deal of reluctance and opposition at earlier stages, we should maintain our position. It should be put into the proper statutory form. We should insist on the Government accepting the Amendment.</p>

<p>It has now been amply proved that discussion on the


Amendment is pedantic. As a pedagogue, I object to anybody else being pedantic. I cannot understand what all the fury is about. Where the inhabitants of a district ask for a charter of incorporation, the demand goes to the Privy Council, which appoints an inspector. He goes along, hears the remarks of the various Government Departments about the way in which the place has been administered hitherto, hears any objections to the proposal, and then recommends either that the charter should be granted or that it should not be granted. The Privy Council usually follows the advice of the inspector, but it is not obliged to do so.<br/>
Each charter is an individual document. I do not understand this mass application for charters to deal with districts that present very difficult problems. A charter granted in the ordinary way appoints a person to act as mayor of the borough until the first meeting of the town council, the election of the mayor, and the appointment of the town clerk and the treasurer. After that he ceases to function and the ordinary procedures of the borough follow. Once the charter has been granted, there is a series of negotiations between the Privy Council and the promoters of the application concerning what shall go into the charter. That varies with the requirements of each district.<br/>
Will the Minister give us an assurance that, as from the time when the decision has been made by the Privy Council, there will be local consultation between the Privy Council and the persons interested in the new borough to ensure that they get a charter that meets their requirements? This is the only point that interests me. I was named in the charter which incorporated Epsom and Ewell to act as mayor until the borough treasurer was appointed. I never handled the borough finances myself. That was a transaction between the treasurer of the former district council and the treasurer who was appointed prior to my leaving the chair at the first meeting of the town council.<br/>
Can we have an assurance that the arrangements will be such that consultation between the authorities of the new area and the Privy Council will take place so that the charter can deal with the

requirements of the new borough and not be merely a mass-produced document that might have very little relevance to some of the requirements of the new borough when it comes into being?<br/>
This is one of the things that we inherited from the old metropolitan vestries which were abolished by the Act which created the metropolitan borough councils. As Lord Morrison of Lambeth once said, they were glorified parish councils. We must ensure that from the beginning these boroughs will have an individual life of their own with a charter that is adapted to their individual needs.</p>

<p>The Minister sits and laughs, as if to say "You are a lot of stupid fellows. I have given you an assurance. What more do you want?" My hon. Friends the Members for Islington, East (Mr. Fletcher) and Islington, North (Mr. Reynolds) have raised an important point of principle. We are asked not to proceed with the Amendment moved by my hon. Friend because the Minister has given an anssurance, and because a noble Lord in another place has given a similar assurance on this matter. This Bill will shortly become an Act and become part of the law. There is nothing in the Bill to show that the Minister has given this assurance, and I therefore do not see how it can be said that we need not worry about making this Amendment.<br/>
This is a simple matter. It is the right of the inhabitants of a locality, through their elected representatives, to apply for a charter. They may or may not apply for one, but the decision should be left to them. If they apply, the application will be considered, a report will be issued, and following that a charter will be granted. Why should the Minister have the right to prevent people making this decision for themselves, and be entitled to say to us, "Do not worry about it. Never mind what they want. I undertake to make a mass application on behalf of these people"? This, on the face of it, appears to be constitutionally wrong, and I think that we should assert the importance of this constitutional principle.</p>

<p>I share the surprise expressed by other speakers from this side of the House that


the Minister cannot accept this modest Amendment. Having accepted the principle of the Lords Amendment&#x2014;which I consider to be an important one and I am pleased the Minister has accepted it&#x2014;not to accept this small Amendment is like straining at the gnat after having swallowed the camel.<br/>
When this matter was discussed on a previous occasion, we had a long debate about the Royal prerogative and how it was possible to apply for the charters. We have opened the door to the extent of accepting the Lords Amendment. If the purpose of the Bill is to bring local government closer to the people, which the Government claim it is, so that the citizens of the various boroughs can feel that they are joining in in taking decisions, this Amendment seems a logical step to take. If people in the locality feel that they are not only enjoying the privilege of having a charter, but that they participated in getting it and in helping to decide its provisions, they will feel that they have achieved something.<br/>
I do not distrust the Minister on this issue, though I distrust him on many others. The assurance that he has given appear to mean that he genuinely wants to achieve the same result as we do. If this is so, why not accept the Amendment to the Lords Amendment?</p>

<p>I am sure that the Minister must realise that there are all sorts of dangers in monkeying about with London's local government. Lord Morrison of Lambeth has often warned both the Government and his own party to be careful when they start monkeying about with local government.<br/>
A lot of confusion appears to have been caused by this modest Amendment. My hon. Friend the Member for Islington, East (Mr. Fletcher) referred to the whole thing as pedantic.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1963-07-25a.1809.2" hansard_membership_id="4492" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29295" speakername="Mr. Fletcher" colnum="1809" time="">

<p>The Minister declares that the whole matter is pedantic, whereas, in fact, it is an attempt by the Government to get out of a practical difficulty. We pressed this on an earlier occasion, as a result of which the Government were obliged to try to find a solution to the

problem when the Bill was considered in another place, and the Lords Amendment is the result of that consideration.<br/>
My right hon. Friend the Member for South Shields (Mr. Ede) asked the Minister whether he would give an assurance that when this matter went to the Privy Council, the Privy Council would take a certain course. Is it within the competence of a Minister to give that assurance? Is it possible for the Minister to assure my right hon. Friend that the Privy Council will act in a certain way in respect of a certain matter? I should hardly have thought so.<br/>
The Minister has brought this danger on himself by the wholesale way in which he is attempting to recast local government in this country. He is in danger of bringing the idea of a Royal charter into disrepute. The essence of a Royal charter is that it gives prestige and dignity to the area which receives it. It enhances the behaviour and the performance of the people in the locality.<br/>
The Minister says that he will make 32 Royal charters as soon as the Bill becomes an Act. He is going to roll out 32 charters at once without considering the circumstances of each locality, without considering the dignity and opinions of the local burgesses, and without taking into consideration the wishes of the local inhabitants. To get himself out of a practical difficulty the Minister is to make 32 Royal charters at one fell swoop. I might almost say that he is cocking a snook at the Royal prerogative.<br/>
The Minister should not do this kind of thing. He should not take on himself the assumption to instruct the Privy Council, which is what he is doing. He should not take on himself the assumption to turn out 32 Royal charters without some regard to the Head of State.</p>

<p>I do not want to let the hon. Gentleman continue. All that I am undertaking to do is to make representations. I cannot make charters. How could I dream of assuming to do anything like that?</p>

<p>The Minister knows that he is in a difficulty. He knows that he has to treat these 32 boroughs on the same footing. He cannot complete the new arrangement with some boroughs being incorporated by a Royal charter,


and others being incorporated by Statute. Therefore, to get himself out of his difficulty he proposes to grant Royal charters to them all, and he proposes to make representations to the Privy Council.<br/>
What he is saying to the House is, "It is all right; I shall fix it with the Privy Council, and with the Head of State". By using this method to get round his difficulty the Minister is lowering the dignity which we have always considered attached to the granting of a Royal charter, and which we have always considered should be applied for by the citizens of the locality in question.</p>

<p>If the debate continues in this way I shall find myself in the surprising position of being rather in sympathy with the Minister. He seems to be in the position of somebody who has endeavoured to give a large, friendly-looking dog a pat on the head and been savagely bitten. The reason that this has happened is that within the framework of the Bill nothing which the Minister can do can be right. Londoners do not want these boroughs. It would not be in order, in this discussion, to raise the general issue of the Bill, but nothing that my hon. Friends say today must be taken as in any way prejudicing or mitigating our total opposition to the Bill.<br/>
We are carrying on the discussion on the assumption that the Bill will become law, and asking ourselves, "What, on that unhappy assumption, is the best way of handling the matters that arise?". I think that I shall carry my hon. Friends with me when I say, first, that, ideally, all we want in this matter is that every London borough should have the right to apply, on its own behalf and not through the Minister, for a charter, as a provincial body can do. Secondly, we want, also, to be sure that if it applies for a charter it shall get one.<br/>
Thirdly, we want to be certain that the charter shall not be one of a series of mass-produced documents, but shall have regard to the particular needs and dignity of each borough. Fourthly, I suppose, we want to be assured that if a borough does not want a charter it will not have one thrust upon it against its will.<br/>
Let us see what way there is of obtaining those four requirements.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1963-07-25a.1812.0" hansard_membership_id="979" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/12111" speakername="Mr. John Barter" colnum="1812" time="">
<p>As I understood the earlier argument of hon. Members opposite, it was that all these boroughs must be treated alike. Assuming that some of the new London boroughs desire a charter and some do not, how can they all be treated alike?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1963-07-25a.1812.1" hansard_membership_id="12514" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30987" speakername="Mr. Stewart" colnum="1812" time="">
<p>They can be treated alike in the sense that they can all have an equal opportunity of applying and an equal certainty of getting a charter if they want one. They can be equal in being able to get what they want.<br/>
The Minister has told us&#x2014;and we must accept his advice&#x2014;that the first requirement is something which, quite genuinely, with the best will in the world, cannot be met. These boroughs cannot, like provincial urban or rural district councils, by their own motion and not through the Minister, apply for a charter, the difficulty being partly that some of them are already corporate bodies, and that being given a charter is a way of becoming incorporated.<br/>
It is not the only way, but it is a way. If one is incorporated in one way already, it is difficult, if not impossible, to apply for a charter. Therefore, the possibility of obtaining a charter in the same way as a provincial body obtains it seems to be ruled out. We must reluctantly accept that.<br/>
But of the four demands, that is the least important. We should be willing to accept a proposition that if a borough cannot obtain a charter in a way that is absolutely an outward sign of the dignity and independence which a provincial body has, we should arrange for it to obtain the charter by some other legal means.<br/>
The next proposition was that a borough can be sure that it will obtain a charter if the Minister applies on its behalf. What the Minister has given us is his assurance that he will make the necessary representations. I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North (Mr. Reynolds) will agree that if the Amendment were carried the boroughs would have no greater certainty of obtaining charters than they have under the Lords Amendment. They would have offered to them a different way of applying for a charter, but no greater certainty of getting it.</p>

<p>Is that entirely right? All that the Minister can do is to give


us an assurance that he will apply for a charter. He cannot possibly give us an assurance that the Crown will grant a charter. While he may attempt to abstract the rights of Parliament he cannot attempt to derogate the powers of Her Majesty.<br/>
That would be more than even the Minister would attempt. Therefore, we must envisage circumstances in which, although the Minister applies for a charter, the charter is refused by the Privy Council. In those circumstances, unless the Amendment to the Lords Amendment is accepted, the borough concerned will not be able to make further representations to Her Majesty&#x2014;which I think that it should be allowed to do.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1963-07-25a.1813.0" hansard_membership_id="12514" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30987" speakername="Mr. Stewart" colnum="1813" time="">
<p>If the Amendment to the Lords Amendment were carried a borough could make representation&#x2014;unless it proves to be the case that there is a completely legal bar in the case of a body which is already incorporated. There is that risk. Secondly, a borough would run the risk that even if it made representations it would not be granted a charter. It could fairly be argued that although the Minister cannot bind the Privy Council or the Crown there is a much better chance of a borough getting a charter under the Lords Amendment as it stands, for the reason that we generally accept the doctrine of Cabinet responsibility as being part of our Constitution&#x2014;although it is nowhere written down in a Statute.<br/>
We would probably all agree that when a Minister, as a Member of the Government, says that he will make representations for a charter, he does not say that without having the consent of his Cabinet colleagues. It seems to me to be extremely likely&#x2014;to put it no lower&#x2014;that if representations were made to the Privy Council the Council would see fit to advise Her Majesty to accede to those representations. It would, therefore, seem to me that on the question of the prospect of obtaining a charter, the boroughs are better off under the Lords Amendment, unamended. I agree that the Minister cannot do more than make representations.<br/>
The next point&#x2014;and this is one that the Minister has not quite cleared up; it has arisen out of the debate, and is of importance&#x2014;is that the charters should not be mass-produced documents,

but should pay regard to the dignity, history and circumstances of each borough. I hope that the Minister can give us an assurance about that.<br/>
Fourthly, there is the rather paradoxical point&#x2014;and we are indebted to my hon. Friends for bringing it out during the debate&#x2014;that there may be a borough which says, "We do not want a charter". I assume that the Minister's undertaking was made on the assumption that they would not all want charters, and that he would not insist on making representations on behalf of a borough that firmly said that it did not want one.<br/>
Although the first point is not secured, and cannot be, if we can have assurances that boroughs will have as good a chance of getting a charter as we can hope to give them&#x2014;and, speaking unpedantically, I have not the smallest doubt that they will get them&#x2014;and also assurances on my other points, namely, that charters will not be imposed upon boroughs that do not want them, and that there will not be a mass production of charters without regard to the circumstances of individual boroughs, I think that myhon. Friends could allow the Lords Amendment to pass.</p>

<p>With the permission of the House, I shall try to answer the points which have been raised. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Fulham (Mr. M. Stewart) for&#x2014;on this occasion&#x2014;his friendly protection from his hon. Friends. The hon. Member for Islington, East (Mr. Fletcher) was determined to be angry with me, but all I was trying to do was to carry out the undertaking that I gave when his side of the House demonstrated, in our earliest debate on the Bill, that it wanted both inner and outer London boroughs to be treated in the same way.<br/>
I then explained&#x2014;and this is where I referred to my pedantry&#x2014;a number of legal obstacles, or apparent legal obstacles. I explained these fully, the House demonstrated that it wanted me to try to overcome them, and I gave an undertaking that I would try to do so. For the record, it is right that I should pay tribute to the efforts of the officials of the Privy Council and the Palace, and to the service and co-operation of my noble Friend the Lord President of the Council, in enabling me to ask, at an earlier stage, that my


noble Friend should put this Amendment on the Notice Paper. There was a good deal of discussion to enable this to be brought about.<br/>
5.0 p.m.<br/>
There are, however, a number of questions which I still need to answer. The most important is perhaps that raised by the right hon. Member for South Shields (Mr. Ede). Certainly, this proposal is not meant to be a wholesale transaction. The Bill as originally brought before the House provided that the Minister should make incorporation orders for each borough and then provided that some of these incorporation orders should be by way of charter. It was the distinction between the two which upset hon. Members opposite, understandably. But the Ministerial initiative has been in the Bill all the time.<br/>
The hon. Member for Fulham said that ideally he would like a combination of four things, which he precisely set out: each borough would have discretion to apply; there would be an assurance that it would get what it wanted; what it wanted would be carefully tailored to its needs; and in no case would incorporation be thrust upon it against its wishes. If that is what he wanted, he should have put down an Amendment. He did not do so.<br/>
I come back to the point of substance. It is essential to either operation&#x2014;that originally in the Bill or that which would result if we accepted the Amendment&#x2014;that the Minister, as soon as the Bill becomes law, should consult the London boroughs to know what they want. There are a number of things which I shall need to know, among which will be their names. I certainly undertake to consult them with a view to seeing which special provisions they would like ideally to see in any charter granted to them, and to consult them about any provision at present in their document of incorporation, be it a charter or not, which they would ideally wish to retain. I would pass on the results of such consultation. If I discovered that one London borough desperately did not want a charter, I would pass on that information, too, and I cannot imagine that a charter would be thrust upon it.<br/>
I think that those are the main points except, as the hon. Member for Fulham stressed, that a Minister cannot guarantee what the Privy Council will recommend or what Her Majesty will decide. All we are discussing are the preliminaries to that consideration.</p>

It meets a point which was made in Standing Committee by the hon. Member for Orpington (Mr. Lubbock) and supported strongly by my right hon. Friend the Member for Reigate (Sir J. Vaughan-Morgan) and my hon. Friend the Member for Putney (Sir H. Linstead). The idea was that on the periphery of Greater London it should be open to a certain number of electors to initiate the process by which a change of an area might be considered in order to move that area from a London borough and Greater London to a non-London authority or <i>vice versa.</i> The Amendment allows this to happen under certain conditions&#x2014;namely, that an application should be made by 300 or 10 per cent. of the local government electors residing in the area, whichever should be the greater.<br/>
I see that the hon. Lady the Member for Wood Green (Mrs. Butler) is in her place, and I remember that she was keen enough to watch during the whole proceedings and to agree with me at the stage at which I advised the Committee against accepting the Amendment. But on further reflection I think that it is sensible to allow this procedure for the consideration of a possible transfer of a small area during the first five years of the new arrangement set in hand by the

Bill. I hope that the House agrees that it is acceptable.</p>

This will cause great satisfaction particularly in Knockholt, which was the purpose of the Amendment by the hon. Member for Orpington (Mr. Lubbock). I am sure that he is extremely sorry that for obviously good reasons he is not able to be here to thank the Minister in person. But I know the area well; it was once in my constituency.

<p>I beg to move, That this House both agree with the Lords in the said Amendment.<br/>
The purpose of this Amendment is to set out explicitly some of the matters to which the G.L.C. must have regard in carrying out the traffic duty laid on it by Clause 9(2) and to remind the Council, if that should be necessary, to have regard to other relevant matters. At an earlier stage, my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, South (Sir H. Lucas-Tooth) referred to doubts about the original phraseology. He thought that it might prevent the G.L.C. from taking into consideration anything except traffic matters. He was afraid that this might override all other considerations. My hon. Friend the then Parliamentary Secretary ex-

plained that these fears were groundless and that if one set of considerations were specified there was no reason why all sorts of considerations which the G.L.C. ought to have in mind should not also be specified. I think this explanation partially satisfied the Committee.<br/>
The matter was not pressed to a Division, but the point was raised again in another place. Although, as my predecessor explained, there was no logical reason to amend the subsection, the Government recognised that there was something to be said for making quite clear that the G.L.C. will be required to consider amenity and other non-traffic matters in every case. Probably in many cases amenity is the most important, but it would be wrong to specify amenity and exclude all the others. The G.L.C. must have regard to the maintenance of reasonable access, the effect on amenities and the general reference to any other matters appearing to be relevant.<br/>
In requiring the Council to have "due" regard what is meant is that the Council must have neither too much nor too little regard to each. There must be no priority. The Council must take into account all aspects of the case and try to strike a fair balance. It is this striking of a balance between conflicting interests, traffic, amenity, whatever they may be, and weighing one against another, which amounts to having "due" regard to the matters concerned. I hope that with this explanation the House may feel disposed to accept the Amendment.</p>

We have had a change of Parliamentary Secretary and all sorts of things have happened since then.<br/>
The important part of this Amendment is the reference to amenity. Those concerned with traffic matters felt that there


is often an attitude of mind that in order to get traffic moving faster and more smoothly amenity can be ignored. It appeared that sometimes the public point of view was almost disregarded. Although it may sometimes be difficult for the Ministry of Transport to execute some of its plans, nevertheless this provision is necessary from a public point of view and I welcome the suggested words.</p>

This Amendment to Clause 9(2) restricts the Minister in the use of his reserve powers. He will be able to exercise those powers only when it seems to him that the Council is not satisfactorily carrying out its duty laid upon it by Clause 9(2) and that it is necessary for him to intervene to ensure that the Council complies with that duty.<br/>
This matter was discussed very fully in the earlier stages of the Bill. In Committee my hon. Friend the then Parliamentary Secretary introduced an Amendment to try to meet the difficulty of hon. Members opposite. That Amendment was couched in strict legal terms and was in consequence found to be rather difficult to understand. The Government gave the matter further thought and introduced this additional Amendment in another place. I hope that it will remove the doubts of hon. Members opposite expressed at earlier stages and make it absolutely clear that the Minister's reserve powers really are reserve and are strictly for use in the last resort only.</p>

<p>I think that the only people who can have objection to this Amendment are the lawyers. The previous Amendment to which reference has been made was undertood by no one. We were seriously worried that the Minister of Transport would be taking

reserve powers of enormous magnitude. A large regional body was being created and we quarrelled about this with the Government. It would be out of order to go into all that now, but, even with the regional body as large as it is to be, the Minister was to have powers which could hamper Greater London Council from doing a first-class job. The proposed arrangement meets the point we had in mind. It adds up to the fact that the reserve powers given to the Minister can be used only in extreme circumstances. For that reason, we welcome the Amendment.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment.<br/>
As the House will realise, my right hon. Friend the Minister of Transport and his predecessors have had since 1924 responsibility for London traffic. I do not think, therefore, it was surprising that in the Bill as originally drafted we wanted to make absolutely certain that the Greater London Council would take the mounting and intensifying traffic problems of the Greater London Area with due seriousness. For that reason the Government introduced into the Bill the requirement for Greater London Council to have, as a chief officer, a director of traffic.<br/>
More and more as we discussed the Bill it became apparent that by this special requirement of an individual chief officer, the freedom and the responsibility of the Greater London Council was being invaded and that, possibly, its chief officer arrangements might be distorted and frozen. The purpose of the Government in stressing the importance of somebody very responsible taking charge of London's traffic was acknowledged on both sides of the House. But the Government later decided that the right thing to do was to leave the job of deciding exactly how to tackle this responsibility to the Greater


London Council, and the House will see now that the Amendment which was accepted in another place and which we are now considering simply requires that the Greater London Council shall, before 1st April, 1965, consult with my right hon. Friend about the arrangements it proposes to make for the discharge of its traffic functions.<br/>
I think, therefore, that we are accepting the substance of what we all agree to be important while freeing the Greater London Council to take any action it thinks necessary to meet the need. But there is another reason also, I feel, for rejoicing that we have now changed the arrangement and removed our previous requirement of a nominated chief officer, namely, the director of traffic, because the nomination of that officer led to a whole lot of other professions requesting that their representative also should be nominated either on the Council or the London borough.<br/>
Here I should, perhaps, take the opportunity to explain that while wishing to leave full responsibility to the new London authorities as to chief officers, town clerks and treasurers, and, indeed, one or two others, and as to how they should make their arrangements, I recommended to the Committee, and the Committee accepted, that in the case of the London boroughs there should be a chief architect as a chief officer. I explained that this was not only because I saw that development was going to be such a major job of the boroughs but, unlike other functions, the design and layout of architecture was not a political matter which could be brought forcefully to the attention of the boroughs which would not give it enough status. Therefore, I thought that an exception should be made and that the London boroughs should be urged to recognise the importance of quality in all the developments they did by having a chief architect. But this, of course, led to further troubles and several other professions felt that their claims had been overlooked. Indeed, many other professions will have an important, an extremely important, part to play in the work of the London boroughs.<br/>
Many London borough councils will be faced with pressing problems of urban redevelopment. Some will acquire large responsibilities for estate management. It

goes almost without saying that where boroughs have these problems their councils should, from the outset, give careful thought to the form of organisation which they will need in order to cope satisfactorily with them. But I am confident that the borough councils, in devising their organisations for these purposes, will recognise that a number of professional specialisms need to be brought to bear.<br/>
Fears have been expressed to me on behalf of estate surveyors that they might not be given an appropriate place in the boroughs' organisations. I feel there is no ground for uneasiness on this account. One obvious method of securing that the estate surveyor's distinctive professional contribution is brought to bear effectively in cases where there are large-scale activities of a kind requiring his advice is by establishing a separate professional department, as many county boroughs of a size comparable with the new London boroughs have done. But the form of the organisation must depend on each borough's judgment of the needs of its own area, and that will vary considerably from one borough to another.<br/>
I hope that the House will accept that the arrangement produced is the substance of what we all want.</p>

<p>It is getting monotonous to have to say "We support this.". Let me put this on record. I think that the Government's original intentions were very honourable and understandable. It would be right to envisage, when the traffic problem is looming so large, that there should be the appointment of an individual with knowledge of the subject. But we do not feel it right to put it into the Bill. In fact, the new G.L.C. would be compelled to appoint such a person. It would be right, therefore, that it should consult with the Minister of Transport and discuss with him how best traffic can be controlled. Indeed, the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary will know that there is an enormous survey going on now of London's traffic, costing a vast amount of money. I do not know when it will be completed, but certainly when it is completed there will have to be another look at the matter to see how the whole of these traffic arrangements are to be dealt with.<br/>
To take the point of the Minister about the arrangement of London boroughs, I do not think that we should write into


the Bill anything about what sort of officers they ought to have. Certainly in London a different status is given to different departments. For example, in some London boroughs the borough engineer is written down whereas the housing manager or director is considered to be a much more important person. They give them differenttitles. There is going to be a lot of argument when the new boroughs merge concerning which of their departments are the most important. I can think of some boroughs where they already have very large labour forces and where the housing director comes into the picture in a much greater and more important way than the engineer's side in another borough.<br/>
I am sure, therefore, that the Minister is right here and that we must give the London boroughs freedom to decide for themselves the sort of officers they want. It would be madness for any new Greater London boroughs not to have first-class surveyors and architects. They will be given these greater powers and will need experts. The only doubt we have is from where they will get the staff. I very much hope that the people in the present L.C.C. surveyors and architects department, which, I understand, is running down, will be given the opportunity to carry on the work they are doing for the L.C.C. and will get the chance of jobs with the Greater London boroughs. We need these experts, and if we lose them to local government it will be a great pity. So we support the Minister and think it right that we should not write into the Bill instructions of this kind which are quite unnecessary.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment.<br/>
This Amendment will oblige the G.L.C., before making a traffic order under Clause 10, to consult with the council of the borough in whose area is

the road affected by the order, and the council of any other borough likely to be affected by the order. This matter has been discussed at considerable length both in this House and in another place.<br/>
As the House will be aware, the Government originally saw serious objections to placing the G.L.C. under an inflexible statutory obligation to consult borough councils. In essence, these objections were that such a procedure would be unnecessarily low, undesirably rigid and possibly dangerous, because it would prevent the G.L.C. quickly changing schemes which went wrong and caused traffic difficulties.<br/>
On reflection, however, the Government have concluded that these objections apply to experimental orders made, by virtue of Clause 11, under Section 28 of the Road Traffic Act, 1962, but not to, or not seriously to, "permanent" orders made under Clause 10. It seems to us to be reasonable that before the G.L.C. introduces a scheme "permanently", in so far as any order is permanent, it should, as the Minister does now, ascertain the formal views of the boroughs directly concerned. A "permanent" traffic scheme could affect, over a long period, local amenities, or cause hardship to, say, some shopkeepers or seriously inconvenience residents. We have thought it right, therefore, that the local authorities' formal view about these things should be taken fully into account by the G.L.C. in deciding whether to make a traffic scheme permanent or not. For this reason this Amendment was introduced in another place, and I commend it to the House.</p>

<p>May I come to the defence of the Ministry of Transport, although that is a rare thing for me to do? On looking back over the


years we can recognise why the Ministry took the line which it did in this matter. Frustration of genuine and sincere planning by the Ministry of Transport for purely local and parochial reasons makes it easy to understand why the Ministry took this line. One could quote instance after instance where local authorities did their damnedest to stop a bollard in the centre of the street from being moved because of some sentimental reason, and the Ministry had to be dictatorial.<br/>
In a democracy it is difficult to know where the power of a Minister should start and stop. But it is right that there should be consultation and I hope that the message will go out from this House that we expect the new Greater London boroughs genuinely to co-operate, and to understand that traffic does not travel only in one particular borough but flows into the areas of other boroughs. If we are to get the traffic moving, the borough authorities must understand and appreciate the point of view of other people. It is right that there should be consultation. I wish well for the Greater London Council and hope that we shall get such consultation.</p>

provides that a person who has no interest in the performance of the obligation on an undertaker not to break open a highway within 12 months of the work having been done on it, must have the consent of the Attorney-General before he can take proceedings against an undertaker.

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment.<br/>
The effect of this Amendment is to require a London borough to obtain the consent of the G.L.C. as to the way in which any new road is made to communicate or link with a metropolitan road. This is achieved by applying to the London authorities in respect of metropolitan roads, a requirement similar to that in Section 26 of the Highways Act, 1959, where the consent of the Minister has to be obtained as to the way in which a new road is to communicate with a trunk road.<br/>
In respect of metropolitan roads the Amendment puts the G.L.C. in the same position as the Minister in respect of metropolitan roads. This is right since the construction of an entirely new road linking with a metropolitan road might be expected to affect the traffic pattern on the metropolitan road, so that the G.L.C. should have some say in the matter. Although the desire was expressed in another place to go rather further, the Amendment was welcomed and I trust that it will also be welcomed in this House.</p>

<p>I make a prediction that when the Bill becomes law it will not


be long before an Amendment is necessary to avoid the ridiculous position which will be created because of the division of road responsibilities. Some are in the control of the Greater London boroughs and some in the control of the Greater London Council and the Ministry, and all will be consulting each other to work out a scheme. I think that a great chance has been missed because the G.L.C. has not been given an overall responsibility as it should have been, except in respect of minor roads. I would give the Council all the powers necessary to control all roads and take away from the Minister a lot of his present powers.</p>

<p>The Amendment is quite plain. But perhaps the Minister will give us a little more information about what he has in mind. This covers the whole range of services of the London County Council in the housing sphere. Does he think that he would not need some powers, for example, to lend money, for very long, but he might need general housing powers, provisional housing estates or slum clearance powers for longer?<br/>
The Clause covers all the powers which the L.C.C. possesses and enables the G.L.C. to carry on operating them for a time. We tried to extend the use of those powers to other parts of the Greater London area and also to enable the Greater London Council to keep them for all time. But we understood that there would be a time when the G.L.C. would be divested of them. Now the Minister asks us to accept the divesting of the powers one at a time.<br/>
I see difficulties and I think that there should be a little more explanation of why the Minister wants this power. Has he any idea which powers he is likely to get rid of first and why does he want power to do so area by area?</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman will appreciate that the housing powers comprise those under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act, the Housing Act,


1957, except Part II, the Housing (Financial Provisions) Act, 1958, the House Purchase and Housing Act, 1959, and the Housing Act, 1961. Some of the powers overlap and some could well be dispensed with before others. One has to look at these together with the areas, particularly with regard to some of the housing powers. There are areas where it is obviously foreseeable that slum clearance will be completed long before other areas, unfortunate as that may be. I think that it is sensible that these powers should exist so that once jobs of this sort are completed the final transfer can be made.</p>

proposals submitted to those authorities, jointly with the L.C.C., to the Minister, but left the outer London boroughs with no such obligation.<br/>

<p>beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment.<br/>
This Amendment accepts the substance of an Opposition Amendment moved in another place, or, at any rate, a large part of it. The main difference between this Amendment and the Opposition Amendment is a matter of presentation and drafting rather than of substance. Paragraph 10 of the Opposition Amendment would have substituted the Greater London Council for the L.C.C. in Section 185 of the Housing Act, 1957. This Section enables the L.C.C. or any other council, including the City of London, which is the local authority of the area adjacent to or in the vicinity of, the County of London to enter into agreements for the provision by the L.C.C. of houses outside the county to meet the special needs of the other council or of houses within this area to meet the needs of the L.C.C.<br/>
For the purpose of this Section, the City of London is outside the County of London and the City and County can make agreement with each other for the provision of houses. The Greater London Council will be the authority for the purpose of town development under this Act and will have power to make agreement on town developments which are almost certain to be beyond the green belt.


Building by authorities in the green belt for the benefit of the Greater London Council will be acceptable only in certain conditions, but the L.C.C. has found it useful to make arrangements of this sort for authorities outside its areas, as, for example, Staines. It will make negotiations easier for the Greater London Council to have this power, and the Amendment is designed for that purpose.</p>

<p>This adds slightly to the powers under the Town Development Act, but would it not have been possible for the Greater London Council to use the Town Development Act for this type of development in adjacent district councils? The phrase
<q>rural district council whose area lies outside but adjacent to&#x2026;Greater London</q>
is perfectly clear, but the phrase "or in the vicinity of" does not seem clear. This is used in defining which of the councils may or may not be able to enter into agreement with the other councils mentioned.<br/>
The phrase, "in the vicinity of" might mean any local authority within 10 or 15 miles of the Greater London boundary or anything within four or five miles of the Greater London authority and it seems exceedingly vague.<br/>
The Amendment gives a similar power to the Common Council of the City of London, and I understand that the powers given would enable the Greater London Council to enter into agreements of this kind for building just outside its area either by itself or on behalf of other authorities, or by other authorities on its behalf, and would also enable the Common Council of the City to do so. But that power would not extend to the 32 Greater London boroughs.<br/>
I believe that there was no such power for the 32 Greater London boroughs in the Bill as it left the House to build outside the Greater London area, and I cannot see why it should be necessary for that power to be given to the Common Council of the City of London with a relatively small population. Do we have to give a power of this kind to the smallest of the authorities inside the Greater London area, while we do not give it to the larger authorities which might be able to make greater use of it? In my own view, out-county building should be done by the Greater London Council itself and

not by the boroughs, but I cannot see why the power should be given only to the Common Council.</p>

<p>The purpose of the Amendment is simply to retain existing arrangements by which ordinary housing Act functions can be carried out. However, I do not think that I can improve on the expression "in the vicinity of". This is not a town development type of housing operation for which further provision is made later. It follows an undertaking which I gave in Committee to the hon. Lady the Member for Wood Green (Mrs. Butler). This enables existing arrangements to be carried on in the environs of London, and it is not a departure from what happens at the moment.<br/>
I will communicate with the hon. Member if I am wrong, but I think that this only enables the Common Council of the City of London to make arrangements with the Greater London Council, as it did with the L.C.C., when it is unable to find land within its own boundaries and wishes to have a housing estate outside its own area.</p>

<p>By leave of the House. That is not the answer to my main question. I believe that a power is being given to the Common Council of the City of London which will not be available to the other 32 Greater London boroughs, and I cannot see why the City Corporation and not the others should be given this power. If the City is short of land for the comparatively small population for which it has to provide houses, how much more short is my own Borough of Islington, which has to provide accommodation for the 16,000 people on its housing list? I do not want any of the Greater London boroughs to have this out-county building power, because I believe that it should be concentrated in the hands of the large authority, but why should it be given to the city and apparently not to the Greater London councils?</p>

<p>By leave of the House. I am afraid that I cannot add to the explanation that this continues the


<i>status quo</i> with the substitution of the G.L.C. for the L.C.C. I do not know what the historical origin is, but it was thought that it was right in an Amendment of this sort to preserve the position. If I am wrong, I will certainly write to the hon. Member.</p>

<p>I do not want to prolong the discussion, but the phrase "in the vicinity" ought to be qualified, because it does not mean anything as the Amendment now stands. Why should it not be deleted if it does not mean anything? The Greater London Council may combine with any council outside its area to do these things, but it is obvious that it would not wish to combine with a rural district council in Caithness and Sutherland. However, according to the Parliamentary Secretary's explanation, it is not necessary to place any particular restriction upon the use of these powers. It would be useful if we could get some further clarification.</p>

<p>Can the Parliamentary Secretary say what parallels there are for the use of the words "in the vicinity of" in other Statutes? Presumably, there must be some view of what words like this mean. The Parliamentary Secretary's reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North (Mr. Reynolds), that this power is being included because it continues the <i>status quo,</i> is very odd in this connection. If the Government are to use that argument, they might as well take the Bill away.</p>

<p>I am profoundly dissatisfied with the Parliamentary Secretary's rather half-hearted attempt to answer my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North (Mr. Reynolds). It seems that the Common Council of the City of London is to be given privileges which no other authority inside the Greater London area is to have. That strikes me as a most peculiar state of affairs, because any one who knows the geography of the Greater London area will know that the Common Council area is the smallest although not the poorest, local government area within the large conurbation. I cannot see why the City of London, whose housing needs are inevitably smaller than those of other London boroughs surrounding it, should be provided with these special powers

over and above those given to other local authorities in the area.<br/>
The Clause would read much more easily if the words
<q>but adjacent to or in the vicinity of</q>
were omitted. As the hon. Member for Orpington (Mr. Lubbock) pointed out, the Greater London Council will not enter into complicated arrangements with some local authority in the north of Scotland. It would be to the advantage of all the authorities which might be concerned and we might avoid arguments and misunderstandings if these words were omitted. They seem to be unnecessary.<br/>
Having given the Parliamentary Secretary sufficient time to collect his thoughts on the subject&#x2014;perhaps the Minister himself will come to the rescue of his colleague&#x2014;I hope that the situation can now be clarified.

<p>To refer to something so unparliamentary as a cup of tea, I have returned refreshed to the fray. The procedure is that the Minister keeps himself closely in touch with Amendments of substance as the Bill goes through another place, but this Amendment was introduced to meet an Opposition point and its effect is so relatively trivial that I cannot give examples of what it might achieve. The point was made in another place that the preservation of this existing power, a power limited to the L.C.C. and the City of London, would be a good thing. The Government saw no harm in preserving a power which the Opposition requested, and they therefore agreed to it. This is purely a survival of an existing power which can do no harm and which might conceivably do good. It is far from any overspill powers. I cannot give any more information about what the G.L.C. might do with it when it has it. The words "in the vicinity" come from the 1957 Act, which was a consolidation Act, and are therefore precedented.</p>

<p>If I understood the Minister rightly, this is merely a carry-over of the present position with the L.C.C. into the new set-up. However, the boroughs on the outskirts of the London area, those in Middlesex, and so on, will also be involved, and it seems very wrong that boroughs like mine, when they are reconstituted to form the new Greater London boroughs, should not know the effect on them of this provision. The Minister does not seem to know what the effect will be and they will not know and I am not clear about how this power will work out.</p>

<p>I am very concerned about the Minister's answer. It is absurd for him to say that he does not know what the words "in the vicinity of" mean. It is all very well to refer to another Statute, but we have to look at the words in the Bill. Is Brighton included in the vicinity of the Greater London area? Litigation is founded upon words used in a Statute. The words are there to be argued and I ask the right hon. Gentleman not to leave an untidy expression of this kind in the Bill. I hope that he will clear up the mystery and put in something much more definite.</p>

<p>Is not the point of this much more simple than it seems? The hon. Member for Brixton (Mr. Lipton) suggested that some sort of special privileges were being given to the City Corporation, but as I read the provision that is not so. The Clause would appear to enable the Greater London Council to make arrangements with areas which could accept an inflow of residents, and erect

houses, and so on, for the benefit of the other boroughs which will comprise the Greater London area. It would seem that the City, as well as areas outside Greater London, will be in a position to receive such people and build houses. That would appear to be the object of the Clause.</p>

<p>The presence of the Common Council here results from the fact that it was retained because we were particularly asked to continue this discretion, which was in Section 185 of the 1957 Act. That was put to us in another place. My hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow, East (Mr. J. Harvey) is correct. This power will enable the G.L.C. to enter into a bargain with an authority just outside London. The phrase
<q>&#x2026;but adjacent to or in the vicinity of&#x2026;</q>
refers to authorities close to the London boundary, if not actually on it. This takes account of the G.L.C. using some of the land in an area belonging to another authority and where, in partial or whole repayment, provides some housing for the needs of that authority, subject to such time arrangements as may be made.<br/>
I cannot reveal the exact effect of this. It is not part of our major strategic activities in this direction. It is a continuation of a power to the G.L.C. This is a small technical power compared with the great strategic powers which are the basis of the Bill.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment.<br/>
It was a strong recommendation of the Royal Commission that the G.L.C. and the London boroughs should co-ordinate their arrangements for housing information for Londoners. There are several major defects in the knowledge that the authorities of London, both outer and inner, have about housing need. First, housing applications may be duplicated. Secondly, some boroughs only register applications after residents have lived in the borough for a certain number of years.<br/>
On the first point, that of the duplication effect, this causes the housing lists to be overstated and the housing need to be understated. There are numerous other defects in assessing accurately the housing need and in the Clause as origin ally drafted there were complicated provisions. The boroughs and the G.L.C. should be able to know the necessary information on which to judge what their housing programmes should be.<br/>
In Committee, my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary undertook to take the Clause back and simplify it after having expert consultation. That consultation has taken place, with representatives of the Metropolitan Boroughs Standing Joint Committee, the Association of Municipal Corporations, the Urban District Councils Association and the L.C.C. The Amendment has been accepted by all of those representatives, but not formally by their associations. It is designed to simplify the arrangements for the collection and use of housing information for the G.L.C. and the boroughs.</p>

<p>The Amendment represents a considerable improvement on the Clause as originally drafted. Hon. Members who were unfortunate enough to have been members of the Committee will recall the discussion we had on this aspect on 9th February, when it was pointed out that the Clause as drafted was extremely rigid and that it would involve on the Greater London Council, and on the new London boroughs, a heavy administrative task in relation to the effect necessary to get the requisite information in the form precisely described.<br/>
I recall the undertaking given by the Parliamentary Secretary. Shortly after that a working party was set up to investigate the matter. The result of its efforts, and the Amendment, will enable the picture of housing need for the whole London area to be assessed and it will mean that, as a result of the various parties getting together&#x2014;the G.L.C. and the boroughs&#x2014;there will be a suitable transfer of information over stated periods rather than thousands of individual applications having to be forwarded. The revised formula is a great improvement on the original.<br/>
The new arrangement will be more practical and less complicated to operate and I imagine that it goes some way to meet the recommendation of the Royal Commission in paragraph 797 with regard not only to obtaining accurate information, but to the necessity to see that there is some degree of assessing housing need on a common basis. This has for long been the desire of the Minister's Central Housing Advisory Committee and it seems anomalous that in certain cases one's chance of getting a council house may depend on the prevailing conditions in the borough in which one is living.<br/>
If one is an ex-Service man, or has lived in the borough for a certain length of time, one may be given a number of points on the waiting list denied in another. I hope that not only will common standards be observed but that the practice of closing lists, which has a dispiriting effect on those who are in need of houses, will be discontinued.<br/>
Since the Amendment represents a considerable improvement on the original drafting, and having expressed my gratitude to the Parliamentary Secretary for

discharging his undertaking, I give my support to the Amendment.</p>

As things are at present, with one list from the borough and another from the central authority, it is quite impossible to know those requirements. This Amendment will enable us to make a proper assessment of our Metropolitan housing needs.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in in the said Amendment.<br/>
From my own point of view, the less I say about this Amendment, and the Amendments consequential upon it, the better. We can count on the right hon. Member for South Shields (Mr. Ede) to improve on the occasion. The fact is that the Government still believe that the three northern wards of Epsom are part of a continuous town. Their Lordships took a different decision. As the decision was taken at a late stage in the Bill and was the only breach of the peripheral boundary of London, the Government had to decide whether or not to advise the House to agree with the Lords.<br/>
In coming to their decision, the Government were pressed very hard, as they had been pressed, I must say, for months past by my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General. After weighing the view that he has always expressed that there was a special factor in the case of Epsom that did not apply to other parts of the boundary, the Government still remain of the opinion that the three northern wards are part of the continuous town, but in view of the strong feelings that have been made known,


and the late stage of the Bill, the Government decided, and announced in another place, that they would not seek to reverse that decision. I do not think that it is necessary for me to say more. It would be quite hypocritical for me to seek any credit for what has happened, though I understand that it has given great pleasure in the area.</p>

I heard over the wireless, and I think that I subsequently saw in the Press, that line 37 on this page had been deleted, because it was thought, I understood, improper that Chigwell should be left in what was called "solitary isolation".

<p>The significance and importance of these Amendments and this part of the Bill can only be gauged when we know what the Minister will put in his regulations. We are now passing a very considerable portion of this Measure dealing with important planning provisions, the effect of which we cannot possibly judge until we know what is what in the Minister's regulations. This is another instance of where, in planning, far from giving more power and authority to local authorities, we are giving them to the Minister, who will decide what classes and cases will be dealt with by the Clause. They may include practically everything&#x2014;any type of development&#x2014;or very little. Until we have that information, it is quite impossible for the House or the country to decide on this part of the Bill.

I should have thought that at this stage we could have had some explanation of what it was intended to include and exclude. It would have been helpful if we could have discussed these regulations in the House. I am sorry that the Minister has not got so far as that. I support what my hon. Friend has just said. We are very much in the dark, and we shall have to reserve our judg-

ment on this matter until we know what the Minister intends to do.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment.<br/>
This and the next Amendment in line 18 go together.

<p>I have read the relevant parts of the debate in another place and I must say that I am little wiser than I was. I still do not understand why this matter has to be dealt with in this Clause. I can well understand the provision as to regulations in Clause 82. I know there was a provision in connection with some transferred officers who might be affected by the new arrangements, but I do not understand why the matter has to be dealt with here, or what the effect is. Neither do I understand why "and compensation" is to be left out.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Clapham (Dr. Alan Glyn) is quite right. In answer to the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (Mr. Skeffington), the words "and compensation" are left out frim their present position in line 17 because suitable words are added by the next Amendment at the end of line 18 referring to the compensation provisions brought in under Clause 82.<br/>
We need to put in such a reference to compensation in Clause 24 because in previous subsections arrangements were made for the transfer of functions between various authorities which might lead to the transfer of staff. In other words, this is part of a linked series of Amendments,


ensuring that where any staff is transferred between London authorities they will get the benefit of Clause 82.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment.<br/>
This part of the Bill makes provision for the planning responsibilities within London, but there are a number of other

statutes which refer to planning authorities and it is necessary at some point in this Bill to define exactly what, for the purposes of the other Statutes, the "planning authority" mentioned in those statutes really means, whether it means the London borough or the Greater London Council. This Amendment picks out those other Statutes in which such references are made and defines the planning authority to which reference must be taken to be made when the Bill becomes law.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment.<br/>
This Amendment meets the point made in another place that there is at the moment in the Bill no provision by which


the Greater London Council may be kept in touch with proposals considered by the London boroughs in making their local development plans. The Amendment enables the Greater London Council to be kept in touch with such information as it requires the London boroughs to produce, so that the G.L.C. may know the whole while what the London boroughs are thinking in connection with their development plan work.</p>

<p>We are considerably overjoyed that the Government have at long last seen that there is some force in the point which was repeatedly made in Committee that the planning proposals as envisaged when the Bill was originally introduced would be absolutely chaotic. We said it was farcical that there should be in this London conurbation boroughs making their separate development plans and the Greater London Council making its development plans with practically no means of reconciling or harmonising them except when the Minister intervened. This addition to the Clause will, at any rate, ensure that the essential information is given at an early stage. Furthermore, it ensures that the type of information is given to the Greater London Council which it must have in considering its own plan.<br/>
The only thing that astonishes me is that it has taken all the discussions in Committee and in both Houses before we have been able to get this modest piece of additional power for one of the overall planning authorities in the London area. I am glad to note that the second part of the Amendment enables discussions to go on between the Greater London Council and the boroughs, presumably in order to get agreement so that the matter does not have to be referred to the Minister, which was the position until the Amendment was introduced.<br/>
During our long discussions, the points that we made were not recognised by the Government&#x2014;indeed, they were disputed&#x2014;and we were told that we were raising quite unnecessary complications. We now find in a few casual sentences that the Minister gives us all the points that we were making. I would have respected the Minister more if he had conceded that there was considerable force in our arguments in Committee, and I am sorry that he has not done so.</p>

<p>I express emphatically my agreement with what has just been said by my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington (Mr. Skeffington). It is some comfort to us to realise that it was worth while hammering away at certain points in Standing Committee, even though there was no immediate result. It is always admirable in planning and housing matters when there is a full exchange of information. It is difficult to get judgments on planning and housing right if everyone concerned is not fully informed. If, to give an example, a Ministry has in its possession a document describing housing needs in 1960, it is deplorable and stupid that it should sit on it for a couple of months when it might have been made available to the general public. I am reminded of that by the Clause. Perhaps the Minister will take this opportunity to assure us that such information will be available to hon. Members in the Vote Office or, perhaps, in an agreed form at the earliest opportunity.</p>

<p>It seems to me that at last there will be co-operation between the boroughs and the Greater London Council.

At the risk of causing one or other hon.

This aspect was pressed upon us in Committee.<br/>
If we are to be teased every time we have met a constructive Opposition criticism, it will make us the less willing over the next few years to do it in the inevitable further legislation which we shall put through the House.

<p>Before the trumpet sounds, may I ask the Minister whether he is sure that he is right in making this provision without the consent of the London borough which may be affected?

I say this knowing well that my hon. Friends have pressed for a provision of this kind, but I am concerned that all the Amendments which we have made, including these from another place, are whittling away a little the rights and powers of the new London boroughs, and particularly those in the present county area of Middlesex. They are losing a lot of their powers and I am not happy about this power being given to the G.L.C. without its having to secure the consent of the London borough from which it may be removing the industry.</p>

<p>We do not want particularly to tease the Minister. We only feel that occasionally he might say that the Government were wrong in Committee to resist our arguments. If he were to make that confession he would disarm us and give us the satisfaction of knowing that we were right, as we always knew we were. I felt this particularly strongly concerning the planning Amendments, because unless the Greater London Council knew details of the borough plans at an early stage, the ultimate result was bound to be chaotic. That is why I thought that the Minister might concede the point now he has accepted it in Amendments previously moved.<br/>
The Amendment is limited in operation because it refers only to land of industrial or commercial undertakings. It is an important concession and I am grateful for its insertion in the Bill, even at this stage. I hope my hon. Friend the Member for Wood Green (Mrs. Butler) will not feel too alarmed about it. It is the sort of case that arises when dealing with the removal of industry from a congested area and when opportunity arises for quick negotiation and purchase of the land vacated. The sole reason why we pressed this matter in Committee, and why this concession is worth while and will not harm the interests of the borough concerned, is that if the Greater London Council wishes to obtain the land, it must act quickly. If it had first to go to the borough and get consent arrangements there, or to the Minister, months might pass, in which event the land would not be acquired by the G.L.C for the essential purpose of developing an area and also in connection with overspill.<br/>
I hope, therefore, that my hon. Friend will not feel that the interests of the


borough will be undervalued or in any way prejudiced. This will be a valuable power for the Greater London Council. I only wish that in the other categories of land which we pressed upon the Minister he had been able to give way, too.</p>

That subsection provides for the review, which has been discussed fully, and also empowers the Minister of Education to lay regulations before Parliament. Subsection (6) must be read with subsection (7), because subsection (7) provides for what may be put into any consequent regulations and therefore clearly, in strict drafting, subsection (7) ought to be mentioned or, as the popular Press may say nowadays, named in Clause 30(1,<i>b</i>).

<p>I join my right hon. Friend the Member for South Shields in welcoming this Amendment. The Minister will remember that many of us were worried about the fragmentation of the education service, and, having been defeated on the general principle, we endeavoured in Committee to find various ways of mitigating the mischief being done. At one stage, for example, we suggested that the Minister could require groups of boroughs to submit a joint development plan to him. That was rejected by the Committee, some hon. Members opposite saying that it showed a contempt for the independence of boroughs on our part. Now we have a more modified version of basically the same idea.<br/>
I take it that the phrase
<q>any other local education authority whose area is contiguous with that borough</q>
means the outer London boroughs which are their neighbours and those authorities across the border of Greater London. If I understand it aright, an outer London borough would be required, in preparing a revised development plan, to consult such other outer London boroughs as border on it and, say, the County Council of Surrey or Kent, its neighbour over the Greater London border.

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment.<br/>
It might be convenient to take with this Amendment the two following Amendments, in line 4, leave out from "London" to end of line 5 and insert:
<q>, or in some other local education authority's area which is contiguous with any part of Greater London, but belongs to the area of a local education authority other than the providing authority",</q>
and in line 11, leave out from first "the" to end of line and insert:
<q>authority to whose area the pupil belongs) shall apply notwithstanding that the last-mentioned".</q>
All the Amendments deal with the same point. They are Government Amendments tabled to give effect to an Amendment again moved by the noble Lords Lord Crook and Lord Shepherd in another place.<br/>
These are by far the most important Amendments on educational matters moved in another place, because their effect is to extend the scope of Clause 31(7) to traffic, if I may so put it, into Greater London from the areas of adjoining local authorities. People living in those areas will have the same access to schools in Greater London as people living inside Greater London in one borough grouping or another. The Amendments in lines 4 and 11 alter that part of Clause 31(7) which deals with the recoupment to the education authority of the cost of further education provided for students from outside its area so as to fit in with the widening of the scope of Clause 31(7) by the Amendment in line 1. One could say that the Amendments in lines 4 and 11 were simply consequential on that in line 1.<br/>
As I said on Second Reading, I should not wish the House to be under any misunderstanding about this. The offer of a place will depend on schools not being full and upon such other reasonable conditions as would normally be applied&#x2014;for example, that the school offered a


course suitable for the child in question. The Bill ensures that the local government boundaries do not in themselves constitute an obstacle.<br/>
Although this Amendment is of limited application, I believe that it is an improvement on the Bill as originally drafted. The general principle of excluding residence in a borough area from the reasons which must be taken into account in considering admissions to a school or technical college&#x2014;the fact that we have free trade within the borough grouping&#x2014;was, I think, warmly welcomed in this House and in another place even by some who were against the whole principle of the Bill. I am glad that that principle of free trade and borough boundaries not themselves constituting an obstacle met with no opposition from the local authorities.<br/>
I hope that this aspect of the Bill will be a precedent which will come gradually to apply more and more widely throughout the country, because I believe that the decision about admitting children to maintained schools or colleges made purely on the basis of administrative boundaries can be the most objectionable decision to parents of all the disputed decisions that authorities can make. I say that not as one who has children, let alone children in maintained schools, but as one who over recent years must have answered thousands of letters from hon. Members of all parties, including a great many letters on this subject.<br/>
A slight extension of the area in which this will not be legal is all to the good. I hope that the general principle of free trade which is applicable under the Bill within Greater London will tend to be applied by the Greater London authorities to pupils and students from outside. It is a very good thing that we should have laid this down quite clearly in the Bill.<br/>
I hope that all hon. Members will welcome these Amendments. It may seem ludicrous to say that in present circumstances, but I believe that they enshrine a principle which is not only valuable in the context of this Bill, but which will, I hope, point the way to a number of reforms in our education service in the years ahead.</p>

<p>I want to welcome the Amendment very warmly. Indeed, I

believe that its wider application to the country as a whole would be a great blessing. A good deal of clerical work is performed in county and borough education offices merely to check up on the number of children who cross boundaries to attend school in neighbouring areas.<br/>
I recall the ludicrous position I encountered once when I was engaged in administration. The southern boundary fence of a school in Lingfield, Surrey, was actually the southern boundary of the county and nearly all the children at the school lived in East Sussex. A very careful check was kept on their attendance. A few miles away there was another school situated in East Sussex but mainly attended by Surrey children. At the end of each year we would find that one county or the other had been educating a few more children from its neighbour than <i>vice versa.</i><br/>
It seems entirely ludicrous that we should virtually employ clerks to check up on that kind of thing when public convenience is being met by allowing children to attend schools nearest their homes. I hope that this administrative excrescence on educational expenditure may be increasingly removed if the principle now embedded in the Bill can be made more general.</p>

<p>I welcome this Amendment strongly. This subject has given a great deal of anxiety to parents in London, and I hope that a good deal of publicity will be given to this Amendment. Hon. Members on both sides have been worried about free trade between the boroughs. I hope my right hon. Friend will see that this new provision is widely known throughout London and so allay the worry and suspicion in the minds of the parents.</p>

<p>As the right hon. Gentle man knows, I have a vested interest in this matter, since I have children attending voluntary schools. All parents in my position are probably more concerned than most over this problem. We support the Amendment, of course, but in the County of London this sort of provision has not been necessary in the past. Free trade has always been part and parcel of the education system there and our relations with Surrey and Kent have been very cordial. It is ironical that in this Bill we have to introduce safeguards


to ensure that free trade shall be carried on.<br/>
I have attended a number of meetings at voluntary schools. Putting party politics aside, there has been great concern about diocesan plans for new schools because of the rearrangement of the areas. That has been the biggest worry of all. Many supporters not only of the Labour Party but also of the Conservative Party have described how they dreaded the future as it was proposed under the Bill. Now the right hon. Gentleman is to be congratulated in doing what he can to allay those fears. If education means anything then it means the right of the parent to choose his child's school where practicable and that boundaries should not exist either in the parent's mind or in any other way.</p>

This is a drafting Amendment designed to clarify the intention of subsection (4). If, as a result of the review provided for in this subsection it is found desirable to make any change in the administrative arrangements for the Youth Employment Service in the area of the I.L.E.A., changes will then be made by regulation made by my right hon. Friend the Minister of Labour, subject to Affirmative resolution.<br/>
To make this possible, this subsection gives him power to make regulations relating to education under Clause 30. At the moment subsection (4) refers only to subsection (6) and this could be construed as meaning that the Minister of Labour was to be given only powers specifically referred to in subsection (6) and was not to be empowered to include in the regulations any necessary, "incidential consequential, transitional or supplementary provisions", those being matters referred to in subsection (7).<br/>
If regulations are to be made there must be power to include only transitional or similar provisions. This has always been the intention of the Clause and the purpose of the Amendment is to make it clear beyond doubt that the Minister of Labour is to have the power to make regulations after a review of the powers conferred on the Minister of Education by subsection (7) of Clause 30 as well as those conferred by subsection (6).<br/>
I have dwelt for a minute or two on this Amendment, although it is practically a drafting Amendment, because in


another place the noble Earl who was in charge of the Opposition's case implied that he had not studied the Amendment as closely as he should but that it seemed to be all right. It was then rather late at night and so I thought I should take this chance to explain it.</p>

Now we come back from education and go down to sewerage and trade effluents. This deals with one of the facets of the Greater London Council's responsibility to carry out a survey of the sewers and sewage disposal works. Our main concern is that a council may apply to the Greater London Council to take over a particular sewer or sewage disposed works and there is a procedure for deciding whether the application shall be granted. In view of the G.L.C's responsibility to survey the whole of the sewers and sewage disposal works so as to decide which are the main ones which shall vest in the Council, it seems that the particular survival of the current dispensation is no longer appropriate.

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment.<br/>
This Amendment and the next Amendment are drafting Amendments, but they alter the drafting considerably and perhaps I should explain them. As the Bill is at present drawn, the procedure by which the Greater London Council gradually vests in itself the whole of the

main sewerage and sewage disposal works in its area was seen to be in three stages, starting with an original sewerage area which is defined in Clause 37(8) and growing gradually as the Council decides to vest different parts of the main sewerage and sewage disposal works until it covers the whole of its sewerage area. As it grew, so the Minister was making Regulations to keep pace with it. What the Amendment does is to provide that, instead of going by three stages, the definition of the sewerage area of the Greater London Council will be made throughout by Ministerial order. The work of the Council will depend upon the survey it is making and on its assessment of what is main sewerage.</p>

<p>This seems, on the face of it, to be a sensible Amendment. I know part of the background to this. It is clear that the area ought to be defined by the Minister, because, as we said in our discussions elsewhere, this is an extraordinarily complicated system. It has grown up over many years. That is why I attach considerable importance to subsection (3), which means that those who are developing or buying property will have access to maps and documents showing where the sewers are. This is not much of a problem in some towns, but in the London area it is a very important one. I assume that the expression that the
<q>map or other document shall be open to inspection by members of the public</q>
means during normal office hours. I did not table an Amendment, because I assumed that that is what it means. We have known cases where the public go on Saturday mornings because some part of the council's offices are open but find that they cannot have access to the information. No doubt this could be dealt with by an announcement, or indeed by the Minister's favourite device&#x2014;regulations.</p>

Lady will assure us that there will be an opportunity for both the new boroughs and the Greater London Council to make contributions for voluntary organisations, and that this will not preclude them from undertaking any of the other responsibilities that fall on them in other parts of the Bill. I hope that there will be some attempt to ensure that there is greater co-operation in dealing with the difficult problems which are being hammered out between the various bodies responsible for the provision of these services.</p>

<p>I am a little puzzled by the hon. Lady's speech when she moved the Amendment. I think she referred to Clause 50. My hon. Friends were speaking&#x2014;and admirably, too&#x2014;

about voluntary contributions to bodies concerned with child welfare, but I think the hon. Lady was talking about petroleum, a fact which escaped my hon. Friend's notice because they are further away from the hon. Lady than I am. She made a rather rapid speech, and I think that I was the only Member on this side of the House who grasped what she was talking about.<br/>
We are in a little confusion. Mr. Speaker, I think you put the Question, "That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment," that is to say, the Amendment in page 67, line 16, which proposes to add certain words to Clause 47 of the Bill which is concerned with the making of contributions by the Greater London Council to voluntary organisations concerned with child welfare, and a very necessary and desirable Amendment it is. I hope the fact that the hon. Lady has made a speech appropriate to a later Amendment does not mean that we are switching on to a discussion of a later Amendment, because we want to make sure that we make this Amendment dealing with children, before we go on to deal with petrol.</p>

<p>Perhaps I can help. I apologise to the House. I spoke to the Amendment in page 67, line 16. As this Amendment was acceptable to the House, I thought that it had been accepted, and that we had moved to the next Amendment while I was looking at my papers. Like the hon. Member for Fulham (Mr. M. Stewart), I was a bit puzzled at first about how voluntary contributions came into petroleum, but I thought I had made an error in not hearing that we have moved to the next Amendment.</p>

<p>If we are talking about voluntary contributions for child welfare, in a sense this is an anomalous Amendment, as were the provisions we made earlier in Standing Committee upstairs to give the Greater London Council power to make contributions to certain voluntary bodies, because the general aim of the Bill has been to ensure that the Greater London Council shall not be a welfare authority. I think I am right in saying that the only power it now has in connection with social services&#x2014;apart from education in


inner London&#x2014;is this power to make contributions to voluntary bodies.<br/>
It is not, for instance a children's authority itself at all. If one were niggly, one might ask whether a body which is not a children's authority, and will not naturally attract people interested in social service into its membership, is really a good body to make the voluntary contribution? But I do not propose to niggle like that because, although this is anomalous in the sense that it is unlike the rest of the Bill, I think the rest of the Bill is bad. I am glad that this bit of the Bill is different from the rest, because we know that the L.C.C. had a very good record for contributions to voluntary bodies.<br/>
When the Bill was published, the voluntary bodies were worried about what might happen with the disappearance of the L.C.C. because there were no provisions in the Bill to enable the Greater London Council to have power to make contributions similar to those made by the L.C.C. I am glad that, partly in this House, and partly in another place, power has been given to the Greater London Council to make these contributions.<br/>
I think the passage of time will show that it would be better if the children's services were in the hands of the Greater London Council, and nearly everybody who has experience of those services thinks so, but since we cannot have that this Amendment is better than nothing.</p>

<p>It is a matter of distress to my hon. Friend the Member for Peckham (Mrs. Corbet) that she is not able to be here while we are discussing the final stages of the Bill. I know that she will regret not being here at this juncture, because I think that she raised this point in Committee upstairs.<br/>
My hon. Friend is an expert on the whole range of miscellaneous administrative and public control functions of the London County Council. The view we took was that although we do not like the general pattern of the Bill, if we are to have in Greater London one large authority, and then various smaller authorities inside that area, there are certain public control functions, particularly those which require uniformity of administration and the services of a limited number of expert officers, which could be done better by a large authority than by a number of small ones.<br/>
The argument generally against that was that if we put too many functions in the hands of the Greater London Council we would leave the boroughs with too little to do. In view of what those London boroughs are to be asked to do in housing in future, I do not suppose that any of them will be grieving over the fact that they are no longer to be the licensing authorities for the purpose of petroleum. The hon. Lady is right when she says that the Amendment will commend itself to the House.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment.<br/>
This Amendment goes with the subsequent Amendment in lines 31 and 32. These are little more than drafting Amendments, to put right two points in the wording of the Bill, which made it slightly too restrictive. As at present drafted the Clause makes the Greater London Council a smallholdings authority, with power to provide smallholdings, but does not confer upon it the duty to provide smallholdings. This provision is made in the case of every other county council except the London County Council under the Agriculture Act, 1947. The Amendment will rectify this omission and, by making Section 47 of that Act apply to the Greater London Council, will ensure that it has a duty to provide smallholdings similar to that now imposed on the Middlesex County Council.<br/>
Similarly, we must ensure that the Greater London Council will be able to exercise all the functions which are now exercisable by the county councils, and especially by the Middlesex County Council, under the pre-1947 legislation.


The second Amendment provides that all the remaining functions will be transferred to the Greater London Council. I should mention that these Amendments require a small consequential Amendment to the Schedule of Repeals. On page 216, in column 3, lines 35 to 37 become redundant.</p>

<p>I have a special interest in allotments, not because I have ever had one but because Fulham Palace is in my constituency and the Palace Meadows provide a considerable stretch of allotments which are very much treasured in Fulham. I wanted to get the position quite clear. I found this a difficult part of the Bill to follow in Committee, as did the hon. Member for Orpington (Mr. Lubbock), who put down an Amendment which was drafted rather more skilfully than mine at the time. I am never sure what is the exact meaning, in an Act of Parliament, of the word "smallholding", as compared with the word "allotment". I think that I am right in saying that if we agree to these Amendments the Greater London Council will have such duties and powers in respect of allotments as the county councils now have.<br/>

Clause 58(2) provides that parks and open spaces vested in the London and Middlesex County Councils shall be initially transferred to the Greater London Council, who, before 1970, are to draw up a scheme in consultation with their local authorities showing which parks are to be retained by the Greater London Council and which are to be transferred to a local authority.<br/>
The Bill contemplates the limited transfer of parks to one or other of the London boroughs, but this formula needs to be revised because the Middlesex County Council owns land in districts which although now part of the county are not being included in


Greater London, such, for instance, as the urban district of Staines, Sunbury and Potters Bar.</p>

The original proposal was that there should be a single very large fund for the Greater London area but that was not very popular with the authorities concerned and this restores the position.</p>

<p>I beg to move, as an Amendment to the Lords Amendment, in line 6, to leave out from "transfer" to "he" in line 7.<br/>
I should mention that a later Amendment, not the next but the following Amendment to the Lords Amendment, would be consequential to this one in that, if the one I am moving were accepted, the words from "transferred" in line 11 onwards would then become unnecessary. I mention that to show that these two Amendments, one in line 7 and one in line 11, are linked.<br/>
The principle involved is that when an officer is transferred from the employment of one authority to that of another as a result of the operation of this Bill he should not suffer loss of emoluments whether or not he is transferred to what are called similar duties. As matters stand, if such an officer is transferred to what are regarded as similar duties his emoluments, conditions, and so on, remain the same, but if he is transferred to what are not considered similar duties but lesser duties he could, and in some cases will, suffer a loss of emoluments and prospects. We argued this complex matter of staff at considerable length in Committee and on Report. Opinion was divided not always on strict party lines. When faced with the difficulty on Report at one point an Amendment which the Government were inclined to regard with favour was declared to be out of order. Since then the matter has been the subject of further consideration in another place.<br/>
I say that by way of prelude, because I think that now we should try to look at this question afresh and without prejudice, and consider what are the merits of the principle that when, as a result of the operation of this Bill, an officer is transferred from one authority to another it should be assured to him that he does not suffer in salary, in prospects or in pension as a result solely of the operation of this Bill and his transfer under it.<br/>
There is one general argument in favour of such a proposition. It is that the servants of local government, like the servants of central Government, are given to understand that, provided they do their work well and continue to deserve to be employed, they have the security of their job and the salary that goes with the job. That is one reason why the State is able to attract to its service, in both central Government and local government, able people who could command higher salaries outside. The State is able to do that partly because of a genuine desire by some people to serve their country and enjoy the distinction that goes with it, but to quite a considerable extent it is because of the special security of tenure and prospects that is supposed to go with civil Service or local government work. That is an important principle, and if we do not provide in this Bill that an officer is properly protected when he is transferred from the employment of an old authority to a new one, or from one authority to another as a result of this Bill, we jeopardise that principle.<br/>
If we want to justify the proposition which I am advancing we are asked to prove two things. First, whether from the point of view of the person concerned a loss may be involved, and, secondly&#x2014;it may appear to conflict&#x2014;if the amount of extra expenditure which may fall on the State as a result of this proposal is totalled up, that total will not be very big. As a matter of fact, both those propositions could properly be claimed in this case. It could make a serious difference to the officers concerned. Take, for example, a fairly senior officer say, in the children's department of the London County Council. I choose the London County Council, not because it is the only authority whose employees are affected&#x2014;not by a long chalk&#x2014;but because it is the biggest example. I choose the children's service because it is the most striking example of a service now on a county basis which is to be broken up in the smaller authorities.<br/>
We may get a fairly senior officer in the children's service of the L.C.C. now earning, say, &#x00A3;1,710 a year and with the prospect of his salary rising in the following year to its maximum of &#x00A3;1,760 for that kind of work. Such a man might very well find himself transferred to a post in the service of a borough to do work in the children's service at a salary of &#x00A3;1,623. That would mean a loss in the first year for him in his new employment of &#x00A3;87 and for every suceeding year for which he was employed of &#x00A3;137. That is a very considerable sum. If we do not insert in the Bill something such as I am proposing, that sort of thing could happen to certain persons.<br/>
Further, it could make a serious difference to the individual. It may be said that although that is what could happen, it is very unlikely to happen except to a very few individuals. If that be so&#x2014;I think it is&#x2014;that is all the more reason for doing what I am asking should be done. I am asking for something which cannot add up to a very serious burden on the whole body of ratepayers and taxpayers, whereas not doing it may impose a serious loss on individuals concerned. Therefore, both those necessary propositions are proved.<br/>
Next we have to notice what will be the effect on the pension prospects of some of these officers. Pensions are, of course, normally reckoned on the average salary drawn by the person concerned in the last few years of service. A person who in middle-age is moved from one authority to another, could suffer a loss of salary such as I have described and he might find himself with a permanently lower pension because during the last five years or so of his employment, which would come under the new authority, his salary would be lower than otherwise it would have been.<br/>
When we debated this matter in this House on 1st April&#x2014;it was after mid-day and so the Minister cannot plead that this was done with the jocularity customary on that day&#x2014;the right hon. Gentleman said that he gave a firm undertaking that pension rights would be protected. I find it difficult to see how that undertaking can be firm unless the Amendment which I am moving, or something very like it, is introduced into the Bill.<br/>
There is another reason which I would not press too far although I think that it

deserves some attention. As the Bill stands now, with the Amendment offered to us by another place, a good deal will turn on the definition of what are similar duties. That will make a difference between whether a man has &#x00A3;100 or &#x00A3;120 a year more or less. In some cases this may be a very difficult question to decide and it will, indeed, be a burning question for the individual. Are we so sure that we can know with positive certainty in every case whether a person's new duties are or are not similar, for the purposes of the legislation to his old duties? Are we so sure of it that we can leave the position that it may make a difference of &#x00A3;100, &#x00A3;120 or &#x00A3;130 a year to a man when the decision goes one way or the other?<br/>
The other thing which one is always expected to prove when advancing a case about pensions such as this is that if one is given what is asked it will not create an alarming precedent involving the State in a great deal of expenditure in other spheres, or that it will not create a position in which there could be an argument by analogy from this case which would oblige the State to spend far more than would at first appear to be required for the group of people for whom one is arguing. Here the position is that at present the weight of example and analogy is on my side of the argument. As was very cogently, and indeed dramatically, pointed out by my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Arlington (Mr. Skeffington) when we were debating this, or a similar issue, during the Committee stage proceedings, the proposition that when an officer is transferred he should not be the loser, even if he is not transferred to similar duties, is already admitted in Orders made by Ministers under the Water legislation of 1945 and 1948.</p>

<p>That is relevant to our present argument because a little while ago the Government announced their intention, in a subsequent Measure, to transfer the functions of the Metropolitan Water Board to the Greater London Council. A good deal has happened since that remark was made and the Government may be feeling too dispirited to proceed with that operation. If they do, they will be faced with this problem. If they


transfer employees from the Metropolitan Water Board to the Greater London Council and do not make provision that they shall not lose, even if they are not transferred to similar duties, they will be treating the employees of the Board differently from transferees in the water industry elsewhere, and it will be difficult to defend that anomaly.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, they said that when they transferred the Water Board employees to the Greater London Council they would still treat them as other water transferees, to coin a term, were treated in the Orders made under the Acts of 1945 and 1948, they would find that the water transferee in the Greater London set-up would be treated more generously than the transferee who has been transferred from some other service, and that also would be quite indefensible. I agree that the point sounds a little comical, but it will be a very serious one. The moment we start bringing in the water people we are almost driven, without an Amendment of this kind, to treat one group or the other in a way that could quite properly cause resentment.</p>

<p>I think that the Minister will agree that we have not tried to be at all malicious or contentious in today's debate. We had a little fun with him about the charters at the beginning of the debate, but we have now come up against a serious point affecting the livelihood, income and pension prospects of distinguished public servants. It is important that we come to the right decision. I am pure that the Government will agree that we should consider this entirely on its merits. There is no question of the prestige of the Government being involved. No one would feel that the Government had lost face if they accepted these Amendments. Secondly, there is no serious difficulty of procedure. It means, of course, that if we make an Amendment to their Lordships' Amendment we shall have to trot the Bill to another place before it receives the Royal Assent, but that can be done

in the time available. The argument that "it is only a little one" is really valid on this occasion. There is no difficulty about procedure or prestige. We can consider the matter on its merits. I believe, for the reasons I have advanced, that its merits are good and I hope that the Government will be willing to accept the Amendment.</p>

<p>I support the Amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham (Mr. M. Stewart), which he has put forward very persuasively and comprehensively.<br/>
This is going to be a very large transfer of staff&#x2014;I suppose the largest transfer in the history of local government. It would be a great pity, when it would be possible to ensure the utmost good will, if the Government did anything to prevent that happening. We are trying to ensure, in this Amendment, that those who are transferred and have to undertake new tasks, not as a result of anything that they have done or their councils have done but because of something that the Government have done, should not suffer. This is an elementary point of justice which, I am sure, will commend itself to all hon. Members. A large number of people will be moved through no fault of their own.<br/>
If an officer who is transferred receives, in effect, a salary of a lesser amount than he is now obtaining, he is not, as my hon. Friend showed very dramatically in the case of the children's officer, losing only in actual salary which, in the case he quoted, is about &#x00A3;80 in the first year and &#x00A3;120 for each of the remaining twenty years or so in which he would be the employed, but his pension is affected because it is calculated generally speaking, on the average of the last three years' service. So we would not only hit the transferred officer at the time of transfer, but we would also see that he gets less pension than that which he has looked forward to.<br/>
We have been served in local government, as in the Civil Service, by many of those whose qualifications both professionally and academically would enable them to secure much larger salaries in the world outside, but who, because of the security as well as the constructive nature of much of the work,


prefer to work in either local government or in the Civil Service. It seems particularly unfortunate that men and women who have devoted themselves in this way should, through no fault of their own, be penalised because the Government have decided that they want to introduce this scheme of reorganisation with all the consequential upheaval for personnel.<br/>
I should like to emphasise again a point made by my hon. Friend and that is the difficulty of defining in the case of transfer what are comparable duties. I speak, as the Spanish say, out of my wounds on this matter, because for some years I was a member of the Civil Service Arbitration Tribunal, where we had to consider these matters. One of the greatest difficulties was to find out what was a similar duty. If the Amendment were accepted this would not be a subject for arbitration or argument or negotiation. The point would be met because no officer transferred would be in a worse position than he now is. It it very important that this technical difficulty of definition should be overcome and they would be short circuited if these two Amendments were adopted.<br/>
The debate that we had on 1st April was rather complicated and unfortunate. There were two staff interests involved and that meant that the issue became obscure for many hon. Members. There was the additional point that the Amendment which I understood that the Government were to accept was out of order. But as my hon. Friend has pointed out, the Minister said:
<q>&#x2026;I give a firm undertaking that pension rights are protected and will be protected by order. I will take further advice on this matter."&#x2014;[Official Report, 1st April, 1963; Vol. 675 c. 67.]</q>
I do not know what further advice has been taken but we have had no indication of the Minister's conclusions. If an Amendment on the lines suggested is not accepted by the Government, pension rights will not be safeguarded and the Minister could not be said to have satisfied his undertaking.<br/>
For all these reasons, I hope that even at this late stage the Government will feel able to accept the Amendment.</p>

<p>Throughout the Bill's passage, hon. Members on both sides of

the House have been concerned with the rights of those who have served us so well. We have been concerned about the preservation of their salaries, prospects and pensions and to see that, where it is not possible to give them similar jobs, they are adequately compensated. This is a problem not reserved to the London Government Bill. It will increase as jobs throughout every industry are changed. In considering the problem, possibly for the first time, we have to realise that we may well be setting the pattern for the future. Any changes that we make should be regarded in that light.<br/>
There are still anxieties among members of the L.C.C. staff about their future. Much of that anxiety is unfounded in that there will be more jobs in the enlarged boroughs, but in any reshuffle of this nature and size there must always be some people who cannot be fitted into the exact place and salary which they have before. That is why we have to ensure that the few people who suffer hardship through no fault of their own are compensated.<br/>
Hon. Members have received a document from the London County Council Staff Association expressing concern if this Amendment is not accepted. This is the last ditch at which we have any chance of ensuring that the staff get a fair deal, and I hope that my right hon. Friend will specifically refer to this document.<br/>
Finally, there is a procedural difficulty, which was slightly underestimated by the hon. Member for Fulham (Mr. M. Stewart). The Bill would have to be unscrambled for such an Amendment to be made at this stage and there are very few days of the Session left. It may well be that the Government think that it is not possible to incorporate Amendments of this type at this very late stage&#x2014;and I am prepared to accept that&#x2014;but if that is so, could my right hon. Friend give some assurance to the staff that he has powers in the Bill to give a degree of flexibility&#x2014;as I see it, there is very little room for arbitration in these cases&#x2014;and that he has reserved powers which he can use so that the few people who lose by this transfer are compensated by administrative action. If there is any machinery like that, I hope that my right hon. Friend will publicise it so that some of the staff's anxieties can be allayed.</p>

<p>The hon.

<p>I welcome the fact that from the Benches opposite the hon. Member for Clapham (Dr. Alan Glyn) has voiced the concern and anxiety which has been felt on both sides of the House. I hope that his right hon. Friend will accept the Amendment, but that if he does not, the hon. Gentleman will support us.<br/>
Of all our discussions on the Bill, our discussion of this matter in Standing Committee was one of the most frustrating. It is true that we were able to discuss some of the anxieties mentioned by the hon. Member for Clapham on Second Reading and on Report, but in Standing Committee the time spent discussing this part of the Bill was one of the shortest devoted to any provision. On one occasion we reached an important issue with only four minutes to go before the Committee adjourned.<br/>
We welcome the opportunity which their Lordships have given us to see whether we can resolve some of the acute anxieties among people whose livelihoods and future may be affected. Their family responsibilities and commitments will be affected by our decision tonight. Acceptance of the Amendment would go a long way to allay many fears.<br/>
We still condemn this as a thoroughly bad Bill. The number of drafting Amendments made in the last two hours has shown that when the Bill is on the Statute Book, it will be essential during the vast reshuffle and changes in functions and duties for local government

officers concerned to be able to approach matters with good will in order to be able to smooth out problems. If they have grievances and a sense of injustice about their present conditions of service and salary and prospects, the transitional period will be even more difficult than it has promised to be.<br/>
It has already emerged in discussions between various local authorities that there will be differing scales and that transfers may result in local government officers going a couple of pegs down the incremental scale because of different conditions of service and designations and so on. We would be grateful if the right hon. Gentleman could assure us that that cannot happen. From discussions that have taken place it appears that under the projected arrangements a man who has received a certain number of increments will find himself perhaps two years behind, having to catch up to the position he occupied before the change. I hope that the Minister will deal with this fear when he replies.<br/>
The remarks that have been made about the children's services apply equally to the welfare and mental health services. This matter was raised at some length in Committee upstairs, particularly with reference to finding the right niche for centralised specialist services such as the mental health, welfare and children's services. At present within the L.C.C. and the Middlesex County Council there exists a highly centralised situation with direction and facilities covering a wide number of functions. Residential hostels, for example, have in the past been administered from the centre.<br/>
One result of putting these services into 32 different departments instead of one is the likely loss of the specialised services and those who man them. As the Minister knows, there has already been a tendency for some of these highly specialised people to apply for jobs outside the Greater London area, in places like Lancashire, Yorkshire and Scotland. We who with to see these services continue for the citizens in the new areas want to ensure that the Greater London Council will have people with specialised knowledge at its disposal. I am, of course, referring to people who have had years of training and experience in the services which must be provided.<br/>
We have time and again referred to the technical problems involved particularly on the broader issues and principles. But when one considers the technical, day-to-day working of a number of these specialised departments one realises that the difficulties are enormous. An important problem is that of trying to refit the various activities that have been built up over many years in Middlesex and London and the question of reabsorbing those who will be needed if these services are to continue. Whenever this matter has been discussed we have returned to the solution that if these services are to continue it will be necessary for two, three or more of the new boroughs to get together to provide certain services which one borough alone could not possibly provide.<br/>
Provision for doing this already exists. It may be possible for as many as 10 boroughs to get together for the running of certain facilities&#x2014;for, say, the mentally handicapped. If the Amendment is passed it may be possible, even though we cannot at the moment designate their future jobs, for us to retain the specialists we need to run these services. Unless these skilled people are prepared to stay in their present areas we will lose the reservoir of skill which it has taken years for the L.C.C. and the M.C.C. to build up. Acceptance of the Amendment may enable us to retain them, remembering that many of them are in their late forties and early fifties, have families, and do not particularly wish to move to Lancashire, Yorkshire and elsewhere. If they can be assured that their present financial position and their superannuation arrangements will not greatly deteriorate, it may be possible, through negotiation, to show that while it is not possible to designate them for precisely the same r&#x00F4;le at the moment, another designation can be offered to them where their specialist knowledge can be put to use, whatever the final shape our local government arrangements may take.<br/>
While this is almost the eleventh hour I hope that the Minister will accept the Amendment. If he does he will find a welcome for his decision not only on both sides of the House and in another place but among a large number of families who are at present anxious to know where their next step will take

them. These specialist workers wish to fulfil their vocational training and knowledge, to look after their families and to earn a reasonable livelihood.</p>

<p>If the eloquent speech of the hon. Member for Fulham (Mr. M. Stewart) in moving the Amendment did not convince the Minister that he would be wrong not to accept it, the speech of the right hon. Gentleman's hon. Friend the Member for Clapham (Dr. Alan Glyn) must have convinced him. As the hon. Member for Willesden, West (Mr. Pavitt) said, support for the Amendment has come from all sides of the House. Were the hon. Member for Hendon, South (Sir H. Lucas-Tooth) still in his place he would be supporting it. It is significant to note that not a single hon. Member has spoken against it, and I am convinced that if we had a free vote the Amendment would be passed by an overwhelming majority. Despite the change in my position, I still believe that a free vote is a good thing on occasions, but not always.<br/>
The apprehension at present felt by virtually every one working in local government has been emphasised. When the Minister replies he will probably tell us that these apprehensions are unfounded. I think I saw the right hon. Gentleman nod his head in agreement when one hon. Member said that there would be more jobs under the new arrangements. This may be true in some cases, so why will the Minister not accept the Amendment? If he says that the compensation provisions will not act adversely against those affected by the changes, why will he not accept it? I agree with the hon. Member for Fulham that the financial effects would be very small.<br/>
It is very important that we should make the correct decision tonight. It is not only the employees of the London local authorities who will be involved; the pattern of change established by this Bill is likely to be repeated over the country as a whole, and local authority officers, wherever they may be, will watch our decision.</p>

<p>I do not doubt for a moment the strong feeling and concern of hon. Members on both sides of the House, and I accept that, as the hon. Member for Orpington (Mr. Lubbock)


has just said, the content and the result of this debate will be watched with considerable interest outside the House.<br/>
Before I go into the details of my reply, I particularly want to answer what I thought was a most unfair point made by the hon. Member for Willesden, West (Mr. Pavitt). I did not mean to put this in the middle of a speech, but I have been teased. It is not good enough for hon. Members opposite continually to tease the Government with the number of drafting and other Amendments that have had to be made. The fact is that, for its own reasons, the London County Council refused that collaboration and consultation that is normal and customary in the drafting of great Bills, and since we had to do without the L.C.C.'s advice on the best way of dealing with the machinery and the purpose on which it is such an expert, there were bound to be occasions when, having had the London County Council's advice indirectly through hon. Members, we were able to improve things. We must all be glad that such improvements have been possible.<br/>
I now want to deal at length, and with full gravity, with the points that have been made. I believe that the projected reorganisation will lead to more job opportunities, but I do not maintain that there will not occasionally be a situation in which a particular man or woman cannot find an exactly similar job to which to be transferred. There will, therefore, be occasions when, for such a man or woman, there will be the alternative either to accept work that is not comparable within Greater London or to seek comparable or better work outside London.<br/>
I think that such occasions will be very rare. The hon. Member for Fulham (Mr. M. Stewart) did not exaggerate here. I think that he himself accepts that this predicament will occur only infrequently. In fact, he built part of his argument on that, because he said that although the total cost of accepting the Amendment would be small, its affect on individuals might be severe. So it is common ground between us all that the problem with which the Amendment seeks to deal will not be a frequent one. I say that the more because what we are dealing with, in general, is a transfer of functions from one authority to a num-

ber of authorities and, in general, that will mean more job opportunities.<br/>
If, therefore, it were simply a question of cash, I do not see that there would be a strong argument against the Amendment, but there is more to it than that. It is not just cash, and it is not just the cash involved in this particular reorganisation scheme. There is here at stake a principle, and there are involved considerations of precedent.<br/>
The principle at stake is this. The Amendment, in substance, maintains that whatever work a local government servant in the Greater London area is called upon to do he shall receive at least as much pay and at least as good conditions of employment as he had immediately before the change. The difference between the pay to which his new job would entitle him and the pay that he will actually receive would under the Amendment be made up to him indefinitely at the public expense. This has a quite considerable implication. Rates and taxes are not so popular that we can light-heartedly accept the very heavy, and continuing, commitment that this might involve.<br/>
After all, reorganisation is not confined to London and is not confined to local government. There have been&#x2014;I shall come back to this later&#x2014;no fewer than 19 separate situations to which the post-war compensation code has had to be applied. The Government are at the moment in the midst of major structural reorganisations of a number of different systems of administration in this country, local government being one. There are groupings of water undertakings and various other reorganisations going on, and there will be more in future.<br/>
I do not utter a threat. This is not a party issue. Both parties must, if they wish to maintain this country in an efficient state, from time to time undertake, unpopular though it may be, reorganisation in one field or another. What hon. Members opposite are asking us to do is to guarantee that, no matter what the reorganisation, no matter what the total cost may be, the ratepayer and the taxpayer shall permanently maintain at least the pay and conditions of service of all people who may be transferred or who may be have to accept changed employment as a result of one or other of these reorganisations.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for giving way. I see his point, but surely this principle has been accepted in a large sphere of Government activity. Certainly it was the position in the National Health Service take-over in 1948, with the principle of no detriment clauses. Where there is a change in rates of pay and conditions of service this is a very old principle. What is so unusual about this one?</p>

<p>I would be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would.<br/>
I maintain that in all this sort of reorganisation there is a compensation procedure and, as I say&#x2014;I referred to it just now and I will refer to it now at more length&#x2014;until the war there was a compensation procedure written into the Local Government Act, 1933. After the war, I believe that it was the Labour Government, in 1948, who thought that this pre-war compensation code was not entirely suitable for the post-war full employment era. The pre-war compensation code provided compensation in such a way&#x2014;not to go into details&#x2014;that there was no incentive for a person compensated to seek alternative work. That may have been right at the time because alternative work was very hard to come by.</p>

<p>I could give another example. Under the National Health Service now there are regroupings and reorganisations.

<p>I do not carry in my head the exact details of every one of the reorganisations, but if all the analogies which have been given are as wrong as some that have been given to me before, I am not very frightened of them. It was partly to deal with the setting up of the National Health Service and the complicated transfers involved that the Labour Government evolved the post-war compensation code. There was, therefore, accepted by the Labour Government&#x2014;that is not the end of the story, I agree&#x2014;the principle that some people would have to accept a lower award and that for that situation there should be a compensation code. I am meeting the intervention of the hon. Member for Greenwich (Mr. Marsh).</p>

<p>I am sorry to intervene again, but this is a material point. Is the right hon. Gentleman sure that what he is talking about is not, in fact, compensation for loss of office, whereas the maintenance of a no detriment clause in the National Health Service has gone through the whole time? Where an employee has been transferred to a different job at a lower rate of pay he has suffered no detriment. There is nothing unusual in this in any nationalised industry. Where an employee has lost his office, he has been compensated.</p>

<p>That is not my understanding. My understanding is that the compensation code provides, among other things, for complete redundancy, for early retirement, for a lower-paid post and for the implications on a man's pension expectations of a lower-paid post. These and, probably, other things which I do not carry in my mind are all covered by the post-war compensation code, which has been applied to nineteen separate structural reorganisations.</p>

<p>I can. If the hon. Gentleman would heed my argument, I am saying that we are all agreed that relatively few people with be involved, but that if we accept the principle here we must accept it for all future reorganisations. These, to the knowledge of the House, already involve local government all over the country, already involve water authorities all over the country and may, for aught I know, involve a lot of other organisations, too, in due course. Therefore, this is both small in its human impact in the Bill and large in its consequential implications for the ratepayer and the taxpayer.</p>

<p>The point made by my hon. Friend comes next in my notes.<br/>
Having stated the general principle, I come to a number of the analogies which have been pressed upon me and I want to meet them fairly and squarely before dealing with the other questions. It was said, first, that the Amendment involves nothing very new and that it is no more than is already provided under the Water Acts for the merger and amalgamation of statutory water undertakings.<br/>
The hon. Member for Fulham (Mr. M. Stewart) constructed what I might call a Fulham fork in connection with the Metropolitan Water Board. He said that if, in the next Session of Parliament, we transfer, as we intend to do, the functions of the Metropolitan Water Board to the Greater London Council, we will be carrying out a water merger and, therefore, we must employ the logic of the Water Acts, which, as the

hon. Member says, support his Amendment. If we do that but refuse his Amendment, the water transferees will have been treated better than the local government transferees. If we do not&#x2014;this was the other prong of the hon. Member's fork&#x2014;we deny the principle of the Water Acts.<br/>
The hon. Member's contention was based upon a misapprehension of what the Water Acts do. They provide that transferred officials shall receive the same conditions of pay when they are transferred. But what the Water Acts do not provide is any guarantee of employment.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1963-07-25a.1902.1" colnum="1902" time="">
<p>I do not wish to mislead hon. Members. Water mergers have a much smaller effect on staff than the London government reorganisation. There is very little chance of individual water officials being taken over under the Water Act and then dismissed.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1963-07-25a.1902.2" hansard_membership_id="9999" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/21985" speakername="Mr. Weitzman" colnum="1902" time="">
<p>What about the principle?</p>

<p>But in principle, as the hon. and learned Member rightly reminds me, there is nothing to stop a water company honouring its obligation to pay to a transferred official his own pay and conditions and then the next day either dismissing him altogether or dismissing and re-engaging him at a lower salary. I do not say that that happens, but what the hon. Member, in drawing an analogy from the Water Acts, is asking the House to accept is wrong. He is asking up to accept that, under the Water Acts, there is a guarantee of the indefinite continuation of similar pay and conditions to those which operated before transfer. I do not think that the Water Acts analogy&#x2014;I did not mean to say this; it came naturally to me and I have not built up to it&#x2014;holds water.<br/>
Secondly, it was pressed on me that the railway reorganisation scheme, with its fairly large guarantee of continued pay, is an analogy which we should respect. There is all the difference in the world between the deliberate contraction, with minimum damage to staff, which is going on in the railway services and the London Government reorganisation, which is likely, if anything, to lead to an increase in staff. We are not dealing with large numbers of people whose way of life is


in danger of being removed, as may happen to some railway workers in some areas. With a reducing or contracting number of jobs, it is necessary to be far more generous than it is right to be when there are ample opportunities and an even larger number of opportunities under the reorganisation than there are at the moment.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1963-07-25a.1903.0" hansard_membership_id="9201" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/18307" speakername="Mr. Mellish" colnum="1903" time="">
<p>The right hon. Gentleman has said that the contraction going on in the railway industry is a special case. When the Greater London boroughs are merged there will be a tendency for fewer senior officials to be employed by the Greater London boroughs than is the case at present. Take the simple case of the town clerk. Three town clerks will be merged under one great London borough. There will be only one town clerk. I assume that the other two will be kept on at their existing salary and, perhaps, be made deputies. In the long term, by normal wastage, they will be got rid of. It is not fair to say that there will be no contraction.</p>

<p>Does the Minister accept that the London County Council scales are superior to those generally accepted in local government? If so, he is not comparing like with like.</p>

<p>Those are two different cases with which I will deal. I will not shirk anything.<br/>
First, to get rid of one limited and easy question to answer, may I say to my hon. Friend the Member for Clapham (Dr. Alan Glyn) that the Minister has no reserve power. We are, therefore, dealing with the whole situation. It cannot be improved by any flexible change later.<br/>
I have been asked to comment on the example given on page 2 of the London County Council Staff Association circular. Although I do not doubt the concern felt by those who drafted it, I find it a little surprising that they should have chosen as their best example an instance from the children's service, where it is almost inevitable that there will be more job opportunities as a result of the reorganisation than there are now.<br/>
There will be nine authorities where there are now one. It is highly likely

that there will be very few cases, if any, where L.C.C. children's officers will find employment that is not at least comparable.<br/>
The hon. Member for Willesden, West (Mr. Pavitt) said he was particularly concerned about the prospects of what he called the centrally employed specialists, for whom there would not be similar opportunities in the absolutely large, but relatively smaller borough organisations. But he forgets that there is power under Clause 5(3) for the boroughs to join together to employ such specialists.</p>

<p>But the hon. Gentleman did not give enough emphasis to the fact that those specialists will find more opportunities in the boroughs than there are in the L.C.C. at present. It is true that the example given in this document is, on its own assumption, correct. But I find that the assumption that such a children's officer will only be able to find a post with less than comparable duties highly improbable.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman does not understand the position in the higher offices of the children's department of the L.C.C. Their responsibility extends over the whole county. There are no comparable offices in any of the boroughs to be created, where the units will be very much smaller.</p>

<p>But my hon. Friend the Member for Bedfordshire, South (Mr. Cole) has not taken the point that provided an official is transferred to comparable work he is guaranteed by the Bill the same pay and conditions as he enjoyed with the L.C.C., even if they are better than those working with him who have come not from the L.C.C. but from other local authorities.</p>

<p>They will carry with them the full scale of pay and conditions and prospects as they had when they


worked for the L.C.C. The worry is for those for whom there may not be comparable jobs and only for them; but we are all agreed that there will be very few.<br/>
I was asked about borough senior officers, including the town clerks. For instance, if we merge three boroughs only one town clerk will be needed out of the three town clerks. One answer may be that the job of deputy town clerk in a large borough may carry as much pay as the job of town clerk of a small borough. I do not rest on that argument, for I do not know what the rates will be, but it is one factor. There are also a number of senior officers who are approaching retiring age and who will either serve out the short time until retirement or retire earlier under the compensation arrangements which will be available.<br/>
It has been impressed on the Government that the dependence of this arrangement on comparable postings is a very vague and difficult one on which to rely. But I remind the House that this arrangement has been running a number of years. The compensation codes have depended for their application upon the availability of comparable jobs and there has been available machinery for deciding what is and what is not comparable. At the moment, there are tribunals, set up by the Minister of Labour, to decide whether a particular post is comparable or not. The exact machinery which will be used for the London government reorganisation has yet to be discussed and decided upon, but it would not be surprising if it were to involve some such tribunal to act as arbiter when there was doubt.<br/>

<p>May I help the right hon. Gentleman? On 1st April he said this:
<q>&#x2026;I give a firm undertaking that pension rights are protected and will be protected by

order. I will take further advice on this matter."&#x2014;[Official Report, 1st April, 1963; Vol 674, c. 67.]</q>

<p>I used those words, but I used them in response to the hon. Member for Orpington (Mr. Lubbock), who was being at that time&#x2014;I say this with all courtesy and from a ministerial point of view&#x2014;an absolute pest. It is a credit to the hon. Gentleman that he was being so. He was trying to get me to define exactly what was covered by "conditions". He asked whether it included the size of the car, or whether it included petrol allowance. In desperation, because I did not know the answers to all these questions, I said, "Anyway, pension rights are fully protected". What I meant was not a reference to the pension rights of people who were transferred in connection with their further years of work, but the protection of their pension rights accrued from the years of work they have already given. I do not think that these words, which were produced not in answer to the specific question now being put to me, can be held against me in this connection.<br/>
I think that I have covered all the points raised by hon. Members opposite. I return to where I began. This cannot be considered in isolation as simply a concession which the Government could cheaply make&#x2014;cheaply, though it is ratepayers' and taxpayers'money&#x2014;to ensure that the few people who may not find comparable posts in the London Government reorganisation will lose not a penny of their salary or pension. For such people there is the compensation code. I remind the House that the compensation code to be applied to London has still to be discussed with the staff and other associations concerned. We are having a new compensation code which will cover this.<br/>
We cannot regard the Amendment as simply something that can be looked at in isolation. If we accept the principle that the Amendment enshrines, we accept that for this and for all future reorganisations the taxpayer and the ratepayer are to guarantee indefinitely the pay and conditions of all official servants of the bodies reorganised, regardless of the work they are called upon to do. That goes a very long way,


far further than the arguments of hon. Members opposite or of my hon. Friend the Member for Clapham would sustain. We should think a very long time before going that far.<br/>
I hope that I have convinced hon. Gentlemen that the compensation code, which has yet to be discussed but which will be at least on the basis of the postwar compensation code, is the proper way to make good to the few concerned what I hope will be the temporary loss of some of their earning power. As for the example given in the circular from the L.C.C. Staff Association, I regard it as highly unlikely that cases of such a drop in earnings would occur, particularly in the children's service, where there will be so many more job opportunities as a result of reoganisation than there are now.</p>

<p>Will the right hon. Gentleman answer my question? Where there is a transfer from a county office to one of the new borough offices, and no change of designation of job is involved, there could be a lowering of the salary because of fewer increments. Could a different scale apply at borough level to that at present applying at county level, which would mean that a man who went from one job to another could find himself on a lower scale?</p>

<p>Whatever work he is called on to do will be comparable to the work he has been doing.

<p>The right hon. Gentleman's speech will cause dismay throughout the

local government services of the country, because under the 1958 Act we are reaching the stage when a number of reorganisation schemes will be brought forward. For instance, on Tyneside, part of which I have the honour to represent, there is a proposal that there should be four county boroughs, and that the work now performed in all the local government areas, which cater for a population of about 1 million, should be divided among these four boroughs.<br/>
Where a person is employed in a county office dealing with the population of the county he is, generally speaking, on a higher rate of salary than the person holding a comparable post in a borough. I am not concerned merely with the three town clerks, one of whom will find himself a new job as a town clerk, while the other two will be employed as deputy clerks, if they are lucky. It is unlikely that these latter gentlemen will get the same salary as the third member of the trinity who is made a town clerk, and this will happen throughout the country.</p>

<p>Surely the right hon. Gentleman does not mean that? His argument depends on the fact that they will not get at least as good a salary as they had before. Nobody expects them all to get as good a salary as the new type town clerk.</p>

<p>I understand that in local government, whatever rate the town clerk is paid, if a deputy does the job he gets only 80 per cent. of that salary. I assume in such a case that the 80 per cent. rate would be comparable to the rate he was getting before?</p>

<p>Having had to deal with the review of county districts in a county which had 33 local authorities, that was not how it worked out. That is not how the officials who came under the new arrangements were treated. I am certain that when what the right hon. Gentleman has said tonight is known, the tasks of reorganising London government in the various areas, under the schemes provided for by the 1958 Act, will be greatly impeded. There will be a considerable volume of grievance, which will continually be brought to


the right hon. Gentleman's notice. I know that he decides everything on the basis of principle. I can only say that I believe that he will find that his view of what is principle in this matter will not be shared by the staffs of local government bodies.</p>

<p>I have been listening to the debate for a short while, and it strikes me that there is a misunderstanding between those who are trying to make certain about the compensation provisions for transferred staff and what I am sure are the sincere wishes and intentions of the Minister. I believe that the two sides are not far apart from each other. I read with care the three bases that the London County Council Staff Association sent to me, in common with other Members of Parliament. As I have already told the House, I had a special reason for taking more than the ordinary interest in the future of these transferred officers.<br/>
It seems to me that these bases are eminently reasonable. There must be some lack of clarity in the matter, because in my view their reasoning seems to be on all fours with what my right hon. Friend appears to be seeking to do. I believe that we are spending too much time in debating a minute difference. The Association asks simply that an officer should receive his existing rate of pay and scale or be compensated for any loss if, for any reason not his own fault, he has to take a lower-scale job-&#x2014;</p>

<p>My hon. Friend has just put himself right. At first he referred to a transfer to a job on a lower scale. That situation is protected. The person transferring carries his own higher scale with him, provided, as my hon. Friend himself said in putting himself right, that the new job is comparable with the old in its functions.</p>

<p>My right hon. Friend admitted that there will be a certain loss in one year and a greater loss in future years.<br/>
My right hon. Friend has already con ceded the second basis in his explanation of the Government's view that no officer should suffer a diminution of pension as a result of transfer&#x2014;</p>

<p>No. My hon. Friend is trying to be helpful to the House and to the local government officials concerned, but there is a difference between our points of view. I have not said that a guaranteed pension related to the transferred officer's previous pay and conditions is involved in what is undertaken here. I have said that the compensation will make good part of any loss of pension that may result.</p>

<p>This is the nub of what I said at the beginning. This is where there is a lack of clarity. My right hon. Friend said that no accrued pension conditions would be lost, and he said that in reply to the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (Mr. Skeffington) when he quoted from the report of the debate of 1st April.<br/>
There is a statement,
<q> No officer should suffer any diminution in pension, as a result of transfer".</q>
That is not entirely clear. Does it mean at present, up to the date of the transfer or for the future? I cannot think that it means for the future because no one knows what the pension entitlement will be in the future since it depends so much on the job.<br/>
I speak with some knowledge here. A man who suddenly gets a job at &#x00A3;2,000 a year when he has been earning &#x00A3;1,200, and maintains the new rate for the last five years of his employment, has enhanced pension rights. Thus, nobody can estimate the pension rights of a man in the future. They are a matter of ability, good fortune and choice of a higher job. My right hon. Friend said that no accrued pension rights would in any way be embarrassed by the transfer.<br/>
The third point is the most reasonable of all, and I believe that there is no


difference between the two sides of the House about it. It states that no officer is to be served with notice of new terms and conditions of employment before those terms and conditions have been the subject of consultation and agreement between the authorities and the staff organisation concerned and, in the event of failure to agree, by award or arbitration. It did not seem to me that I was very different from anything that my right hon. Friend said in this matter except for the nicer points which he made in the course of my remarks.<br/>
With great respect, my right hon. Friend did not clarify my mind on these points and I, and I am sure many local government officers, would like to know what is to happen in the three kinds of body which are to be transferred to the new Greater London authority. What happens to a man or a woman on a scale, even though it is an A.P.T. scale, where the maximum of the scale in his present authority is higher than that in his new authority? If he is transferred to a new post in a new authority, does he keep his existing maximum although it does not conform to the new authority scale?<br/>
In agreeing that these figures were correct, my right hon. Friend stressed that nobody in the children's service, particularly, was likely to get a worse job. With that I agree. But we are concerned not so much about his getting a worse job as about whether he gets the same maximum salary for the same job. I am not concerned at the moment with his getting a different job or a better job. Let us hope that he gets a better job. But the maximum given in one case is &#x00A3;1,760 and in another case &#x00A3;1,580&#x2014;a difference of &#x00A3;180 a year for the same job in the two authorities. I want a simple answer to this question: does a man on the ordinary A.P.T. scale get that enhanced maximum in a new authority until new terms and conditions are negotiated?<br/>
With respect to all concerned, I think that in considering the Amendments we are suffering mostly from a lack of complete understanding of each other's minds. I hope that this can be clarified for the benefit of all existing officers who will be transferred and of those who will consider in the intervening two years going into local government,

where in the past they have considered that there was a high degree of security of employment. I hope that they will so consider in future. I hope that for their sake we can soon resolve the misunderstandings and reach mutual agreement.</p>

<p>I have always admired the ingenuity of the right hon. Gentleman the Minister, but I have never listened to a more tortuous argument than the one he has made on this Amendment. The case is a very simple one and to a certain extent the right hon. Gentleman recognised the justice of it as it was put forward. Here we have a Government interfering with the security of employment and terms of employment of certain individuals. They are naturally apprehensive about the change to be brought about. They have relied upon their position and on the fact that they had that security. The Government, with this Measure, alter that state of affairs and these people are to be transferred. They may be transferred to like jobs and get the same money, the same terms and conditions, or they may not be transferred.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman starts by admitting that there will be more jobs, so it is very unlikely that there will be any great number of cases, but a very few cases will be affected. He admits that from the financial point of view there is not an acute problem in any shape or form. He should surely recognise the elementary justice of the proposition that, if we interfere with the security of employment and if people have for years had a job and relied upon it and then the Government interfere, whatever job we put those people into we ought to see that the terms of their employment are secure. That is elementary justice. The right hon. Gentleman to a certain extent admits that, but his answer is that it is wrong from the point of view of principle to allow that to be done.</p>

<p>I hope the hon. and learned Member will answer in his argument the point I made about precedent. The precedent is that under the Labour Government there was a new post-war compensation code provided especially for cases where the Government interfere, as we are now doing&#x2014;I do not dispute it&#x2014;with the secure employment of local government or equivalent officials. That


compensation code has applied in 19 reconstruction cases since the war. It will apply in future. The hon. and learned Member has to meet the precedent of the past and the precedent for the future.</p>

<p>I withdraw the words, "Labour Government". The point is being made that we are acting repugnantly to elementary justice. Reorganisation is something with which all Governments have to deal. It has gone on for a long time and we shall have many more reorganisations in future.</p>

<p>I leave out the words "Labour Government" in the same way as the Minister does, but is he saying that, because a Government have done something in the past, through the ages we should recognise that as a position to be adopted and that we should perpetuate an injustice? Either the case is a just one or it is not a just one. If I am right in saying that it is elementary justice when a Government interfere with security of employment that they should put the persons concerned in the same position and on the same conditions of employment, that is either right or it is not. I should have thought the right hon. Gentleman would be the first to recognise the justice of it; indeed, he did so. He started by saying that he did, but he then went on to justify his refusal to accept the Amendment by saying that this is a question of principle and that we would be creating a tremendous precedent.<br/>
I do not accept that the precedents are such as the right hon. Gentleman says they are. There were many instances</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1963-07-25a.1914.0" colnum="1914" time="">
<p>given by my hon. Friends about the water board. There was another with reference to the Civil Aviation Act and others to which one could refer. By pointing to the principle, are we really dealing with the justice of this case? Does that provide an answer?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1963-07-25a.1914.1" colnum="1914" time="">
<p>The right hon. Gentleman recognises that there will be few instances where hardship will occur. Surely that is a strong argument in favour of accepting the Amendment; unless the right hon. Gentleman is saying that here is a tremendous principle which will affect Government Measures right through the years. That is the only effective answer which he has given. The Minister must recognise, when considering the question of compensation, that it can be only a partial satisfaction with regard to changing the job. Individuals will suffer an injustice. We can salve our consciences for allowing him to suffer that injustice only by saying that it is for the good of the community. That means that if we do this sort of thing the taxpayer will suffer in some way. If, as the right hon. Gentleman maintains, there will be few instances, how can the taxpayer suffer?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1963-07-25a.1914.2" colnum="1914" time="">
<p>The only other point is whether we are creating a precedent. The Minister heard what was said with regard to precedents. I wish that Ministers would sometimes try to deal with Bills, proposals, and so on, on first principles and not attempt to refute arguments by saying that it is all a question of principle; that a precedent is created; that it is most important. That is rubbish. I could only wish that the Minister had been sitting on this side of the House listening to his own argument. Then he would have realised what nonsense it was.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1963-07-25a.1917.1" hansard_membership_id="12203" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20698" speakername="Mr. Skeffington" colnum="1917" time="">
<p>I beg to move, as an Amendment to the Lords Amendment, in line 7, after "employment", to insert:
<q>being terms and conditions of employment which have been settled by agreement or award".</q>
A similar Amendment was discussed in another place and an undertaking given on 30th May by the Government spokesman that if that Amendment were withdrawn, the matter would be considered. However, no alternative Amendment has been put forward by the Government and those who are interested, as I know many hon. Members from both sides of the House are, have put forward this reasonable and much more modest Amendment than that which we have just considered.<br/>
The object is simply to ensure that officers transferred to the new authorities and to the Greater London Council itself do not have forced upon them, as is theoretically possible, a unilateral scale of salaries and conditions which have not been negotiated. It has been common practice in all these services, certainly local government services throughout the country, to settle terms and conditions by negotiation or, in some cases, by agreement with a staff council or some similar body. This general practice was confirmed when the matter was discussed in the other place.<br/>
When this House discussed the matter, on 1st and 2nd April, the Minister indicated, either in an aside or by one of his many nods, that he agreed with the practice in principle. As he indicated that he would have accepted one of the Amendments, which was unfortunately out of order, it is surprising that the Government have not brought forward an Amendment to deal with this matter. The staff cannot understand, in view of the general agreement on common practices, the undertaking given to look at the matter again and what appeared to be the agreement of the Minister with his principle at an earlier stage, why nothing has appeared on the Order Paper.<br/>
In its scope the Amendment is more modest than the earlier proposal. It is</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1963-07-25a.1918.0" colnum="1918" time="">
<p>right that we should do everything we can, in the turmoil that may arise in the transfer of staff, to remove the anxiety that some authorities may unilaterally impose a scheme which had not been discussed through the ordinary machinery or by arbitration.</p>

<p>It is good to hear a voice from Scotland in our deliberations.<br/>
The Amendment omits to take into account the fact that, as is well known, in practice these terms and conditions emerge as the result of negotiations. There is no conceivable reason to think that the negotiations will not be as successfully achieved in future as they have been in the past. The hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (Mr. Skeffington) in moving the Amendment did not give any reason whatever for thinking that the Greater London Council will not be a satisfactory employer. I do not see from his remarks that there is any reason why we should seek to bind the Council's hands in this way.<br/>
As for the eloquent nod I am alleged to have given and the willingness I am alleged to have shown to advise the Committee at an earlier stage to support an Amendment, it may well be that I would have welcomed a particular Amendment on the Order Paper as putting partly right the havoc and damage that had been caused in Committee when an Amendment which went far further than the Government thought right happened to be moved successfully against us. The Government thought that it was wrong and at a later stage the damage was repaired.<br/>
The hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington is seeking to urge the House to anticipate and bind the hands of the employers before they have had an opportunity to negotiate the pay and conditions of the staff. I cannot, therefore, advise the House to accept the Amendment.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1963-07-25a.1919.0" hansard_membership_id="9999" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/21985" speakername="Mr. Weitzman" colnum="1919" time="">
<p>The Alice in Wonderland attitude of the Minister grows greater as the debate progresses. Does the right hon. Gentleman consider that he has adequately answered the case adduced by my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington (Mr. Skeffington)? The Amendment merely seeks to insert the words
<q>being terms and conditions of employment which have been settled by agreement or award".</q>
To this the Minister merely says, "They are all very good employers and they always negotiate". If they do, what is wrong with accepting the Amendment? The words "by agreement" mean by negotiation. If a case should arise where they do not negotiate, one then has the word "award". There is no validity in the Minister's argument and I was amazed to hear his comments.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1963-07-25a.1919.1" hansard_membership_id="2598" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30613" speakername="Mr. Cole" colnum="1919" time="">
<p>I intervene briefly because, bearing in mind the great respect I have for his intellect and integrity, I was surprised at the reply of my right hon. Friend. I leave aside for the moment the general question of what may happen in two years' time and I wish to consider the transferees. I speak as one who, up to some years ago, was a local government officer of 20 years' standing. We all know that these things are not always arranged amicably. There is a big meeting in the Kings way Hall, the populace gets to know about it, and someone has to give way, but for those concerned it is a lot more comforting to have the procedure laid down in a Statute that is affecting their future careers.<br/>
The Lords Amendment, which we will presumably be asked to accept, speaks of
<q>&#x2026;terms and conditions of his employment&#x2026;not less favourable than those he enjoyed immediately before the date of transfer.</q>
I should have thought that those words went a long way further, yet my right hon. Friend has swallowed those but cannot accept something which, unless I am very na&#x00EF;ve, is intended to codify existing practice.<br/>
If my right hon. Friend puts the suggested words into the Statute then, in the event of a dispute&#x2014;and especially at the beginning of the affair&#x2014;we put on both sides an implicit responsibility to go to arbitration. The employers might be so minded and the employees might not be, but the employees would have to go to

arbitration because that would be implicit here.<br/>
Personally, if I were handling this Clause I should prefer to put into it exactly what I expect to happen, rather than rely on 32 local authorities and the Greater London Council, all of whom, having that autonomy that we want to see, will have different ways of looking at things. I should have thought that those authorities would welcome this House telling them that the terms and conditions must be agreed or taken to arbitration for an award.<br/>
I cannot see why we cannot put into the Bill what are, to me, innocuous words. If there is something behind them that I do not understand, my right hon. Friend will no doubt improve my education&#x2014;</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1963-07-25a.1920.0" hansard_membership_id="3990" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/31314" speakername="Captain W. Elliot" colnum="1920" time="">
<p>My hon. Friend has called these innocuous words. I was a member of the Committee, spoke on the Amendment and voted against the Government. I do not quite see how the words
<q>being terms and conditions of employment which have been settled by agreement or award</q>
would strengthen the Lords Amendment.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1963-07-25a.1920.1" hansard_membership_id="2598" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30613" speakername="Mr. Cole" colnum="1920" time="">
<p>I am sure that my hon. and gallant Friend knows what I mean. I mean that the words convey no hidden meaning and are quite simple and harmless in their application. This Amendment would merely put in certain words and, goodness knows, we have enough words in the Bill for a few more not to matter. We are putting in so many words what all of us hope will happen&#x2014;indeed, must happen, if local government in Greater London and the boroughs is to continue.<br/>
There is the psychological effect on local government officers and their families of knowing that the terms and conditions must be settled by agreement or by award. That is not the end of the story; it merely keeps the door open for them to argue things out, and stops any suspicion, however unjustified, that any arbitrary local authority can settle these things without the staff having any redress. We have made good progress so far. I appeal to my right hon. Friend not to hold up that progress and embarrass his hon. Friends and people outside who are his admirers by insisting that these words should not be inserted.<br/>
I did not quite understand what my hon. Friend meant by referring to what happened in Committee, but I rather gather that, in certain circumstances, he would have accepted these words.</p>

<p>What is puzzling a lot of us on both sides of the House is exactly what is the Minister's point of disagreement with this Amendment. We shall be very pleased to hear it. As I understand it, all that we are seeking to do is to ensure that these staff in the reorganisation are not asked to accept conditions and rates of pay which have not been negotiated or agreed. The reason for this is obvious. It is to avoid the possibility&#x2014;which I must confess, until the Minister showed his objection to the Amendment, I would have thought was very faint&#x2014;of imposed conditions of service and salaries upon local government staff.<br/>
I can appreciate that there are some conditions and agreements that the staff would not want, but, on the whole, there has been in local government a long history of conditions of service which were applied by agreement and by negotiation. Within the local government service there are scales and agreed conditions of service which with adjustments could be applied to these staff. The right hon. Gentleman has got to say something other than the fact that he does not like this Amendment.<br/>
The hon. Member for Bedfordshire, South (Mr. Cole) with whom I would normally hope to disagree&#x2014;I have spent the last three minutes working out why I agree with him, and I still come to the conclusion that it must be because the Minister is wrong&#x2014;made the point that this is a position which has existed in local government. There have been within the London County Council from time to time arguments about whether certain conditions of service were agreed, and there are arguments as to which organisations or which people had to join together to constitute an agreement. But there has never been this disagreement about conditions of service within the national local government service.<br/>
One would have thought that the principle of negotiation for local government employees in local government service was something with which we would all

agree on both sides of the House. I hope the light hon. Gentleman will be able to give us a wider reason than the one which he has just given, which seems to be quite contrary to the general policy.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1963-07-25a.1922.0" hansard_membership_id="6661" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/16709" speakername="Sir K. Joseph" colnum="1922" time="">
<p>Perhaps I did not make myself clear. Indeed, I am sure I cannot have done for my hon. Friend the Member for Bedfordshire, South (Mr. Cole) to make the speech he has made.<br/>
This Amendment introduces a totally new concept&#x2014;not a principle, but a concept&#x2014;into the settlement of pay and conditions in local government service. What is involved here is some form of external arbitration. First, it does not make sense to have an Amendment which involves arbitration without also having in the Amendment some machinery for the arbitration. There is no such machinery in this Amendment or associated with it.<br/>
Secondly, it would be a very grave step indeed for the Government to be willing to introduce this revolutionary proposal in the settlement of pay and conditions of local government servants without having proper consultations with the employing and the staff sides of local government. So far as the Government can see, there is absolutely no reason why local government should not in the future, as in the past, rely upon the existing Whitley Council machinery. Hon. Members must recognise that they are seeking to introduce a new element into the negotiations.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1963-07-25a.1922.1" hansard_membership_id="8469" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/18013" speakername="Mr. Marsh" colnum="1922" time="">
<p>Surely the local government service joint industrial council negotiates very well the terms and conditions of service, as is the case within industry generally. The industrial courts are separate issues. What additional machinery does the Minister want?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1963-07-25a.1922.2" hansard_membership_id="6661" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/16709" speakername="Sir K. Joseph" colnum="1922" time="">
<p>The hon. Member must realise that what exists in local government service exists by agreement and not because of statutory obligations. It would be a new element to introduce a statutory obligation upon local government to agree or to accept arbitration. If local government accepts arbitration by its own good voluntary discretion, that is fine&#x2014;that is how we work at the moment; but for the Government, without any reason, to think that the present system is not working well and to say, "You people cannot agree. We will, therefore, provide for an external arbiter


in quarrels which do not exist", would be unjustified. The hon. Member has not shown or tried to show that there is any reason to introduce this new concept or element of machinery.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1963-07-25a.1923.0" hansard_membership_id="8469" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/18013" speakername="Mr. Marsh" colnum="1923" time="">
<p>Is the Minister honestly saying that members of a local authority could, with his agreement, refuse to go to the Industrial Court and could refuse in law to accept the decision of that court?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1963-07-25a.1923.1" hansard_membership_id="6661" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/16709" speakername="Sir K. Joseph" colnum="1923" time="">
<p>I am seeking to avoid limiting in any way what, voluntarily, local government employers and employees may do. We have relied effectively on their voluntary co-operation in settling terms and conditions and no argument has been adduced to show that we should not go on so relying in the future. The voluntary system works well. We have no evidence why we should not rely upon it.<br/>
The Amendment would discard the voluntary system by introducing a compulsory element. [An HON. MEMBER: "No."] If it would not will the hon. Member explain what he is doing in introducing the word "award" into a Statute? What local government employer and employee sides wish to do is their own affair. They run their own negotiations. The Government would have to think many times before intervening in this process. No argument has been made to justify doing so.<br/>
In reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Bedfordshire, South (Mr. Cole), it is true that the basic Lords Amendment to which we are discussing Amendments goes a long way, but it still relies, obviously, upon the voluntary means for negotiating terms and conditions. The House would be wise to rest upon this in the future, as in the past.</p>

<p>tionary, but I am disappointed that he is so adamant against any new concept. The Amendment would allay many of the fears which have been expressed, from both sides, about the future of employees who will be affected by the Bill. The anxieties are recognised by the Minister and the proposition put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington (Mr. Skeffington) would do a great deal to allay those fears.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1963-07-25a.1924.1" colnum="1924" time="">
<p>On a previous Amendment, the Minister indicated that there would be a possibility of a tribunal to settle awkward cases. Would not such a tribunal then reach an award? This is not such a revolutionary concept&#x2014;</p>

<p>That is a machinery for settling difficult cases which has been voluntarily adopted by both sides. That is very different from the Statute laying down that they shall accept or shall do anything in particular. It is up to them.</p>

<p>The point has been made more effectively by one of the Minister's hon. Friends. It is true that once this becomes part of the Statute, there is an obligation. Is not that precisely what we are seeking to do, to provide a safeguard so that when the various problems arise, when the existing employees are to be chopped and changed from the present to the new authorities, they will feel that by statute they have protection, and the matter is not simply left to a take-it-or-leave-it attitude, when the employee is entirely in the hands of the employer? The case has been well made by my hon. Friend. I am surprised that the Minister is so adamant concerning such an elementary commonsense approach to the problem.</p>

This Amendment secures that the regulations which will be made under Clause 82(4) will also provide for compensating any persons who would have been employed at the material time but for the fact that they were engaged on some other service&#x2014;for example, National Service. In the relevant Acts "National Service" is fairly widely defined to cover service rather wider than the ordinary service with the Armed Forces.</p>

I think that the House might conveniently deal at the same time with the next 11 Amendments.<br/>
This group of Amendments takes account of the fact that for the two purposes&#x2014;main drainage, on the one hand, and land drainage, on the other&#x2014;the G.L.C. will be responsible for areas which are not co-terminous with Greater London and which stretch out into the adjacent county districts. In some cases, for instance in connection with sewage, there are existing local Acts affecting the administration of these services. The purpose of the Amendments is merely to ensure that these local enactments can be reviewed and, if necessary, amended under Clause 84, notwithstanding that they are applied in areas extending beyond Greater London.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment.<br/>
I think that it might be convenient if with this Lords Amendment I could describe the Lords Amendments in page 120, line 28, in page 121, line 45, in page 122, line 1, and in page 127, line 18.<br/>
Two of these Amendments enable an election to be held on or after the date of the passing of the Bill in respect of a casual vacancy occurring before that date. In the Bill as passed by the Commons paragraphs 6(1) and 10 of Schedule 3 prevent an election being held after the passing of the Bill in respect of any office which is to disappear after 1st April, 1965. But Section 67(1) of the Local Government Act, 1933, and Section

42(1) of the London Government Act, 1939, in providing for an election to be held within 30 days of the date on which the High Court or the local authority declare the office vacant or on which notice of the vacancy is given in writing by two local government electors, requires all the arrangements for holding an election to be put in hand in respect of a casual vacancy occurring before the Bill is passed.<br/>
If the Bill receives the Royal Assent on, say, 31st July then, unless the Amendments were made, an election which was to be held on 1st August could not be held, and there would have been work and expense for nothing. The Amendments therefore provide for the elections to be held as if the London Government Bill had not been passed and for the councillors elected to fill the casual vacancies to remain in office until 1st April, 1965, which is the day on which the councillors mentioned in paragraphs 6(1) and 10 would have gone out of office.<br/>
The effect of the other Amendments is that elections held on or after the Bill is passed to fill casual vacancies which have occurred before the Bill is passed will be conducted as if the Bill had not been passed.<br/>
The final Amendment is a drafting one to make it clear that this reference to
<q>councillor elected for any such electoral area</q>
means a councillor elected for an electoral area of Hertfordshire or Chigwell which is wholly or partly in Greater London.</p>

<p>A casual vacancy has almost been caused by the speed at which the hon. Lady rushed through these Amendments. Suppose a councillor resigns his office after the passing of this Act? Is there a prohibition on a by-election to fill that vacancy? Similarly, if an alderman or a councillor dies after the passing of this Act, is there a prohibition on an election to fill the vacancy? This will become relevant, because a considerable time will elapse between now and the setting up of the new authorities, and there may well be a considerable depletion in the membership of a local authority. All I want the hon. Lady to make clear is the question whether there is provision for by-elections to be held after the passing of the Act.</p>

<p>I am afraid that the hon. Member has had some difficulty in understanding me. I apologise for having gone fast. I felt that this was probably a technical matter, and that the House would not wish to be delayed for too long. In the case of death there is a prohibition on the election.</p>

<p>While this information is being obtained perhaps I can put a point. I do not think that this can be right, so far as I have followed what the hon. Lady has said. As my hon. Friend pointed out, it could so happen that, through resignation, removal and death, there was nobody left on the council. What would happen? This is an extraordinary provision, introduced at the last moment. We should be told a little more about it.</p>

<p>This is another example of the haste with which this legislation has been prepared, and of the fact that we have not had enough time on the Bill in Committee or here. The hon. Lady says that if a councillor dies or resigns, if two electors have given notice before the Royal Assent is given the Amendment will provide that an election can be held afterwards, whereas otherwise that would not be possible. That applies to councillors, but what about aldermen? Does the same sort of position arise with them? There should be provision for two electors to give notice if an alderman resigns four or five days before the Royal Assent is given to the Bill. Can we have an assurance that this provision will apply to aldermen as well as to councillors?</p>

<p>I believe that in the case of aldermen and councillors the prohibition remains in the case of resignation or death. As the hon. Member for Fulham (Mr. M. Stewart) has said, there is the

possibility of another Black Death or something of that sort, but in the case of such an emergency the Minister would have to make a transitional order to cover the situation.</p>

This Amendment is the result of some concern which was expressed in Committee about the management of commons. My right hon.

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment.<br/>
Clause 85(2) in applying Section 290(2) to 290(5) of the Local Government Act, 1933, gives the responsible Government Department discretion whether or not to recover the cost of holding local inquiries from the local authorities or other parties concerned. As regards the alteration of boundaries of wards of London boroughs, the Bill as passed by this House does not provide for other expenses of the Secretary of State such as the cost of causing notice given of proposals for altering wards under paragraph 1 of Part III of the First Schedule to the Bill to be met by local authorities.<br/>
It is considered that the Secretary of State should have discretion whether or not he should require these costs to be met by local authorities in the same way as he has discretion whether the cost of local inquiries should be met by local authorities. This Amendment will give the Secretary of State such discretion. This is reasonable since it would normally be the case that proposals for the subsequent alteration of ward boundaries under Part III of the First Schedule


would be put forward by the local authorities themselves.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment.<br/>
This is a consequential Amendment, but it may be convenient if I give some explanation of its purpose. In the Bill as passed by the Commons, paragraphs 6(1) and 10 of Schedule 3 to the Bill prevent an election from being held after the passing of the Bill in respect of any office which is to disappear after 1st April, 1965. But Section 67(1) of the Local Government Act, 1933, and Section 42(1) of the London Government Act, 1939, in providing for an election to be held within 30 days of the date on which the High Court or the local authority declare the office vacant or on which notice of the vacancy is given in writing by two local government electors, requires all the arrangements for holding an election to be put in hand in respect of a casual vacancy occurring before the Bill is passed. If the Bill receives the Royal Assent on 31st July then, unless the Amendments were made, an election which was to be held on 1st August could not, in fact, be held, and there would have been work and expense for nothing.<br/>
The Amendments therefore provide for the elections to be held as if the London Government Bill had not been passed, and for the councillors elected to fill the casual vacancies to remain in office until 1st April, 1965, which is the day on which the councillors mentioned in paragraphs 6(1) and 10 would have gone out of office.<br/>
The final Amendment is a drafting Amendment, to make it clear that the reference to
<q>&#x2026;councillor elected for any such electoral area&#x2026;</q>
means a councillor elected for an electoral area of Hertfordshire or Chigwell which is wholly or partly in Greater London.</p>

The effect of this Amendment is to allow my right hon. Friend to delegate work on the maintenance of trunk roads to the G.L.C. as well as to the London boroughs. I should add that we do not intend to use this power as a matter of course. The London boroughs will be much better equipped than the G.L.C. for the ordinary run of maintenance on trunk roads, but there may be some occasions when it will be convenient and


more efficient to delegate to the G.L.C. responsibility for instance for looking after a particularly complex structure such as a flyover or underpass. The Amendment will enable us to do this.</p>

This Amendment makes a slight but necessary correction to an Amendment tabled by hon. Members opposite, which was accepted in Committee. Owing to the original wording it might have been implied that the G.L.C. could carry out improvement to any highway, which is not so.

This Amendment is related to the earlier one in Schedule 6. The London borough councils and the Common Council will have power to extinguish or divert public footpaths and bridleways by order under Sections 110 and

111 of the Highways Act, 1959. Under the paragraph to be omitted they would have exercised the power subject to the consent of the Greater London Council, which was originally expected to be responsible for the general survey of footpaths under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act, 1949. But as this function has now been given to the London borough councils, with powers in Clause 59(3) to transfer it by agreement to the G.L.C., reference to the Greater London Council is no longer necessary.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment.<br/>
This Amendment excepts the inner London borough from the operation of the advance payments code in Part IX of the Highways Act, 1959 which, where it applies, required a developer in a private street to give the street works authority a deposit or security for the cost of street works before he begins to erect a building. The extension of highways legislation relating to private street works, including the advance payments code, to inner London would require new machinery to take account of the fact that the special L.C.C. building control system continues to apply in the inner London boroughs.<br/>
The procedure for requiring payment is linked to the procedure for depositing and passing plans in accordance with building byelaws, but in inner London building control is not by byelaws and plans do not have to be deposited. In view of the fact that there is very little undeveloped land in Central London and therefore the advance payments code will be very seldom necessary, I do not think that this provision will make any practical difference and has clearly considerable advantages from a drafting point of view.</p>

<p>As I understand it, the code which is now not going to apply normally applies to a district council. This money for private development to a private road is paid to a district council which is usually the authority for looking after roads. I understand that this legislation is legislation which is operated by the L.C.C. and is dealt with under its general planning laws. Are we going to be in the ridiculous situation whereby in a London area it will be the Greater London Council which will deal with this but that in the outer London areas it will be the outer London authorities?<br/>
This seems a rather unsatisfactory situation to create in a new system of local government. I really do not think that we should work out legislation simply on the view of whether or not it is complicated to do something. This is so having regard to the fact that the Bill is extremely complicated and that these Lords Amendments are extremely complicated, so that it strikes me Ministers are having difficulty in understanding them and are having to read the explanations and sometimes not reading them very well either. Since we are dealing with the matter let us sort it out to do the job properly.</p>

<p>The code which I referred to is the 1951 code by which a planning authority can insist upon a builder making a deposit or individual purchasers of houses making a deposit against the cost of making up the road. I think the hon. Gentleman will at least agree that this is not an operation likely to be very frequent in central London. It is an operation confined almost entirely to development of undeveloped land.</p>

<p>With respect, no, because in redevelopment the roads, having already been adopted&#x2014;and this is the stage up to adoption&#x2014;would in any case be the responsibility of the highway authority. So far as the advance payment code is concerned throughout the rest of the country, it applies automatically to urban authorities, to borough councils and county boroughs. It does not apply automatically to county councils or rural districts, and here we are

making an exception which is not likely to be of practical significance, and it is not even a unique exception, because in many parts of the country it does not apply for the reason that it is thought to be insignificant. I do not think there is any real difficulty about this.</p>

This Amendment affects paragraph 2 of Part One of Schedule 9, which prohibits a local authority from vesting in itself a sewer or sewage disposal works vested in any other authority.

The Bill without this Amendment gives the Greater London Council powers which the L.C.C. now has to construct sewers without giving notice to the owners of land under which the sewers are to pass. The reason for this is the vast number of owners who would need to be given notice in this crowded part of London. But the same arguments do not apply to the construction of sewage disposal works. The same considerations

apply to their construction in London and elsewhere and this Amendment is designed to bring the provisions of the Bill into line with those outside London.</p>

Burials in any church inside London that was built since 1848 is forbidden by the Bill. We think that this went too far. We are repealing this part of the Act, so the position remains as it was, and some burials are, under some circumstances, permitted even in churches built since 1848.</p>

<p>With permission, I wish to make a statement.<br/>
As the House knows, the text of a Treaty to ban nuclear weapon tests in the atmosphere, in outer space, and underwater was initialled in Moscow this afternoon by representatives of the United States, the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom. I will arrange for the text of the Treaty to be circulated in the Official Report.<br/>
The communiqu&#x00E9; following the initialling has by agreement been published in Moscow at 10 p.m., in the United Kingdom at 8 p.m. and in the United States at 3 p.m. I regret that owing to the character of the business of the House today it was not possible for me to make this statement at 8 p.m. I thought, however, that it was proper courtesy to the House to make this statement at the earliest possible moment and before it appears in the newspapers tomorrow, and I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Bury and Radcliffe (Mr. Bidgood) for making this possible by giving up his Adjournment debate.<br/>
The following is the text of the communiqu&#x00E9;. It is rather long, but I think the House would wish me to read it.<br/>
<q>The special representatives of the President of the United States of America and of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, W. A. Harriman, Under-Secretary of State


for political affairs of the United States, and Lord Hailsham, Lord President of the Council and Minister for Science for the United Kingdom, visited Moscow together with their advisers on July 14. Mr. Harriman and Lord Hailsham were received by the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the U.S.S.R., N. S. Khrushchev, who presided on July 15 at the first of a series of meetings to discuss questions relating to the discontinuance of nuclear tests, and other questions of mutual interest. Discussions were continued from July 16 to July 25 with A. A. Gromyko, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the U.S.S.R. During these discussions each principal was assisted by his advisers.</q>
<q>The discussions took place in a businesslike and cordial atmosphere. Agreement was reached on the text of a Treaty banning nuclear weapons tests in the atmosphere, in outer space and underwater. This text is being published separately and simultaneously with this communique. It was initialled on July 25 by A. A. Gromyko, Mr. Harriman and Lord Hailsham. Mr. Harriman and Lord Hailsham, together with their advisers, will leave Moscow shortly to report and bring back the initialled texts to their respective Governments. Signature of the Treaty is expected to take place in the near future in Moscow.</q>
<q>The heads of the three delegations agreed that the Test Ban Treaty constituted an important first step towards the reduction of international tension and the strengthening of peace, and they look forward to further progress in this direction.</q>
<q>The heads of the three delegations discussed the Soviet proposal relating to a pact of non-aggression between the participants in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and the participants in the Warsaw Treaty. The three Governments have agreed fully to inform their respective allies in the two organisations concerning these talks and to consult with them about continuing discussions on this question with the purpose of achieving agreement satisfactory to all participants. A brief exchange of views also took place with regard to other measures, directed at a relaxation of tension.</q></p>

<p>The House, and I think people all over the world, will be thankful at the conclusion of this agreement. I hope that the House will permit me, on behalf of my right hon. and hon. Friends, to offer congratulations to all the three Governments concerned.<br/>
If the Prime Minister will allow me to say this, I think the United States and ourselves showed great wisdom in dropping at the right moment insistence on a fully inspected agreement covering underground tests as well&#x2014;which all of us would have liked&#x2014;and concentrating on the more limited, but still important and useful, agreement covering tests in space, in the atmosphere and, of course, under water. The Prime Minister will recall that after our own talks in Moscow we reported to him and his colleagues that there was more hope in this direction, I think, than in going the whole way.<br/>
I think that the speed with which this has been reached, because it is a very important field of discussion, has shown great realism on the part of all three negotiators.<br/>
I should like to ask the Prime Minister two or three questions. Of course, we may have the answers to these when we have the text of the Agreement. I have seen newspaper reports that the Soviet negotiators have shown some willingness to consider proposals for the creation of non-nuclear zones&#x2014;I think that Africa, in particular, was mentioned, and there may be others. Would the right hon. Gentleman say, first, whether there have been any discussions on this and whether the further negotiations now hoped for will enable speedy progress to be made in the creation of nuclear-free zones? If Africa could become guaranteed by all the major Powers to be completely free from nuclear experiments and the stationing of nuclear weapons, I am sure that the House would agree that that would be a big step forward.<br/>
Secondly, can the right hon. Gentleman say at this stage, without having had a full oral report from the Lord President of the Council, how far there has been discussion or preliminary discussion on the possibility of a complete anti-pro-

liferation agreement to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons to Powers which at present are non-nuclear? Something from the right hon. Gentleman on that aspect would be of great interest tonight.<br/>
Finally, in view of suggestions in the Press this morning that there was an escape clause which could be invoked by any party if explosions, experiments, were conducted by France, China or any other Power&#x2014;which, to some extent, would be a disappointment to us all&#x2014;could the Prime Minister tell us, without waiting for the publication of all the details, whether such an escape clause exists?</p>

<p>To take the right hon. Gentleman's last question first, there is a withdrawal clause. However, I would prefer to study that in the Treaty and the text, which is carefully drawn up.<br/>
On the other two questions, the communiqu&#x00E9; makes reference to discussions on methods of reducing tension. I think that it would be wiser for me to leave it at that tonight. We have to consult with our allies and we have to prepare very carefully the next stage. If this has been successful, it is because very careful preparations were made.<br/>
I hoped that the House would not press meto say anything further, except this: that I am very anxious that we should regard this not as something in itself but as a step. It is something very valuable in itself. There is an old saying that it is the first step that counts. This is the first step for many years, and I believe that it will count.</p>

<p>May I join with other hon. Members in welcoming wholeheartedly the agreement which has been reached in Moscow and express the wish that this will indeed be a step towards general disarmament? I do not want to press the Prime Minister, in view of what he said, on the withdrawal clause, but may I ask him this? I am sure that we all hope that General de Gaulle will not now proceed with independent tests. May we take it that the agreement which has been reached is not dependent upon the action of other members of N.A.T.O., including France?</p>

be satisfied that it is the most comprehensive that it was possible to make in present circumstances.

<p>As one who has frequently pressed the Prime Minister on these matters, may I be allowed to say how warmly I welcome his announcement, which may well turn out to be a turning point in East-West relations. Would he now take the view that the road has been cleared for a meeting of the three Heads of Government, and any other Heads of Government, with, a view to bringing about a settlement of some of the outstanding international problems which have been dividing East and West in recent years?</p>

<p>There is a road to be cleared, and no doubt there will be obstructions and difficulties.
