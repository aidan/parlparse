<p><i>The present Parliamentary session, which I am now bringing to a close, has seen the final overthrow and unconditional surrender of our enemies in Europe. Their leaders, almost without exception, are either dead by their own hand or held in Allied custody. At last, after more than five years of mortal strife, Europe is liberated from the foul tyranny that threatened to enslave it. This deliverance is due not only to the resolution with which My People in these islands have carried on the struggle, but also to the stalwart aid so freely given by the peoples and governments of My Commonwealth and Empire overseas, to the splendid Armies, Fleets and Air Forces of the United States and the vast supplies which they have afforded, and to the heroic deeds of the Forces of much-suffering Russia. I must also express My deep admiration for the exertions of all those other Allies who fought by our side on sea, land and in the air and of the resistance of their peoples, now happily restored to their former independence. So persistent, so widespread and so united aco-operation of States to rescue European freedom from a hideous menace has never before been seen in the history of the world. I, with all My peoples, take pride in the thought that it was we who stood alone to face the foe in the darkest</i>

<i>days, and who now share in the common triumph.</i></p>

<p><i>It has given The Queen and Myself particular pleasure to have been able to visit My loyal subjects in the Channel Islands; and I rejoice that they, who suffered so long under the German invader, are once more free.</i></p>

<p><i>I have already had an opportunity, in replying to your loyal Addresses of Congratulation, to pay tribute to all that has been done by My peoples, whether in the Armed Forces or in any of the other forms of national endeavour. It is a wonderful record of constancy, faith and courage in every part of our national life and a striking manifestation of the historic character and quality of the British people.</i></p>

<p><i>My thoughts have been constantly with the peoples of the Commonwealth and Empire whose lands still suffer from the tyrannous Japanese occupation and with all others who have experienced the same calamity. The resounding victory gained in Burma and the swift advances made in the Pacific by the powerful Forces of the United States, who, together with Forces from these islands and from Australia, New Zealand and other parts of My Dominions, are closing in on Japan, have brought nearer their liberation. Though heavy labours and tribulations may still lie ahead, the downfall of our enemy in Europe enables us to bend all our energies to the task, which we shall share with our Allies, of crushing the aggressor in the Far East.</i></p>

At San Francisco My Ministers have striven to further the framing of an international organisation by which future generations may be spared from the horrors of war.</i></p>

<p><i>The destruction of our homes by the enemy and the urgent need to concentrate our man-power for nearly six years on tasks directly connected with the prosecution of the war have led to a widespread shortage of houses. Energetic measures have already been taken to restore houses damaged by enemy attack and to prepare housing sites, and</i>

<i>the maximum effort is being devoted to the production and erection of new houses.

A measure has been passed to assist employers and workpeople in securing the wider observance of jointly agreed terms and conditions of employment and in maintaining reasonable standards of remuneration. A much needed reform has been effected in the law concerning contributory negligence. Henceforward a claimant who proves that his injury is due to another's fault will not fail to secure some compensation merely because a certain degree of fault is attributable to him.
